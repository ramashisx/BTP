HDFC Bank's stock will remain in focus on October 4 as the bank restructures its top management post a merger with HDFC Ltd in July. This is the second reorganization since Sashidhar Jagdishan took over as managing director and chief executive officer in October 2020, succeeding Aditya Puri.

The bank communicated the changes in a memo to employees on October 1, as per reports. Information technology and digital functions, led by Ramesh Lakshminarayanan, now report directly to CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan as the bank emphasizes on technology for expanded services. Ashish Parthasarthy, a veteran of the bank, will oversee the crucial retail branch business, including deposits and product distribution.

Parthasarthy is restructuring the retail branch business geographically for better expansion and product management. Smita Bhagat and Sampath Kumar will co-lead this effort. Bhagat, a senior leader at the bank, handled government, institutional, ecosystem, inclusive banking, and start-ups. Kumar managed liability products, third-party products, and non-resident business, CNBCTV18 reported.

""This may aim to enhance execution to (1) drive growth in mortgages, where Mr. Arvind Kapil will get exclusive charge and (2) optimise branch ramp-up where responsibilities will be split geographically. IT & Digital also get a needed direct reporting to CEO. Ramp-up of deposits & housing book will be key to growth & investor comfort"", said Jefferies India in its latest note. The brokerage house stayed its buy rating on the stock and increased its target price to Rs 2030 a share, up 33 percent from current market price.

HDFC Bank's stock has declined by over 9 percent in the past three weeks following the takeover of HDFC Ltd. However, analysts consider it to be trading at attractive valuations (2.1x Mar’25E ABV and ~13x EPS) and believe it offers a favorable risk-reward for long-term investors. They anticipate that as growth and earnings gradually recover, the stock's performance will improve.

The stock closed at Rs 1508.05 on the NSE on October 3.

Meanwhile, post merger, analysts expects HDFC Bank to experience a near-term decline in net interest margin (NIM), net worth, and asset quality after merging with parent company HDFC. HDFC Bank's CFO Srinivasan Vaidyanathan noted a potential 25 basis point NIM contraction due to increased CRR and excess liquidity post-merger.

This could result in lower earnings for the bank in the second quarter, with the merged entity's margin estimated at 3.7-3.8 percent in June, down from the bank's previous standalone margin of 4.1 percent. Analysts, including Macquarie, suggest this may affect the bank's near-term return on assets (RoA).

""HDFC Bank is not going to rally in a hurry and there will be more of a selling pressure. Some of the technical indicators are in the oversold territory.. the stock is very close to its support zone of Rs 1470-1500. This is the zone where it could see some respite. But sustaining these levels will be difficult. If it does bounce back, it will meet with immediate resistance of Rs 1560-1600 levels"", said Aamar Deo Singh, AngelOne."

HDFC Bank Ltd. is revamping some parts of top management as the Indian bank seeks to propel its mortgages business, three months after it acquired another lender.

The bank detailed the changes in a memo to employees late Sunday, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.

It has brought information technology and digital functions, led by Ramesh Lakshminarayanan directly under Chief Executive Officer Sashidhar Jagdishan as the bank leans on technology to offer more products and services across its branches, the people said. Ashish Parthasarthy a bank veteran who has led treasury since 2009, will get responsibility for the key retail branch business, which handles deposits and product distribution, they added.

The lender’s shares have come under pressure since the takeover of Housing Development Finance Corp. in July, which made HDFC one of the world’s largest banks. It also faced a rare downgrade last month from Nomura Holdings Inc., which cited concerns on HDFC’s return on assets and pressures on loan growth.

HDFC Bank Shares Have Trailed Private Lenders in India.

HDFC agreed last April to acquire the country’s largest mortgage lender in a deal valued at about $60 billion to ride a boom in home loans and consumer spending in the world’s fastest-growing major economy. The deal to merge the two companies with a combined market value of almost $190 billion at that time followed a proposal by the banking regulator for large non-banking finance companies to convert into banks to avoid a repetition of the nation’s massive shadow lending crisis in 2018.

Under Parthasarthy, the lender is splitting the geographical management of the retail branch business to handle its expansion and product plans in a more structured way, the people said. It will be co-led by Smita Bhagat and Sampath Kumar.

Bhagat, one of the senior women leaders at the bank, was previously the group head for government and institutional business, ecosystem banking, inclusive banking and start-ups. Kumar was group head of liability products, third party products and non-resident business at the bank.

HDFC Bank did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment."

Banks’ lending to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) rose by 35.1 per cent to Rs 14.2 lakh crore in June, a report said.

Credit exposure of banks to NBFCs rose by a robust 35.1 per cent on-year to Rs 14.2 lakh crore in June, indicating non-banking finance firms’ decreased reliance on international borrowings. This also pushed up NBFCs’ share in overall credit from 8.5 per cent in June 2022 to 9.9 per cent in the reporting month, according to Sanjay Agarwal, a senior director with Care Ratings.

However, the report noted that the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank, effective July 1, will lead to a reduction in the share and also the exposure of banks to NBFCs, as HDFC’s bank borrowings will undergo a temporary reclassification, resulting in a shift of exposure to HDFC Bank. Meanwhile, mutual funds’ debt exposure to NBFCs, including through commercial papers (CPs) and corporate debt, also increased 14.5 per cent to Rs 1.62 lakh crore in June, it said.

According to the report, MF exposure to NBFCs as a share of debt assets under management has remained broadly constant hovering at around 10 per cent. On the other hand, the share of banks’ advances to NBFCs as a share of aggregate advances has doubled from around 4.5 per cent in February 2018 to nearly 10 per cent in June, indicating the reliance of NBFCs on bank lending.

The report also said that bank credit to NBFCs has been consistently moving up since the second half of FY22, coinciding with the phased reopening of the economy since the Covid pandemic. This growth momentum further accelerated in FY23 and in the first quarter of FY24, which can primarily be ascribed to NBFCs’ asset base.

Food delivery firm Swiggy has partnered with the country's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank to launch a co-branded credit card. The card will offer a hefty 10 percent cashback on food delivery grocery delivery under Instamart and its dining out platform Dineout. The card will be hosted on the Mastercard network.

The cashback offered is much higher than the usual five percent offered by brands for shopping on their own platform. For instance, Amazon, Flipkart, Paytm and Tata Neu only offer around five percent as cashback even though occasionally there could be a few extra offers. The Paytm and Tata Neu co-branded credit cards are also in partnership with HDFC Bank.

The Swiggy-HDFC card will also offer five percent cashback on shopping across other e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Nykaa, Ola, Uber, PharmEasy, NetMeds, BookmyShow, and several others, the statement said. In fact, with an Amazon-ICICI credit card, a customer cannot get five percent cashback on Flipkart and vice versa. Hence the Swiggy card makes more sense for anyone who shops across these platforms.

ALSO READ: Visa says co-branding offers opportunities for new categories to emerge

In one fell swoop, the card could make Amazon-ICICI and Flipkart-Axis credit cards irrelevant for most users as the cashback remains the same whether a customer uses the Amazon card, Flipkart card or the Swiggy card. However, there is a catch. The benefits of such high rewards can be reaped only if the customer uses Swiggy a lot every month. Because the cardholders will get cashback in the form of Swiggy Money, which can be used only on Swiggy.

However, the only catch being that the cashback will be deposited as Swiggy Money and can be used only on Swiggy. If a customer's monthly grocery purchases are more than Rs 4,000-5,000, it must not be difficult to use/exhaust the Swiggy Money buying grocery on Instamart.

For reference, even the Amazon ICICI credit card offers the cashbacks as Amazon Pay Balance and can be used only on Amazon and its partner merchants. However, the use cases of exhausting the Amazon Pay Balance is much wider with the platform offering insurance, flight tickets and hotel bookings.

The credit card launch and the aggressive cashback offers is happening at a time when Swiggy is gradually losing market share to Zomato and its grocery delivery platform Blinkit. The credit card could help cultivate loyalty and drive up its usage.

The co-branded credit card success story

HDFC is the country's largest credit card issuer. The bank has issued close to two crore credit cards in the country whereas the overall number of credit cards in the country stands around 10 crore as of June 30, according to RBI data.

Earlier this year, Swiggy's Gurugram-based rival Zomato had ended its co-branded card partnership with RBL Bank, which also offered 10 percent cashback on its premium Black edition, while the Classic edition offered only five percent cashbacks. It is not clear why the partnership has not worked out.

Some of the co-branded credit cards have been a runaway success among customers over the last four-five years with both Amazon and Flipkart adding 40 lakh users each. These cards see fully digital onboarding of the majority of the users apart from high usage and activation rates. Paytm has around seven lakhs customers for its cards.

Today, Amazon ICICI credit card is almost 30 percent of the ICICI credit card portfolio and the Flipkart Axis credit card is almost 40 percent of Axis Bank's credit card portfolio, indicating the importance of a successful cobranded partnership for banks. HDFC does not have such a huge success as of now. Today, one in three credit cards are cobranded credit cards whereas it was just 10 percent a decade ago. This has been driven by the new-age consumer internet brands.

While airlines, offline retail brands and oil marketing companies cards' used to be popular a decade ago, digital brands have taken their place as customer spending has also shifted towards the platform and has often demonstrated loyalty and stickiness.

For instance, the overall credit card spending on digital platforms were close to Rs 90,000 crore during the month of June, whereas the credit card spending at Point of Sale terminals (or offline channels) stood at Rs 50,000 crore, that is almost 80 percent higher on online platforms.

Who is the card for

While there are around 10 crore credit cards in the country, the unique number of credit card users is only around four crore. Most power users will have multiple cards and uses the cards to maximise value or cashbacks. Adding a Swiggy credit card will not hurt such users.

The cashback benefit of five percent is also applicable on branded websites like Nike, H&M, Adidas and Zara among others. Similar to Amazon and Flipkart credit cards, this card also offers one percent cashback on all other spending.

“We recognise that modern-day consumers actively seek rewards, offers, and cashback programs that add value to their spending,” said Rahul Bothra, Chief Financial Officer of Swiggy.

As a welcome benefit, the card is also offering a three-month Swiggy One membership that offers free delivery and additional discounts. The credit card will be rolled-out in a phased manner on the Swiggy app over the next 7-10 days, post which all the eligible customers will be able to apply for it on Swiggy app and HDFC website.

“We strive to offer innovative and tailored solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Dining and Grocery are at the core of customer’s daily needs, and with this strategic collaboration we are offering convenience of both categories bundled with great value,” said Parag Rao, country head for payment business, consumer finance, technology and digital banking at HDFC Bank."

HDFC Bank’s managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan on July 19 warned managerial level employees of transgression from good working culture saying he is aware of such instances and has the resolve to ‘nip this in the bud.’

“I am fully conscious of the fact that there may be instances where some people managers might transgress our defined way of working,” Jagdishan said in his message to shareholders on July 19. “We have the resolve to nip this in the bud, both by way of training/counselling and appropriate action, to ensure that the same is not attempted by anyone else,” Jagdishan said.

Jagdishan, however, added that the bank has ‘some distance to traverse on this front.’ “We are taking concrete steps towards building an inclusive organisation, which will go a long way in reining in attrition in the coming years,” he added.

Why the comment is important

The comment from the CEO assumes significance in the backdrop of an incident recently circulated on social media with respect to the alleged unruly behaviour of one of the senior executives of the bank towards junior staff.

HDFC Bank on June 5 suspended the concerned officer in Kolkata for allegedly engaging in unruly behaviour with colleagues during an internal meeting. In a video circulating on Twitter, the officer was heard shouting at his junior colleagues for not selling enough banking and insurance products.

In a statement made available to Moneycontrol, HDFC Bank said that on the basis of a preliminary enquiry into the matter, the concerned employee has been suspended and a detailed investigation has been initiated which will be undertaken as per the Conduct guidelines of the bank.

The banking major further added that they have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of misconduct at the workplace and firmly believe in treating all our employees with dignity and respect.

In the video, the manager was asking his junior employee said, ""I don't understand, today you're going to do 25 smart ones, 25 sure covers, and 25 health covers.""

Misselling complaints

Incidents of product misselling have been reported across the banking industry. In the past, there have been instances where life insurance policies were sold to customers aged above 75 years in Tier II-III cities. Usually, branches of the banks push products of their subsidiary insurers.

Bank executives face immense pressure from top management to sell third-party products like insurance. Failure to meet targets invites informal penal actions while meeting targets brings perks such as parties in five-star resorts.

Banks typically cross-sell insurance products of their subsidiaries, and sometimes of other companies, along with loan products. Many a time, banks insist purchase of policies along with loan products. Early this year, the RBI had conducted a meeting with the board of directors of all public sector banks and private banks to discuss issues related to governance and ethics.

Emphasis on culture

In his message, Jagdishan stressed the importance of good working culture saying that it defines the experience of each employee.

“Managers are uniquely positioned to represent the culture the Bank stands for. Talent, Potential and Capabilities can best be harnessed through an enabling culture,” Jagdishan said.

Towards this aim, the bank has adopted the managerial behaviour architecture based on the principles of 'Nurture, Care and Collaborate', said Jagdishan, adding that this should translate into simple behaviours that managers can demonstrate in their interactions with their teams. The Nurture, Care, Collaborate initiative that covered over 12,000+ managers in the previous year was extended to the senior leadership levels and over 6,000 new managers in FY 2022-23, the CEO added.

“The intent is to have all managers at the Bank equipped to fully live the cultural ethos of the Bank,” Jagdishan said.

Increase in attrition

Jagdishan said the bank has experienced an increase in attrition over the last financial year, a significant part of which was in the ‘non-supervisory staff’ levels, including sales officers. Jagdishan attributed Covid as one of the reasons for high attrition that may have prompted the younger workforce to recalibrate what they ‘want from their lives’, the CEO said.

“This has led to increased attrition across all sectors. It is a reality that all major employers are grappling with, especially in the BFSI sector,” Jagdishan added.

Earlier, in an interaction with the media, the bank’s chief financial officer, Srinivasan Vaidyanathan had said that the lender witnessed a 30 percent employee attrition in the fiscal year 2022-23.

“On average, we saw the attrition rate at around 30 percent. Highest attrition was seen at the entry-level positions, which stood at around 40 percent to 50 percent,” Vaidyanathan said at a post-results media call.

A few levels above the entry-level, Vaidyanathan said that the attrition rate is around mid-20 percent to 30 percent, the CFO added.

HDFC and HDFC Bank got merged effective July 1, marking a major event in India’s banking sector. Post-merger, the loan book or advances of the merged entity jumped by 38.77 percent to Rs 22.21 lakh crore as against 16 lakh crore as on March 31, as per investor presentation of the bank.

The merger gave HDFC Bank entry to India's booming housing loan market while for HDFC, the decision made sense on account of vanishing regulatory arbitrage earlier available for non-banking finance companies."
"July 17, 2023 04:22 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/nbfcs-are-among-top-mutual-fund-buys-heres-why-10973611.html,"Between May and June, asset management companies upped their stake in HDFC, Shriram Finance, Creditaccess Grameen and Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services among several other names.

Financials remain the darlings of Dalal Street with non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) now grabbing the spotlight within this sector. In June, mutual funds heavily invested in NBFC stocks while booking profits from private banking stocks.

The current market sentiment suggests that the peak of the interest cycle is approaching its end, according to analysts and fund managers. As central banks in developed markets begin to cut interest rates, India is expected to follow suit. Resultantly, the liability costs for NBFCs are likely to decrease, leading to higher profit margins and increased profitability.

Mutual funds in June raised their holdings across various NBFC segments, be it housing finance, consumer finance, or microfinance. Loan demand remains strong across product categories like vehicle, SME/consumer segments, and gold finance. The Street expects assets under management (AUM) growth above 20 percent year on year for most NBFCs in Q1 FY24.

“Credit growth is now well-entrenched and can continue for the medium term. The credit cycle also looks good and predictable. The probability of any big NPL (non-performing loans) shocks coming over the next few quarters is very low,” Vinay Sharma, Fund Manager - Equity Investments, Nippon India Mutual Fund, said.

In June, asset management companies upped their stake in HDFC, Shriram Finance, Creditaccess Grameen and Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services among several other names. While HDFC can be looked at as MFs jumping on an arbitrage opportunity ahead of merger with HDFC Bank, inflows for other NBFCs were largely on the back of improving outlook on their asset quality and margins.

Why the optimism?

NBFCs borrow from banks or raise money from non-convertible debentures. In both cases, they are borrowing at high rates but at the same time, they are lending at even higher rates. “For instance, select NBFCs are raising funds while offering yields up to 10 percent per annum, but lending rates are also north of 14 percent. In that sense, the gross margin picture for NBFCs looks better than that of many banks that accept deposits at 7.5 percent and lend at around the 9 percent range,” explained Nirav Karkera of Fisdom.

While some NBFCs could see their NIMs (net interest margins) contract by 5-15 basis points, given the increase in the cost of funds, analysts at Systematix Institutional Equities believe other NBFCs will likely maintain or see a marginal increase in NIMs, aided by a change in their portfolio mix and upward revision in lending rates.

Moreover, when it comes to high-yield segments like SME (small and medium enterprise) loans, loans against property and unsecured personal B2C (business-to-consumer) loans, NBFCs are more willing to extend credit compared to several regulatory checks by banks. This is why NBFCs will be able to serve the increasing trend of financialisation better as they are playing the credit-risk game better, said analysts.

According to Krishna Sanghavi - CIO Equity, Mahindra Manulife Mutual Fund, NBFCs will continue to re-rate as the focus shifts from margin pressures. “FY23 saw some de-rating for NBFCs on concerns over margins while banks saw profit gains as well as re-rating. Q1FY24 saw a re-rating for NBFCs as post the policy pause by RBI, market expectations shifted away from margin pressure,” he said.

Bargain buys

Moreover, mutual funds also jumped at the opportunity to buy NBFC stocks at a bargain. For instance, CreditAccess Grameen and Shriram Finance both saw big block deals in June at a slight discount to the then market price. Canara Robeco, Axis Mutual Fund and HDFC AMC upped their stake in CreditAccess Grameen while Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC and Kotak Mahindra AMC, among others, bought into Shriram Finance.

“Meanwhile, cash flows have held up well and contributed to better collection efficiencies which will translate into benign credit costs across most of the NBFCs,” Ritesh Bhagwati - Head of Research - Rockstud Capital. In Q1 FY24, analysts expect the credit cost of most NBFCs likely to be maintained at Q4 levels, except for a few like Mahindra Finance and Cholamandalam Finance, which could see a normalised credit cost.

And finally, the space is also heating up with the entry of Jio Financial Services soon. While it is expected that JFS will disrupt the sector and heat up the competition, fund managers do not seem to mind loading up on the already listed names to capitalise on India's growth story.

Shares of Housing Development and Finance Corporation (HDFC) stopped trading on July 12, marking the end of an over four-decade-long journey for India’s oldest and biggest mortgage lender.

HDFC now lives on as part of HDFC Bank, but many market veterans view the company as a role model for corporate India and synonymous with the country’s socio-economic progress.

Here are some key highlights of HDFC’s market journey –

Founded by H T Parekh, uncle of Deepak Parekh. Incorporated on October 17, 1977

Deepak Parekh joined the company in 1978, leaving his Chase Manhattan Bank job where he was earning twice the salary offered by HDFC.

Deepak Parekh approached UTI seeking investment in HDFC’s IPO. UTI -- the only mutual fund in India that time -- refused, saying retail lending for home loans was too risky.

HDFC IPO launched in 1978. Issue size – Rs 10 crore (10 lakh shares of Rs 100 each). Shares issued to public at par (no premium).

126 equity shares of Rs 100 taken up by the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association, including 100 shares held by H T Parekh.

50,000 Equity shares of Rs 100 each subscribed by ICICI, the IFC (W) and HH the Aga Khan IV respectively.

4,50,000 equity shares of Rs 100 issued for private subscription.

3,99,874 equity shares of Rs 100 offered to the public. The Corporation received 10,697 applications for 4,73,976 equity shares. The Corporation allotted the shares to 10,543 applicants.

The stock has posted a stellar CAGR of around 19 percent over the last three decades. However, the CAGR for HDFC Bank is higher at 24 percent.

Rs 1,00,000 invested in HDFC in May 1995 would have grown to Rs 1,26,39,000 today (without dividends). However, Rs 1,00,000 invested in HDFC Bank would have increased to Rs 4,14,00,000 (without dividends).

HDFC received approval for setting up HDFC Bank in 1994. The bank was inaugurated in February 1995 by the then Finance Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.

HDFC took 33 years to hit the Rs 1-lakh crore m-cap mark. HDFC Bank reached the milestone in 15 years.

HDFC's market capitalisation reached Rs 2 lakh crore in February 2015, Rs 3 lakh crore in February 2018, Rs 4 lakh crore in July 2019, and Rs 5 lakh crore in February 2021.

In FY2000, HDFC’s net profit at Rs 400 crore was almost four times that of HDFC Bank at Rs 120 crore.

HDFC maintained its lead for the next decade. In FY2010, HDFC Bank overtook its parent in terms of net profit at Rs 2,949 crore vs Rs 2,826 crore for HDFC. The lead only widened over time.

For the financial year ended March 2023, HDFC reported a net profit of Rs 16,239 crore, compared to Rs 44,109 crore for HDFC Bank.

Even in terms of topline growth, HDFC Bank has usually outperformed its parent.

The HDFC IPO was a tepid affair, with shares listing below the issue price. Even at its last trading session on July 12, 2023, the share closed in the red, down nearly 1 percent at Rs 2,724.30 on the NSE."
"July 12, 2023 10:05 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/an-era-ends-as-hdfc-shares-stop-trading-on-stock-exchanges-10947341.html,"Deepak Parekh will hang up boots post the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank

On July 12, the shares of Housing Development and Finance Corporation, or HDFC, stopped trading on bourses post the merger with HDFC Bank that came into effect on July 1. That marks the end of a four-decade-long journey for India’s oldest mortgage lender.

Founded by H T Parekh, uncle of Deepak Parekh, HDFC was incorporated on October 17, 1977, and disbursed its first home loan in 1978 to D. B. Remedios in Mumbai. To start with, the founding team had an unenviable job. Home loans were not a popular product back then and no one knew HDFC as a brand.

But the team worked hard and steadily expanded the business. By 1984, HDFC had crossed annual loan approvals of Rs 100 crore, a big milestone for the company. The company was listed in 1978 with a face value of Rs 100 each. The issue did not get a great response, in fact, it was undersubscribed.

Yet, that was the start of a remarkable journey to become a financial behemoth. On July 12, when the shares closed, HDFC had a market capitalisation of over Rs 5 lakh crore.

End of an era

Deepak Parekh, the man who played a key role in building India’s oldest mortgage lender from scratch, hung up his boots after four decades with the company. With Parekh stepping down from all roles, an era has ended.

In his last letter to shareholders of HDFC on June 30, Chairman Deepak Parekh announced his retirement ahead of the mega merger with HDFC Bank saying it is time for him to hang up his boots.

Parekh, 78, will not take up any role in the bank while HDFC Chief Executive Officer Keki Mistry is likely to join the bank's Board subject to clearance from the Reserve Bank of India.

""It is my time to hang my boots with both anticipation and hope for the future,"" Parekh told shareholders.

""While this will be my last communication to shareholders of HDFC, rest assured we now stride tall into a very exciting future of growth and prosperity,"" Parekh added. In a rather emotional letter, Parekh said the HDFC experience is invaluable. ""Our history cannot be erased and our legacy will be taken forward,"" said the veteran banker.

Questions on HDFC culture

In the letter, Parekh re-emphasised the importance of HDFC culture which helped the institution become a household name in India.

""An oft-repeated question is what happens to the culture of HDFC? My answer to this is that mergers are inherently about change. The work culture will be an amalgamation of the best of both organisations,"" Parekh wrote.

Explaining further, Parekh said the culture at the workplace is always a shared responsibility that needs daily reinforcement through the demonstration effect with the tone set at the top.

""As HDFC hands the baton, my wish is that our core founding values of kindness, fairness, efficiency and effectiveness get woven deeper into the fabric of the HDFC group,"" Parekh added.

In the letter, Parekh said HDFC Bank managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan and his team at the bank will take the HDFC legacy ahead.

""With the proven execution capabilities of HDFC Bank, we are confident that Sashi, together with the leadership team will forge an era of new opportunities for the combined entity,"" Parekh wrote in the letter.

Message to the bank?

In what appeared like a message or guidance to the bank with respect to home loan business, Parekh said that every home loan customer has their own story and it is the empathy factor that is the key differentiator between housing finance providers.

""Dealing with home loan customers requires immense patience. It is about understanding the needs and feelings of a home loan customer, assuaging their anxiety during this complex transaction, customising solutions, explaining financial implications of a mortgage product and lending responsibly to ensure a customer is not over-stretched,"" the veteran banker said.

Only home loan provider in the 80s

For CEO Keki Mistry too, this is the end of a long journey as HDFC CEO. In an interview with Moneycontrol in March this year, Mistry, who is associated with the HDFC brand for nearly 42 years, also highlighted that there will be structural opportunities in housing finance as the sector has seen tremendous change.

“In the early 1980s, we were the only housing loan provider. Convincing people in the 80s that housing finance and loan would work was a major challenge. But now the sustained demand for housing loans has been strong,” Mistry said.

Though the merger was discussed a few years ago, the plan entered a fast track in May 2021 with the bank deliberating the proposal at the top level and later approaching the parent with a proposal. HDFC Bank insiders say that compared with the previous boss of the bank, Aditya Puri, his successor Sashidhar Jagdishan was more amenable to the idea of a merger. Puri exited the bank in October 2020 and Jagdishan took charge as the new chief.

A good match for both parties

While the merger gave the much-need big entry to the bank into the lucrative home loan business, for the parent too, the decision made immense sense for one key reason. For NBFCs, life was getting tougher in India.

In his first-ever exclusive media interview post the merger announcement, Deepak Parekh told Moneycontrol that the NBFC business was getting tougher due to the tightening of the RBI regulations. “The constraint is that the RBI, over the last few years, removed the arbitrage between a bank and an NBFC,” he said.

Over the years, the RBI had brought in bank-like regulations for India’s big non-banks. Under the new multi-tiered structure for NBFCs (based on their asset size and systemic importance), bigger NBFCs were treated at par with banks on capital, regulatory scrutiny, and treatment of assets, which made operations even more expensive for this class of companies.

HDFC, with an over Rs 5-lakh-crore loan book, logically fell in the upper layer which meant it will be now monitored, inspected and regulated akin to a bank, whereas the incentives in NBFC business were less. However, when HDFC knocked on the doors of the regulator for a merger, it got a key relief.

The RBI gave critical relaxations on certain aspects such as priority sector lending norms and treatment of ownership of subsidiaries in April 21, 2023. Also, the RBI gave six months to HDFC customers to switch to new benchmarks.

Post-merger, the loan book of the merged entity will jump to Rs 22.21 lakh crore as on March 31, 2023, while deposits are at Rs 18.84 lakh crore. Further, HDFC Bank's market capitalisation will rise to Rs 14.6 lakh crore, from Rs 9.45 lakh crore prior to the merger. For the HDFC group, a great story ends and a new journey begins today.

HDFC Bank declined around 3 percent in morning trade on July 5, after the company announced its first quarter business update for FY24.

At 10.57 am, the stock was trading at Rs 1,671.80 on the National Stock Exchange, down 3.26 percent from the previous close.

HDFC Bank informed the exchanges on July 5 that its advances aggregated to approximately Rs 16.15 lakh crore for the quarter ended June 30, up nearly 15.8 percent year on year (YoY) from Rs 13.95 lakh crore a year ago. The bank's advances grew around 0.9 percent on quarter over quarter (QoQ) basis against Rs 16 lakh crore in Q4FY23.

The banks’s deposits jumped 19.2 percent YoY for the said quarter to Rs 19.13 lakh crore, as compared to Rs 16.04 lakh crore in Q1FY23. They were up 1.6 percent QoQ from Rs 18.83 lakh crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.

During the quarter under review, the retail deposits were increased by Rs 38,000 crore, growing by 21.5 percent YoY and 2.5 percent QoQ. The wholesale deposits improved by approximately 9 percent YoY and declined by around 2.5 percent QoQ.

In Q1FY24, the bank purchased loans aggregated to Rs 11,632 crore through the direct assignment route under the home loan arrangement with HDFC Ltd.

As on June 30, 2023, HDFC Bank's CASA deposits aggregated to Rs 8.13 lakh crore, an improvement of 10.7 percent over Rs 7.34 lakh crore as on June 30, 2022. CASA deposits were down 2.7 percent over Rs 8.36 lakh crore at March end. The retail CASA grew by 11 percent in Q1FY24 against Q1FY23, but fell by 2 percent QoQ. The Bank’s CASA ratio stood at around 42.5 percent in the said quarter, compared to 45.8 percent in Q1FY23 and 44.4 percent in Q4FY23.

Commenting on the update, analysts at brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher stated, “Loan growth numbers are lower, probably due to focus on the merger. While loan offtake seems to be lower for the system, retail growth was strong at 4 percent QoQ, which is a positive, and the share of retail is expected to improve this quarter.” They further added that deposit accretion has been in-line with credit offtake, although the 2.7 percent QoQ decline in CASA seemed seasonal in nature. The brokerage firm has given a “Buy” rating on the stock at a target price of Rs 1925.

Merged Entity Q1 Update

Some key takeaways about HDFC Bank and HDFC’s merged balance sheet:

-Gross advances were up 13.1 YoY and 0.7 percent QoQ basis, reaching Rs 22.45 lakh crore.

- Deposits aggregated to approximately Rs 20.63 lakh crore in Q1FY24, up 16.2 percent YoY and 1.2 percent QoQ.

- The merged entity's average liquidity coverage ratio for the Q1 stood at around 120 percent on a proforma basis.

The merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India's oldest and largest mortgage lending firm, with HDFC Bank came into effect on July 1. And it is an emotional moment for many old HDFC employees who spent a lifetime with the company.

Some HDFC employees Moneycontrol spoke to recall their early days, including the struggles of selling home loans when the product wasn't popular. ""I still remember the first day I joined HDFC. Now I've worked for more than two decades with the company, and it feels like home to me,"" said Nitin Walia, Assistant Manager of a branch in Delhi.

Another employee, who did not wish to be named, said after working 34 years at HDFC, the culture of the company is what he will miss the most. ""The spirit of working and the culture is the most important thing I experienced in my career at HDFC,"" said the employee.

""HDFC is an iconic brand. No one can take HDFC from us,"" said another senior employee.

""My 17 years in HDFC were full of a roller-coaster ride. Now to see that HDFC merged with HDFC Bank is a happy moment,"" said Shalabh Sharma, Deputy Manager at an HDFC branch in Mumbai.

Old days

HDFC opened in 1977 and was the sole mortgage lender in India at that time. Keki Mistry, CEO and Vice Chairman, HDFC, in an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol in March 2023, said that initially it was the only mortgage lender in India, and, with time, “we created our competition.""

""We trained some individuals and banks to start mortgage lending. During the early years of the company, home loans were not popular in India,"" Mistry said.

Echoing this, Sharma said that his role in the initial years involved developing leads and contacts. ""In the early years, people did not know about home loans. Before selling, there was a need for informing,"" said Sharma.

Mahesh Shah, former Corporate Communications Head at HDFC, said that the first word that comes to his mind when he recalls his journey with HDFC is commitment. Shah recalled that in May 1987, Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC, came to Cross Maidan to motivate the HDFC Cricket team during the finals of the Corporate Cricket tournament ‘The Times Shield.’

""He took me for a stroll on the ground as it was a lunch break to discuss the status of the match which he responded HDFC will win. He wanted to know if we needed to strengthen the team to meet the challenges of a higher level and he stuck to his commitment of a spinner being recruited,"" said Shah.

The evolution

HDFC Bank was incorporated in 1994 as a banking subsidiary of HDFC in Mumbai. With time, HDFC and HDFC Bank became mammoths in their respective sectors. The bank’s loan book, over the years, grew tremendously from Rs 2.3 lakh crore in 2013 to Rs 16 lakh crore in 2023. As of March 2023, the market capitalisation of HDFC Bank is Rs 9.5 lakh crore and that of HDFC is Rs 5.2 lakh crore.

The struggle of selling a home loan was something that HDFC faced in the years of its evolution. Parekh, in a press conference in Mumbai, on June 27, said that he still remembers the first loan the company gave. ""Our first home loan was of Rs 30,000. We took photographs of the customer with his house and made it the cover picture of our first annual report,"" said Parekh.

Shah recalled that during his time in HDFC, he remembered the growth of the company and summed it up in one word — commitment. ""The management of the company created an environment of subtleness and friendliness from the earliest days,"" said Shah.

Culture of HDFC

Parekh said HDFC and HDFC Bank have different cultures due to the nature of their business. However, though there is some difference, the company aims to have the same culture in the bank, he added. ""We want to have the culture of HDFC in HDFC Bank. Culture is the essential part of our organisation. A bank which does not do housing will have a different culture,"" said Parekh.

Mistry also said that there is not much cultural difference in HDFC and HDFC Bank and that every single employee from the mortgage lender will get absorbed into the bank. ""We don't see too many cultural differences between the two entities and all our staff. We have reassured that every single employee of HDFC will be taken into the bank,"" said Mistry.

The employee, who did not wish to be named, highlighted that the culture at HDFC is one thing he takes pride in. ""Culture is the essence of a workplace. I felt a home-like culture at HDFC,"" said the employee.

The merger

HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge on April 4, 2022. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.

In fact, Parekh had said, back in 2015 itself, that his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank, if circumstances were favourable. But the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense, provided there is no loss for shareholders.

Sashidhar Jagdishan, Managing Director, HDFC Bank, on an analyst call on May 24, said that the merger is only about a month away.

Once the deal comes into force, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the bank. With the parent finally joining with the bank, the combined entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry."

Having successfully executed the merger with parent HDFC, HDFC Bank's managing director and chief executive Sashidhar Jagdishan on Saturday said the country's largest lender aims to double every four years.

In a letter to the over 4,000 employees from HDFC who joined the bank's rolls on Saturday, Jagdishan said the future is bright, and the work on realising the potential of the merger starts now.

""The runway for financial services and mortgage, which are so underserved and under penetrated, is going to be very large. HDFC Bank - the combined entity - with a large and growing distribution and customer franchise, more than adequate capital, healthy asset quality and profitability, will be best positioned to capture growth. The pace at which we aim to grow - we could be creating a new HDFC Bank every 4 years,"" he said.

HDFC Bank began the day one after the merger with a rebranding exercise, wherein it is putting up its colours at all the over 500 branches and offices of HDFC Ltd.

The erstwhile HDFC's corporate headquarters at Ramon House already sports the HDFC Bank branding, and officials estimated that the entire exercise will be over in the next 24 hours.

It can be noted that dedicated teams have been put in place to make the merger as seamless as possible, right since its announcement on April 4 last year. As part of the USD 40 billion all-share deal, the biggest in Indian corporate history, HDFC Bank had committed to absorb all the over 4,000 employees of its parent.

""Our work starts from today, in realising the potential of what this merger holds for us,"" Jagdishan wrote.

To realise its growth aims, Jagdishan said the bank will be adding about 1,500 branches every year for some years to better serve the middle class and upper segment of the country.

It will continue investments on the digital front as well which, Jagdishan said, will make HDFC Bank into a 'technology company into banking"", and added that the same will get unveiled over the next three years.

The bank will be assessing its people on the basis of how they conduct governance and compliance, teamwork and their ability to delight customers, he said.

The canvas being offered to the HDFC Ltd employees is large -- both professionally and personally, the email said, adding that an external expert was appointed to arrive at the right formula for inducting people into the bank and deciding their role in the hierarchy.

Jagdishan said the cost-to-revenue ratio of HDFC at 0.04 per cent was the lowest for any mortgage company in the world, and thanked its leadership, including Deepak Parekh, Keki Mistry and Renu Karnad, for creating such an institution.

He said from a customer perspective, the home loan is a very emotional product which establishes a great bond between the financier and borrower and added that HDFC Bank would like to harness the same bond.

""The penetration levels of the home loan product in its (HDFC Bank's) customer base and the extent the distribution has been leveraged, is quite low. This is an opportunity! The runway for growth is going to be large and for a long time to come,"" Jagdishan said.

HDFC Bank will move from sales management to a relationship management model because of the opportunity to cross-sell that exists within the franchise after the addition of mortgage finance, insurance and asset management subsidiaries, Jagdishan said.

""The velocity of product sales and the reduced touch points to serve the customer will be a game changer with this 'power of bundling',"" he added.

HDFC Ltd, the parent of the country's largest private sector lender, merged into HDFC Bank on Saturday, with boards of both entities clearing the plan first presented on April 4 last year. HDFC Ltd, the largest pure-play home financier, ceases to exist 44 years after it was founded.

The USD 40-billion merger, the largest such deal in Indian corporate history, is driven by a changing regulatory landscape, which limited the advantages for HDFC continuing as a non-bank lending entity.

Post-merger, HDFC Bank will become the fourth most valued lender in the world, and narrow the gap by asset size with state-owned SBI to be the second largest Indian bank.

The total business of the merged entity stood at Rs 41 lakh crore at the end of March 2023. With the merger, the networth of the entity would be over Rs 4.14 lakh crore.

The combined profit of both entities was to the tune of about Rs 60,000 crore at the end of March 2023.

With the deal getting effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 per cent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 per cent of the bank. Every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares they hold.

The board of directors of HDFC Bank in consultation with the board of directors of HDFC Limited has fixed July 13, 2023, for determining the shareholders of HDFC Ltd who would be issued and allotted the shares of HDFC Bank, it added.

Besides, July 13 has been fixed for the continuation of warrants of HDFC Limited in the name of HDFC Bank.

The board has fixed July 12, 2023, for the transfer of non-convertible debentures while July 7 for the transfer of commercial papers of HDFC Ltd in the name of HDFC Bank.

The merged entity brings together significant complementarities that exist between both entities and is poised to create meaningful value for various stakeholders, including respective customers, employees and shareholders of both entities from increased scale, comprehensive product offering, balance sheet resiliency and ability to drive synergies across revenue opportunities, operating efficiencies and underwriting efficiencies, a statement said."

In his last letter to shareholders of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) on June 30, Chairman Deepak Parekh announced his retirement ahead of the mega merger with HDFC Bank saying it is time for him to hang up boots.

Merger to give cross-selling opportunities to bank

The merger of HDFC with Bank will offer cross-selling opportunities to the bank, while the home-loan business will be complemented by the bank’s core strengths, Parekh said in the letter.

""For HDFC Bank, a home loan customer marks the beginning of a journey of having a customer in perpetuity. HDFC Bank is excited at the prospect of cross-selling an array of asset and liability products to home loan customers. This will be done seamlessly on their digitalisation platforms – all through a one-click experience,"" the HDFC chairman said in the letter.

HDFC and HDFC bank merger is likely to take effect from July 1.

Further, Parekh said what the future holds, only time will tell but the biggest risk organisations face today is staying with the status quo, believing what worked well yesterday will continue in the future.

""Change takes courage as it displaces one from the cocoon of comfort and familiarity. Yet, with change comes the power of adaptability, growth and new aspirations. The orchestration of this merger is to ensure that the future is not constrained for any of our stakeholders,"" Parekh added.

Focus on HDFC Culture

In the letter, Parekh reemphasised the importance of HDFC culture that has helped the institution become a household name in India.

""An oft-repeated question is what happens to the culture of HDFC? My answer to this is that mergers are inherently about change. The work culture will be an amalgamation of the best of both organisations,"" Parekh wrote.

Explaining further, Parekh said culture at the workplace is always a shared responsibility that needs daily reinforcement through the demonstration effect with the tone set at the top.

""As HDFC hands the baton, my wish is that our core founding values of kindness, fairness, efficiency and effectiveness get woven deeper into the fabric of the HDFC group,"" Parekh added.

In the letter, Parekh said HDFC Bank managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan and his team at the bank will take the HDFC legacy ahead.

""With the proven execution capabilities of HDFC Bank, we are confident that Sashi, together with the leadership team will forge an era of new opportunities for the combined entity,"" Parekh wrote in the letter.

Status quo biggest risk

This means, at the time of the merger, FTSE will continue with the current free float shares of HDFC Ltd in the indices and rename the constituent with the acquirer’s name HDFC Bank. This will result in no weight changes.

According to Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research, ""In the subsequent review, FTSE will combine the original HDFC Bank shares provided sufficient liquidity, no foreign ownership restriction and 10 percent plus foreign headroom is available.""

This could lead to a potential weight-up inflow of around 63 million shares of the merged entity worth $1.3 billion.

""In terms of impact this shouldn’t be very significant for the humongous size of the merged entity,"" Nuvama added.

Days before its reverse merger with its own banking subsidiary, HDFC on Tuesday inaugurated a legacy centre detailing its founder HT Parekh's contribution to the creation of a housing finance market in the country in particular and to his overall contribution to the financial sector.

It is called the HT Parekh Legacy Centre, housed in the Ramon House, which is the headquarters of HDFC in the city.

The centre offers a digital and photo-led history of Hasmukh Thakordas Parekh, who founded HDFC in 1978, when he was 67 years old and one year since his retirement from ICICI Ltd Chairman with just Rs 10,000 personal contribution and Rs 10 crore of borrowed money.

Over the past 46 years, the tiny startup has gone to become a financial giant with over Rs 6 lakh crore of assets under management and on merger will be an Rs 18 lakh crore-behemoth, becoming the second largest financial institution in the country.

Parekh, who was born in March 1911 in Surat and passed away in November 1994, also founded GRUH Finance and Hindustan Oil Exploration Corporation.

The legacy centre was inaugurated by Jamshyd N Godrej, the chairman and managing director of Godrej & Boyce, in the presence of Pheroza Godrej and Deepak Parekh, the chairman of HDFC, which is set to be merged with HDFC Bank from July 1.

The centre has been set up by HDFC and the HT Parekh Foundation.

The centre is a humble attempt to tell his story covering his early life, stockbroking years, building ICICI as a development bank and finally HDFC in 1977, a culmination of his lifelong dream, Deepak Parekh said and described his late uncle as ""a soft-spoken giant"".

His journey has been depicted in a chronological order in a visual medium that comes alive with archival documents, photographs, audio-visuals and personal belongings, covering his mentors, colleagues, friends and family, he added.

The HT Parekh Foundation is the philanthropic arm of HDFC, established in October 2012. The foundation works across rural and urban India and partners with organisations across the focus areas of education, healthcare, environment and supporting persons with disabilities.

Parekh said post merger, the foundation will continue to do what it has been doing and will be independent of the bank."

Borrowing costs of some non-banking finance companies (NBFC) and housing finance companies have fallen by 10-25 basis points (bps) as investors look beyond HDFC to other companies ahead of the mortgage lender's exit from the market, a Moneycontrol analysis of the market data showed.

Dealers said the fall in yields on some papers was also due to a sharp easing of yields on government securities. In the last few weeks, the yield on a 10-year benchmark bond has eased more than 20 basis points (bps) due to a pause on rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and easing oil prices.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

“Demand for NBFC or housing finance companies have increased post HDFC/HDFC Bank merger. But lower yields is also a function of lower benchmark yield,” said Mataprasad Pandey, Vice President, Arete Capital Service.

Further, Umesh Kumar Tulsyan, Managing Director of Sovereign Global Markets, a New Delhi-based fund house, said borrowing figures of HDFC were on the elevated side due to the merger. “Now this figure would come down substantially and crowding will reduce.”

The issuances

According to the NSE and BSE electronic bidding platform data compiled by Moneycontrol, JM Financial Credit Solutions issued bonds on June 19 with a yield of 8.80 percent compared to 9.00 percent on May 22.

Similarly, Shriram Finance sold bonds on June 23 at an 8.65 percent coupon as compared to 8.79 percent on April 11. The maturity of both bonds was the same at around two years.

Another bond of Shriram Housing Finance maturing in three years was sold by the company at an 8.80 percent coupon rate on May 31 as against 8.95 percent on April 19.

Money markets dealers said this shows the demand from investors was already shifting to other entities since May.

Earlier on today, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh said the merger between the country's largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, and mortgage lender, HDFC Ltd, is expected to be completed by July 1.

""The merger is expected to be complete by July 1. Both HDFC Bank and HDFC Ltd will have separate board meetings on June 30,"" said Parekh.

Will the merger help AA and below-rated papers?

Dealers say the exit of HDFC from the bond market after the merger is likely to help other players get demand from investors, who will turn towards them for better returns.

However, Pandey added that demand will be confined majorly to quality and top-rated papers.

“I don't see the merger improving demand for AA-rated papers meaningfully as it is about to be replaced with equally strong papers,” he said.

This is because of the risk involved in AA and below-rated papers despite their giving higher returns, a bond dealer at a state-owned bank said.

This will obviously help with respect to spreads coming down for other NBFCs, said Tulsyan.

How much HDFC borrowed this fiscal?

According to the data compiled from NSE and BSE EBP, HDFC raised over Rs 45,000 crore between April and June.

In March, the board of directors of the company approved raising Rs 57,000 crore via non-convertible debentures (NCDs) on a private placement basis.

The merger process

HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge on April 4, 2022. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.

Back in 2015, Parekh said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank if circumstances were favourable. But the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense, provided there is no loss of value for shareholders.

Sashidhar Jagdishan, Managing Director, HDFC Bank, on an analyst call on May 24 had said that the merger is only about a month away.

“It's now just another four or five weeks before the big day,” Jagdishan had said.

Once the deal comes into force, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, with existing shareholders of HDFC holding 41 percent of the bank."

""This is an industry-wide issue and the company will be taking appropriate steps in due course to reply to the show-cause notice and contest the matter. It may be noted that Rs 250 crore has been deposited under protest with the authority in this matter in the past,"" HDFC Life added.

In September 2022, the Mumbai unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) said that an input tax credit of Rs 824 crore was availed by 16 insurance companies on the basis of fake invoices. Out of this, insurers had voluntarily paid Rs 217 crore after the DGGI investigation.

DGGI investigations revealed that these insurers were paying commissions beyond the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s permissible limit to their corporate agents in the garb of expenses related to marketing and brand activation.

The GST law doesn’t allow availing of such input tax credit as the supply of said service did not actually take place.

In a filing on June 23, the company also said the insurance regulator had approved the transfer of shares of HDFC Life from HDFC Ltd to HDFC Bank. This comes ahead of the merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank.

""We also wish to inform that IRDAI vide its said letter has also granted its approval for HDFC Limited to acquire additional shares in HDFC Life so as to hold more than 50 percent of its total share capital,"" HDFC Life said.

At 11 am, HDFC Life was trading 0.55 percent up at Rs 630.40 on BSE.

In his first interview with Indian media post the landmark deal, Jimmy Mahtani, Head, BPEA EQT India spoke to Moneycontrol's Ashwin Mohan on the road ahead post the Credila gameplan, BPEA EQT's India M&A strategy, opting for the consortium route and more ...

Q. What were the key deal triggers for BPEA EQT when it comes to the HDFC Credila acquisition?

Jimmy Mahtani: This is a landmark deal for BPEA EQT. It’s not only our first investment in India following our combination with EQT, it also marks the largest-ever private equity buyout within India’s financial services sector.

We have been following HDFC Credila closely since 2016 as the company is positioned at the intersection of two of BPEA EQT’s core sectors - education and financial services.

There’s huge demand for high-quality education among India’s young population, and we are both humbled and excited about the opportunity to enable access to academic studies for even more students going forward.

Q. As a buyout fund which has struck deals across multiple sectors, why did BPEA EQT choose to not go solo and partner with ChrysCapital for this deal? What is the split between the two in terms of deal consideration?

A: We like to partner up with like-minded investors. It adds more perspectives, networks and experiences. Similar to BPEA EQT, ChrysCapital has a strong track record within financial services in India.

BPEA EQT will hold a significant majority stake in HDFC Credila.

Q. How does BPEA EQT plan to take HDFC Credila to the next stage of growth? Is an India IPO on the cards?

A: We see a huge opportunity in accelerating HDFC Credila’s digital transformation journey, drawing on EQT’s expertise and in-house capabilities in this field, especially improvements related to UX, operational efficiencies,

data-driven underwriting, and cybersecurity. We also see attractive opportunities in broadening HDFC Credila’s product and services offering into adjacent verticals.

It’s too early to think of potential exit routes. We just signed this investment, right now our focus is on closing the deal so that we can get started on working together with HDFC Credila’s management and partners to kick off the next phase of the company’s growth journey.

Q. Are there any synergies between the existing education portfolio of BPEA EQT namely Nord Anglia Education and IMG Academy and its latest bet HDFC Credila?

A: Definitely. Education is one of BPEA EQT's core sectors, and we have invested more than $4 billion of equity in 12 companies over the course of the past decade. During this period, we have accumulated plenty of operational expertise, insights and networks from having supported our education assets’ growth across Asia, Europe and North America.

Q. Does BPEA EQT expect more consolidation in the Indian education loan segment, and will it participate further in M&A opportunities in the Indian financial services space?

A: We believe HDFC Credila has a long runway for organic growth, and we will infuse Rs 20 billion of primary capital to support this. We will be open to M&A opportunities that add to HDFC Credila’s product and service capabilities."

Competition watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) on June 20 granted its approval to mortgage lender HDFC to acquire a certain stake in HDFC Life Insurance Company and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company Ltd.

These approvals will help pave the way for the merger of HDFC into HDFC Bank, expected to be finalised by the third quarter of this financial year.

In April, the Reserve Bank also allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC to increase shareholding in HDFC Life Insurance Company and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company to over 50 per cent prior to the effective date of the merger.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI), in a statement said it has approved the proposed combination involving acquisition of additional shareholding of HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited by Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (HDFC).

In another statement, the fair trade regulator said it has also cleared acquisition by HDFC of certain additional shareholding of HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company Limited.

In both these cases, the merged entity HDFC Bank (after the effective date of the proposed amalgamation) will hold over 50 per cent of the shareholding of the two insurance companies, according to CCI.

Termed as the biggest transaction in India's corporate history, HDFC Bank on April 4 last year agreed to take over the biggest domestic mortgage lender in a deal valued at about USD 40 billion, creating a financial services titan. The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore.

After the deal is effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the bank. Every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares they hold.

On May 22, Moneycontrol was the first to report that a Baring PE EQT-led consortium was the frontrunner to pick up a majority stake of around 90 percent in HDFC Credila. The valuation expectation was around Rs 10,000 crore, the report had added.

The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and dispensations (including the RBI and Competition Commission of India) in connection with the Proposed Transaction and continuation of HDFC Credila’s business.

According to the deal terms, HDFC shall have the right to nominate 1 non-executive nominee director on the board of HDFC Credila on terms as agreed under the Shareholders’ Agreement and the firm shall have customary pre-emptive rights under the Shareholders’ Agreement.

Management view

Jimmy Mahtani, Partner and Head of BPEA EQT India, commented, “The demand in India for obtaining a higher education is growing at a faster pace than ever, accelerated by our country’s growing middle class and students’ strive for better career opportunities. Coming out of HDFC Group, one of India’s most respected and well-established financial conglomerates, HDFC Credila plays a critical part in serving this demand. We have been following HDFC Credila for several years and we are excited to partner with its strong management team led by Arijit Sanyal.

""We also welcome HDFC Group’s decision to retain a minority stake in the business and we see their continued support as a testament to our vision for the company. Looking ahead, BPEA EQT plans to accelerate HDFC Credila's digital transformation and invest significantly in the Company's continued growth.”

Arijit Sanyal, CEO of HDFC Credila, said, “Having established ourselves as the largest NBFC in the education finance sector in India, we are delighted to welcome our new investors BPEA EQT and ChrysCapital. Our association with such marquee investors is expected to fuel the next chapter in HDFC Credila’s journey and enable us to scale new heights. We also welcome HDFC's decision to retain 9.99 percent stake in the company and look forward to our continued association.

""I would like to thank all our stakeholders and employees for their continued support. I am extremely optimistic about our future and look forward to the next steps.”

Sanjay Kukreja, Partner and CIO of ChrysCapital, commented, “ChrysCapital is excited to partner with BPEA EQT and help support HDFC Credila in its next leg of growth. Financial services has been a focus investment sector for ChrysCapital with more than a quarter of total deployments over the last 20 years and more than a third of realisations.

""This transaction is in tandem with ChrysCapital’s strategy to increase focus on buyout transactions across sectors. This transaction is the fourth investment and third buyout from ChrysCapital’s latest $1.4B ninth fund, and is also the fund’s second buyout in financial services after the investment in Bandhan Mutual Fund earlier this year.”

The domestic private equity firm put out a statement saying, ""ChrysCapital-led funds plan to invest over $250M in HDFC Credila of the total $1.3 bn consortium investment.""

In April, ahead of the merger with HDFC Bank, the banking regulator directed HDFC to reduce its stake in subsidiary HDFC Credila to 10 percent within two years without onboarding new customers. Established in 2006, HDFC Credila is India's first dedicated education loan company.

In November 2009, HDFC announced the acquisition of a 41 percent stake in HDFC Credila Financial Services, marking its entry into the segment. HDFC purchased the 41 percent equity from DSP Merrill Lynch Capital Ltd, an Indian subsidiary of global financial services major Merrill Lynch. Then in December 2019, the mortgage lender took complete control by acquiring a 9.12 percent stake from the promoter Bohora family, valuing the entire company at Rs 4,331 crore.

A closer look at the acquirers

Following EQT's acquisition of Baring PE Asia in 2022, BPEA was integrated with the EQT platform and is now known as BPEA EQT, operating as EQT's private equity business line alongside EQT's infrastructure and real estate businesses in Asia. It also holds a minority stake in private sector lender RBL Bank.

According to its website, in the financial services space, Chrys Capital backs the likes of Bandhan Mutual Fund, Hero Fin Corp and Varthana, which provides loans and services to affordable private schools in India.

The total revenue of HDFC Credila during FY 2022-23 was Rs 1,352.18 crore and its net worth as on March 31, 2023 stood at Rs 2,435.09 crore.

The Rs 9,060-crore buyout of HDFC Credila by the BPEA EQT and ChrysCapital consortium is the largest acquisition in the Indian financial services sector by private equity investors.

BPEA EQT was advised by Arpwood Capital, E&Y (financial, tax, ESG, and technology) and JSA (legal).

The high profile merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank is coming to a close, and the resultant entity will be 'too big to ignore'. So much so that several mutual funds schemes will breach market regulator's norm for maximum permitted holdings in a security. According to a Moneycontrol analysis, around 60 mutual fund schemes will hold Rs 5,000 crore worth of HDFC Bank shares beyond Sebi's (Securities and Exchange Board of India) prescribed limit post merger.

As per SEBI, a mutual fund scheme cannot invest more than 10 percent in a single security. Exchange-traded funds and thematic funds are exempt from this rule.

Of the 60 funds, the largest excess exposure, to the tune of Rs 1,231 crore, will be held by Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund-Reg(G). A name from the HDFC group pops up, too. HDFC Top 100 Fund(G) will have the second highest excess exposure of Rs 720 crore.

Our calculations have also found two schemes - Tata Quant Fund-Reg(G) and Invesco India Tax Plan(G) - overshooting the limit by 5 percent. Invesco India Tax Plan(G), which has a total AUM of Rs 1,999 crore, will hold ~Rs 101 crore worth HDFC Bank shares in excess post merger.

Possible scenarios

According to a Reuters report, SEBI is unlikely to give special exemption to mutual funds if they breach the norms.

After the merger, when funds report the holdings in their schemes, they will get 30 days to rebalance, said Abhilash Pagaria, Head - Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

""The industry was prepared for this scenario. Fund managers can start adjusting their portfolios right away or sell their holdings in that 30-day period. Either way, the stock will not come under too much pressure because 20-day average trading and delivery volumes is sufficient to take care of Rs 5,000 crore impact,"" he said.

Market participants are certain that the selling will be absorbed by smart money.

""A good quality stock such as HDFC Bank always finds equilibrium in the case of a sell off being triggered due to non-fundamental reasons. Smart money by high-networth individuals and retail Investors will fill the gap left by their institutional contemporaries,"" said Ali Azar, a chartered accountant and content creator specialising in stock markets.

On May 4, HDFC Bank shares tumbled over 6 percent after index provider MSCI tweaked the adjustment factor for the combined entity. Soon after, the stock recovered a bit and is now down 1.4 percent since then.

On June 15, the stock was quoting at Rs 1,603 on the NSE, higher by 0.12 percent at 9:50 am with volumes of 1.4 million shares.

India's markets regulator is unlikely to give special exemption to mutual funds if they breach the norms for maximum permitted holdings in a security after the merger of HDFC Bank and HDFC, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

HDFC Bank and HDFC - both heavily owned by mutual funds - are set to conclude a merger in the next few weeks to create India's second-largest financial institution by assets after the State Bank of India.

However, pressure on mutual funds to reduce their holdings or any limitations on increases could be an overhang on the stock of the merged entity.

As per the rules of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), a mutual fund scheme cannot invest more than 10% in a single security. However, exchange-traded funds and funds that invest in particular sectors are exempt.

At least 60 equity mutual fund schemes will see their combined exposure to HDFC Bank and HDFC overshoot the 10% cap as of Wednesday.

HDFC Bank and SEBI did not reply to emailed requests for comments.

SEBI could consider this overshoot as a ""passive breach,"" implying no deliberate attempt to flout rules, one of the sources said. In such cases, the funds have 30 days to rebalance their portfolio, which can be extended by another 60 days, failing which the mutual funds may face regulatory action, the source added.

Regulatory intervention is warranted if there is a wider impact on the market, which is not the case here, said the second source.

Both sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

The matter has been referred to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), according to two mutual fund executives.

Last week, AMFI officials and industry executives analysed the impact of the merger and how much of the stock the industry would need to sell to adhere to regulatory limits, the executives said.

""Considering the regulatory requirement, there will be some mutual funds that would need to sell which will create short-term pressure on the stock. However, with the prices reducing, it will create more opportunities for retail and other domestic investors to buy,"" said Deven Choksey, founder of KRChoksey Holdings Ltd, a brokerage firm.

Funds may have to offload 30 billion rupees ($364.9 million) to 40 billion rupees of the combined company's stock, said an executive with a large fund house.

""HDFC Bank and HDFC are fairly liquid stocks and have a lot of demand. This will hold true for the combined entity, too,"" the executive said, adding that funds that need to sell will find buyers.

This clause could curtail the ability of fund managers to take incremental exposure to the banking bell-weather, the chief executive of another large-sized mutual fund pointed out.

""Selling to meet the regulatory requirements could be seen by some in the market as a desperate act and the fund managers would not get good buyers at the right price,"" the person said. ""This will impact the fund's performance."""

The merger of India’s most valuable lender and the nation’s largest mortgage financier to create what could be the world’s fifth-most valuable bank is inching closer to completion, with just one key step remaining that investors are watching for closely.

Announcement of the so called ‘record date’ — or the cut-off day set for investors — for the swapping of shares of Housing Development Finance Corp. for HDFC Bank Ltd. is expected within three weeks. The merged entity is likely to trade under the HDFC Bank ticker before July 20, bringing an end to the process that began in April 2022.

The merger is unprecedented in India, creating a bank worth $168 billion and impacting over tens of millions of customers and shareholders across the two companies apart from group insurance and asset management businesses.

A central team, with 3 members from each company, and nearly three dozen committees worked on a business integration plan. Meanwhile, legal approvals were sought from shareholders, banking, securities market and competition regulators as well as stock exchanges with the final nod granted by the company law tribunal in March.

The approvals got done in good time and the integration of technology platforms is at an advanced stage, Keki Mistry, chief executive officer of the mortgage lender told Bloomberg News last week. “The target is for the merger to be effective early July,” he said.

Final Step

Once the merger is effective, a cut-off date will be announced to determine HDFC shareholders eligible to receive HDFC Bank shares. HDFC shares will stop trading on that date and it would take a week or two for allocation and listing of new shares.

HDFC Bank will allocate 42 new shares for 25 shares of HDFC. The mortgage lender said it will try to time the record date to ensure no gap takes place between HDFC shares being suspended and HDFC Bank shares being allocated to its over 740,000 shareholders.

A day before the record date will be the ex-date which marks the price adjustment between the two merging companies, said Anil Ghelani, head of passive investments and products at DSP Asset Managers Ltd.

On the ex-date, the HDFC Bank share price will adjust to incorporate the value of HDFC. This is important for key stock indexes that include the two companies, as well as overlying index funds and ETFs.

Nifty Indices’ new rules indicate HDFC will be excluded from any index on the ex-date and the value of HDFC Bank updated. Earlier rules excluded companies from the index at the beginning of the merger process. This changed soon after the HDFC merger announcement as the two financial majors are among the top five constituents of the benchmark National Stock Exchange’s Nifty50 by weightage. The exchange did not respond to queries about the exclusion."

HDFC Bank Ltd has shortlisted veteran Arvind Kapil, its current retail assets head, to spearhead the home loans business post its mega-merger with India’s biggest mortgage financier Housing Development Finance Corp.

Kapil, who has worked at India’s most valuable bank for almost a quarter of a century, recently met executives at the mortgage lender to discuss plans for the loan book post-merger, according to people familiar with the matter. If he gets the role, Kapil will lead a mammoth mortgage business, that currently includes gross individual loans of Rs 5 lakh crore ($61 billion) at HDFC and over Rs 1 lakh crore at HDFC Bank, according to the firms’ latest financial statements.

The decision has yet to be finalized and may still change with the merger slated to be completed as soon as July 1, they said. Kapil did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment. HDFC Bank did not respond to an email seeking confirmation on Kapil’s new role.

At HDFC Bank, Kapil has overseen the rollout of initiatives like getting a personal loan in 10 seconds, even for those without a bank account, as well as offering car loans in 30 minutes.

The merger will create a financial behemoth that can ride the boom in home loans and consumer spending in the world’s most populous nation. An integration committee in the bank is constantly reviewing the business, credit and operations processes so the integration is seamless, Kapil said at the HDFC Bank Day, according to a May 24 video on the bank’s YouTube page.

“Step by step, we’re pretty much ready,” Kapil said at the event. About 70% of HDFC’s mortgage customers did not have accounts with the bank and Kapil said the lender plans to encourage these clients to bank with it."

Members of the public can exchange Rs2,000 banknotes up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time, the central bank had said.

Playing safe

Banks are insisting on customers filling separate forms as a precautionary measure so that data on every such transaction is accounted for with customer details to share with RBI or other agencies if enquiries arise in future, bankers said.

""We have introduced forms because we want to keep data on who has exchanged money from our bank,” a senior banker in Mumbai/Delhi with a state-run bank told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.

“This is to ensure we don't fall in trouble (in case of future enquiries),"" the banker added.

Another banker said many people tried to come to branches to exchange Rs 2,000 notes multiple times.

""Only motive to come up with this separate form at the time of exchange is to keep track of how many people are coming to the branch to exchange the Rs 2,000 notes,” said the second banker.

To ascertain the progress of Rs2000 note deposits/ exchange, Moneycontrol reporters visited several bank branches in New Delhi and Mumbai.

Banks insisting on forms being filled include Punjab National Bank (PNB), Bank of Baroda (BOB), Canara Bank, Axis Bank, IDFC First Bank, RBL Bank and HDFC Bank.

""As directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), we are facilitating Rs 2,000 denomination notes deposited in customer accounts without the requirement of any document submission. This has been ensured at all our branches across the country. Besides, the exchange of Rs 2,000 denomination bank notes is being facilitated, up to the limit of Rs 20,000 at a time, for our customers based on customer ID and for all non-HDFC Bank customers a copy of any of the officially valid document (OVD) or pan card is required. This is as per the RBI’s master direction on Know Your Customer and in line with the extant process of the bank. HDFC Bank stands committed to serving its customers,"" an official from HDFC Bank said.

Except for HDFC Bank, emails sent to other banks seeking responses for this story remained unanswered till the time of filing this copy.

A few banks such as ICICI Bank are using the deposit slip instead of separate forms for the exchange of Rs 2,000 notes.

""We are only allowing customers to exchange Rs 2,000 notes once in a day; also we are not facing any kind of liquidity crises so far and have enough cash for exchange,"" a Delhi-based banker said.

State Bank of India (SBI) on May 22 informed all its branches that no form or identity proof would be needed to exchange Rs 2,000 currency notes and reiterated the one-time limit of Rs 20,000 for depositing or exchanging banknotes.

""The facility of exchanging Rs 2,000 notes to all members of the public up to a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time will be allowed without obtaining any requisition slip,"" the country's largest lender said in a press release on May 20. ""No identity proof is required to be submitted by the tenderer at the time of exchange.""

Officials at SBI said there are no restrictions on customers coming in multiple times to exchange notes.

""This is true that many people are coming to exchange multiple times to exchange Rs 2,000 notes and exchanging more than 10 notes. However, we try to keep an eye on this too, ""said a senior SBI official.

Rs 2,000 note so far in the market

The latest release on May 19 by the RBI showed the total value of Rs 2,000 banknotes was Rs 3.62 lakh crore constituting only 10.8 percent of notes in circulation on March 31, 2023.

About 89 percent of the Rs 2,000 denomination banknotes were issued prior to March 2017 and are at the end of their estimated lifespan of 4-5 years.

“It has also been observed that this (Rs 2,000 banknote) denomination is not commonly used for transactions. Further, the stock of banknotes in other denominations continues to be adequate to meet the currency requirement of the public,” the RBI said in the release."

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is in the final stages to offload stressed loans of around Rs 2,000 crore extended to developers ahead of its merger with HDFC Bank, according to a report by The Economic Times.

HDFC’s asset quality has been improving in the past few quarters and it wants to sell the stressed loans before its merger with HDFC Bank which will create a financial behemoth. Its individual gross non-performing assets (GNPA) decreased from 0.99 percent to 0.75 percent as of March 31. Non-individual GNPA decreased from 4.76 percent to 2.9 percent.

These loans are spread across 7-8 accounts and reportedly include advances to the local owners of Radisson Blu properties. The mortgage lender is engaged in negotiations with asset reconstruction companies to sell these loans. Alvarez & Marsal, a consulting firm, is actively seeking potential buyers for the loans.

The report says some of these loans might include NPAs while some may be stressed, but haven't formally been declared yet as NPAs. Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the report.

During March, HDFC had showcased some of these accounts for potential sale but did not proceed due to lower-than-expected recovery prospects, the report mentioned. Omkara ARC bought the Rs 150 crore worth of outstanding loans of Matoshree Developers for Rs 50 crore, which entails a 33 percent recovery for HDFC.

During Q4, HDFC had received a bid from Omkara ARC for around Rs 1,100 crore pooled stressed assets but the bid value fell short of the mortgage lender's expectations, resulting in the sale not taking place, the report added."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC

HDFC saw a good quarter with core PPoP beating PLe by 12% led by better NII/NIM and higher assignment income. Asset quality was stronger as GNPA reduced QoQ from 1.5% to 1.2% due to higher recoveries. Net AuM growth was softer at 9.2% YoY due to 11% drop in non-individual which has been run down to comply with merger. We see superior AuM growth at 12% in FY24/25E as 1) bulk of run-down has been effected and 2) HDFC expects home loan momentum to sustain. Company would need to build-up LCR before merger since LCR as per bank norms is ~75% (reported 128%). While we await clarity on the LCR need to assess the NIM impact, HDFCB does hold excess SLR.

Outlook

With core RoE at ~14%, valuation is at 1.8x. Keeping multiple at 2.3x we shift to Mar’25 core ABV and raise TP from Rs3,000 to Rs3,200. Retain BUY.

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC

HDFC 4QFY23 reported PAT grew 20% YoY to INR44.3b (13% beat), aided by a) NIM expansion and b) Higher assignment income. Core PPOP grew 16% YoY to INR53.4b. NIM expanded sequentially by ~10bp with FY23 NIM at 3.6% (v/s 3.5% as on 9MFY23). Credit costs increased ~4bp QoQ to ~29bp. Disbursements in the Individual segment were slightly below INR500b in 4QFY23. Individual/total AUM rose 17%/11% YoY, with Individual loans comprising ~83% of AUM. The management shared that it has not witnessed any perceptible change in demand for mortgages, despite the high interest rates and that a large proportion of customers have seen only their tenor increase rather than any EMI increase. HDFC achieved its highest ever monthly disbursements in Mar’23 and expects this positive momentum to continue throughout FY24. Commentary on the existing mortgage demand has been divergent across the different lenders in the mortgage ecosystem.

Outlook

HDFC continues to have a strong ‘right to win’ in its standalone Mortgage business. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a TP of INR3,290 (premised on Mar’25E SoTP).

Demat account openings hit lowest since Dec 2020 at 1.6 million as volatility continues

Demat account openings were at the lowest level since December 2020, with only 1.60 million accounts opened in April. This made a significant deviation from the average of 2.9 million and 2.09 million accounts added per month in fiscal 2022 and 2023. Analysts attribute the decline to factors such as volatile markets lasting beyond 18 months, lack of attractively priced large initial public offerings, and muted returns for investors, in the small and mid-cap segments.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) posted higher than expected net profit in the March quarter but the stock was trading almost 5 percent down on May 5 morning following an update on MSCI implementation post merger.

On May 4, HDFC reported a near 20 percent growth in standalone net profit at Rs 4,425.50 crore in the March quarter, up from Rs 3,700.32 crore in the year-ago period. Net interest income (NII) for the quarter stood at Rs 5,321 crore against Rs 4,601 crore in the previous year, implying a growth of 16 percent.

HDFC was expected to post a 4.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit at Rs 3,854 crore, according to a Moneycontrol poll. NII was expected to rise nearly 5 percent YoY to Rs 4,752 crore.

During the conference call with analysts, HDFC said the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is at 128 percent. The management highlighted that LCR as per RBI’s norms for banks is around 70-75 percent.

It expects the merger with HDFC Bank to be completed by July 2023.

Analysts seem to be bullish on the company’s prospects and they expect an upside potential of 4-20 percent in the financier's stock, but MSCI’s change in adjustment factor on May 5 morning roiled HDFC twins.

Contrary to Street's expectation of HDFC's merged entity commanding double the current weight in MSCI, the index provider tweaked the adjustment factor on May 5, indicating the weight will remain more or less the same.

Here is what analysts have to say about Q4 performance and the stock:

Nomura

The asset quality of the financier remains benign, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) reducing 30 basis points (bps) QoQ to 1.2 percent as credit cost remained low at 25 bps. The brokerage firm has a “buy” rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 3,100.

Deposits formed 27 percent of total borrowings, down 540 bps YoY, as HDFC continues to reduce the proportion of corporate deposits and now retail deposits comprise 73 percent, up over 10 percent YoY, of total deposits.

Nuvama Institutional Equities

The brokerage firm has retained its “hold” rating but increased its EPS for FY24-FY25 by 2-4 percent, leading to a higher target price of Rs 2,820 from Rs 2,700.

“Merger narrative will drive stock price,” the brokerage firm said.

Historically, entities that are merged have traded at a discount to the merger ratio and Nuvama Institutional Equities said the risk reward for HDFC is evenly balanced.

Macquarie

The foreign brokerage firm has an “outperform” rating on the financier’s stock with a target price of Rs 3,060. It pointed out that the March quarter was a stable one for HDFC, while the focus would be on the merger with HDFC Bank.

Macquarie said the stable spreads, rising margin and improvement in asset quality is in-line with expectations.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services

The domestic brokerage firm expects HDFC’s margin to remain largely stable over FY24 and FY25. It has increased its EPS estimates for FY25 by 2 percent to factor in lower credit costs.

It expects HDFC’s AUM and profit after tax to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of around 14 percent each over FY23-25, which will translate into a core Return on Asset and Return on Equity of 2 percent and 14 percent respectively in FY25. It has reiterated its “buy” rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 3,290.

At 10.10 am, the stock was trading at Rs 1,650.20 on the National Stock Exchange, down 5 percent from the previous close.

Contrary to Street's expectation of HDFC's merged entity commanding double the current weight in MSCI, the index provider tweaked the adjustment factor on May 5, indicating the weight will remain more or less the same.

""Previously, the adjustment factor for computing the weight of merged entity was 1x. Now, MSCI says it will be 0.5x. So, it was earlier expected that the merged entity would see $3 billion inflow. Now, MSCI's tweak could result in $150-200 million outflow,"" Abhilash Pagaria of Edelweiss Alternative Research told Moneycontrol.

At present, HDFC's weight is 6.74 percent in MSCI India Index and as per Pagaria's preliminary calculations, the merged entity will end up having a slightly lower weight of about 6.5 percent.

Both HDFC and HDFC Bank shares opened over 4 percent lower on May 5 after the MSCI tweak. At 9.20 am, HDFC was quoting at Rs 2,745 on the NSE, down 4.09 percent from the previous close and HDFC Bank shares were down 4.07 percent at Rs 1,657.50.

Why did MSCI bring down the adjustment factor?

Inclusion in MSCI index depends on a stock's foreign room. Foreign room is essentially the proportion of shares available to foreign investors relative to the maximum allowed. MSCI requires this to be at least 15 percent.

Based on the latest available shareholding disclosure, the foreign room of the merged HDFC entity is expected to be marginally above 15 percent.

""Due to volatile flows, if the foreign room comes below 15 percent by the next quarterly review, MSCI would have to change the weightage again. To avoid this, it has tweaked the adjustment factor,"" Pagaria said.

What was the expectation?

HDFC is a part of the MSCI index, while HDFC Bank is not as its foreign room does not meet the threshold.

After the merger, the non-index constituent, HDFC Bank in this case, will be considered for immediate inclusion. MSCI would have considered an adjustment factor of 1x, which could have doubled the free float market capitalisation of the entity.

This now stands changed.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) on May 4 reported an 19.59 percent growth in standalone net profit at Rs 4,425.50 crore for the quarter ended March, as against Rs 3,700.32 crore, reported a year ago.

The net interest income (NII) for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 stood at Rs 5,321 crore compared to Rs 4,601 crore in the previous year, representing a growth of 16 percent.

HDFC was expected to post a 4.4 percent on-year growth in net profit for the March quarter to Rs 3,854 crore, according to a Moneycontrol poll. Net interest income (NII) was expected to rise nearly 5 percent on-year to Rs 4,752 crore, the average of estimates showed.

The Board declared an interim dividend of Rs 44 per equity share for the financial year ended March 31, 2023.

The company said as at March 31, 2023, the assets under management (AUM) stood at Rs 7,23,988 crore as against Rs 6,53,902 crore in the previous year.

As at March 31, 2023, individual loans comprise 83 percent of the AUM. On an AUM basis, the growth in the individual loan book was 17%. The growth in the total loan book on an AUM basis was 11 percent.

“The inherent demand for home loans continues to remain strong. Growth in home loans was seen predominantly in the mid-income segment and high-end properties,” the company said.

HDFC is likely to post a 4.4 percent on-year growth in net profit for the March quarter to Rs 3,854 crore, according to a Moneycontrol average poll of three brokerage estimates, as against Rs 3,700 crore a year back.

HDFC, India’s largest housing finance company by market capitalisation, is seen reporting muted growth in the net profit for the quarter ended March due to a likely rise in provisions. However, the company is likely to see strong loan growth and healthy operational performance.

Net interest income (NII) is expected to rise nearly 5 percent on-year to Rs 4,752 crore, the average of estimates showed. The housing finance major is scheduled to release its earnings on May 4. The board might also consider dividends for existing shareholders in the meeting.

Brokerage Estimates

Kotak Institutional Equities expects HDFC to deliver 3.7 percent QoQ individual loan growth (16 percent YoY, 3.4-4 percent QoQ in the last three quarters), reflecting marginal weakness in retail disbursements. Overall, loan growth is lower at 11 percent due to slower growth in the non-individual segment. Core net interest margins (NIMs) will likely expand marginally (up 5 bps QoQ), reflecting recent rate hikes.

ICICI Direct expects HDFC to witness loan growth of 15 percent YoY to Rs 6,51,060 crore, led by healthy demand for home loans. Hence, growth in NII is seen at 15 percent YoY to Rs 5,024 crore. NIMs are likely to remain steady despite the competitive intensity. Provisions to decline marginally YoY at Rs 391 crore leading to standalone profit growth of 6.3 percent YoY (4.8 percent growth QoQ) to Rs 3,868 crore.

Motilal Oswal Securities expects healthy growth in HDFC’s asset under management (AUM) at 13 percent YoY. It estimates margins to remain largely stable sequentially. The pre-provision operating profit is set to grow 7 percent YoY, and credit cost is likely to be at 25 bps.

HDFC Ltd stock has given a return of 5.26 percent since the beginning of 2023, outperforming the benchmark Nifty50 index which has lost 0.59 percent of its value since the beginning of this year.

However, on a five-year basis, the Nifty50 index has given a return of 70.37 percent, outperforming the HDFC stock by a considerable margin. The HDFC stock has only given a return of 46.15 percent during the same period.

Housing Development Finance Corp., India’s largest mortgage financier, has picked Jefferies Financial Group Inc. to manage the sale of a unit that offers student loans, according to people familiar with the matter.

HDFC could seek a value of as much as $1 billion for HDFC Credila Financial Services Ltd. in a sale, which is part of the lender’s moves to comply with regulators’ requirements for its merger with HDFC Bank Ltd., the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Jefferies has started initial talks with interested bidders, and a formal process for the sale may be launched soon, they said.

The Reserve Bank of India has given the merged entity two years to cut its stake in fully-owned Credila to 10%, HDFC Bank said in an exchange filing last month. The sale mandate will be one of the biggest managed by Jefferies in the country and will help in its ambition to build a deal advisory business in the local market.

There is no decision on the valuation and time by which the sale will be completed, the people said. Spokespersons for HDFC and Jefferies declined to comment.

The 17-year-old HDFC Credila is India’s first dedicated education loan company, information available on its website shows. The privately-held company had assets of 142.3 billion rupees ($1.7 billion) as of Dec. 31, according to the website."

Eight of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 1,17,493.78 crore in market valuation in an overall weak trend in equities last week, with Infosys taking the biggest hit.

Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank were among the eight companies that suffered a decline in their valuation. ITC and State Bank of India were the only gainers.

Last week, the 30-share BSE Sensex fell by 775.94 points or 1.28 per cent.

The market valuation of Infosys plummeted by Rs 66,854.05 crore to Rs 5,09,215 crore. Infosys Ltd on April 13 reported lower-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter net profit and gave a weak 4-7 per cent revenue growth guidance for FY24 amid tightening of IT budgets by clients following turmoil in the US banking sector.

HDFC Bank's valuation tumbled Rs 10,880.5 crore to Rs 9,33,937.35 crore.

ICICI Bank lost Rs 10,462.77 crore from its valuation which stood at Rs 6,17,477.46 crore and the market capitalisation (mcap) of TCS tanked Rs 10,318.52 crore to Rs 11,56,863.98 crore.

The mcap of Hindustan Unilever declined by Rs 8,458.53 crore to Rs 5,86,927.90 crore and that of HDFC fell by Rs 5,172.27 crore to Rs 5,06,264.24 crore.

The country’s largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, recently said that it has received some clarifications from the banking regulator with respect to its proposed merger with the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC). These clarifications were given after the bank sought certain relaxations from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to make the process of merger smooth. The merger is expected to take effect by July this year.

A quick look at the clarifications shows HDFC Bank has received relief in certain major areas. The biggest relief is in relation to the priority sector lending (PSL) norms. Under the rules, a banking entity needs to lend 40 percent of the adjusted net bank credit to the so-called priority sector or economically weaker sections such as agriculture, micro-enterprises and other economically weaker sections.

If HDFC Bank (the combined entity) had to meet this on day 1 of the merger, it would have been a big jolt. But now, the RBI has clarified that HDFC Bank can calculate the adjusted net bank credit considering one-third of the outstanding loans of HDFC Limited as on the effective date of the amalgamation for the first year.

The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio of HDFC Limited can be considered over a period of the next two years equally, the RBI said. This means HDFC Bank will have around three years to comply with PSL norms. In fact, the PSL requirement kicks in only 12 months after the effective date of the merger, according to the bank.

In short, this will be a significant reduction in cost. The second big clarification is on the treatment of investments in subsidiaries. Investors were worried that the bank may be asked to cut stakes in key subsidiaries such as HDFC Life. Here, the RBI has clarified that investments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited are allowed to continue as investments of HDFC Bank.

The RBI has permitted HDFC Bank or HDFC Limited to increase the shareholding to more than 50 percent in HDFC Life Insurance Company and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company. This is another major good news for the bank and investors. HDFC, as on March 2023, already has 49 percent stake in HDFC Life.

The parent company had earlier held a majority stake in HDFC Life at 50.14 percent in September 2020. To comply with RBI guidelines of 50 percent limit, the stake was cut to 49.99 percent in December 2020, 49.88 in December 2021 and to 48.65 percent in March 2023. Logically, the bank can now hike the stake in HDFC Life to over 50 percent, which may happen eventually.

Further, the RBI has permitted HDFC Bank to continue holding HDFC’s stake in HDFC Education and Development Services Private Limited, engaged in operating three education schools, for a period of two years from the effective date and HDFC Credila Financial Services Limited, subject to the shareholding being brought down to 10 percent within two years from the effective date.

In simple terms, what this all means is that HDFC Bank, post its merger, will get close control of all subsidiaries much like its rival conglomerates like ICICI Bank. One of the major concerns of investors in the run-up to the merger was the likely treatment of subsidiaries. With the RBI clarification, that worry is gone.

The not-so-good part of the clarification is that all the mandatory reserve requirements such as CRR (cash reserve ratio), SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) and LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) will be set in on the first day of the merger. But, considering the larger reliefs on PSL and subsidiary treatment, this will likely be a lesser worry for the combined entity."

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed some regulatory relief to HDFC Bank ahead of its merger with HDFC, which is a positive for the stock, analysts said.

In a regulatory filing on April 21, HDFC Bank said the RBI has allowed calculating the Adjusted Net Bank Credit (for PSL) considering only one-third of the outstanding loans of HDFC as on the effective date of the amalgamation for the first year.

The remaining two-thirds shall be considered over the next two years equally.

“Assuming PSL requirements would kick in only in FY25, PSL cost would reduce from Rs 20 bn to Rs 5 bn implying a core PAT upgrade of 2 percent,” brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a note.

Domestic banks are required to lend 40 percent of their total disbursal to the priority sector, which includes agriculture, MSMEs, education, housing, export credit and advances to weaker sections.

“The HDFC Ltd portfolio will be allowed three years (in equal instalments), after the first year post merger, to become PSL compliant. This is against the earlier assumption of 18 months from effective date to be PSL compliant,” Dhananjay Sinha of Systematix Group told Moneycontrol.

Investments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited have been allowed to continue as investments of HDFC Bank.

The RBI has also allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC Limited to increase the shareholding in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO to more than 50 percent. “This certainly removes the overhang of RoE dilution due to stake sale. Also this would be a positive for HDFC Life,” the brokerage said.

Assuming the stake would increase to 51 percent, sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) impact would be Rs 3-4 on HDFC Bank’s target price of Rs 1,925, it noted.

The stock should see a positive reaction, it added.

“The RBI rule had originally mandated that the shareholding in the insurance subsidiary can be either above 50 percent or at 30 percent. With the current HDFC Ltd shareholding in HDFC Life at 48.65 percent, there was the overhang on HDFC Life shares of the possibility of selling from HDFC Ltd to become compliant with the extant regulations,” Sinha said, adding this removes a major overhang on HDFC Life shares.

No relaxation has been granted on CRR, SLR and LCR norms, which was the consensus view and HDFC Bank has also utilised the time from announcement of merger to plan for this eventuality, he added.

In a recent note, Prabhudas Lilladher assigned a buy rating on HDFC Bank with target price of Rs 1,925. Based on April 21’s closing price of Rs 1,673.80, this implies a potential upside of nearly 15 percent.

Termed as the biggest transaction in India’s corporate history, HDFC Bank on April 4 last year agreed to take over the biggest housing finance company in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan. The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC Limited to increase the shareholding in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO to more than 50 percent, the bank informed the stock exchanges on 21 April.

The bank said the apex bank has allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC Ltd to increase the shareholding to more than 50 percent in HDFC Life Insurance and HDFC ERGO General Insurance prior to the effective date of the merger.

“Investments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited are continued as investments of HDFC Bank,” said the bank.

This is part of the clarifications provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for the merger of HDFC and HDFC Ltd, according to the filing.

Also, the central bank has allowed HDFC Bank to calculate the adjusted net bank credit considering one-third of the outstanding loans of HDFC Limited as on the effective date of the merger for the first year, the bank said.

Further, the remaining two-thirds of the portfolio of HDFC Limited can be considered over a period of next two years equally, said the bank.

But how will this impact the merged company?

According to RBI regulations, 40 percent of a bank’s total lending portfolio should be towards PSL. Out of the 40 percent, 18 percent should be towards agriculture.

Given that RBI has allowed hdfc bank to spread over the PSL liability across three years, experts said that this a positive move for the bank as it will have time to work on the portfolio and divide it across three years.

""HDFC Bank will get about 3 years to completely comply with these norms. This is positive for the bank as it can divide its lending portfolio across three year"" said Aditya Shah, a financial and banking analyst.

Experts also said that since fulfilling the PSL requirement will take time, there could be a possible marginal profit growth.

""Assuming PSL requirements would kick in only in fiscal year (FY) 2024-25, PSL cost would reduce from Rs 20 billion to Rs 5 billion implying a core profit after tax (PAT) upgrade of 2 percent,"" said a banking analyst.

Increasing stake in subsidiary

The apex bank, in 2021, in its guidelines for non-banking financial companies (NBFC) and housing finance company (HFC) said that a HFC parent company cannot hold a stake of more than 50 percent in its life insurance subsidiary.

""The maximum equity contribution such an HFC can hold in the JV Company will normally be 50 percent of the paid-up capital of the insurance company,"" RBI said in the guideline.

HDFC Ltd, as of March 2023, holds 48.65 percent stake in HDFC Life, its life insurance subsidiary. The parent company held a majority stake in HDFC Life at 50.14 percent in September 2020. After RBI guidelines, it started reducing its stake in HDFC Life from 49.88 percent in December 2021 to 48.65 percent in March 2023.

Experts said that in line with the permission of increased holding in its subsidiaries by the RBI, now the merged company will have almost all subsidiaries within itself.

One could assume that the parent company’s stake in HDFC Life could increase to 51 percent. This could impact the stock price by Rs 3-4 on its trading price of around Rs1925,” said the bank analyst mentioned above.

""HDFC Bank can even increase its stake in HDFC Credila. It will have all the subsidiaries within itself just like its closest private sector competitor, ICICI Bank. The hangover for subsidiaries gets removed. A large part of the de-rating of HDFC Life was due to the uncertainty of the merger. This goes away now,"" Shah said.

The regulator also clarified that HDFC Bank shall continue to comply with extant requirements of CRR, SLR and LCR from the Effective Date without exceptions.

The merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Deepak Parekh, the chairman of the country’s leading mortgage company, had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.

A number of large corporations, including Kotak Bank, SBI, HUL, TCS, ICICI Pru, Tech Mahindra and HDFC, constituting a market cap of around $465 billion, or 21 percent of the Nifty weight and 17 percent of total FII holdings, are set to see a change in the corner office over the next 12 months.

Several large-cap companies such as HUL, TCS, Tech Mahindra, and ICICI Pru have announced changes in the rank of the chief executive offer (CEO) over the last few weeks. This makes a complete U-turn in the trend observed during the Covid period when too few transitions were recorded in the CEO rank.

Businesses are now dealing with a changed macro environment and geopolitical situations that make CEO changes more likely. Certain companies such as Reliance Industries have even started generational changes in leadership.

TCS leads the league of Nifty50 behemoths where the corner office sees change in occupants this year. While Krithivasan will take over as CEO and MD of TCS from June 1, HUL will have Rohit Jawa as the new CEO and MD by June 27.

Some corner offices will vacant this year because of the end of term of the reigning chief executives. Uday Kotak’s tenure as the MD and CEO of Kotak Bank will end by December 31 and Dinesh Khara’s term will be up for renewal at SBI in October. Whereas HDFC Limited will have a new CEO and MD in Sashidhar Jagdishan after the twins merge.

Assessing the Impact

Jefferies India stumbled upon surprising results as it picked up 72 CEO transitions to assess the impact of the change in the high chair. The 'zero date' was defined as one month prior to the actual announcement of the CEO change. According to the analysis, in 53 percent of the cases, the trend in the stock price did not change around the time of the transition.

In cases where there was a change, 68 percent of them were for the better, which means an underperforming stock became outperforming in six months, with a split between internal and external hires.

External hires seemed to have made a positive difference in the stock price trends in many cases. Among the 72 transitions analysed, less than 40 percent of large-caps replaced CEOs with external hires, while 55 percent of smaller-cap companies chose to hire externally.

Among sectors, it was found that the changes in CEOs triggered a disproportionate change in Staples where five out of seven saw a change in relative performance. In non-bank financials, it was eight out of 10, but practically none in consumer discretionary with only one out of 10.

The study suggests that CEO transitions do not necessarily require investors to re-look at their portfolios. However, it is important to note that this analysis only looked at the impact of CEO transitions over a six-month period from the 'zero date'. Over longer terms, other factors can influence stock performance and must be taken into account, Jefferies mentioned."

Global headwinds are likely to slow down India's GDP growth, but the country is more resilient than many large economies, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said on Saturday.

India has enough tailwinds with political stability, vaccine security, food security, a robust domestic consumption-based economy, digitisation initiatives and a robust regulatory system for the financial sector, Parekh said at SPJIMR's Centre for Family Business and Entrepreneurship (CFBE) event.

""India is not immune to the global shocks but has proved to be more resilient than many large economies. For sure, India's GDP growth will slow down because of global headwinds,"" he said. For startups, he said, ""many investors still have plenty of dry powder for good, innovative ideas, but the days of cash burn and high valuations are behind us"".

Entrepreneurship in India has exploded because of the conducive startup environment in the country and India has the third largest number of startups after the US and China, Parekh said.

""In the recent period, geopolitics has dominated over geoeconomics with spillover impacts on trade, services, technology, capital flows and even in the mobility of the labour force.

""There is immense distrust amongst countries at a time when we most need global cooperation to solve common pressing issues like global supply chains, global warming, cyber threats, money-laundering, data privacy, responsible use of artificial intelligence amongst several others,"" he said.

Parekh further said that the other critical global issue of the Western world has been the sudden change from years of quantitative easing and negative interest rates to a sharp rise in interest rates to combat inflation.

""This has resulted in a cost of living crisis across many advanced economies. In India, based on yesterday's (RBI policy) announcement, we are lucky to have finally got a pause in the rising interest rate cycle,"" he added.

Talking about the family business, Parekh said, the most significant change seen in family businesses today has been the investment in the education of the next generation.

""This is the single biggest game changer. Better education has helped bring in scale, vision, professionalism and diversification in businesses. Armed with better education, there is a deeper understanding of changing market realities, which helps family businesses stay relevant,"" he added.

Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, who also attended the event, said that the country needs education and research institutes that can guide and give appropriate vision to the youth.

""In order to make the country truly self-reliant, there is a need to develop and work on such technology that can help reduce imports,"" the minister added. Gadkari also urged young entrepreneurs to focus on rural and tribal areas, which have immense potential.

""The rural and tribal areas have enough raw materials that can be utilised to reduce imports through technology. I urge entrepreneurs to use such technology that will help in reducing our dependence on imports and also help in wealth and jobs creation,"" Gadkari added."

This will be done through multiple tranches, the company said in a release.

This is the second major fundraising announced by HDFC in the last two months. On February 26, HDFC raised Rs 25,000 crore through bonds at 7.97 percent coupon rate. It was the country's largest-ever bond issue.

HDFC-HDFC Bank merger is set to take effect by June-July after receiving the necessary approvals from various regulatory authorities. The merger was announced in April last year.

“Increase in the overall borrowing powers of the Corporation from Rs. 6.00 lakh crore to Rs. 6.50 lakh crore, outstanding at any point of time and recommended the same for approval of the Members of the Corporation by way of postal ballot,” the company said in the release.

The precious metal had ended at Rs 58,700 per 10 grams in the previous trade.

Silver also zoomed Rs 1,860 to Rs 69,340 per kilogramme.

“Spot gold prices in the Delhi markets traded at Rs 60,100 per 10 grams, up Rs 1,400 per 10 grams,” Saumil Gandhi, Senior Analyst – Commodities at HDFC Securities, said.

“Bullions continue surge, with gold on domestic front hitting a new lifetime high of over Rs 60,000, as a wave of banking crises shook global markets and put bullion on track for its biggest weekly rise in three years, while bets solidified for a less aggressive Fed in its fight against inflation,” Navneet Damani, Senior VP – Commodity Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.

Ravindra Rao, CMT, EPAT VP-Head Commodity Research, Kotak Securities Ltd said the western banking crisis upended global markets, taking domestic gold prices to a record high, to above Rs 60,000 per 10 grams.

“After rising more than 5 percent in the previous week, gold prices are up 1.5 percent on Monday, amid broad risk off sentiments as UBS-CS deal failed to calm investor nerves. US bonds reversed early losses and yields on two-year treasury notes fell more than 15 bps, to below 3.7 percent, the lowest since September 2022, signalling caution,” he said.

However, gold prices backed off from the key $2,000 mark in a volatile trade today as investors are assessing the health of the global banking sector even as increasing bets of a rate pause by the Federal Reserve have kept bullion near its one-year peak.

Spot gold was down 0.6% at $1,976.60 per ounce, as of 1318 GMT, while U.S. gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,983.20. Prices fell over one percent before climbing by the same amount to the metal's highest level since March 2022 at $2,009.59, just shy of a record set during the onset of the pandemic.

""Gold's volatility reflects that the market is digesting the recent shotgun wedding between Credit Suisse and UBS and the possible contagion,"" said independent analyst Ross Norman.

Prices have rallied more than $100 after the collapse of United States-based Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month, which ensnared 167-year-old lender Credit Suisse.

Gold is considered a safe-haven asset during times of financial uncertainty and lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding the non-yielding bullion, making it more attractive.

“Today’s rejection above $2000 may trigger some profit taking, but in our opinion not a change in direction,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note.

“We maintain a bullish outlook for gold, especially if the FOMC, driven by the current banking and liquidity crisis, is forced to change its focus away from fighting inflation to maintaining stability.”

This action is based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the company with its customers, the RBI said.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has cleared the way for the merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank, which is being billed to be the biggest merger in the history of Corporate India.

The country's largest housing finance company HDFC Ltd will merge with country's largest private lender HDFC Bank to create a banking behemoth.

HDFC Ltd had already received approval letters including from Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), PFRDA and Competition Commission of India (CCI) as well as from India's stock exchanges BSE and NSE.

Earlier, the tribunal had given its nod for holding a shareholders’ meeting for obtaining approval for the proposed merger.

Meanwhile, shares of HDFC Ltd and HDFC Bank were trading over 1.7 percent higher at Rs 2,575.95 and 1,578.20 apiece, respectively on BSE today during late trading hours.

""With the passage of time, the objective is to sell housing loans from more locations and branches of the bank,"" Mistry said.

The market, Mistry said, which currently has a penetration level of around 11 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), can reach up to 20 percent in the coming years.

In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Mistry, who is associated with the HDFC brand for nearly 42 years, also highlighted that there will be structural opportunities in housing finance as the sector has seen tremendous change.

“In the early 1980s, we were the only housing loan provider. Convincing people in the 80s that housing finance and loan would work was a major challenge. But now the sustained demand for housing loans has been strong,” Mistry said.

Post merger, there is a huge opportunity to the housing finance sector, Mistry said. and the post merger entity will provide a bigger platform for lending to the housing sector.

“Growth opportunity on loans will be a bigger opportunity in HDFC Bank than HDFC. Gradually, the objective is to expand housing loans from more and more branches of the bank,” Mistry said.

On regulatory requirements for lenders, Mistry said: “Regulator requires a 60 percent liquidity cover ratio (LCR). We have over 100 percent,” Mistry said.

LCR is a proportion of highly liquid assets which lenders keep aside to ensure enough funding during a period of uncertainty.

On the appointment of a head for the merged entity, Mistry said that an integration committee is working on the same.

“Mortgage head for the merged entity - It's still being worked out. We have an integration committee looking at this,” said Mistry.

HDFC on April 4 said its board has approved the merger of its wholly-owned subsidiaries HDFC Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited with HDFC Bank Limited. As part of the plan, HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger.

Mistry said the lower regulatory costs for the merger at this point was one of the key reasons that led to the timing of the merger.

“It is not the vanishing regulatory arbitrage that led to the merger. We have time and again looked at the merger but the regulatory cost was high (earlier). Advantage of the merger was always there. Over the last 7-8 years, regulatory cost has come down for merger and benefits of the merger became stronger,” Mistry said.

Earlier, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh had cited the vanishing regulatory arbitrage as one of the reasons that led to the merger.

“Every new RBI policy entailed tightening of regulations for NBFCs,” Parekh told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on January 27 . “So, the flexibility and the light-touch regulation that an NBFC enjoyed was fast disappearing, and rightly so, because a number of NBFCs had collapsed and some had even taken public deposits,” the veteran banker said.

HDFC and HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.

But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders. On its part, the RBI has been encouraging large NBFCs to convert into banks, after the shadow lending space was shaken by the IL&FS crisis in 2018.

Not to take any executive role in the bank

Mistry said he will not take any executive role in the bank but could look at joining the board.

“I will not take any executive role in the bank,” said Mistry in the interview.

Earlier, there were speculations that Mistry might take up an executive role in the merged entity.

Replying to a question on whether the company has identified the person to head the mortgage portfolio, Mistry said non decision has been taken so far. “It's still being worked out. We have an integration committee looking at this,” Mistry said.

In the interview, Mistry said the demand for housing loans is expected to remain strong gong ahead despite high interest rates environment. “There is a sustained demand for housing loans. The home loan penetration in India in the housing finance market is 11 percent. There is a huge growth potential and it will take time to reach 20 percent,” said Mistry."

Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd had made an offer to sanction a loan of Rs 400 crore to IL&FS as a lease rental discounting transaction.

In calendar year 2022, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) processed over 74 billion transactions worth Rs 125.94 trillion, while in 2021, the platform processed over 38 billion transactions worth Rs 71.54 trillion. That’s a growth of 90 percent in volume terms, and 76 percent in value, showed data from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).

India’s homegrown UPI is leapfrogging to create multiple use cases and there’s been a lot of buzz around its diversification in the last few weeks. Just a week ago, India kicked off its first cross-border real-time payment systems connectivity with UPI. Here’s an explainer of how UPI’s use cases have diversified and evolved in recent times:

UPI Lite

At the beginning of 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) launched the concept of UPI Lite with the aim of making easier the digital payments experience for users.

The feature allows users to initiate low-value transactions directly from a digital wallet without entering their UPI PIN. In 2023, Paytm was the firm payments firm to incorporate this feature option on its platform.

Enabled by the NPCI, the Lite option will help users carry out multiple small-value UPI transactions instantly and enhance their digital payments experience.

“The data available with NPCI shows that more than 50 percent of UPI transactions are below Rs 200. And for this, UPI Lite will be a great option, as it will be extremely fast compared to what we use now, and the chances of failure at the banks’ end are very low,” said an independent consultant on digital public infrastructure to Moneycontrol.

Users can add a maximum of Rs 2,000 to the UPI Lite wallet. The UPI Lite option helps users make payments even in an offline mode, but only if the wallet has money in it.

RuPay credit card on UPI

In order to boost credit card acceptance across merchants and businesses, NPCI in the first week of February announced the integration of RuPay credit cards with UPI. The two are linked to provide a seamless, digitally-enabled credit card lifecycle experience for customers.

“Customers will benefit from the ease and the increased opportunity to use their credit cards. Merchants will benefit from the increase in consumption by being part of the credit ecosystem with acceptance of credit cards using the asset lite QR codes,” said a statement released by NPCI.

“To enable this, customers should check the credit card accounts from the issuer bank based on thier registered mobile number and link it to the UPI ID on BHIM app or any UPI app” the statement added.

Post-linking the card, the customer will be able to make payments to merchants by scanning the UPI QR code on the card. Payment authentication will be done using the UPI PIN.

Banks that are presently live with this feature include HDFC Bank, Indian Bank, Punjab National Bank, and Union Bank of India.

Cross-border payments with UPI

For NPCI, cross-border payments are a part of its long-term vision. Banks and payment companies in several countries and regions have partnered with the international arm of NPCI to accept UPI payments. These include the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the UAE, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.

Many others have shown interest in adopting India’s UPI and integrating it with their payment solutions.

In a first-of-its-kind collaboration with another country, India and Singapore, on Tuesday, linked their respective online payments systems ― UPI of India and PayNow of Singapore ― for seamless cross-border transactions between the two countries.

One of the main challenges of sending remittances or cross-border payments is the high cost involved. Even the cheapest available provider charges 8.6 percent of the transfer amount (including all fees and exchange rates) as part of the total cost of an INR-SGD transfer.

""There are costs involved, such as currency exchange costs, intermediary charges, and regulatory costs. The cost of sending money across international borders remained high, at around 6.4 percent of the transaction amount on average in the first quarter of 2021,"" wrote Naveen Jaiswal, Partner IBM Global Consulting Solutions Leader for Industries in a LinkedIn post.

UPI One World for G20 guests

RBI’s Deputy Governor Rabi Sankar, along with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys and NPCI’s MD & CEO Dilip Asbe launched ‘UPI One World’ for foreign nationals visiting India during the G20 sessions.

Transcorp is the entity permitted by the RBI and NPCI to issue UPI One World to foreign nationals. It is the only entity with both Foreign Exchange (AD2) and Payments (PPI) licenses required to exchange currency, and thereafter issue UPI One World wallets.

Transcorp UPI One World wallets will initially be offered via the Transcorp-Cheq app to all G20 nationals and non-resident Indians (NRIs).

A simple KYC-based process, followed by mobile registration, will allow users to load money via international currency/cards and pay at any QR code in India using the ‘@trans’ handle which operates on the interoperable UPI 2.0 rails.

NRE accounts and UPI

NRIs from at least 10 countries are no allowed to make payments using UPI without an Indian mobile number. These countries are Singapore, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Oman, Qatar, USA, Saudi Arabia, UAE and the United Kingdom.

""To begin with, we shall be enabling transactions from mobile numbers having the country code of (10 nations)... and shall extend this to other country codes in the near future.,” said NPCI while launching the same.

UPI eMandate (Autopay)

NPCI launched the UPI AutoPay on 22 July 2020 for recurring payments using the UPI trail. This feature was introduced for the convenience of users.

Users can set automatic monthly payments for recurring use cases, such as systematic investment plans (SIP) for stocks and mutual funds, subscription charges, and auto ledger update, among others.

The autopay allows users to make recurring transactions of up to Rs 15,000 automatically through UPI apps, and up to Rs 1 lakh via authorisation on the due date.

Industry sources say that while this feature was introduced some time ago, it’s gaining prominence now. “We see a much younger generation using the feature for bill payments and SIP investments. This feature is hassle-free and secure,” said the co-founder of a payment solutions start-up.

To further enhance the feature for merchants, NPCI said that the mandate cannot be cancelled/revoked by the borrower (for lending), and auto-debits can be done for up to Rs 15,000 without a PIN.

UPI 123 for feature phones

In February 2022, NPCI and RBI jointly launched UPI 123Pay, wherein UPI can be used on feature phones, enabling payments to be made without a connection to the internet. The aim is to help people in rural areas who cannot afford a smartphone to participate in UPI transactions.

Here, users can access their bank accounts and perform routine transactions, such as receiving and transferring funds, paying for regular purchases, and bill payments, etc., by giving a missed call to the number displayed at the merchant outlet. The customer will receive an incoming call to authenticate the transaction by entering the UPI PIN.

During the launch, RBI Governor ShaktiKanta Das, said, ""This current decade will witness a transformative shift in the digital payments ecosystem in the country.”

Expectations from the upcoming UPI 3.0

While there are multiple use cases evolving from the UPI, there are more expectations from the UPI version 3.0.

“Interoperability of RBI’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) and UPI will be very interesting. It is expected to be linked even for the pilot version of CBDC,” said the independent consultant quoted above.

Experts also expect the next wave of innovation within UPI to have more to do with GST and other tax benefits to further accelerate adoption.

Apart from new features, NPCI should encourage more Third Party Apps (TPA) to integrate the native UPI payment within their apps for better experience and greater success, said Deepak Abbot, founder of Indiagold, a gold loan platform.

""The current process of approvals and audit makes it difficult for any app to take this path. Ease of integration will help in faster adoption and much more innovative use cases,” Abbot added.

While on the customer side there are proposals to introduce income tax benefits for digital payments, there are also recommendations for providing cashback incentives to merchants for the adoption of UPI QR."

After the complete deal and merger, existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the HDFC bank.

Nine of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 1,87,808.26 crore in market valuation last week, with HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries taking the biggest hit amid an overall weak trend in equities.

Last week, the BSE benchmark tumbled 1,538.64 points or 2.52 per cent amid concerns that the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates further to curb inflation. Fresh foreign fund outflows also dented investor sentiments.

Barring ITC, all 10 firms, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, ICICI Bank and Hindustan Unilever, were the laggards.

HDFC Bank's valuation declined by Rs 37,848.16 crore to Rs 8,86,070.99 crore at close on Friday.

The market valuation of Reliance Industries fell by Rs 36,567.46 crore to Rs 16,14,109.66 crore.

The valuation of TCS tumbled Rs 36,444.15 crore to Rs 12,44,095.76 crore and that of HDFC tanked Rs 20,871.15 crore to Rs 4,71,365.94 crore.

The market capitalisation (mcap) of ICICI Bank fell by Rs 15,765.56 crore to Rs 5,86,154.58 crore and that of Infosys declined by Rs 13,465.86 crore to Rs 6,52,862.70 crore.

Bharti Airtel's mcap dipped by Rs 10,729.2 crore to Rs 4,22,034.05 crore and that of State Bank of India went lower by Rs 8,879.98 crore to Rs 4,64,927.66 crore.

The valuation of Hindustan Unilever slipped Rs 7,236.74 crore to Rs 5,83,697.21 crore.

However, ITC added Rs 2,143.73 crore taking its mcap to Rs 4,77,910.85 crore.

Reliance Industries continued to retain the title of the most valued firm followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, ITC, HDFC, State Bank of India and Bharti Airtel.

Existing investors HDFC Bank and Pravega Ventures featured in this round of funding, whereas, other institutional investors, including White Whale Venture Fund also backed the company, as per a statement released on February 21.

Mintoak plans to deploy the raised capital to ramp up its tech stack and double down on the existing product portfolio.

It will also focus on strengthening its existing presence in India, while expanding into new markets including the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia.

Founded in 2017 by Raman Khanduja, Kabeer Jain, Rohit Ramana and Sanjay Nazareth, Mintoak is a SaaS platform for banks, enabling them to expand their payments proposition for merchants by integrating digital business solutions and leveraging the engagement to cross-sell and deliver financial products.

“Mintoak’s modular platform with pay-per-use pricing is white-labelled for each banking partner, which makes the entire proposition attractive to banks. I am thrilled to have some of the world’s most trusted brands place their faith in our product, team, and delivery,” said Khanduja, who is also the company's CEO apart from being its cofounder.

Mintoak has so far built a modularised, cloud-native and API-first payments platform that allows banks and merchant acquirers across India, Africa and Middle East to deploy and rapidly scale value added services, such as payments, lending, and engagement, to their small and medium enterprise (SME) customers.

The Mintoak platform claims to serve over 1.5 million merchants across leading banks in India, including HDFC Bank, SBI, and YES Bank, and in international markets such as Africa and the Middle East.

In December 2022, HDFC Bank acquired a 7.75 per cent stake in the fintech startup for Rs 31 crore. In 2020 the firm had raised $2 million in its pre-Series A round of fundraising led by Pravega Ventures, an early-stage venture capital fund.

“PayPal leverages technology to make financial services and commerce more convenient, affordable, and secure to millions of businesses,” said Ashish Aggarwal, Partner, PayPal Ventures.

“Similarly, Mintoak allows banks to offer a user-friendly, intuitive payments and commerce platform for merchants in developing nations through SaaS. We look forward to the next stage of Mintoak’s growth journey,” he added."

HDFC said it has raised Rs 25,000 crore of 10-year money by issuing non-convertible debenture (NCDs) carrying a coupon rate of 7.97 percent per annum. This translates to a spread of 49 basis points over Wednesday's closing of the 10-year government securities yield.

The issue was launched on Tuesday on the electronic book platform to raise Rs 5,000 crore with an option to retain subscription for an additional Rs 20,000 crore.

""Today, as the bids opened, there was wide participation from several high-quality investors across insurance companies, pension funds, provident funds, banks, and mutual funds. The issue was oversubscribed and received 92 bids amounting to Rs 27,863 crore, of which the company retained 55 investor bids totalling to Rs 25,000 crore,"" the issuer said.

National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and HDFC Bank on February 16 announced that HDFC Bank customers can now use their RuPay Credit Card on UPI with BHIM App and other UPI-enabled apps.

HDFC Bank RuPay Credit Cards will be linked to a UPI ID, thus directly enabling safe, and secure payment transactions, NPCI and HDFC said in a joint statement.

With this linkage, HDFC Bank is the first private sector bank in the country to go live on UPI with its RuPay Credit Card.

“As India’s largest card issuer, it is our constant endeavour to ensure that our customers are able to choose the option that best suits their changing needs.

HDFC Bank customers will benefit from the increased opportunity to use their credit cards on UPI, and merchants will benefit from the increase in consumption by being part of the credit ecosystem with the acceptance of credit cards using assets like QR codes.

“We believe linking RuPay Credit Card on UPI to be a game-changer for the ecosystem and will give impetus to the adoption of UPI across businesses with multiple use cases. It will provide a seamless, digitally-enabled credit card lifecycle experience to the customers and will enable consumers to make QR-based, e-commerce payments using the credit card on UPI which will fuel further economic growth,” said Praveena Rai, COO, NPCI."

Housing Development Finance Corp. priced its biggest ever rupee bond issuance ahead of a merger with its banking unit, which will create an Indian financial services behemoth valued at more than $200 billion.

India’s largest mortgage lender will raise 250 billion rupees ($3 billion) selling notes due in a decade at a coupon of 7.97% on Friday, according to people familiar with the matter. The proceeds will be used to support its housing finance business, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information.

HDFC is stepping up borrowing from notes because its merger with HDFC Bank Ltd. will make accessing the bond market more difficult. The merged entity will be classified as a bank, which means it can only raise funds through bonds either to meet capital requirements or for funding infrastructure projects.

HDFC was India’s top seller of rupee bonds last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The merger is expected to conclude next quarter, and will give HDFC access to so-called low-cost current and savings account deposits and time deposits of the bank that will let the financier continue expanding its assets, which stood at about 7 trillion rupees at the end of December.

Axis Bank Ltd., HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank Ltd. and ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. are the arrangers to the issuance, the people said."

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) expects to raise as much as Rs 25,000 crore through a sale of 10-year bonds on February 16, merchant bankers aware of the plan said. Bidding will take place from 9.30 am to 10.30 am on the BSE’s bidding platform.

This is the highest amount that HFDC plans to raise and comes ahead of its merger with HDFC Bank, one banker told Moneycontrol on February 15. One person said the base issue is for Rs 5,000 crore with an option to keep an additional Rs 20,000 crore.

Dealers said the mega bond issue ahead of the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger is intended to mop up funds and test investor appetite for such paper. This is because banks have limited options to raise funds such as mobilisation of deposits, issuances of certificates of deposit, and infrastructure bonds, one of the people said.

“It is to ensure that big investors don’t miss out,” said a merchant banker.

Market participants said if more investors bid for the issue, it will provide some premium on the coupon set on the bonds.

According to Prime Database, HDFC has raised Rs 53,415 crore through private placement of debt as of February 14, 2023. HDFC Bank has raised Rs 23,000 crore so far in the current financial year.

HDFC got in-principle approval from the National Stock Exchange of India and the BSE last year for the merger with HDFC Bank.

HDFC had already received approval letters from the Reserve Bank of India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, and the Competition Commission of India. It had earlier received no-objection certificates from both stock exchanges.

The National Company Law Tribunal had also given its nod for holding a shareholders' meeting to obtain approval for the proposed merger last year.

Other companies issuing bonds on February 16 are Power Grid Corporation of India, which plans to raise Rs 2,300 crore, and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, which plans to raise Rs 684 crore.

Companies prefer to issue bonds because it releases them from restrictions that come with bank-term loans.

Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (HDFC), which will be merged with HDFC Bank soon, has all 'Buy' ratings expect one, according to Moneycontrol's Analyst Tracker for January.

Nuvama Institutional Equities is the only firm with a 'Hold' rating on the stock. HDFC has total 26 calls on it and 25 of them are 'Buy' ratings.

The merger narrative will drive the stock price, as per Nuvama. ""Historically, entities that have merged have traded at a discount to the merger ratio,"" it explained in a report dated February 2.

The firm has a target price of Rs 2,700 based on 2x book value FY25E versus 2.2x FY24E earlier. Currently, the stock is trading at P/B multiple of 2.59x at Rs 2718.75.

Since HDFC is a key lender of housing finance, primarily focusing on retail housing, Nuvama Research believes that increased competition and slack in the mortgage market can lead to lower growth than the Street estimates.

Another key risk for the company is NPA (non performing asset) accretion due to increase in interest rates, it added.

Risks aside, the company reported a strong set of Q3 numbers on February 2, with a healthy 13 percent increase in its net profit. Net profit came in at Rs 3,690.80 crore for the December quarter, up from Rs 3,260.69 crore in the same quarter of the previous year.

The lender's net interest income also rose by 13 percent to Rs 4,840 crore for the December quarter from Rs 4,284 crore in the corresponding quarter of FY22.

The strong financial performance along with the company's thrust on affordable housing loans continues to keep analysts bullish on the stock. The consensus Street target price for the stock is Rs 3,096.38.

Meanwhile, the merger with HDFC Bank is expected to be completed by July 2023 for which the merger ratio is 42 shares of HDFC Bank (face value of Re 1 each) for 25 shares of HDFC Ltd​.

When 2023 came knocking, investors were ready for a pause in interest rate hikes, slow cooling off of inflation, decreased volatility in raw material prices and slightly better returns from equity markets. But things don’t always go as planned.

A report by Hindenburg Research, dated January 24, caused mayhem in Adani group stocks, most of them declining over 50 percent in a week’s time. The Nifty 50, which houses Adani Enterprises and Adani Ports, also fell 2.8 percent in that time.

Cautious investors sold shares as the report accused the group of “stock manipulation” and “accounting fraud”. On the flip side, analysts continued to remain positive on Adani Ports, which saw upgrades increase by 3.9 percent in January.

Of the 21 brokerages covering the stock now, it has 20 buy calls and 1 hold call. A month ago, 23 brokerages were covering the stock with 21 buy and 2 hold calls.

The company is on a journey to become India's largest integrated transport utility company by 2030. Though it has a considerable amount of debt (about Rs 42,500 crore as of FY22 end), the management has said that it is building a war chest for the acquisition Container Corporation of India (Concor).

According to foreign brokerage Jefferies, “Follow-ups to the National Logistics’ Policy (NLP), continuing GST (goods and services tax)-driven organised players’ share gain, Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) traffic increase and Concor privatisation should play out for the logistics sector in 2023.”

Its base case scenario for the stock is Rs 995 while the bull case target is Rs 1,330, as the company expands its market share from 14 percent in FY15 to 31 percent by FY25.

The stock got an upgrade from Kotak Institutional Equities to buy from add on January 26, with the target price unchanged at Rs 860 a share. “At its current 11.5x FY2024E EV/EBITDA, the stock provides comfort for any unforeseen risks that may arise over time."" Kotak said in its report.

Another big conglomerate, Reliance Industries, saw its price decrease 8.8 percent in January but upgrades increased by 5.16 percent. Windfall tax and a muted earnings show by the mainstay O2C (oil-to-chemicals) business remain a major overhang on the stock. But analysts believe the Street is not fully pricing in the prospects of Reliance’s retail business and new energy opportunities.

BOB Capital Markets upgraded the stock to a buy rating, raising the target price to Rs 2,840 from Rs 2,670. “We believe listing of the digital services and retail arms will be linked to the achievement of operational milestones that have been delayed by Covid-19. We upgrade as a 12 percent correction since November 2022 opens up an opportunity to enter the stock,” it noted.

Among contrarian downgrades over January, HCL Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Tech Mahindra rose 10.46 percent, 7.63 percent, 5.73 percent and 2 percent even as analysts’ pessimism trickled in. The stocks saw ‘buy on dips’ in the month after significant selling last year.

Meanwhile, buy calls are declining for IT stocks as managements have started flagging concerns in the European and US markets. For instance, Antique Stock Broking downgraded Tata Consultancy Services to hold after the third-quarter results, with the target cut to Rs 3,600 from Rs 3,700, citing macroeconomic uncertainties in the US that could pose a downside risk. “Q3 results offer limited reasons to change our cautious view on the sector,” noted most foreign brokerages.

Quarterly change

In quarterly calls, too, Adani Ports topped the list of contrarian upgrades. The other stock that gains prominence is Bajaj Finance. The NBFC stock has corrected 16.9 percent over the last three months, while its buy calls have gone up from 19 to 25. The correction has come on the back of slow growth in AUM (assets under management) and new loans.

But this correction has made the stock attractive for analysts. HDFC Securities upgraded it to Add in January, with a target price of Rs 6,700. “While our concerns on the quality of earnings from the new-to-franchise (NTF) customers and new products remain, the sharp 20 percent correction in the past few months appears at a disconnect from the franchise earnings potential,” the firm said.

Titan’s share price decreased 10.45 percent, but buy calls increased from 25 to 27 in the quarter gone by. The reason for the upgrades is similar to that of Bajaj Finance—a 17 percent correction from peak that has made valuations reasonable.

Analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher have recently upgraded the stock to buy and increased FY23/FY24/FY25 earnings per share estimates by 1.5 percent/2 percent/2 percent on the back of strong underlying demand trends across divisions and a correction from the peak.

In contrarian downgrades, apart from IT stocks, HDFC and Hero MotoCorp have made it to the list. The stocks have gained 7.2 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, in the last quarter while buy calls have tumbled.

Investors’ optimism on both the stocks largely arose from anticipated higher consumer spending during the festive season and the period after that, be it discretionary purchases like a two-wheeler or investing in real estate. However, that hasn’t played out according to the script with inflation burning a hole in Indians’ pockets.

Axis Securities downgraded Hero MotoCorp in November from buy to hold. “Rural demand momentum, maintaining a strong share in the entry-level segment and building a product portfolio in the premium segment will be the key challenges in our view for the company,” it said. The number of buy call on the stock has come down to 28 from 32 in the last quarter.

For HDFC, buy calls have come down from 27 to 25, but there are no sell calls on the stock. Nuvama Institutional Equities is the only brokerage with a hold call. “Merger narrative will drive stock price. Historically, entities that have merged have traded at a discount to the merger ratio,” as per Nuvama.

Yearly change

For the 12 months ended January 2023, the list of contrarian upgrades and downgrades were well-balanced.

Here, too, Adani Ports tops the contrarian upgrades list along with Bajaj Finance. Adani Enterprises, too, has seen upgrades but that is because it has gone from 1 hold to 1 buy and 1 hold call.

Then comes HDFC Life that has seen its price fall by 23.42 percent. From 29 buy, 10 hold and 1 sell calls, it now has 25 buy, 3 hold and 3 sell calls. Optically, it looks like an upgrade but the number of analysts covering the stock has also fallen.

Over the past year, HDFC Life’s acquisition of Exide Life was viewed as a positive trigger by the brokerage community. However, the Street did not like the fact that the deal was expensive.

Among recent triggers, taxation on high-value insurance policies that was announced in Budget 2023 has come as a rude shock for the stock.

Tata Motors is the next stock in the contrarian upgrades list with its price falling 11 percent but buy calls going up to 27 from 25. The company had been posting losses for the last seven quarters, but was back in the black in October-December 2022.

CLSA has upgraded its rating on the stock with a buy tag and target price of Rs 512 a share. It expects the Jaguar Land Rover division’s margin profile to improve led by volume growth, and for commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles (PV), business margin to improve on lower commodity costs and price hikes.

""Improvement in volume and margin profile to aid free cash generation in FY24,"" it said.

Apollo Hospitals saw its share price decrease by 9.4 percent but buy call went up to 25 from 23 over the past one year. While the stock fall came on the back of some profit-booking after the significant run-up during COVID-19 years, the upgrades were largely driven by optimism on the hospital chain’s execution.

UBS believes that Apollo Hospitals is executing well on new initiatives, growth and core segments, and that the market is not pricing in an early success of its digital strategy.

Among contrarian downgrades, Coal India stands out. The stock has gained 36.5 percent in the past one year while buy calls have come down to 16 from 21. Downgrades have trickled in as international coal prices are sliding and e-auction premiums are also expected to fall soon. The company’s revised annual wage bill at Rs 46,000 crore will also weigh on its financial performance, pointed out analysts.

JSW Steel and Bharti Airtel’s share price rose 8.5 percent each but buy calls reduced to 19 from 6 and to 27 from 31, respectively.

According to domestic research and broking firm Motilal Oswal, HDFC's core Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) grew 11 percent YoY to Rs 45.4 billion.

""Margin expanded sequentially with Q9 FY23 net interest margin (NIM) at 3.5 percent (v/s 3.4 percent in H1 FY23). Credit costs declined ~7bp QoQ to ~25bp, aided by minor improvement in asset quality. Disbursements in the Individual segment were slightly above Rs 400 billion in Q3 FY23. Individual/total asset under management (AUM) rose 19 percent/13 percent YoY, respectively, with Individual loans comprising ~83 percent of AUM,"" it said.

HDFC continues to have a strong ‘right to win’ in its standalone mortgage business. ""We maintain our buy rating on the stock, with a target of Rs 3,050 (premised on Sep’24E SoTP), an upside of 15 percent from the current market price,"" the brokerage firm said.

The research said HDFC's quarter is in line and NIM was flat. The brokerage added that individual loan growth was robust, shedding non-compliant loans. Core PPoP was largely in-line and asset quality improved. RBI dispensation and deposit mobilisation would be the key monitorable, it added.

The country's largest housing finance company reported a net profit of Rs 3,690.80 crore for the December quarter, up from Rs 3,260.69 crore in the same quarter of the previous year.

The lender's net interest income rose by 13 percent to Rs 4,840 crore for the December quarter from Rs 4,284 crore in the corresponding quarter of FY22.

Its total interest income rose to Rs 14,457 crore from Rs 11,055 crore in the year-ago period. Total revenue from operations was Rs 15,230.12 crore, up from Rs 11,783.60 crore in the year-ago period.

HDFC’s loan book grew by 13 percent year-on-year on an asset under management (AUM) basis. The individual loan book grew at a faster pace of 18 percent on an AUM basis.

Individual loan disbursements grew by 23 percent year-on-year for the December quarter. Disbursements slowed down during October and November but picked up in the month of December, HDFC vice chairman Keki Mistry said.

Retail loan growth moderated in the December quarter from around 20 percent in the previous quarter. Mistry attributed this to a temporary sentiment hit owing to a rise in loan rates but added that the underlying demand is still strong.

The lender saw its non-individual loan book shrink year-on-year to Rs 1.17 lakh crore. ""There is a reasonably good pipeline of construction finance loans, the disbursement is linked to progress of the project....so some these may get disbursed in the next year,"" Mistry said in a call with analysts after the results.

The average ticket size of home loans grew marginally for the December quarter. Around 10 percent of home loans approved during the quarter were from the economically weaker section, Mistry said.

The spread on loans over the cost of borrowings for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 was 2.29 percent. The spread on the individual loan book was 1.91 percent and on the nonindividual book was 3.69 percent.

The lender's asset quality remained steady and the share of gross bad loans dropped to 1.49 percent of the loan book from 2.32 percent a year ago. In the individual loan book, gross bad loans were just 0.86 percent, a fall from 1.44 percent a year before.

"January 27, 2023 01:39 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mc-interview-shrinking-regulatory-arbitrage-key-driver-for-hdfc-hdfc-bank-merger-says-deepak-parekh-9947411.html,"Deepak Parekh

The key driver for the merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (HDFC) and HDFC Bank Ltd was the shrinking arbitrage between Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and banks in terms of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations, says HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh.

“Every new RBI policy entailed tightening of regulations for NBFCs,” Parekh told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on January 27. “So, the flexibility and the light-touch regulation that an NBFC enjoyed was fast disappearing, and rightly so, because a number of NBFCs had collapsed and some had even taken public deposits,” the veteran banker said.

On April 4, 2022, HDFC, India’s largest mortgage lender, announced that it would merge with HDFC bank in a $40 billion deal.

“The overall process of merger till final NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) approval could take 7-8 months after the shareholders’ approval. We believe that the merger could be completed a few months ahead of schedule by one to two quarters,"" HDFC Bank’s chief financial officer (CFO) Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said after the announcement.

With the merger in place, HDFC Bank can eye a bigger and larger role within the banking sector and the economy as a whole.

The merger, which is expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2023, will give HDFC access to over Rs 16.7 trillion rupees in funds including low-cost current and savings account deposits and time deposits of the bank.

Parekh said the merger made sense before the full implementation of the RBI’s regulations on NBFCs. Once completed, the combined entity will emerge as a stronger organisation with a large customer base, Parekh said.

RBI regulations for NBFCs

Parekh highlighted that the merger was important before the completion of the full implementation of the RBI regulations for NBFCs.

""Banks have to maintain SLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio), CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio) and have priority-sector loan limits, which NBFCs do not have. But, NBFCs are now required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),” he said.

SLR is the minimum percentage of deposits that a commercial bank has to maintain in the form of liquid cash, gold, government bonds or other approved securities.

CRR is the share of a bank’s total deposits that is mandated by the RBI to be maintained with the central bank as reserves in the form of liquid cash.

LCR refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets held by financial institutions to ensure their ability to meet short-term obligations.

Further Parekh said the classification of NBFCs by RBI hinted at risk factors stemming from the large NBFCs, one of them being HDFC.

The RBI has put in place a process for classifying all NBFCs into three broad categories—the upper, middle, and base layers. The mandate is that upper-layer NBFCs include the large ones that can pose a systemic risk to the financial system, Parekh said.

“These NBFCs now have to follow bank-like regulations. So, in a way, it made sense to do the merger ahead of the full implementation of these new regulations,"" Parekh added.

A bigger opportunity for combined entity

Parekh said apart from the regulations, the scope of a bigger business opportunity also inspired the company to work on the merger.

Explaining this point, Parekh said the bank is a big player in retail credit, but its retail portfolio is a short-duration one of around 18 months. HDFC bank does not give mortgage loans because this is HDFC’s core business. With the merger happening, this issue can be addressed, Parekh said.

“Now, as a combined entity, the bank will get long-term mortgage loans which will increase the duration of the retail portfolio. Further, with a larger customer base, the bank will be able to do a lot more cross-selling of products."" the veteran banker said.

Inflation and rate hikes

To fight inflation, the RBI in the current rate hike cycle has increased the repo rate by 225 basis points. The repo rate is the rate at which RBI lends short-term funds to banks. One basis point is one- hundredth of a percentage point.

On how NBFCs guided the rate hike scenario, Parekh said: “We have to take care of so many, many moving parts and the RBI rightly articulated that it will rein in inflation, but would also keep in mind economic growth considerations.”

With inflation beginning to ease, Parekh said that central banks around the world have stopped their mega rate hikes.

“Even globally, with inflation beginning to ease a bit, I think the days of jumbo interest rate hikes by central banks are behind us now,” Parekh said."

At 78, Deepak Parekh may have given up alcohol, but there is one habit he still holds on to. When Moneycontrol caught up with the chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation at his sixth-floor office in HDFC House, Nariman Point, Parekh admitted that he flouted most rules of good health through most of his life, but lost his taste for alcohol after battling Covid-19.

“I can admit that I mostly flouted all the rules in life when it comes to good health. I ate everything and used to enjoy a drink almost every night,” the veteran banker confessed. “Then in December 2021, I got Covid and post that, I've just lost the fondness for any alcohol. Even with friends, they'll drink while I’ll just have nimbu paani.”

But there is one habit he has no plans of giving up. “The one thing I won’t give up is doing a Sudoku every night before I sleep,” said Deepak Parekh, adding that the logic puzzle keeps his mind sharp.

“I’ll work on the most challenging, hardest Sudokus I can get my hands on. That excites me and helps keep the mind sharp,” he told Moneycontrol.

Parekh stepped down as CEO of HDFC more than a decade ago, but it’s clear he likes to remain in the thick of things. In fact, he still comes to office for a few hours every day, mostly for meetings and to stay connected with what’s happening in the business world. The 78-year-old is still on the boards of HDFC Life, HDFC AMC and Siemens India.

His focus these days is on ensuring that the mega-merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank goes through smoothly. This could take a bit of time, given that it entails approvals from Indian and US authorities (HDFC offers American Depository Receipts, too).

He had said last year that once this is done, he is looking forward to “keep my feet up and relax”. By his own admission, though, his Sudoku-a-day routine is unlikely to change even after the merger is done and dusted."

Deepak Shantilal Parekh has an unfair advantage. The Gods are clearly on his side. On one wall in his office are about 60 small idols, including those of Lord Ganesha, Tara Devi, and Buddha, beaming their blessings from a shelf.

A dream merchant, the Chairman of the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) has helped nearly a crore Indians see their aspirations come to life in the form of a home they can call their own.

Parekh has also resolved many a knotty corporate crisis, including salvaging the Unit Trust of India and Satyam Computer when both floundered, and also been the go-to man for policymakers at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

He's wearing a purple shirt with white slacks and brown loafers, minus socks, when we meet in early January. His sixth-floor chairman's office at HDFC House in Nariman Point is supremely silent, a luxury in Mumbai's din and clatter. Parekh still comes to office for a few hours every day, mostly conducting meetings and staying connected to what's happening in the business world.

The veteran business leader is still on a handful of boards that include HDFC Life, HDFC AMC, and Siemens India. Nowadays, his focus is on ensuring that the mega-merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank goes through smoothly. It is the largest-ever corporate merger and the first time two Nifty-listed firms of such scale are coming together.

While he and his associates have contemplated the merger for around five years, the announcement was made only last April. ""The key driver was that the arbitrage between non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) and banks was shrinking. Every new RBI policy entailed tightening of regulations for NBFCs. So the flexibility and the light-touch regulation that an NBFC enjoyed was fast disappearing, and rightly so, because a number of NBFCs had collapsed and some of them had even taken public deposits,"" he says.

Naturally regulators were concerned and they reduced the arbitrage between NBFCs and banks. ""Banks have to maintain SLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio), CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio) and have priority-sector loan limits, which NBFCs do not have. But , NBFCs are now required to maintain a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). Further, the RBI has put in place a process for classifying all NBFCs into three broad categories—the upper, middle, and base layers. The mandate is that upper-layer NBFCs include the large ones which can pose a systemic risk to the financial system. These NBFCs now have to follow bank-like regulations. So, in a way, it made sense to do the merger ahead of the full implementation of these new regulations,"" he adds.

Parekh goes on to explain another driver for the merger from the Bank’s perspective. ""As you know, the Bank is a big player in retail credit, but their retail portfolio is a short duration one of around 18 months only. So every 18 months, the Bank has to replace these assets as well as show growth on a large base. HDFC Bank does not do mortgage loans as this is HDFC’s core business. Now, as a combined entity, the Bank will get long-term mortgage loans which will increase the duration of the retail portfolio. Further, with a larger customer base, the Bank will be able to do a lot more cross-selling of products.""

Internationally, too, if one sees the trend with banks in Australia, England, America, or Europe, the largest component in their retail portfolio is mortgages, which was the missing piece at HDFC Bank.

So is there a timeline for the merger’s execution?

The merger approval procedures have been moving as per envisaged timelines, Parekh says. ""We would like to see the merger process completed by the first quarter of the next financial year. Yet, timelines are difficult to estimate because there are regulatory procedures that entail court hearings and final decisions and approvals by Indian as well as US regulators, because HDFC Bank has a listed ADR (American Depositary Receipt). Merging the financials is another task because HDFC follows IndAS (Indian Accounting Standards), the Bank does its financials as per Indian GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), and for the ADR filings, the accounts need to be done as per US GAAP.""

Does that mean that there is more risk for the combined entity?

""Absolutely not. We will have a much larger balance sheet. We will have a larger appetite to offer loans. The Bank has always been very prudent in its operations. With the heft of a combined balance sheet, we should be able to fund long-gestation infrastructure projects as well.""***

Born in 1944, Parekh graduated from Mumbai’s Sydenham College and completed his chartered accountancy from the UK. He gave up his job at Chase Manhattan bank in New York City to join a new mortgage company in India started by his uncle, H.T. Parekh, in 1978. In fact, Parekh took a 50 percent salary cut to join HDFC, which sought to help the average Indian buy his own home.

Parekh has since been a part of the RN Malhotra committee on insurance reform, the M Narasimham committee on banking reform, and the taskforce set up by the Prime Minister's office on the infrastructure sector. In 2012, he was appointed Chairman of the high-level infrastructure finance committee. To give the country's infrastructure sector a boost, Parekh became the Founding Chairman of the Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC), which he stepped down from only in 2013, after 15 years.

Given Parekh's broader feel for the economy, how does he see India's significance in the global economy?

""I've been on record several times stating that I have never been as optimistic about India as I am today. The world is going through a tough time and there are headwinds that will impact us a little in India. But as a country, India seems to have more tailwinds. We have to seize this opportunity India has for the next couple of years because China's growth is slowing as is global growth, which is expected at just 2 percent, while India is expected to grow by at least 6.5 percent or more.""

What if banking rates harden?

""Rates have hardened, but I can't see India increasing rates by, say, 75 basis points (bps) at a time. The US did it four times before lowering it to a 50-bps-increase. In India, we have to take care of the lower-income categories, we have to take care of government borrowing, and be fiscally prudent. We have to take care of many, many moving parts, and the RBI has rightly articulated that while it will rein in inflation, it would also keep growth considerations in mind. That apart, even globally, with inflation beginning to ease a bit, I think the days of jumbo interest rate hikes by central banks are behind us now.""

Even so, Parekh does have concerns.

""I worry about the extent of layoffs happening globally, especially across the tech sector that anticipated a rapid future expansion. This did happen during the pandemic, but now IT spends are coming down, and as recessionary fears increase, companies tend to downsize to curtail costs.""

But India remains a bright spot.

“The World Bank, think tanks, and foreign investors are all saying that India is a bright spot. We are a bright spot because we have political stability. I have no doubt that the current regime, under (Prime Minister) Modi's leadership will come back in the next general elections, probably with a higher majority. This would mean the continuity of policies. Investors accord a high premium to political stability,"" Parekh explained.

Much of the world is suffering from a cost-of-living crisis due to a sharp escalation in food and energy prices, even as India continues to enjoy food security?

""Foodgrain production has been at record highs, we have adequate food for our people and we don't need to import food. We could have actually exported food when there was an acute international wheat shortage owing to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. But tactically, the Indian government was right to ban wheat exports. The government knew that if more wheat got channelled to the international markets owing to the higher prices that producers would receive, it could have led to wheat shortages in the domestic market. This in turn could have led to an increase in food prices in India. So, keeping the citizen’s needs first, this was the right strategy to pursue,"" Parekh added.

According to Parekh, another positive is that India has vaccine security. ""China's problem is they don't have proper vaccines, and on-the-ground reports suggest that the local Chinese vaccines may not have been too effective. Its zero-COVID strategy was also a failure. In comparison, India has vaccine security, food security, political security, and the country remains among the fastest growing major economies,"" Parekh said.

But experts say that there are steps that India needs to take to stay on that high-growth highway, and sustainably so.

Parekh concurred: ""To my mind, India now needs to increase its capital expenditure, both public and private. While the budget for public capex is likely to increase, I also see a turnaround in the private sector. For instance, given the increased demand for construction, companies are increasing capacities in cement and steel plants. Even auto sales have picked up and capacity expansion of auto and auto ancillaries are growing.

""The other big thrust of the government has been on clean energy and the production-linked incentive scheme in about 14 key strategic sectors. The policy thrust is in the right direction, and this is India’s opportunity to demonstrate that it can be an important high-end manufacturing hub. Global companies, too, are looking at India seriously as part of their China-plus-one strategy. Countries are recognising the importance of having dependable trading partners, and India has managed its external relations very well in the recent period.""

On a personal note: what are Parekh's hobbies?

""I can admit that I have mostly flouted all the rules in life when it comes to good health. I ate everything and used to enjoy a drink almost every night. Then in December 2021, I got COVID, and post that, I've just lost the fondness for any alcohol. Even with friends, they'll drink while I’ll just have nimbu paani,"" he says.

There are, of course, habits that he continues with. ""The one thing I won’t give up is doing a Sudoku every night before I sleep. I’ll work on the most challenging, hardest Sudokus I can get my hands on. That excites me and helps keep the mind sharp.""

That, along with everything else, may well be the secret for Parekh’s penchant for problem-solving."

India's Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC) will return to bond market after a gap of two months, three merchant bankers said on Friday.

The company plans to raise at least 30 billion rupees ($369.26 million) through bonds maturing in 10 years, they added. The housing financier is likely to invite the coupon bids from investors and bankers next week and is yet to make an official announcement of the issue on an electronic bidding platform.

The issue will also have a greenshoe option to retain an additional 20 billion rupees. The bonds, rated AAA by CRISIL, will have a put option at the end of the third year, one of the bankers said.

If you look at the Nifty’s move this year, from 17,600 to 15,300 to 18,800 and back to 17,900 ― investors bled money, made money and again lost some before closing the year. It was nothing short of a roller-coaster ride.

Many stocks made headlines but the ones that really left a mark were those that were picked up by the meme community. Be it a stunning rally or a disappointing decline, memes made some stocks eternal this year. Reddit, Twitter, and WhatsApp were all flooded by them and investors had a good laugh in a year marred by market volatility. Let’s take a look at some.

HDFC twins

On April 4, before the market opened, an announcement took everyone by surprise. A transformational merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank sent newsrooms into a scurry. It was not anticipated. There were hardly any whispers on such a deal brewing. “I am disappointed with media intelligence,” said Deepak Parekh as he addressed reporters in a press conference.

Nevertheless, the announcement gave enough fodder to memers who unleashed their creativity. As the merger is all set to create a $160-billion financial services behemoth, investors were quick to liken it to Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s popular dialogue from Gangs of Wasseypur – Kabhi kabhi lagta hai apun hi bhagwan hai.

Adani Enterprises

Akshay Kumar sported an eccentric polka dot shirt in Hera Pheri and claimed he can double your money in 25 days. That was a lie, but Adani Enterprises has certainly managed to do so in the span of one year. The stock began its 2022 climb at Rs 1,700 and is all set to end above Rs 3,700. A big trigger was its entry into the Nifty 50 index in September.

The flagship entity of Adani Group and its Chairperson Gautam Adani were in the limelight for many other reasons, as well. A cement deal which makes it the second-largest player in the space, a media deal which made heads turn, a blockbuster debut by the group’s FMCG arm, and a relentless rally that has propelled its promoter to Asia’s richest man ― it was certainly an eventful year for Adani Enterprises. Not to forget, a mind boggling 345x P/E valuation has also left many investors scratching their heads.

LIC

The public insurer’s listing on May 17 was the event of a lifetime. The government’s 3.5 percent stake sale in the 65-year-old institution made it India’s biggest ever initial public offering (IPO). It fetched close to Rs 21,000 crore. The issue price was set at Rs 949 apiece. Retail investors lapped up the shares, with their allotted quota subscribed 1.99 times. It was the perfect recipe for a grand success, but then… the dreadful happened!

The stock listed 8 percent below its issue price at Rs 872. Fingers were pointed at the Reserve Bank of India. Investors said RBI’s sudden interest rate hike soured the mood and caused the listing to be at a discount. For the meme world, LIC was Baahubali, RBI was Katappa.

Since its listing, the stock has gone only downwards. It is set to end the year near Rs 690 level.

ITC

No list is complete without the OG meme stock – ITC. Since May 2019, investors had been waiting patiently to see the stock touch the Rs 300 mark again. And it finally happened in July 2022. Just like its many businesses ― cigarettes, FMCG, hotels, paper, agri ― the variety of memes was a sight to behold. From a turtle on a treadmill to a galloping bull, ITC was likened to several animals.

It is the second-best-performing Nifty stock of the year, with a 52 percent gain. If we go by what brokerages say, the stock is all set to puff more gains in 2023. For instance, Antique Stock Broking has a Rs 419 target on the stock. One can only imagine the hysteria that will follow once ITC crosses the Rs 400 mark!

Zomato

Zomato’s lock-in period ended on July 25 and the stock crashed to a record low, triggering a meme fest on social media. The most iconic meme was one comparing Zomato’s share price to the price of one kg of tomato. Currently, it is trading way below its issue price of Rs 76.

Zomato sure has an edge as it operates in a duopolistic market, believe analysts. But, its $570-million acquisition of Blinkit resulting in greater cash burn has not gone down well with investors. The company still has some way to go before it can dish out profits. Till then, social media will serve you some great memes. Keep watching the space!

Do share your favourite stock memes of the year with us! And here’s to hoping that 2023 has another laugh riot in store for us."

The companies in separate statements on Friday said this loan will help close the urban housing gap and improve access to climate-smart affordable homes by boosting green housing, which will go some ways in supporting the country's shift towards a more sustainable growth path, creating jobs and ensuring long-term business growth.

HDFC said it has earmarked 75 per cent or USD 300 million of the IFC funding for financing green affordable housing units.

It is estimated that 275 million people in the country or 22 per cent of the over 1.4 billion population do not have access to adequate housing, and rural housing shortage is twice that of urban areas. As of 2018, the urban housing shortage was 29 million units, increasing by over 54 per cent since 2012.

""Given our long-standing partnership, we welcome IFC's expertise to help strengthen our green affordable housing lending portfolio. We are keen to increase our footprint in funding affordable and green housing and are committed towards supporting the nation's efforts for a sustainable and green, low-carbon economy,"" Renu Sud Karnad, managing director of HDFC, was quoted as saying in the statement.

This timely investment will help galvanize HDFC's efforts to cater to the underserved segments of the population, boosting economic resilience and supporting the government vision of housing for all, she added.

Residential housing accounts for around 24 per cent of the country's electricity consumption. According to climate commitments under the Paris agreement and at the climate change conference COP-27 at Sharm el-Sheikh, the green affordable housing sector is key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through lower household energy consumption and greener construction activities, among others.

With a growing need for affordable housing and a largely underpenetrated market, IFC's loan to HDFC underscores the fact that lending to the underserved populations is viable, said Hector Gomez Ang, regional director for South Asia at IFC.

Since 2010, IFC has lent over USD 1.7 billion to the domestic housing finance companies for on-lending to retail buyers and also to developers of affordable and green housing."

The revised rates would be effective from Tuesday.

The retail prime lending rate on housing loans, on which the adjustable rate home loans are benchmarked, has been increased by 35 basis points to 8.65 per cent onwards, effective December 20, the bank said in a regulatory filing.

HDFC has cumulatively increased its lending by 225 bps since May.

The repo rate currently stands at 6.25 per cent, the same as the pre-pandemic level.

HDFC said the new rate of 8.65 per cent will be available only for those borrowers with a credit score of 800 and above. This is the lowest rate in the industry, it added.

The lowest lending rate of SBI, which leads the market in home loan AUM with over Rs 6 lakh crore, is 8.75 per cent for those with a credit score of 750-plus. This rate is part of its ongoing festive offer that will last till January 31, 2023. The bank's normal rate is 8.90 per cent for those with credit score of 800 plus.

Similarly, ICICI Bank's festive offer rate begins at 8.75 per cent and has condition of 750 plus credit score. Its special rate ends on December 31. The bank's normal rate is 8.95 per cent onwards."

The bank wants to double the current pace of half a million new credit card issuances every month, according to Parag Rao, country head for payments business, consumer finance, digital banking and marketing. The firm will announce partnerships across a range of industries from online retail to food delivery in the coming weeks to increase spending on cards, Rao said.

The recovery for HDFC Bank has been swift since the eight-month long card ban was lifted in August last year, with the lender seeking to move past the punishment for repeated online glitches that hurt its customers. Reserve Bank of India data showed that the bank captured 29% of India’s overall spending on credit cards in October, the highest among its competitors.

“We focus not only on the issuance of cards which is a distribution game, but on deep engagement, ensuring customers find more value in their cards, and keep spending,” Rao said in an interview.

The partnerships in the next few weeks also include two airlines and a large hotel chain, according to Rao. HDFC Bank is in the final stages of developing a new digital credit card to pull in younger customers, he added.

Banks in the world’s second most populated country are poised to benefit from the growth in online shopping where customers use their credit cards for purchases. Between 200 million and 300 million Indians are expected to spend $50 billion on online retail this year, according to a Bain & Co Inc. report.

Part of the push at HDFC Bank will be tied to its merger with Housing Development Finance Corp., which will give it access to the mortgage lender’s customers, Rao said. The two firms agreed to combine this year in one of the biggest global deals to ride a boom in home loans and consumer spending in India.

Beyond partnerships, the bank also wants to attract more customers who use credit cards from India’s local retail payment system known as RuPay, according to Rao. He sees recent rules that allow the linkage of RuPay credit cards to the widely used government-backed payment interface expanding the market for these cards.

“The credit lines for such customers will be small but these will be customers of the future, who can upgrade to other cards as they evolve,” Rao said.

And while peers are offering rewards on a slew of products to gain customers, HDFC Bank is avoiding this strategy.

“We never have had the best discounts in the market nor do we want to be known as the card with the most discounts,” Rao said."

India’s biggest merger ever will likely take away from the rupee bond market one of its top issuers, an absence that may weigh on debt sales and arrangement fees for banks.

The consolidation of Housing Development Finance Corp. and unit HDFC Bank Ltd. will create a more than $200 billion financial services behemoth, and the parent will be able to tap the bank’s deposits to grow, rather than pile on more debt. That’s not all bad for India’s bond world as the hole created by the shadow lender may let new borrowers sell notes, helping India deepen its debt market.

The shadow lender is India’s biggest bond seller in 2022, with its issuance accounting for 7.7% of the country’s total issuance volume this year, higher than an average of about 6% in the last 10 years, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The merged entity will be a bank and is still likely to offer notes when needed to boost its capital buffers and fund infrastructure projects.

“HDFC’s exit will initially hurt overall sales volume next year,” said Jayen Shah, founder of Mavuca Capital Advisors Pvt., a fintech investment banking firm. “I expect a lot of first-time issuers, state and private companies tapping the bond market next year as yields stabilize, which may then gradually fill the void.”

The merger, expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2023, will give HDFC access to 16.7 trillion rupees ($202 billion) of funds comprising so-called low-cost current and savings account deposits and time deposits of the bank. That will let it continue expanding its assets, which stood at 6.9 trillion rupees at the end of September.

The exit of a debt issuer of that size risks hurting the fee income of bankers who have arranged HDFC’s various offerings. In the last few years, Axis Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. have overseen most of those sales, Bloomberg-compiled data show.

For HDFC’s competitors, though, the firm’s exit may be a positive in fundraising terms. “The departure of HDFC from the bond market would benefit its peers as it will give them access to a larger pool of credit,” Mavuca’s Shah said. “That in turn will cut funding costs of other top-rated housing finance companies.”"
"December 05, 2022 09:41 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/lic-raises-stake-in-hdfc-ltd-to-over-5-9654461.html,"Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the country's largest insurer, has increased its stake in HDFC Ltd to over 5 per cent following the acquisition of shares from the open market.

LIC purchased 1.2 lakh shares from the open market hiking its stake in the company to 5.003 per cent, mortgage lender HDFC Ltd said in a regulatory filing on Monday.

LIC in a separate filing said the holding increased from 4.991 per cent to 5.003 per cent, an increase of 0.012 per cent at an average cost of Rs 2,673.84 per unit. The insurer made the purchase on December 2, 2022, it added. LIC purchased additional shares at a total cost of about Rs 57.2 crore.

Shares of the HDFC closed at Rs 2,674.95, up by 0.35 per cent on the BSE. Before the acquisition, LIC held over 9.09 crore shares representing 4.991 per cent stake in the company.

Earlier in April, HDFC Ltd decided to merge with its banking subsidiary HDFC Bank. Touted as the biggest transaction in India's corporate history, HDFC Bank on April 4 agreed to take over the biggest domestic mortgage lender in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan.

The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore. The merger is expected to be completed by the second or third quarter of FY24, subject to regulatory approvals.

Once the deal is effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 per cent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 per cent of the bank."

HDFC Bank expects to amalgamate its home loan major parent HDFC into itself by September next year, a top official said on Friday.

Both HDFC and HDFC Bank held general meetings on Friday to seek shareholder approvals for what is billed as the largest merger in Indian corporate history at over USD 40 billion.

At the time of announcing the merger on April 4 this year, the entities had said the merger will take 12-18 months.

""We believe going by the past practice and going by past trends, it will take about 8-10 months time before an effective date is announced,"" HDFC Bank's chief executive and managing director Sashidharan Jagdishan said at the meeting.

The merger will help expand the capital adequacy ratio of the merged entity by 0.20-0.30 per cent, courtesy the healthy capital adequacy of HDFC Ltd, he added.

Given the fact that bank deposits have to comply with mandatory cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio requirements, many shareholders at both meetings showed keenness to understand if the regulator will be offering some forbearance for the merged entity on this aspect.

In the HDFC meeting, its chairman Deepak Parekh said HDFC Bank is engaged with the Reserve Bank of India on the same but asked the shareholders to not worry.

""In case, the forbearances are not forthcoming, the merged entity is expected to have sufficient liquidity and alternatives available to meet the necessary funding requirements,"" Parekh said.

HDFC Bank's chairman Atanu Chakraborty said all of HDFC's subsidiaries will become subsidiaries of the merged entity, but there are some which cannot be a part of the bank and will be divested.

It will be seeking approvals from the RBI and insurance watchdog Irdai (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) for the merger of the subsidiaries, he said.

On the issue of board composition of the merged entity, Chakraborty said HDFC Bank will absorb some of the members of HDFC's board subject to requirements laid down under the Banking Regulation (BR) Act, Companies Act and other statutes, and added that age, tenure and area of expertise are looked at by the BR Act.

Parekh made it clear to HDFC shareholders that he will not be joining the HDFC Bank board given the age mandate and added that Chakraborty will continue as the chairman of HDFC Bank.

Chakraborty said HDFC's Renu Karnad will continue to be on the board of the bank as her appointment is for a period extending beyond the merger and the company secretary will also be joining the bank's management team.

Jagdishan said that over 3,500 employees of HDFC will be joining the 1.61 lakh-strong staff of the bank, and almost all of the 508 branches of HDFC will also get merged barring a few ones, which are in close proximity to an existing HDFC Bank branch, which will have to rationalise.

The bank has also sought regulatory approvals for transferring the fixed deposits of HDFC into the merged entity, and will pay interest as per the commitments, Jagdishan said.

Both meetings were chaired by NCLT-appointed Gautam Doshi, who said a copy of the voting result will be informed to the National Company Law Tribunal by Saturday evening."

The NSE Indices, a subsidiary of the National Stock Exchange, on November 18 announced changes in its methodology of Nifty equity indices for mergers after receiving feedback from market participants.

The revised changes will be applicable to the index constituent (index company or transferor) that merges with another company.

As per the proposed changes, ""the index company will be excluded from the index on the ex-date of merger which is closing of T-1 day,"" the NSE Indices said in its release. The exchange has made ex-date an important factor.

These changes will be applicable to all corporate actions involving mergers with an immediate effect.

Media reports indicated that these changes may be taking place ahead of the proposed merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank, to avoid sharp price movements of these stocks.

Transferor Company

In the case of indices which have a fixed number of constituents (stocks), the NSE Indices said on ex-date, a replacement of company would be made based on the eligibility criteria of respective indices in place of the transferor company which is being excluded.

In the indices with a variable number of constituents, NSE Indices will not replace any stock, on ex-date, in place of the transferor company which is being excluded.

The announcement of these changes would be made a minimum of three working days in advance for the change in the constituents of indices, including the indices on which Futures and Options are traded at NSE. Earlier the announcement was made four weeks prior to the index reconstitution date.

As per earlier or existing rules, in the case of indices with a fixed number of constituents, the transferor company is excluded from the index and the same is replaced with another eligible stock soon after the equity shareholders’ approval of a scheme of arrangement for the merger of a company.

In the case of a variable number of constituents, the transferor company is excluded from the index soon after the equity shareholders’ approval of a scheme of arrangement for the merger of a company without making a replacement in the index.

If we take ‘A’ company and ‘B’ company just as an example – ‘A’ company is the transferor and ‘B’ company is the merged entity.

Merged Entity

In the case of the merged entity, as per the revised rules, NSE indices said equity shares, the investible weight factor of the merged entity would be updated based on the terms of the merger on the ex-date (closing of T-1 day) of the merger.

Earlier, there were alternate methodologies. If the equity shares of the merged entity allotted to the shareholders of the transferor company (post-merger) account for more than or equal to five percent of the current equity of the merged entity, then these shares are updated for calculation of market capitalistion with effect from the last trading day (T Day) of the calendar month of listing of these shares.

Or if equity shares of the merged entity allotted to the shareholders of the transferor company (post-merger) account for less than 5 percent of the current equity of the merged entity, then these shares are updated for calculation of market capitalisation with effect from the last trading day of the corresponding calendar quarter (March, June, September and December).

In October, the NSE Indices had floated a consultation paper to seek changes in the methodology of merger and demerger of index constituents for equity indices to avoid big churnings, which take place in the current system.

The changes in the methodology of the demerger will be announced later.

""As responses on market consultation related to the treatment of demerger in Nifty equity indices require further deliberations with various stakeholders, changes related to the treatment of demerger shall be announced in due course,"" the NSE indices said.

""As expected, the modified methodology evades HDFC Ltd's immediate exclusion from Nifty 50. The stock will only get replaced by another contender on the ex-date (T Day) of the HDFC- HDFC Bank merger,"" said Abhilash Pagaria, Head - Alternative & Quantitative Research, Nuvama Wealth Management.

In the best case scenario, Nuvama expects the merger to get completed around April-May 2023."

The market recouped not only all its previous two-day losses in a single day but also climbed further to hit the highest level of the current year as bulls returned in full throttle on Friday. The rally in global peers after a falling US inflation, raising hopes for less hawkish rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, and a fall in the US dollar index lifted the market sentiment.

The BSE Sensex jumped nearly 1,200 points to 61,795, while the Nifty50 rallied more than 300 points to 18,350 and formed bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts.

The further drop in volatility also raised confidence among traders. India VIX, the fear index fell by 7.5 percent to 14.41 levels.

But the mood was quiet in broader markets, as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 0.07 percent and 0.38 percent respectively.

Stocks that were in action included Zomato, which surged nearly 14 percent to Rs 72.8, forming robust bullish candle on the daily charts with healthy volumes. Also the stock has broken long horizontal resistance trendine adjoining several highs.

Swan Energy shares also saw huge buying interest on last Friday, climbing nearly 13 percent to Rs 244 and formed long bullish candle on the daily charts with large volumes. It has broken long downward sloping resistance trend line adjoining May 4 and November 1 this year.

HDFC was the biggest gainer in the Nifty50, rising 6 percent to Rs 2,651.70 and formed robust bullish candle on the daily charts with high volumes after consolidation for several sessions. Also it has given a healthy breakout of long downward sloping resistance trend line adjoining November 15, 2021 and November 9, 2022.

Here's what Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:.

Zomato

This breakout is accompanied with huge volumes representing increased participation. This buying momentum was observed from its 20, 50 and 100 day SMA (simple moving average) support zone.

The daily and weekly strength indicator RSI (relative strength index) is in positive terrain which indicates rising strength. The daily ""Band Bollonger"" buy signal indicates increased momentum.

HDFC

Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (HDFC) on Saturday said its life insurance arm has received nod from the pension fund regulator PFRDA for change in shareholding ahead of the merger between HDFC and subsidiary HDFC Bank.

PFRDA vide its letter dated November 11, 2022 to HDFC Life, has granted its approval for proposed change in shareholding of HDFC Life, sponsor company of HDFC Pension due to proposed amalgamation i.e. change in promoter from HDFC Limited to HDFC Bank, it said in a regulatory filing.

The amalgamation scheme remains subject to various statutory and regulatory approvals, including from the NCLT and the respective shareholders of the companies involved, it said.

In a separate filing, HDFC Life informed exchanges about the approval granted to the company by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) on the merger scheme shareholding changes."

Strong growth trends in the current fiscal year will help accelerate the journey of CSB Bank from a small bank to a mid-sector one as envisaged in its Vision 2030 roadmap, according to Pralay Mondal, the new MD and CEO of the bank.

The bank grew 24 percent year-on-year in the last two quarters, higher than the banking industry average of over 16%.

“The growth was 9 percent last year. Our aim is to grow faster than the industry and for that we need to grow around 20%. So far, we are on track,’’ he said.

Also Read: CSB Bank – Why is the stock not shining despite the glitter of gold loans?

Mondal is not a new face in the bank. He joined as president of retail, Small and Medium Enterprises, technology and operations two years ago and became the deputy managing director and interim MD early this year. So, he is quite conversant with the progress of the bank in the new phase.

After the Fairfax group took a majority stake in the Thrissur, Kerala-based bank four years ago, it has been trying to spread its wings. The bank, formerly known as Catholic Syrian Bank, still has around 50% of its branches and operations in Kerala.

Expanding beyond Kerala

“We will remain focused in Kerala where the 100-year-old bank has loyal customers. But at the same time, we are looking to expand beyond the state,’’ Mondal told Moneycontrol.

The bank has a good presence in the southern states, which it is keen to develop further. A large share of 100 branches it is planning to open in FY23 will be in these states.

“After that our focus will be Maharashtra, Gujarat and a little bit in Delhi and Punjab,’’ Mondal said.

He reckons that the bank needs more branches and a wider customer base as it prepares to launch more products.

“Just increasing assets is not enough; we need liabilities too for funding. While western regions of the country are the wealth market, the northern parts are good from the liability side,’’ he said.

He expects these branches to boost the bank’s non-treasury income. Currently, the bank’s ratio of core fee to total income is lower than the banking industry average.

Counting on gold loans

The bank has not done well in mobilising more from insurance, wealth and commission fees while the income from treasury operations and Priority sector lending certificates (PSLCs) has dropped.

Admittedly, gold loans that currently account for 43% of the overall asset mix, will remain as one of the strong points of the bank.

“It grew by 47 percent in the last quarter. But it will be difficult to maintain that growth since it is against a low base last year. But we expect the gold loan growth to be between 40-45 percent for next one year at least,’’ Mondal said.

Kerala and Tamil Nadu are leading this business for the bank with strong support from other southern states. Mondal recognises the need to have multiple products to attract more customers.

“For instance, to strengthen Current and Savings Accounts (CASA), we need customers to have accounts with us. That will happen only when they have EMI (equated monthly instalment), vehicle loan payments etc,’’ he said.

Loan products, credit cards

The bank had several loan products earlier which it will be relaunching under a centralised process. On the anvil are vehicle loans, including for commercial vehicles, and loans for commercial equipment.

The bank is gearing up to introduce credit cards in a month with a partner. As for housing loans, the bank will cater to those seeking premium facilities through a tie-up with Housing Development and Finance Corp (HDFC) Ltd and will directly service the medium-range housing segment needs.

The small size of the balance sheet of the bank prevents it from having a say in large corporate loans but it expects to target emerging corporate entities, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and mid-market companies.

The bank hope to do better in Non-Resident Indian (NRI) deposits with half its branches in Kerala.

“At present it is around 23% of our total deposits. In the last one year, with NRIs having better options outside India, the inward remittances and NRI deposits have not grown much. But I think it will change in another year,’’ he said.

Deposit rates, credit growth

Mondal is firm on keeping deposit rates at a sustainable level as he believes higher rates will attract rate-sensitive customers who may not stay with the bank in the long run.

Overall credit growth in the industry has been 16 to 17%, triggered mainly by the buoyancy in retail and SME sectors. But to reach the pre-pandemic levels, corporate credit should look up.

“We are already seeing signs of this with corporates starting to look at capex and more investment,’’ he said adding that credit growth touched 18-19% in October. The bank has a build, sustain and scale strategy under Vision 2030.

“We want to sustain our current businesses like gold loans, build technology, processes and products for the future and then scale up the activities post-2027 to grow bigger,” Mondal said."

live bse live

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

After the completion of HDFC and HDFC Bank's union, the weight of the merged entity could be double that of HDFC Limited in MSCI, according to a sales note by global financial services group Macquarie.

HDFC is part of MSCI indices whereas HDFC Bank is not. MSCI requires the proportion of shares available to foreign investors relative to the maximum allowed to be at least 15 percent and HDFC Bank fails to meet this criterion.

Despite the heavy FII selling earlier this year, HDFC Bank's ""foreign room"" as of September end stood at 11 percent, as per Macquarie.

So, what has changed?

MSCI's new rule says, ""When there is a corporate event affecting index constituents, non-index constituents that are involved in the event are considered for immediate inclusion in the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes.""

The non-index constituent will be treated as a continuation of index constituents, it added. This means that HDFC Bank, which is a non-index constituent, will be treated as an extension of HDFC Limited.

How this removes the technical overhang

The merged entity has a foreign room of 17.3 percent as of September-end, which is above MSCI's 15 percent threshold, but another key technical overhang was the 0.5x adjustment factor.

""If a security's foreign room is less than 25 percent and equal to or higher than 15 percent, MSCI will use an adjustment factor of 0.5 to reflect the actual level of foreign room,"" according to the firm's website.

As per Macquarie's calculations, the adjustment factor of 0.5x would have resulted in free float-adjusted market capitalization of $63.1 billion.

But now since HDFC Bank will be considered an extension of HDFC Limited, the adjustment factor applicable will be 1x and not 0.5x. This implies free float-adjusted market capitalisation of $126.3 billion for the merged entity.

This is more than twice of HDFC Limited's current free float-adjusted market capitalisation of $55.9 billion, said the Macquarie note.

How does the weight go up?

Free float-adjusted market capitalisation is used to derive the weight of the stock in the index. Thus, HDFC Limited's 5.78 percent weight in MSCI could now go up to 13 percent of the merged entity.

Anjali Sinha, who has penned the Macquarie note, concludes, ""My understanding is that post the merger, HDFC Ltd stock is replaced by HDFC Bank and the weight goes up. It's time to load up.""

At 2.30 pm, both the stocks were trading 6 higher in trade and were the top index gainers. HDFC was quoting at Rs 2,661 on the National Stock Exchange and HDFC Bank was trading at Rs 1,617.

Reliance Industries, the country's largest company by revenues, profits and market value, is India's best employer and the world's 20th best firm to work with, according to Forbes' World's Best Employers rankings 2022.

The global ranking was topped by South Korean giant Samsung Electronics, followed by US giants Microsoft, IBM, Alphabet and Apple.

US companies occupy rankings from 2nd to 12th , followed by German automaker BMW Group at 13th. The world's largest online retailer Amazon is ranked 14th in the list and French giant Decathlon is at 15th rank.

Oil-to-telecom-to-retail conglomerate Reliance, with 2,30,000 employees, is ranked 20th - the highest ranked Indian firm. It is ranked above Mercedes-Benz of Germany, US beverage maker Coca-Cola, Japanese auto giants Honda and Yamaha, and Saudi Aramco.

There is no Indian company other than Reliance in the top 100. HDFC Bank is ranked 137th. Bajaj (173rd), Aditya Birla Group (240th), Hero Motocorp (333rd), Larsen & Toubro (354th), ICICI Bank (365th), HCL Technologies (455th), State Bank of India (499th), Adani Enterprises (547th) and Infosys (668th) are the other companies on the list.

Against this backdrop, Forbes has compiled its sixth annual World's Best Employers.

Forbes said it partnered with market research company Statista to compile the ranking by surveying 1,50,000 full-time and part-time workers from 57 countries working for multinational companies and institutions to determine which ones excel in corporate impact and image, talent development, gender equality and social responsibility.

""Participants were asked to rate their willingness to recommend their employers to friends and family and to evaluate other employers in their respective industries that stood out either positively or negatively. This year's list comprises 800 companies that received the highest scores,"" it said.

Companies were rated on aspects such as image, economic footprint, talent development, gender equality and social responsibility.

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC

HDFC reported a PAT of INR44.5b in 2QFY23 (5% beat), up 18% YoY, primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate of ~18% (because of higher dividend income). Core PPOP grew 15% YoY to INR43.8b. Margin was stable QoQ at 3.4% in 1HFY23. Credit costs fell by ~4bp QoQ to ~32bp, aided by a decline of ~20bp in GS3 and resolutions in the nonIndividual segment. Disbursements in the Individual segment grew 36% YoY to INR440b. Individual/total AUM rose 20%/16% YoY, with Individual loans comprising ~81% of AUM. The management said it has a healthy pipeline in Construction Finance (CF) and LRD, and expects growth in the NonIndividual segment to accelerate in subsequent quarters. With the merger announced, taking a view in isolation is difficult.

Outlook

However, we feel that HDFC continues to have a strong ‘right to win’ in its standalone Mortgage business. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a TP of INR2,900 (premised on Mar’24E SoTP).

"November 04, 2022 08:07 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rbi-encouraged-us-to-go-for-hdfc-hdfc-bank-merger-says-deepak-parekh-9452931.html,"Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC (File image)

The Reserve Bank of India encouraged Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and HDFC Bank to go for a merger in anticipation of stringent guidelines to regulate large non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), Deepak Parekh, the Chairman of the mortgage lender said.

“We knew that the Reserve Bank of India was coming out with new guidelines for large NBFCs. Half a dozen companies collapsed in the last 3-4 years — big ones,” Parekh said at an event in Kolkata earlier this week.

“… we knew that they (guidelines) were going to be announced, and they (RBI) encouraged us that it is better if we merge because they are bringing bank-like considerations for large NBFCs,” said Parekh. “...we had disadvantages of being an NBFC and no advantage of a bank.”

The RBI has been tightening vigilance on systemically important NBFCs, bringing their regulation on par with that of commercial banks to ring-fence the system. The collapse of infrastructure behemoth Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) in 2018 and subsequent failures of leading NBFCs like Reliance Capital, Dewan Housing Finance Corp and SREI have prompted the RBI to tighten its scrutiny on shadow lenders.

On April 19, this year, the central bank issued detailed guidelines on regulatory restrictions for NBFCs aligning their lending and disclosure rules for large NBFCs with banks.

Under the new norms, large NBFCs must not have an exposure higher than 20 percent of its capital base to any entity, and its board can approve an additional 5 percent exposure limit to take it to 25 percent, the RBI said in its circular. Unless sanctioned by the board, NBFCs in the middle and upper layers may not grant loans of Rs 5 crore and above to their directors or relatives of directors. These directions were effective from October 1.

A few days before these norms were released, HDFC Bank on April 4 had agreed to take over the biggest domestic mortgage lender in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan. HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger. The deal is termed as the biggest transaction in India’s corporate history.

The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore. The merger is expected to be completed by the second or third quarter of FY24, subject to regulatory approvals.

The deal has got in-principle approval from the stock exchanges, RBI, Securities and Exchange Board of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and Competition Commission of India (CCI).

Parekh said at the event that although the merger will add value to all stakeholders, the key challenge is about integrating the two entities.

“The task (about the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger) is how to do the integration; integration is the big issue because there are two companies whose cultures, systems, technologies are different,” said Parekh."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC

HDFC saw a good quarter with core metrics being in-line along with better margins, strong individual loan growth and improved asset quality. NII was a tad better (+12.9% YoY) led by higher NIM at 3.3% (PLe 3.2%). Loan accretion (+14.5% YoY) was driven by individual loans (+20% YoY) due to faster growth in metros that too in higher value home loans. Company expects this credit momentum to sustain while share of construction finance could enhance. NIM may improve in H2FY23 as asset repricing would catch up with that of liabilities. GNPL reduced by 19bps QoQ to 1.6% while OTR/stage-2 pools also declined.



Outlook

We retain our multiple at 2.3x and rolling forward to Sep’24 core ABV we increase TP from Rs2,900 to Rs3,000. Retain BUY.

The market seems to be gaining strength as the benchmark indices added more than a percent in the Diwali week ended October 28, on top of over 2 percent rally in the previous week. Auto, energy, infrastructure, metal, oil and gas, and select bank stocks helped the Nifty close at a one-and-half-month high.

Even the Nifty50 has started off new monthly F&O series (November) on a positive note but faced a lot of challenges at 17,800 on the higher side, while on the lower side, 17,600 seems to have acted as a good support for the entire last week. Hence, if the index decisively crosses 17,800 in coming days, then 18,000-18,100 will be easily taken out which can ultimately pave the way towards new highs, according to experts.

The Nifty50 has formed small bodied bullish candle on the daily charts followed by a 'hanging man' pattern in the previous day, while on the weekly scale too, there was a small-bodied bullish candle formation.

""Practically, the trading action in the previous truncated week was very dull. In our sense, markets have opted to take some breather before unfolding the next leg of the rally,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.

As far as supports are concerned, 17,600 - 17,500 are to be treated as key levels and till the time, it remains unbroken, there is no reason to worry for, he feels.

On the flipside, ""it's a matter of time, we would see Nifty surpassing 17,800 to retest the psychological junction of 18,000,"" the market expert said.

Chavan advised traders to remain upbeat and keep a close watch on the thematic moves which may get unfolded in the first half of the forthcoming week.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the November 28 closing prices.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

L&T Finance Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 80.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 70 | Target: Rs 88 | Return: 10 percent

The stock is in a corrective pattern since March 2021. Since April 2022, it has tried to break the supply line several times but it has failed. However, over the past month, the stock narrowed trading activity, which would result in an upward breakout.

The strategy should be to buy 50 percent at current levels and the remaining 50 percent at Rs 72, with a stop-loss below Rs 70. On higher levels, it would rally up to Rs 88 and Rs 100 levels in the short to medium term.

Max Healthcare Institute: Buy | LTP: Rs 430.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 390 | Target: Rs 500 | Return: 16 percent

Technically, the stock is absorbing the selling pressure, which is at Rs 430. It has also recorded several bottoms between Rs 400 and Rs 390. Based on it, we can expect an upward movement in the stock.

The oscillators are supporting the formation of the daily and weekly charts. Buy at current levels and remaining at Rs 410 with final stop-loss below Rs 390. At higher levels, there is room to move towards Rs 500 with major resistance at Rs 460.

If the proposal is approved and implemented, HDFC Bank and Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) are likely to be among the first stocks to fall under the new rubric.

The HDFC-HDFC Bank merger will likely create the third-largest Indian company as measured by market capitalisation.

With HDFC being a part of the Nifty indices, the mortgage company’s scrip could witness massive selling from passive funds, market experts believe. A report from international financial services firm Investec pegged these outflows at $2.4 billion by way of 88 million shares from exchange-traded funds and index funds tracking the underlying indices as of December 2022. Emkay Global Financial Services estimated an outflow of $1.25 billion.

If the proposal by NSE Indices is approved, sharp swings could be avoided in the prices of shares of companies that are in the process of being included or excluded from the indices on account of buying and selling by passive funds that track these indices.

NSE Indices has proposed changes for the inclusion or exclusion of a company from or into the indices closer to the event.

The NSE arm is seeking feedback from the market regarding the methodology.

Read here | NSE Indices seeks market feedback on existing methodology of merger, demerger in Nifty Indices

Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research (formerly Edelweiss Alternative & Quantitative Research) believes that the proposal should get support from participants. The brokerage has batted for this change as it sees the new methodology avoiding big churning under the current methodology.

Currently, index reconstitution takes place at the time of exclusion of the transferor company and subsequently during the weight rebalancing of the stocks in the index.

“This results into churning of stocks twice in case passive funds (ETF/Index funds) are tracking such index,” NSE Indices said in a press release.

Punit Patni, an equity research analyst at Swastika Investmart, a financial services firm, believes a change in the methodology of merger and demerger of index constituents will prevent needless churn in the index and funds tracking such index.

“This move will be beneficial for HDFC and HDFC Bank shareholders, as the current expected $1.5 billion outflow in HDFC due to index rebalancing would have caused unnecessary loss for investors and traders at least in the short term,” Patni pointed out.

But Koushik Mohan, lead analyst at Ashika Institutional Equities, feels that this proposal “might not bring a revolutionary change”. His reasoning is that this would largely affect arbitrage fund managers who take advantage of special events like mergers and demergers but overall, except averting wild fluctuations in the stock price of the companies concerned, this proposal is unlikely to create any difference.

Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research said if the proposed changes are considered after the consultation is over, HDFC will only get excluded on the ex-date which will likely be Q1 of FY24."

With over Rs 7,200 crore in subsidy disbursals, the largest pure-play mortgage lender HDFC has cornered over 15 per cent of the credit-linked subsidy scheme for affordable housing since its launch in June 2016.

The 45-year-old Corporation, which is awaiting a reverse merger with its subsidiary HDFC Bank, has also won the best housing finance company award from the government for this for the third time this year.

Its Managing director Renu Sud Karnad said they have over 3.13 lakh credit linked subsidy scheme (CLSS) customers, who have cumulatively borrowed more than Rs 67,000 crore from them since the launch of the plan under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).

These customers have received more than Rs 7,200 crore in subsidies, which is a tad over 15 per cent of the total subsidy of Rs 48,250 crore given by the government.

The corporation has been awarded the best performing housing finance company under the CLSS and the same was given away by Union Housing Minister Hardeep Singh Puri in Rajkot last night, Karnad said in a statement on Thursday.

It can be noted that poll-bound Gujarat has become the best-performing state under the scheme in terms of the number of borrowers.

HDFC in July 2018 won the best-performing primary lending institution in the EWS and LIG segments and the second-best in the MIG segment under the scheme.

In March 2019, it was also awarded the best private sector financial institution under this. Karnad expects affordable housing to continue to drive the real estate sector as there is a strong structural demand for housing due to better affordability, government incentives, favourable demographics, increasing urbanisation and rising aspirations to own a house.

She has also noted a paradigm shift among customers across all segments applying online, which has enabled HDFC to assist over 3 lakh customers under the PMAY, especially during the pandemic.

As result, today over 92 per cent of new loan applications received are through digital channels, which was less than 20 per cent before the pandemic. Over the past 45 years, HDFC has funded more than 95 lakh homes. It has 695 offices in the country and also in London, Dubai and Singapore."
"October 18, 2022 04:32 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/festive-fervour-hdfc-sbi-bank-of-maharashtra-cut-home-loan-rates-9349071.html,"At a time when interest rates on home loans are rising in line with the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) policy rates, lenders such as Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Maharashtra are clearly the outliers. They have cut home loan rates recently to attract demand in wake of the festive season.

As part of its festive offer, SBI is offering a concession of up to 0.25 percent on home loans, with rates starting at 8.40 percent.

The country’s largest lender is also offering a concession of 0.15 percent on top-up loans, and 0.30 percent on loans against property. The bank has further sweetened the deal by waiving off the processing fee on home loans up to January 2023.

Bank of Maharashtra also cut its home loan interest rates by 30-70 basis points. Home loans will now be available at a minimum of 8 percent per annum rate.

Mortgage lender HDFC also offers festive cheer for borrowers. Under the special festive offer, HDFC is offering just one rate of 8.4 percent on home loans for a credit score of 750 and above, irrespective of the loan amount. This offer is valid till November 30. Prior to this offer, HDFC’s home loan rates ranged between 8.60 and 9 percent, depending on the loan amount and credit score.

Bajaj Housing Finance Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary of Bajaj Finance Limited, has announced a Diwali special offer, slashing its home loan interest rate to 8.2 percent per year for salaried and professional applicants. The Diwali Special Offer will remain valid from October 14 to November 30 and is only applicable at select locations.

Festivals such as Navratri, Dussehra, Dhanteras and Diwali are traditionally considered auspicious to make investments in homes, gold, etc. Lenders are using the festive season to offer lucrative home loan rates and tap into credit demand.

Tapping demand

The drop in rates comes at a time when the RBI’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has increased the repo rate by 190 basis points since May to quell inflationary pressures in the economy. Banks are quick to pass the repo rate hike on loans to consumers.

Bankers said that the cut in home loan rates comes at the right time, now that the economy is just about recovering from COVID-19 and the festive cheer has begun to set in.

“As we enter the festive season after a long period of muted celebrations due to COVID restrictions, our offers this festive season are aimed at providing the much-needed support to prospective home buyers as they embark on their journey for home ownership,” said Alok Kumar Choudhary, managing director, retail banking and operations at SBI.

Choudhary added that SBI is seeing “strong interest” for home loans across the country.

Home loans extended by banks increased by 16.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 17.86 lakh crore in August, according to data from the central bank. Analysts attributed this rise to pent-up demand, consumers’ growing disposable incomes and aspiration for owning a house.

“Lower interest rates do lure borrowers. We would like to see the length of time the scheme works to see if the demand will accrue,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice president, research, at Kotak Securities.

Can home loan demand sustain?

According to analysts, demand for loans responds more to every consumer’s affordability rather than cost of money. Also, to say that home loan demand will sustain just on the basis of these cuts would be premature, especially since interest rates are poised to edge higher, going forward, they said. Whether other banks shall follow suit is a strategic decision of each bank, they added.

“In an increasing interest-rate environment, lenders will not offer such generous pricing to everyone. So, the eligibility filters will be fairly tight, I suspect,” said Krishnan ASV, senior vice president, HDFC Securities.

“Any positive impact on demand would be negligible. This demand would come from those consumers who have waited on the sidelines for the right offer. Now, when pricing is conducive, such customers may bite,” Krishnan added.

According to Punit Patni, a research analyst at Swastika Investmart, the robust demand for home ownership is “astonishing”, considering the current interest hikes and rising real estate prices. Lower rates may not be sustainable (for lenders) for a long time, which is why these offers are meant for only a temporary period, added Patni.

Patni said that the recently announced rate cuts by a few lenders “will be the icing on the cake” for borrowers and other banks will jump on the bandwagon soon."

Fund raising through corporate bond sales rose sharply by 49% month-on-month to Rs 82,378 crore on the back of large issuance by some banks and state-owned entities even as the rates on these instrument rise, dealers said.

This was because most issuers have raised funds before yields started to move up, said Umesh Kumar Tulsyan, managing director of Sovereign Global Markets, a New Delhi-based fund house.

Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by private and public corporations. Companies issue corporate bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes, whether building a new plant, purchasing equipment, or growing their business. When one buys a corporate bond, one effectively lends money to the ""issuer,"" the company that issued the bond.

According to data from Prime Database, companies and banks raised funds worth Rs 82,378 crore in September, compared to Rs 55,500 crore raised in the previous month. Data also showed that funds raised in September was the highest in the current financial year.

State Bank of India, Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd, Power Finance Corp., Small Industries Development Bank of India, and HDFC Bank were among the top five issuers in September, together raising Rs 31,708 crore. The money raised by these five entities amounted to 39% of the total funds raised in September.

""The view of the market was that the yield will be moving up and all wanted to fulfil their capital requirement, so somehow they timed the best of the market to raise funds,"" Tulsyan added.

""Issuance has risen in September because bond yields were supported due to expectation of global bond index inclusion, positive FPI (foreign portfolio investment) flows, lower SDL (State Development loans) supply and strong investors demand which reflected in primary issuance bidding. Also credit off-take has been positive, clocking around 16% Y-o-Y growth and with the festive season approaching we may see a significant rise in demand for money,"" said Sanjay Pawar, Fund Manager – Fixed Income, LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Ltd.

Yield movement

Yield on corporate bonds maturing in three years rose by 45 basis points, five years by 40 basis points and 10-year by 22 basis points month-on-month in September, tracking an uptick in government securities yield and low demand from mutual funds. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Pawar added that the market had seen a hardening of yields across the segment both in government securities and corporate bonds due to a delay in the inclusion of the country's bonds in its global index, the central bank hiking rates aggressively, a rally in crude prices, weakening rupee and draining out of liquidity from system.

Further, the yield on benchmark government bonds has risen by 25 basis points, whereas due to the quarter-end there was redemption pressure on mutual funds that led to a rise in yields on corporate bonds.

According to data compiled from the corporate bond deals, the yield on three-years corporate bonds that were trading at a 7.10% rose to 7.55% in September, yield on five-years paper rose to 7.65% from 7.20%, and the yield 10-year paper rose to 7.72% from 7.50%.

Going forward

Debt dealers said yields are expected to rise further due to heavy supply in the second half of the current financial year and expectations of further rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

While issuers will keenly watch the movement of the yield on government securities, which were expected to rise further given higher crude oil prices.

Usually, higher Brent crude oil prices put pressure on the inflation print, leading to a dampening of investor sentiments . In the last few days, Brent crude oil prices had risen sharply after OPEC and its allies decided to cut production output by 2 million barrels per day. Brent crude oil prices were trading at $97.38.

Moreover, the spread between corporate bonds and government securities, which is hovering at a historical low, is expected to rise as supply may increases and if liquidity conditions tighten further, Pawar said."

Bears have taken charge of Dalal Street after significant correction in the last three trading sessions of the week ended September 16, forcing the market to bleed by 1.7 percent during the week. The aggressive interest rate hike expectations in the US, selling by FIIs and correction in IT stocks weighed on market sentiment.

The Nifty50 has defended the 17,500 level by closing at 17,531 last Friday. The index is expected to take crucial support at 17,400, which was also around the bullish gap zone area created on August 30, breaking of the same can pull the index towards 17,200-17,000 levels, whereas 17,800 is going to act as resistance area in coming sessions, experts said.

On the flipside, he feels if Nifty has to find its mojo back, it needs to go beyond Friday's high of 17,820 on a closing basis. So meanwhile, any minor bounce back towards 17,650 – 17,750 should ideally be used to exit longs.

The stock is in rectangle consolidation since August 2022. It is facing resistance at Rs 325 and finding support at Rs 300.

If we consider the volume pattern it is rising whenever the stock moves to the upper boundary of the trading range, which is a sign of an upside break out, which is more likely in the near term.

It is a partly buy at current levels and adding more at Rs 305 is advisable. Place a stop-loss at Rs 295 to hold a long position. On the upside, it will rebound to Rs 350 or Rs 370 in the medium term.

Maruti Suzuki India: Buy | LTP: Rs 9,189.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 8,800 | Target: Rs 9,500-9,750 | Return: 3-6 percent

The stock is consolidating at the highest levels of the current rally. On a weekly basis, it has crossed the previous swing high, which was at Rs 9,200 and it is positive for the stock as the broader pattern is of a saucer, which will eventually lift the stock to Rs 10,000 levels in the medium term.

Voltas: Sell | LTP: Rs 912.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 960 | Targets: Rs 860-820 | Return: 6-10 percent

The stock price has closed below crucial support of Rs 917. It has given bearish breakout from last four months' price consolidation.

The price breakout is accompanied by rising volumes. Primary trend of the stock has been bearish with lower tops and lower bottoms.

The stock is placed above all important moving averages, which indicates bullish trend on all time frames.

Larsen & Toubro Infotech: Sell | LTP: Rs 4,379.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,570 | Targets: Rs 4,150-4,000 | Return: 5-9 percent

Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

UPL: Sell | LTP: Rs 703.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 735 | Target: Rs 679 | Return: 3.5 percent

In last one and a half month, the stock has consolidated above its ‘200 DEMA’ and prices have given a breakdown below the support in last Friday’s session.

The selling also witnessed higher than average volumes and thus we could see an underperformance in the stock in the near term. The ‘RSI’ (relative strength index) oscillator is also hinting at a negative momentum and hence, any pullback move towards the supports broken is likely to witness selling pressure.

Hence, traders can look to sell the stock on pullback around Rs 715, with potential short term targets of Rs 679. The stop-loss on short positions should be placed above Rs 735.

Tata Communications: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,203.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,250 | Target: Rs 1,120 | Return: 7 percent

In the recent upmove, the stock resisted around the 61.8 percent retracement of the previous corrective phase. The momentum readings have given a negative crossover from the overbought zone which indicates probability of a short term corrective phase.

Hence, traders can look to sell the stock in the range of Rs 1,200-1,210 for potential short term targets of Rs 1,120. The stop-loss on short positions should be placed above Rs 1,250.

Jatin Gohil, Technical & Derivative Analyst at Reliance Securities

Siemens: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,959.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,139 | Target: Rs 2,577 | Return: 13 percent

On September 14, the stock tested its prior high connecting rising trendline and witnessed a sharp reversal subsequently. Above average volume and rise in future open interest signals that major market participants are in favour of the bears.

Its daily RSI gave the sell signal post a bearish divergence and currently on the verge of a trendline breakout.

Further decline will accelerate, undergoing negative momentum, which could drag the stock towards its intermediate point of polarity initially (Rs 2,812) and its 100-day SMA (Rs 2,577) subsequently.

In case the stock manages to surpass its prior swing high of Rs 3,139 convincingly, probable decline will be negated.

DLF: Sell | LTP: Rs 389.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 414 | Target: Rs 348 | Return: 10 percent

The stock reversed after testing its medium-term supply zone (Rs 410-407) and closed below its 20-day EMA (Rs 393). Earlier, the stock bounced respecting that moving average due to lack of participation (especially bear’s).

We believe the stock will extend the loss as a spike in volume and bearish cross-over in daily RSI signals short-term weakness.

This could drag the stock towards the prior point of polarity, which is placed at Rs 348. On the higher side, its medium-term supply zone will continue to cap the up-move.

Power Grid Corporation of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 235.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 222 | Target: Rs 259 | Return: 10 percent

In the last week, the stock bounced after a downward oscillation and breached its prior falling trend. The stock formed a Bullish Engulfing pattern and rose to an almost 4-month closing high.

Rise in volume and increase in the future open interest signals that major market participants were in favour of the bulls.

This could lead the stock towards Rs 259, which coincides with its prior high connecting rising trendline. In case of any decline, the stock will find support around its 20-week EMA (Rs 222). Since August 2022, the stock remained above that moving average.

"August 11, 2022 09:26 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/hdfc-executes-rare-trade-to-hedge-rate-risk-9003831.html,"India’s largest mortgage financier used an unusual trade to hedge some of its borrowings against interest rate volatility as it sought to expand its range of tools to manage risk, according to people familiar with the matter.

Housing Development Finance Corp., the nation’s biggest rupee-bond issuer this year, used a so-called total return swap to hedge rate risks on a debt issuance which closed last month, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private arrangements. The lender had been primarily using overnight-index swaps before, they said.

The switch in hedging tools comes as markets are buffeted by surging policy rates, with the Reserve Bank of India having hiked by 140 basis points since May to tackle inflation. The central bank said last week that it will do “whatever it takes” to bring down price pressures, though some traders had expected it to tone down its hawkishness.

Under the interest-rate derivative contract, banks bought easily tradable sovereign bonds on behalf of the Mumbai-based financier on their treasury books, and HDFC would pay the overnight Mibor rate and a spread to the lenders, the people said. The spread acted like fees that HDFC paid to the banks which had taken a bond position for the financier.

A representative for HDFC declined to comment. The lender’s dependence on overnight-index swaps for managing rate risks had allowed traders to make bets in the market to factor in HDFC’s upcoming hedges whenever it raised money, making it costlier for the financier to buy protection, the people said.

The contract is called a total return swap because it allows the receiver to get returns on the underlying asset, in this case sovereign bonds, without having to fund the assets on its balance sheet.

With more than 40% of the financier’s $66 billion borrowings coming from debt securities, managing the possible yield mismatch between the variable-rate loans it offers and the fixed rates at which it borrows is vital for HDFC. The swap agreement makes the liability and borrowing variable for HDFC, thereby protecting its lending margins.

That would help should policy rates drop over the duration of HDFC’s bonds. It’s unclear which bond the mortgage financier had hedged the rate risks on.

HDFC last month raised a combined 181.1 billion rupees ($2.3 billion) through three debt offerings. Of the total, 40 billion rupees was raised through notes due in March 2024 at 7.28% coupon, 31.11 billion rupees via bonds maturing in June 2027 at 7.77% and the remainder through a jumbo 10-year offering at 8%.

Not all companies in India use the total return swap to hedge their interest-rate risk. That’s because some aren’t in the lending business, and so there is no need to hedge risk, and also no other shadow financier in the nation has a balance sheet that’s close to HDFC’s in size."

Mortgage financier Housing Development and Finance Corporation (HDFC) has announced a quarter of a percentage hike in the retail prime lending rate (RPLR) on housing loans.

The benchmark lending rate for home loans has been raised by 25 basis points, as per a regulatory filing. The new rate will come into effect from August 9, HDFC said.

""HDFC increases its retail prime lending rate (RPLR) on Housing loans, on which its adjustable rate home loans (ARHL) are benchmarked, by 25 basis points, with effect from August 9, 2022,"" it informed the stock exchanges.

The announcement comes around a week after HDFC raised the RPLR by 25 bps, with effect from August 1. The key lending rate has been increased six times since May this year. It has been cumulatively hiked by 140 bps.

The increase in RPLR will result in higher EMIs paid by home loan borrowers.

HDFC, earlier in the day, also announced a hike in the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) across all loan tenures by 5-10 bps, ""with effect from today, 8th August 2022"".

Financial institutions are expected to aggressively raise their lending rates, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been increasing repo rate since May in a bid to tame the inflation. The central bank on August 5 announced a 50 bps jump in the key policy rate, while noting that ""inflation still remains at uncomfortably high levels"".

The repo rate hikes over the past three months have cumulatively increased it to 5.4 percent, which is the highest since August 2019."

CTBC Bank, Mizuho Bank, State Bank of India and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation are the other MLABs and joint social loan coordinators.

This is India’s largest social financing issuance, the largest social loan globally, the first social ECB loan out of India and the largest ECB loan deal from a Housing Finance Company/private NBFC in India, HDFC said. External Commercial Borrowings are instruments used by domestic entities to raise capital from overseas markets in Indian rupee or any other permitted foreign currency. Since its inception in 1977, the largest mortgage lender by asset size in the country has financed 95 lakh housing units and has a gross loan book of Rs 6.7 lakh crore.

""Affordable housing is a critical component of quality infrastructure as also a growth driver for the real estate industry and the economy at large given its strong linkages to nearly 300 industries. It contributes to capital formation, employment, and income opportunities,"" Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC Ltd, said on the borrowing programme.

He said a boost to affordable housing will play a significant role towards the 'Housing for All' objective of the government. ""The aspiration to own a home is inherent in every household. In India, housing will play an important role as a catalyst for growth with increased demand for affordable housing"", Parekh said further.

HDFC terms the social loan as a 'landmark financing' which promotes the company’s longstanding mission to be the leading provider of housing finance in India. Loans by the company have assisted over 314,000 beneficiaries, mostly in affordable housing, under the CLSS (credit-linked subsidy schemes) of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), the highest by any financial institution in India, as per HDFC."

HDFC’s reported, PAT at Rs. 3,669 crore , lagged both street expectations and our estimates of Rs. 3,905 crore, rising by 22% y-o-y/ -1% q-o-q mainly due to lower net interest income (up 8% y-o-y and was down 3% q-o-q). Despite strong AUM growth (17% y-o-y; 3% q-o-q), NII growth was modest (8% y-o-y/ -3% q-o-q) due to a 21 bps q-o-q/ 20 bps y-o-y fall in margins. NIMs (calculated as % of avg. AUMs) stood at 2.68%. NIMs were lower mainly on account of lag in transmission of increased rates on asset book and lower swap rate benefit achieved in Q1FY22. Operating profits grew by 11%y-o-y / 2% q-o-q on the back of higher non-core income from higher dividend. Credit costs (% of avg AUM) remained broadly stable q-o-q at 31 bps.

ICICI Bank, the second-largest private sector lender, on Monday raised its lending rates by 0.15 percent across all tenors in anticipation of a rate hike by the RBI later this week.

The rates have been increased across all tenors under the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) system, a move that will make EMI expensive for those who availed loans benchmarked against MCLR.

Under the revised rates, effective August 1, the bank’s one-year MCLR increased by 15 basis points or 0.15 percent to 7.90 percent, while the overnight MCLR rose to 7.65 percent, as per information posted on the bank’s website.

The one-year MCLR is considered important from a retail loans perspective, as a bank’s long-term loans like home loans are linked to this rate. The rate hike comes ahead of the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting later this week.

It is widely expected that the MPC would hike interest rates to tame high inflation.

Last week, mortgage lender HDFC increased its lending rate by 0.25 per cent. Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IBHFL) also hiked its reference rates on housing loans and MSME loans by 25 basis points in line with other players.

The new rates will be applicable for new customers from August 1 and for existing borrowers from August 5 onwards."

“You have seen the numbers up to June, we had a growth of 19 percent in our individual loan book, which has been the highest growth we have had in the last 8 years, which is nearly 32 quarters,"" said Keki Mistry, VC & CEO, HDFC, in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

Elaborating on what is driving the exceptional growth in the loan book, Mistry said that the affordability today is significantly greater than it was in 2016-2017 and income levels have particularly risen sharply in the last one year.

""The most important thing is that in the last... let's say 9-10 months, maybe a year, income levels of people have constantly kept rising. If you talk to players in certain industries like the IT industry, the e-commerce business, which you would be doing, you will find that everyone is talking of wage increases. So because of the wage increases, people's income levels, their feel-good factor, their ability, their willingness to take the plunge and buy a house is today much higher than before,"" he explained.

The housing finance major reported a 22 percent rise in its standalone profit after tax to Rs 3,669 crore for the quarter under review against the Rs 3,001 crore posted during the same period last year. Net interest income (NII) was up nearly 8 percent to Rs 4,447 crore from Rs 4,125 crore while the individual loan disbursement went up by 66 percent as compared to the first-quarter of FY22. NIM, however, came in at 3.4 percent, six-quarter low.



The overall AUM stood at Rs 6,71,364 crore as against Rs 5,74,136 crore on a YoY basis, with individual loans accounting for 79 percent. However, repo rate hikes taken by the Reserve Bank of India leading to increase in lending rates has had an impact on the borrowing costs.



""The full increase of 90 basis points in lending rates has not come through in the earnings up to June 30th, but the borrowing cost changes immediately. So while the borrowing cost changes immediately, the lending rates change over a period of 3 months,"" said Mistry. He added that going forward, the company will change lending rates every month with an agreement with the new customers.







Taking about the upcoming RBI policy announcement, Mistry said that he expects the rate hikes to not be as high as earlier envisaged.



“Now the general feeling is that the rate hikes will not be as sharp or as high as they were originally envisaged. RBI, to some extent, will also look at what the Fed is doing before they take a call on interest rates primarily because of the currency... But yes, some increase in rates is bound to happen,” he said.



HDFC stock was trading 0.26 percent lower at Rs 2,373 per share on BSE at the time of writing, falling after three consecutive sessions of gains.



The stock has gained 7.41 percent in the last one-month while it is down 8.21 percent year-to-date and 2.72 percent in the last one year. The stock has underperformed the Sensex by 12.87 percent in the last one year.

HDFC’s earnings missed estimates led by sequentially lower core metrics. AuM growth was largely in-line at 17% YoY mainly driven by individual loans while NII and margins were lower. Core PPoP was lower by 8%, while higher provisions led to PAT miss by 11.5%. As per management, ROE expansion would be driven by NII growth, controlled opex and decline in credit costs.

The average of the estimates of seven brokerages polled by Moneycontrol had expected the net profit to be at Rs 3,902 crore.

HDFC vice chairman Keki Mistry said that the full impact of the lending rate hikes undertaken by HDFC is yet to show on the loan book, which kept net interest income low for the quarter.

“This has been due to the transmission lag between the interest rate increase in borrowing costs and the increase in lending rates,” he said.

The lender’s margins improved from the year-ago period to 3.4 percent for the June quarter.

The home loan lender reported a loan growth of 16 percent, closer to its historic trend. The growth was driven by its individual loans which grew by 19 percent year-on-year on an AUM basis.

Disbursements surged during the quarter to Rs 42,000 crore, Mistry said. Individual loan disbursals grew by 66 percent year on year. The affordable housing loan segment, too, showed a healthy growth of 10 percent for the quarter, though lower than the 14 percent growth seen a year ago.

Another drag on net profit was an increase in provisions, which went up to Rs 510 crore for the June quarter from Rs 450 crore in the previous quarter. The lender holds Rs 13,328 crore or as total provisions against potential delinquencies.

That said, HDFC’s provision coverage ratio remains high. Gross bad loans improved to 1.78 percent of the total loan book for the reported quarter from 2.28 percent in the year-ago period. This was due to a fall in delinquencies in the non-individual loan book and also resolutions.

Delinquencies in the non-individual loan book fell to 4.44 percent for the June quarter from the peak of 5.05 percent in the December quarter of FY22. In the March quarter, delinquencies were at 4.77 percent. Those of the individual book, too, marginally improved to below 1 percent.

HDFC Bank will be among the world's top 10 most valuable banks after its merger with the parent, mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), at the current valuations and will also be the first Indian bank to make it to the Top 10 club, a Times of India report said.

India's largest private lender has a market capitalisation of about $108 billion and recently edged past Citigroup (over $100. 5 billion), which was at the 17th position, said the report.

HDFC Bank is worth more than DBS Group and UBS and (both valued at around $58 billion). The country’s largest lender State Bank of India ($57 billion) is at number 32 ahead of BNP Paribas ($55 billion) in terms of valuation. The combined market cap of HDFC Bank and HDFC ($52 billion) would be around $160 billion.

India’s biggest private lender HDFC Bank is set to become even bigger—both in terms of assets and market valuation.

After its merger with the parent, mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), the Mumbai-headquartered bank's market capitalisation will rise from Rs 7.76 trillion to around Rs 12 trillion after adding HDFC’s about Rs 4.16 trillion, according to a Moneycontrol calculation, way ahead of Rs 4.6 trillion of State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest bank.

In terms of assets, too, the difference will show.

New sheriff in town

The merger will see HDFC Bank’s assets rise to Rs 17.86 trillion, inching closer to SBI’s Rs 26.64 trillion. In another few years, HDFC Bank can emerge as a serious contender to SBI in India-focused larger loan deals, in the country and elsewhere.

SBI’s dominance is about to be challenged.

Since 1955, no bank has come closer to the state-owned lender’s massive asset size. Formerly Imperial Bank of India, which owns a fifth of the market share in assets and a quarter in loans and deposits, is the rate-trendsetter in the Rs 120-trillion Indian credit market.

But this will change after HDFC Bank’s merger with the parent.

The deal also gives HDFC Bank something it didn’t have—home loans. It has thrived on consumer loans but lacked strength in the juicy mortgage market. Its home loan book is minuscule compared with its book size.

Only 2 percent of HDFC Bank’s customers source home loans through the lender and about 70 percent of the parent’s customers do not bank with HDFC Bank. But, the merger with HDFC—the giant in the mortgage business—will address this glaring gap.

Now for some hard work

Going big on the elusive mortgage business reignites HDFC Bank’s ambition to be the market leader but it won’t be a walk in the park. Finding the synergy with the parent’s work culture—an emotional connect with clients—is the key.

To grow big, HDFC Bank needs to catch up on the liability side. It needs to add at least Rs 5.5 trillion deposits in FY24-25 to replace HDFC’s high-cost borrowings, Emkay Global’s analysts have said.

That means tough work for branches and some rate tinkering.

To dethrone SBI and lure bigger international clients, HDFC Bank will need to go big on a safe, mortgage book and let go of risky corporate and unsecured loans.

It will also need a better tech team and alert risk managers to avoid past run-ins with a watchful central bank.

For the regulator, too, bigger banks mean bigger challenges. HDFC Bank is a systemically important or a “too-big-to-fail” bank in India. The combined entity will warrant closer scrutiny by the regulator.

Answering shareholder queries at the 28th annual general meeting of the largest private sector lender, its chief executive and managing director Sashidhar Jagdishan said the initial public offering (IPO) plans for HDFC Securities and HDB Financial Services depends on the merger process.

HDFC Bank and HDFC in April announced the USD 40 billion merger, touted as the largest such transaction in corporate history, saying that it will take up to 18 months to end. ""The IPO plans (of HDFC Securities and HDB Financial Services) are something that we will contemplate after we have absorbed (the merger) we’ve got directions from the regulator, after we absorb as and when the merger happens. And then we will think about"", Jagdishan said.

Earlier, he said that on HDB Financial Services, the bank is still awaiting directions from the regulator to ascertain a glide path for the way ahead for the company, which reported a huge jump in post-tax net at Rs 441.3 crore for June quarter. In the case of HDFC Securities, the bank would like to maintain a majority stake given the complementarity in business offerings with the brokerage whose customers are the same as the bank’s, the CEO said.

The decision on whether to keep the stake at the current 95 per cent or dilute it will be taken in due course of time, Jagdishan said. Despite approval from the RBI, the bank has shelved its plans to invest more in HDFC Ergo General Insurance, pending the merger with HDFC, after which the insurer will become a subsidiary of the bank itself, Jagdishan said.

Once the merger goes through, the bank will also have to look at increasing the maturity profile of its liabilities which are currently below three years, Jagdishan said, explaining that the mortgage assets are typically longer term in nature due to which the bank’s asset liability committee will have to take the appropriate calls. He said the overall composition of housing loans of the merged entity will be 35 per cent and hinted at doing more of the same product as well by stating that it does not see this as concentration risk. On one side, the under-penetration presents an opportunity, while on the other side, other loan products of the bank will also be growing, he underlined.

The bank is also keen to patronize the deposit agents of HDFC after the merger, but will await regulatory clarity on the same, he said. The bank, which had to face slaps from the regulator in the recent past because of outages faced by customers, is planning to soon launch a payments app which will be better than its current offering called Payzapp and include features including instant credit of cashbacks, Jagdishan said.

He said from July or August onward, it plans to launch one new digital offering every three to four weeks, which will also include a new mobile app for corporate and small business clients, and added that it has already soft-launched a customer experience hub sans much of fanfare. On the credit card front, the bank has made sizeable progress since being allowed to sell new cards after the ban, the CEO said.

The overall number of cards stands at 17-18 million and HDFC Bank’s market share in the overall receivables has gone up to 47-48 percent, he said, adding that from a profitability perspective, it will be back at the pre-COVID levels in the next 6-8 months. The bank is also cognizant of data privacy issues and has recently appointed a chief data officer, who will be working along with a chief data security officer, Jagdishan said, adding that its entire data mining operation starts with getting consent from the customer first, and it will be compliant with Indian regulations on this front as and when they come in.

From the perspective of minimising the downtimes, the bank will be investing more on the technology front going ahead, he said, without giving details on the quantum of the money to be invested. In the last two years, the bank has seen an increase in the corporate loans in the overall loan book, which has led to a dip in the net interest margins to 4 percent levels, Jagdishan said, adding that the crucial number influencing profitability to go up to 4.2 percent once the share of retail advances goes up.

There have been higher loan losses on the retail loans front during the last two years of the pandemic, he said, adding that similar trends were observed after the global financial crisis in FY09 and also after demonetization as individuals faced difficulties in their financial situations. The bank’s attrition has gone up to 19 per cent with the reopening of the economy post the pandemic-induced slowdown, Jagdsihan said, adding that the number is embarrassingly: higher among the youngsters and efforts will be made to reduce the same.

The bank has the approval to open a branch in Singapore and after the merger with HDFC, the number of foreign branches may go up, he said, stressing that it sees India as a key opportunity and does not see a significant increase in its global footprint, which currently consists of branches in Bahrain, Hong Kong, Dubai and Gift City. Meanwhile, the bank’s non-executive chairman Atanu Chakraborty said it is looking at doubling its branch network to over 12,000 over the next 3-5 years, and the sizes of branches may reduce over time.

Typically, it takes two years for a branch in a metro city to break even, while the same for other pockets is around three years, he said."

In the filing, HDFC stated, ""We wish to inform you that HDFC Limited has today i.e. on July 8, 2022, received an approval from PFRDA regarding change in its status/ constitution pursuant to the Scheme in accordance with the PFRDA (Point of Presence) Regulations, 2018, subject to a condition that the services to NPS subscribers associated with HDFC Limited will not be affected due to the Scheme.""

HDFC Bank on July 4 said it has got banking sector regulator RBI's nod for the merger proposal of its parent HDFC Ltd with itself.

Prior to the RBI nod, the proposed merger got approval from both stock exchanges — BSE and NSE - in June last week.

The merger was announced in April this year when HDFC's board had cleared the amalgamation of its wholly-owned subsidiaries HDFC Investments Ltd and HDFC Holdings Ltd with HDFC Bank. HDFC Bank's proposed takeover of the biggest domestic mortgage lender in a deal valued at about $40 billion, will create a financial services titan.

""HDFC Bank has received a letter dated July 04, 2022 from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) whereby the RBI has accorded it's 'no objection' for the Scheme, subject to certain conditions as mentioned therein,"" the bank said in a regulatory filing. The merger proposal remains subject to various statutory and regulatory approvals, including from the Competition Commission of India (CCI), National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), other applicable authorities and the respective shareholders and creditors of the companies, it said.

Private lender HDFC Bank said it has received no adverse observations from the stock exchanges in relation to its proposed merger with parent entity Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Ltd.

""We would like to inform you that HDFC Bank has received observation letter with ‘no adverse observations’ from BSE Limited and observation letter with ‘no objection’ from the National Stock Exchange of India Limited, both dated July 2, 2022,"" it said in a regulatory filing.

The merger was announced in April this year when HDFC's board had cleared the amalgamation of its wholly-owned subsidiaries HDFC Investments Ltd and HDFC Holdings Ltd with HDFC Bank.

While the proposed merger has received a thumbs-up from the stock exchanges, it still requires approvals from other regulatory bodies.

""The scheme remains subject to various statutory and regulatory approvals inter alia including approvals from the Reserve Bank of India, the Competition Commission of India, the National Company Law Tribunal and the respective shareholders and creditors of the companies involved in the scheme, as may be required,"" HDFC Bank said.

As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger. Every 25 shares held by HDFC shareholders will fetch them 42 shares of the bank. The merger created an entity that will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs 17.9 lakh crore.

HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh, while announcing the plan, had called it a ""merger of equals"" and attributed tight RBI regulations on non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) as a major reason for the merger.

In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol after the announcement, Parekh, the veteran banker who built the iconic mortgage lender over four decades, had said that it makes sense for the mortgage lender to merge with the bank considering the absence of any regulatory arbitrage for non-banks due to RBI tightening of rules.

Parekh elaborated on how the tight RBI regulations have impacted the NBFC industry. He cited rules on NPA (non-performing assets) and liquidity coverage ratio as examples. Also, the cost of money for NBFCs is on the rise, he said.

HDFC and HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.

With the parent finally giving the go-ahead for the merger, the resultant entity is expected to emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry."

We remain optimistic about the resilience of the Indian economy despite the high volatility in the global environment, said Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC Life Insurance, at the firm's 22nd Annual General Meeting.

He added that the world’s largest COVID vaccination drive has allowed India to swiftly move beyond the acute phase of the pandemic that was witnessed at the start of the last financial year.

""We are now witnessing early signs of a sustainable economic revival. High growth in non-oil and non-gold imports reflects a pickup in domestic demand. Domestic economic activity is fuelled by private consumption and rising discretionary spending,"" Parekh observed.

Furthermore, the forecast for normal southwest monsoon this year is expected to support rural consumption, he said.

Talking about the life insurance industry, he said that despite the pandemic, the Indian life insurance industry’s new business premium grew by 16 percent in FY22. ""India’s insurance penetration and density still remain much lower than the global average, which means with an increase in per capita GDP, there is an immense potential for continued sectoral growth.""

He also reviewed HDFC Life's performance for the year in his speech, calling it ""another strong year of business performance"". ""We maintained our New Business market share of 21 percent and 7.7 percent in private and overall life insurance market, respectively,"" he shared.

The chairman also mentioned HDFC's subsidiaries - Exide Life insurance, HDFC Pension and HDFC International Life and Re, and assured that they ""have all continued to perform well.""

""Factors such as low market penetration, favourable demographics and rising awareness amongst consumers regarding the need for insurance, are considerable tailwinds for the industry,"" he said while adding that the company's ""endeavour is to continue expanding sources of new business and introduce new products whilst ensuring appropriate risk management and business quality.""

In a major achievement, HDFC Life had also announced the first-of-its-kind acquisition in the life insurance industry in January. Talking about it, Parekh said, ""The acquisition and subsequent merger of Exide life insurance will bolster our distribution reach, especially in south India.""

The chairman also welcomed IRDAI's step towards a reforms agenda, ‘Vision 2047’, aimed at ‘Insurance for All’ by 2047, commemorating 100 years of independence.

However, auto, metal, realty and select banks stocks remained under pressure. The broader markets also stayed under control of bears on weak breadth.

The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices fell 2.3 percent and 3.2 percent respectively as about six shares declined for every share rising on the NSE.

India VIX, the fear index that measures volatility in the market, fell by 1.51 percent to 22.41 levels, indicating that the market was volatile and in favour of bears.

Stocks that were in action and sharply outperformed frontline indices included Pidilite Industries, HUL and HDFC which were among top five gainers in the futures & options segment on Monday.

Pidilite Industries gained 5.4 percent at Rs 2,106.65, Hindustan Unilever rose 4 percent t Rs 2,196, and HDFC climbed 4 percent to Rs 2,135.

Here's what Vidnyan Sawant of GEPL Capital recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:.

Pidilite Industries

On longer term charts, Pidilite Industries was moving in a strong uptrend since March 2020. Post August 2021, the stock started to consolidate in a broader range while forming a topping Head and Shoulder pattern.

On the weekly charts, prices formed an Inverted Hammer candle pattern after retesting the neckline which again was followed by a faster retracement of the previous swing. Also the 13 weeks exponential moving average (EMA) which was acting as a strong support to prices has lost its validity and is acting as resistance.

On daily charts, the stock has been sustaining below its 200 days simple moving average (SMA) since last one month indicating negative sentiments of the stock.

The RSI indicator on weekly time frame is below 50 which indicated bearish tone in the stock. We advise traders and investors to exit the positions from Pidilite Industries. Upside resistance for the stock is placed at Rs 2,200 level.

Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever has seen an exceptional uptrend since October 2018. The stock after such an elongated rally saw lower low formation, lower high formation since November 2021.

The stock on the weekly time frame broke the trend line which was respected very well since October 2018, and started acting as a resistance to the prices. We can also spot changes in the polarity of the prices.

On daily time, the stock has been taking strong resistance at 200 days SMA since November 2021. The RSI indicator is below 50 which shows bearish momentum.

The stock may show some pullback. We recommend to hold this with a strict stop-loss of Rs 1,900 mark.

HDFC

On weekly chart of HDFC, we saw some sideways action post breakdown happened at Rs 2,400 levels with volume confirmation. Prices have been maintaining lower low, lower high formation. The downtrend was also preceded by Negative direction.

In the previous week, the stock opened gap down and managed to sustain below the gap. The relative strength index (RSI) indicator is below 50 mark on higher time frame which suggest bearish tone for the stock.

We recommend trader and investors to stay away from HDFC till it sustains below Rs 2,400 mark. Rs 1,800 - 1,900 will act as a downside support for the counter. Level of Rs 2,400 would act as a strong resistance to the prices.

While that title holds good in India as well, some bankers, it appears, are richer — way, way richer — than others.

Dinesh Khara would be able to testify to that.

Khara heads India’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI). He is a powerful man, overseeing assets to the tune of Rs 28.18 lakh crore and loan disbursals of over Rs 50,000 crore in a year. But Khara, who earned an annual salary of Rs 34 lakh in FY22, may not be laughing all the way to the bank. While Rs 34 lakh is a decent pay package for a government-run entity, it pales in comparison with the compensation earned by Khara’s private-sector counterparts in the business of lending. For instance, HDFC Managing Director and CEO Keki Mistry took home a gross package of Rs 19 crore in the financial year 2022. HDFC’s total assets under management (AUM) stood at Rs 6.53 crore as on March-end.

Private bank chiefs

The salaries of the top five private bank leaders, excluding ICICI Bank, ranged between 2.3 crore to Rs 7.1 crore per annum, including perks, in FY21. Private banks are yet to release their FY22 annual report. This story has used the latest numbers where available. Other numbers will be updated as they become available.

The stark difference in the annual salaries of public and private sector bank executives is due to private banks’ performance incentives being attached to their annual remuneration.

The widening divide in salary between top officials in public sector banks (PSBs) and their counterparts in private sector banks and large non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) continues to highlight the wage problem in India’s state-owned banks.

A private bank chief’s salary will be dependent on multiple factors, such as the performance of the bank, including net profit, the performance of subsidiaries, and dividends, among others. The private bank heads also have equity stock ownership plan (ESOP) perks, which are not available in PSU banks.

For example, HDFC Bank granted former MD Aditya Puri a total quantum of 406,140 employee stock options for the performance year 2019-20, basis of approval by the RBI. HDFC Bank Executive Director Kaizad Bharucha was granted a total quantum of 153,300 employee stock options for the performance year 2019-20, while Sashidhar Jagdishan, who took over as HDFC Bank MD and CEO from October 27, 2020, received a total of 260,000 employee stock options.

“The quantum of grant reported for him (Jagdishan) pertains to the grant received in his erstwhile role of Group Head of the Bank during the financial year 2020-21, prior to his appointment as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer,” HDFC Bank’s FY21 annual report said.

Axis Bank MD & CEO Amitabh Chaudhry received a basic salary of over Rs 3.8 crore in FY21, leave fare concession facility of Rs 10 lakh, house rent allowance of Rs 1.07 crore, and perquisites, excluding ESOPs, of Rs 84 lakh, among others.

“Amitabh Chaudhry was granted 16,55,000 stock options, under the Employee Stock Option Scheme of the Bank, since 1 January 2019 being the date of his appointment as the Managing Director & CEO of the Bank….Further, 8,64,500 stock options remain unvested, as on 31 March 2021,” said Axis Bank’s annual report.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, on the other hand, paid Rs 1.8 crore to its Joint MD Dipak Gupta in FY21 with another Rs 1.5 crore as an annual incentive.

“For Mr Uday Kotak and Mr Dipak Gupta, the Annual Incentive includes an amount of ` 8,500,000 for FY 2018-19, approved by the RBI on 6th July 2020 and 7,000,000 for FY 2019-20, as approved by RBI on 26th March 2021,” the bank said.

IndusInd Bank MD & CEO Sumant Kathpalia earned Rs 1.6 crore in annual salary in FY21 and received other allowances amounting to Rs 5.4 crore.

Apart from HDFC, PSU bank heads also earn less than the chiefs of prominent NBFCs such as Bajaj Finance and Mahindra & Mahindra Finance, who paid their leaders over Rs 3.8 crore and over Rs 9 crore, respectively, in remuneration last fiscal year, excluding ESOP grants.

Size doesn't matter

Khara’s remuneration is lower than the Rs 40 lakh that his peer, Bank of Baroda MD & CEO Sanjiv Chadha, earned in the same period, the banks’ annual reports showed. For FY22, Chadha earned Rs 38.19 lakh as annual salary and Rs 2,27,191 in perquisites, while Khara earned Rs 27 lakh in basic pay and Rs 742,500 as dearness allowance.

On a consolidated basis, the salary of the top 5 PSU public sector bank leaders in FY22, excluding Punjab National Bank (PNB), ranged between Rs 34 lakh and Rs 40 lakh.

The salary of whole-time directors (WTD) of PSU banks and other senior officials has to be based on composite performance parameters of the individual and bank, a senior private sector bank official told Moneycontrol.

As per the RBI’s report on trends and progress of banking in India, released on December 28, the gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of all scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) moderated to its lowest level in six years, aided by efforts towards recoveries and technical write-offs.

As of September end, the GNPAs of scheduled commercial banks fell to 6.9 percent from 7.3 percent as on March 31, 2021. Private banks’ GNPAs fell from 5.5 percent in FY20 to 4.9 percent in FY21, while PSU banks’ GNPAs reduced to 9.1 percent in FY21 versus 10.3 percent a year ago.

“Asset quality improved, partly attributable to imposition of the asset classification standstill. Public sector banks (PSBs) reported net profits after a gap of five years. More generally, the capital position of banks improved, aided by recapitalisation by the government as well as raising of funds from the market,” the RBI said.

Apart from most PSBs posting profits in FY22 on an individual basis, SBI’s standalone net profit rose 55% in FY22 over the previous year to Rs 31,676 crore, on the back of stable net interest income and controlled slippages.

“During FY22, your Bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPA) came down by Rs 14,366 crore to Rs 1,12,023 crore. Recoveries and upgradation during the year increased by 21.58% to Rs 21,437 crore. Consequently, the gross NPA ratio of the Bank improved by 101 bps from 4.98% in March 2021. The net NPA of the Bank also improved to 1.02% as of March 2022,” SBI’s annual report said.

“The talent crunch (at PSU banks) can be solved if the Board is also permitted to recruit wholetime directors (WTDs) from the market. Today, these are selected only from public sector banks,” the official said.

“The RBI has issued detailed guidelines for computation of the compensation for wholetime directors of private sector Banks, which include the fixed and variable portion of the compensation. The variable portion also includes ESOPs and cash incentives and the same guidelines should be made applicable for the compensation of WTDs of PSBs too,” the official added.

A senior union leader, however, had a different view on the subject.

“Private banks’ motive is to make a profit, while PSBs’ objective is broad-based economic development and making banking credit and services accessible to all, at affordable prices,” said CH Venkatachalam, General Secretary, All India Bank Employees Association.

There is more security in a PSU bank role but the need for a pay hike is being felt of late as the top job has become stressful now, especially in the face of heightened competition, he added.

The market capitalisation (m-cap) of the top-10 most valued companies eroded by over Rs 2.29 lakh crore last week, with Life Insurance Corporation taking the biggest hit. On a weekly basis, the domestic equity benchmarks witnessed heavy selling.

The Sensex tumbled 1,465.79 points or 2.63 per cent, while the Nifty lost 382.50 points or 2.31 per cent as investors rushed to safer assets because elevated crude oil prices triggered inflation fears. On a weekly basis, the domestic equity benchmarks witnessed heavy selling.

Corporate major Reliance Industries' m-cap fell by Rs 44,311.19 crore to Rs 18,36,039.28 crore. IT bellwethers TCS and Infosys lost Rs 45,746.13 crore from their cumulative market cap. The valuation of TCS stood at Rs 12,31,398.85 crore, while that of Infosys was Rs 6,21,502.63 crore.

The country's top lenders HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI saw a cumulative erosion of Rs 34,970.26 crore in their market capitalisation. HDFC Bank's valuation dipped by Rs 16,433.92 crore to Rs 7,49,880.79 crore.

The m-cap of State Bank of India (SBI) plunged by Rs 2,231.15 crore to Rs 4,12,138.56 crore, and that of ICICI Bank slumped by Rs 16,305.19 crore to Rs 5,00,744.27 crore. The valuation of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) tanked by Rs 21,674.98 crore to Rs 5,16,886.58 crore, while Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) declined by Rs 57,272.85 crore to Rs 4,48,885.09 crore.

HDFC's valuation slipped by Rs 17,879.22 crore to Rs 3,95,420.14 crore. Telecom major Bharti Airtel also witnessed a dip of Rs 7,359.31 crore from its market valuation, which stood at Rs 3,69,613.44 crore.

In the ranking of top-10 firms, Reliance Industries retained the title of the most valued firm, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, Infosys, HUL, ICICI Bank, LIC, SBI, HDFC and Bharti Airtel.

"June 11, 2022 08:19 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/home-loan-demand-set-to-moderate-as-borrowers-brace-for-higher-emis-say-experts-8670151.html,"Demand for home loans is likely to moderate as borrowers confront higher equated monthly instalments (EMIs) after back-to-back repo rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to tame inflation, six bankers and industry experts said.

“Rising interest rates will definitely have a negative impact on the (home loan) demand,” Nirmal Jain, founder of IIFL Group, told Moneycontrol. “Interest rate hikes worth 50-to-100 basis points at this stage can be absorbed, but if they go up further by another 100 bps, there will be an impact on home loan demand; it will slow down.”

On May 4, RBI hiked its repo rate, the rate at which it lends short-term funds to commercial banks, by 40 bps to 4.4 percent and followed it up with a 50-bp increase on June 8, to cool consumer price inflation that accelerated to 7.79 percent in April, a 95-month high.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Across the industry, home loan rates have gone up by 75-to-100 bps, Jain said. Rates can rise by another 75-to-100 basis points at the industry level, assuming the rate hike cycle will continue for some time.

If RBI is compelled to into undertaking more rate hikes, housing loan demand will moderate by a certain degree, Jain added.

EMIs set to rise

Most economists are expecting another repo rate hike of at least 25 bps in the August monetary policy.

Already, a clutch of banks and housing finance companies have begun to pass on higher rates to customers by increasing the marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR) and the retail prime lending rate (RPLR).

Currently, housing finance companies in India lend at RPLR. Most banks peg their loans to MCLR and external benchmarks.

On June 9, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) increased its RPLR by 50 basis points with effect from today. It was the fourth time in a month that India’s largest home loan provider hiked its home loan rate. Home loan rates at HDFC start at 7.55 percent onwards.

With inflation unlikely to cool, the Monetary Policy Committee of RBI is likely to hike the repo rate further in the upcoming policies, which could consequently make EMIs dearer, and could probably deter home loan borrowing.

“In April, the bottom (of home loan rates) were at 6.40 percent to 6.80 percent. Most lenders had their lowest rates pegged in that zone. Adding 90 basis points to that, the bottom moves up to 7.30 percent to 7.70 for existing borrowers,” said Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer at BankBazaar.com. “The days of sub-7.00 percent rates are over. We’ll be nudging 8.00 percent soon.”

Double whammy

For the housing finance sector, high pent-up demand has played out quite well so far. Simply put, pent-up demand is when there is a rapid increase in demand for a product, usually following a period of subdued spending.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, most borrowers deferred their home purchases because of job losses and salary cuts.

“While high-pent up demand is playing out currently due to stamp duty reductions etc, it is unlikely to sustain,” said Nachiket Naik, head of corporate lending at Arka Fincap, a non-banking finance company. “Input cost pressures have risen significantly due to the hike in global commodity prices, resulting in higher asset prices which, coupled with a higher cost of borrowing, will mean a double whammy for home buyers.”

For banks, it makes sense to pass on rate hikes to borrowers and enjoy higher margins because there is sufficient liquidity in the system and the cost of deposits need not be high.

“Once the RBI sucks out more liquidity from the banking system, banks would be forced to increase deposit rates,” said an executive director at a state-run bank, requesting anonymity. “At that point, the transmission of higher interest rates to borrowers will be more aggressive than what it is now. So pent-up demand is bound to dry up.”

The banker added that a “sizeable portion” of the bank’s loan book is linked to external benchmarking.

Aka Fincap’s Naik added that the impact will be more in the affordable housing segment where the operating margins are “significantly thinner” than in the premium segment. The pass-through of rate hikes will be back-ended and that should lead to a slowdown in demand for housing loans eventually, he added.

Options for borrowers

With back-to-back hikes, home loan rates are expected to increase rapidly. In this scenario, what should borrowers do to lessen the burden of high home loan EMIs?

“Pre-pay,” said BankBazaar.com’s Shetty. “There are two scenarios here. One: inflation rises now but moderates by 2023. In that case, go for moderate pre-payments. Borrowers can voluntarily increase EMIs or pre-pay strategically to nullify the tenor extension. Both these options will shave months or years off the loan.”

“If inflation continues to be high and the rates start inching towards double digits, borrowers can pre-pay aggressively,” Shetty added.

Borrowers can also get the lowest rates by improving their loan eligibility, said experts. This happens largely with income stability and a credit score.​"
"June 10, 2022 02:01 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-adia-investment-key-to-penetrating-deeper-into-affordable-housing-segment-says-iifl-groups-nirmal-jain-8668711.html,"Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) will invest Rs 2,200 crore for a 20 percent stake in IIFL Home Finance, which had Assets Under Management of Rs 23,617 crore as of March-end. The deal the sovereign wealth fund signed with IIFL Finance, the parent of IIFL Home, marks one of the biggest investments in the affordable housing segment in India.

In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Nirmal Jain, founder of IIFL Group, said ADIA’s investment would be used to penetrate deeper into the affordable housing segment and target under-served markets in Tier 4 or Tier 5 markets.

Home loan rates can rise by another 75-to-100 basis points at the industry level, assuming the rate hike cycle by the Reserve Bank of India, will continue for some time, Jain said. He also spoke about the impact the merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and HDFC Bank will have on smaller housing finance companies.

Edited excerpts:

What would the proceeds of the ADIA investment be used for?

IIFL Home Finance has been growing at a fairly good pace... The market opportunity is big because in the affordable housing finance segment there are not too many players. This is a huge under-penetrated market and affordable housing finance is something which even banks have not been able to capture - people who are self-employed or those in the informal sector, where documents are not fool-proof. There are so many smaller towns and places in India where credit still has to go deeper. And this is what we would want to target now that we have the investment from ADIA. We want to grow the business across the country.

Which new geographies are you looking to tap?

There are many districts that we need to penetrate deeper. Right now, housing finance is operating in 230 cities across India. When we say new markets, we mean that we would want to target the under-served markets in Tier 4 or Tier 5 towns and cities. We will go deeper in these markets.

What is your outlook on branch expansion?

Right now, we are present across 16 states and two Union territories with 230 branches. We will continue to expand branches. IIFL Finance, which is the holding company, will set up 300 new branches in FY23.

How will the rate hikes impact demand for housing loans?

Rising interest rates will definitely have a negative impact on the demand. But at this point in time, demand has been very strong. There is pent-up demand. Interest rate hikes worth 50-to-100 basis points at this stage can be absorbed, but if they go up further by another 100 bps, there will be an impact on home loan demand; it will slow down. It is a function of two things — one, economic activity and second is the interest rates. One good thing is that housing prices, in nominal terms, have grown at a much slower pace in the last 20 years compared with the income. But I agree that if interest rates further go up, there will be some impact on demand.

By how much will home loan rates rise across the industry given that the rate hike cycle is expected to continue?

Currently, across the industry, home loan rates have gone up by 75-to-100 bps. These rates are for a period of one year and these are floating rates. I think the rate increases in the shorter end of the G-Sec yield curve will get passed on, and we may see rates rise by another 75-to-100 basis points at the industry level, assuming the rate hike cycle will continue for some time. If RBI is compelled to take more rate hikes, then housing demand, which is very robust, will see some moderation.

What is your outlook on interest rates?

Any guess at this point in time looks difficult. It will largely depend on the trajectory of crude oil prices, economic environment in developed countries and inflation.

How do you assess the impact of RBI’s rate hike on the affordable housing market?

This is a hugely under-penetrated market and I think the relative impact of rate hike will be less in the affordable housing segment. Since the loan amount is small, the rate hike can be absorbed. At the same time, we also have to see that our cost-to-income (ratio) should be efficient enough to absorb some of the cost. This segment is very large. Some of the housing finance companies that cater to this market have scaled back or wound up. So competitive intensity for this has reduced and the demand remains strong.

What would be the impact on your margins?

We won’t have much of an impact on our margins because we are able to pass on the rate hike to our customers. Almost the entire loan book is linked to external benchmarking or floating rate. We do not have a fixed rate for long-term loans. We normally do not lend for a very long term. If you lend for a long term, then you do not have the flexibility to increase the tenor. So, instead of increasing the EMI (equated monthly instalment), most lenders, most housing finance companies, tend to increase the tenor. This helps in repayment and collection.

Do you have any growth target for Assets under Management (AUM) in FY23?

It is difficult to make a forward-looking statement at this point. But, if the industry is growing at 15-to-20 percent, our AUM should be able to grow slightly faster than that.

How has asset quality panned out for IIFL Home Finance?

This quarter what has happened is that all the moratorium and restructuring that was offered is over. We are seeing that most customers have started to make the scheduled payments or else they are classified as delinquent or Non-Performing Assets (NPA).

What is the outlook on NPAs?

We expect asset quality trends to improve from here. Our NPA ratios will improve; after the third COVID wave, collections have also been improving. Our target is to bring down the gross NPA ratio to below 2 percent of our loan book in this financial year. We also aim to have more than 100 percent coverage on these. Home loan NPAs will be brought below 1 percent of our loan book in FY23; that is our target.

How will the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger impact smaller players in the industry?

Since it is a merger behemoth, we expect them to focus more on large, premium customers. They would probably look for co-lending or partnership arrangements for affordable loans or small ticket segments. So, it may not impact us much."

The house loan rate hike comes into effect from June 10, 2022.

This is the fourth time that HDFC hiked its home loan rates in one month. The previous hike had come on June 1, when home loan rates had been increased by five basis points. Prior to that, the rates were hiked on May 9 (by 30 bps) and on May 2, by five bps.

Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank have also hiked their interest rates recently. While Kotak Mahindra Bank has announced a rise in interest rates on savings accounts and fixed deposits following the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) repo rate hike by 50 bps, ICICI Bank has increased rates on its FDs. The ICICI Bank FD interest rate hike came into effect on June 7 and the Kotak Mahindra Bank rate hike will come into effect on June 13.

"June 09, 2022 09:09 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-hdfc-bank-asks-parent-to-cut-exposure-to-certain-loans-before-merger-8661791.html,"India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank is said to have asked its parent Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) to cut exposure to a certain category of loans that are not permitted for banks under Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations.

These are mostly short-term loans that include certain corporate loans and loans to developers. It is estimated that the value of this chunk of loans will be around Rs 20,000-25,000 crore on HDFC's book at present, part of which will get extinguished over the next few quarters.

Even then, it is estimated that HDFC will have less than approximately Rs 10,000 crore such loans on its books prior to the merger.

“The bank has asked HDFC to pare down exposure to all such loans that aren’t compliant with RBI rules for banks. They have time to do it in the next 15 months or so before the merger take effect,” said a person familiar with the development.

The person declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the matter. HDFC Bank didn’t respond to a query from Moneycontrol on this issue.

HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge on April 4. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.

HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh called it a merger of equals. Every 25 shares held by HDFC shareholders will fetch them 42 shares of the bank. The merger will create an entity that will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs 17.9 lakh crores.

The announcement came as a surprise to most analysts. Markets cheered the decision.

In an exclusive conversation with the media after the announcement, Parekh, the veteran banker who built the iconic mortgage lender over four decades, explained to Moneycontrol on April 5 why the company decided to merge with the bank and the challenges on culture integration.

HDFC is the largest mortgage lender in India, whereas HDFC Bank is the largest private lender in terms of assets. The bank, however, has only a relatively small presence in the housing loan market compared with rivals.

The HDFC-HDFC Bank merger is expected by the second or third quarter of FY24. HDFC too had said the proposed transaction will enable HDFC Bank to build its housing loan portfolio and enhance its customer base.

HDFC and HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour. But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders.

With the parent finally joining up with the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry.

HDFC is awaiting regulatory guidance on the path forward for its mega merger with HDFC Bank and needs shareholders’ trust and support “more than ever before” at this juncture, Parekh said in the company’s annual report.

“We have at length, already articulated the rationale for the proposed merger, which takes cognisance of the future growth potential of the country, the evolving macro environment and changes in the regulatory architecture,” he added."

At least till the June policy we will not see corporates, especially banks and NBFCs, borrow from the bond market,” added Manglunia.

“Issuers are not in a hurry to tap the debt market. There is no sense of urgency to borrow at elevated levels (as) alternatively they get bank credit at better levels than bond yields,” said Ajay Manglunia, managing director and head of investment grade group, JM Financial.

Indian banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are likely to push back fundraising via bonds due to volatility in the debt market, according to experts. A majority of fund managers and money market experts Moneycontrol spoke to said issuers are likely to wait at least till the next monetary policy decision to assess the impact on the debt market and take a call on fundraising.

This isn’t all. According to dealers, more issuers are likely to scrap their planned bond issuances in approaching days if investors demand very high returns.

Also, mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) received a tepid response for its Rs 12,000-crore issue on May 24, being able to raise only Rs 7,743 crore from the bond market. The 10-year issue was at an annual coupon of 7.86 percent.

National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) on May 25 cancelled a planned Rs 5,000-crore primary three-year bond sale citing higher coupon bids, said at least three money market participants. None of them agreed to be identified saying they are not authorised to speak to the media.

RBI cues spooks markets

The rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in an off-cycle meeting on May 4 hiked the repo rate by 40 basis points (bps) due to concerns of high inflation. Jayanth Varma, a member of the panel, had said the MPC may have to raise rates by around 100 bps “very soon”.

Government bond yields jumped following the rate hike, with the 10-year yield spiking to a three-year high of 7.49 percent on May 9. However, most banks did not raise their Marginal Cost of Fund-based Lending Rate (MCLR) by that amount, which entices borrowers towards bank loans rather than the debt market.

Corporate bond yields move in line with government bond yields. However, corporates have to pay a higher premium to investors for their investments given the higher risk involved. This difference between the two is called the “spread”. Money market experts said that the spread between corporate bonds and government securities is not very attractive at current levels, which is why investors are choosing to stay away. This has also deterred banks and NBFCs from tapping the debt market.

“Spreads between corporate bonds and government securities are below the historical average due to ample liquidity in the system and low corporate bond issuance post TLTRO (targeted long-term repo operations),” said Sanjay Pawar, fund manager (fixed income) at LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management.

Chances of the spread moving to the historical average looks “bleak” as corporate bond supply is likely to be low, Pawar said. Large issuers may not borrow as stated in their budgets, he added.

Uneasiness in corporate debt market

Issuers of corporate bonds are also seeking clarity on where interest rates are headed vis-a-vis inflation. In an interview to CNBC-TV18 on May 23, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das had said that another repo rate hike in the next meeting was “a no-brainer”. Das had also said that the recently announced fiscal measures, which includes an excise duty cut on petrol and diesel, will have a “sobering impact” on inflation going forward.

Economists have said that the fiscal measures could possibly lower inflation in the coming months, but would not hold back the MPC from raising interest rates. Barclays expects the MPC to raise the repo rate by 50 bps next month.

“The corporate debt market is still wary of higher rates and is choosing to delay fundraising,” said Raju Sharma, chief investment officer, debt, at IDBI Mutual Fund. “Most of the companies have borrowed funds at a lower interest rate in the past two years and, hence, may want to wait for the market to stabilise.”

“The 10-year government bond yield is very sensitive currently — it can fluctuate in a wide range of 7.10 percent to 7.45 percent, depending on the news flow. This, coupled with a possibility of a rate hike in June, has probably kept issuers at bay,” Sharma added.

Lull ahead in bond market?

According to money market experts, corporate bond issues of banks and NBFCs are likely to stay subdued till bond yield spreads adjust, clarity on interest rates emerges and investor demand returns. Any immediate fund requirement can be tackled through commercial paper or a certificate of deposit, they added.

“The fiscal measures are likely to taper down inflation and may not warrant aggressive rate hikes. That may be clear in the June policy,” said JM Financial’s Manglunia.

“Although the next rate hike is priced in, issuers would want to get a clear picture on where rates are headed and how aggressive the monetary policy action will be,” he added.

LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management’s Pawar said that major bond issuances will only pick up from the second half of this financial year when festive season demand emerges and as issuers’ expectations are in sync with investors’ demands. The investor community will also have some more clarity on future RBI actions, he said."

Updates from the two most valuable HDFC group companies, HDFC Ltd and HDFC Bank, about the status of foreign shareholding show there is plenty of room for investors to buy in.

Foreign investors held 68.56 percent in Housing Finance Development Corporation Ltd and 66.55 percent in HDFC Bank as on May 13, stock exchange notices showed. Further, the foreign institutional investor (FII) shareholding in HDFC Bank included 20.98 percent owned by HDFC Ltd and its units.

Both firms have been receiving queries from investors seeking information on their aggregate foreign shareholding.

HDFC Bank shares’ tepid performance over the past year had led the street to believe there was little room left for foreign investors, given that demand for the stock from this class of investors was strong compared with that from domestic investors. Foreign shareholding is capped at 74 percent for HDFC Bank.

The proposed merger between HDFC Bank and HDFC was expected to free up room for foreign investors to buy. Through the merger, every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of HDFC Bank for 25 shares they hold in the mortgage giant.

Post-merger, foreign shareholding in HDFC Bank is expected to be 66 percent and may dip further. Since the merger announcement, HDFC Bank and HDFC have fallen over 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively. In comparison, benchmarks Sensex and Nifty lost a little over 10 percent each over this period.

However, analysts believe the inclusion of the merged entity in the MSCI India index may be difficult, as it requires a larger FII headroom (from cap) for inclusion.

Analysts said based on the current methodologies being used for index construction, the weight of the merged entity could be 15 percent in the Nifty 50 and that in the MSCI India index could be very low, assuming no meaningful change in shareholding between now and the merger date. This would make it difficult for both domestic money managers (who are benchmarked to the Nifty) and foreign money managers who are benchmarked to MSCI.

HDFC has said that index providers (MSCI, FTSE) are reviewing the transaction especially in the context of the merger vis-a-vis consideration of combined entities as new entrants and may consider both free float percentage and free float value."
"May 11, 2022 05:36 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/high-interest-rates-may-not-dent-housing-loan-demand-in-india-say-experts-8489921.html,"Floating-rate home loans sanctioned after October 1, 2019 are linked to an external benchmark, which in case of most banks is the repo rate. Since it now stands revised to 4.4 percent, all new retail loans linked to it will see an equivalent rise in their interest rates.

Demand for housing loans in India may not shrink even as the country’s rate-setting panel embarks on a gradual normalisation of interest rates. Despite the probability of continued rate hikes in the coming months, home loan rates are expected to be cheaper compared to pre-Covid levels and could be attractive for borrowers, according to at least six experts and officials at housing finance companies with whom Moneycontrol spoke to on Wednesday, May 11.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in a surprise move hiked the repo rate by 40 basis points to 4.40 percent on May 4, citing inflationary concerns. The repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends short-term funds to banks. Lenders, of course, have the option of whether or not to pass the rate hike on to borrowers.

Following the RBI’s move, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) increased its retail prime lending rate (RPLR) on housing loans by 30 basis points, applicable to both existing and new borrowers, from May 9. Simply put, RPLR is the rate at which housing finance companies lend to their most creditworthy customers. Following the RPLR hike, interest rates on HDFC’s home loans will be in the range of 7 percent to 7.45 percent, which will automatically translate into higher equated monthly instalments (EMIs) and/or longer tenures of the loans for borrowers.

Despite the increase, though, experts point out home loans are cheaper than compared to the 8 percent and more levels just before the pandemic. That apart, the expectation of a rise in interest rates largely rests on the premise that rate hikes by the RBI will be gradual. In a fiercely competitive market, large housing financiers would also shy away from continuously raising home loan rates.

“Currently, the lowest rates have nudged towards 7 percent on small loans under Rs 30 lakh, while they are still under 7.5 percent for large loans above Rs 75 lakh,” said Pankaj Bansal, chief business officer (CBO) at BankBazaar.com. “The thing that impacts the decision to buy property the most is the buyer’s readiness.”

Borrowers also have the option to go for longer-term loans or prepaying a part of the existing loan to cushion and spread out the impact of higher EMIs when the overall interest goes up, say experts.

According to Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, economic recovery is picking up and credit growth will be continue to be high despite the rise in rates. Both banks and housing finance companies will benefit from this trend, he said.

Fundamental factors at play

Experts and industry officials said that even though rate hikes are a sentiment dampener, they cannot be the sole reason why a committed buyer decides to not seek financing. A lot of fundamental factors, like geographies, demographics and growing culture of nuclear families too come into play. Housing demand is also supported by favourable tax regimes and the government’s thrust on the sector.

According to a recent CRISIL report, the momentum in housing demand across India’s top six cities is expected to continue in this fiscal year and grow 5-to-10 percent despite rising property prices, interest rates and a high base effect, supported by favourable demographics and urbanisation. The rating agency estimates that housing demand rose a solid 33-38 percent in the last fiscal year ended March 31, surpassing pre-Covid-19 levels, albeit on a lower base.

“Demand for housing is mildly impacted by interest rates, while fundamental factors play a major role,” said Jairam Sridharan, managing director of Piramal Capital Housing Finance.

“When the interest rates were historically low over the last two years, demand for housing was subdued as incomes did not rise. Now, home prices are suppressed and affordability has improved and the accumulated demand for housing will start showing, irrespective of the rise in rates,” he added.

In fact, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh in an earlier interview to Moneycontrol said in his 44-year stint with HDFC, he had not seen housing demand the way it is today. Parekh had said that the large inventory of unsold housing inventory is also being liquidated because people have started buying homes.

According to BankBazaar’s annual Aspiration Index survey, the two most important things for Indians are home ownership and saving for children’s education, said the BankBazaar CBO, adding that Indians will seek to fulfil this aspiration despite the challenges.

However, Piramal Capital Housing Finance’s Sridharan said that housing finance companies will have to figure out a strategy to balance their assets and liabilities in a rising interest rate scenario.

“The key challenge will be to hold on to rates, while on the liability side housing financiers would want to assess how much of their liabilities is exposed to higher rates. For some time, the liability side will dominate and squeeze margins,” Sridharan added."

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), the country’s largest mortgage lender has increased its Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR) by 30 basis points (BPS) with effect from May 09, 2022. (1 bps = 0.01 percentage point)

The company's Adjustable Rate Home Loans (ARHL) is benchmarked on the RPLR on housing loans, which means availing the facility is now costlier for customers.

Below is the revised rates as per the rate increase:

This rate hike comes after the lender increased RPLR by 5 bps on May 2, irrespective of the loan amount.

Notably, State Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank and Bank of Bank of Baroda, also increased their marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR), in anticipation of a repo rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as early as June.

On April 4, HDFC said its board approved the merger of its wholly owned subsidiaries HDFC Investmentsand HDFC Holdings with HDFC Bank. HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger, according to an HDFC Bank filing with the stock exchanges.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC

HDFC reported a good quarter with all core metrics beating estimates. AuM growth was higher at 14% YoY mainly driven by individual loans while NII and margins too were ahead of projections. Core PPoP was ahead by 5.1% while due to softer provisions, PAT was a beat by 12%. FY22 core PAT at Rs104.5bn (+26.4% YoY). Management indicated that home loan demand remains strong while construction finance could see an uptick. Certain aspects of the merger were clarified i.e. HDFC Ltd’s non-individual loans, borrowings and deposits would form part of the merged balance sheet.



Outlook

We cut FY23/24E earnings by average 8% led by lower NII also trimming our core FY24 ABV multiple from 3.3x to 2.7x. Revise SoTP from Rs3,228 to Rs2,900 but maintain BUY.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), the country’s largest mortgage lender, on May 1 raised the Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR) on home loans by five basis points, irrespective of the loan amount. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

This means HDFC’s floating-rate home loans for customers with a credit score of over 750 will now carry an interest rate of 6.75 percent, up from 6.70 percent earlier.

The move comes after a clutch of banks, including State Bank of India, Axis Bank and Bank of Bank of Baroda, increased their marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR), in anticipation of a repo rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India as early as June.

Borrowers taking home loans are bracing for higher interest rates in the coming months amid inflationary pressures.

What is the RPLR?

RPLR is the rate at which housing finance companies lend to their most creditworthy customers. It determines most of the interest rates charged by lenders and is the benchmark on which housing financiers price their loans to customers. RPLR is derived from the average cost of funds for the lender. The rate includes the historical cost of the bank in raising deposits, the cost of the cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio, maintenance and the operating and other costs that lenders incur. Currently, housing finance companies in India lend at RPLR. Most banks peg their loans to MCLR and external benchmarks.

In the case of HDFC, the RPLR is also the rate at which its Adjustable-Rate Home Loans (ARHL) are benchmarked. ARHLs are also known as floating or variable rate loans. Any increase in HDFC’s RPLR will lead to a similar hike in home loan rates.

How do housing financiers derive the home loan rate from RPLR?

Since the RPLR is the benchmark at which their most creditworthy borrowers are given loans, housing financiers charge a spread over the rate for other customers. This spread is to compensate the bank for taking a higher credit risk. The final lending rate would include the credit risk spread and the tenure premium.

Policy rate changes trickle down to the RPLR and to the loan market. The discretion of passing on policy rate hikes or cuts depends on the housing finance company and its borrowing costs.

How does an RPLR hike impact borrowers?

An increase in RPLR would increase the interest burden on the borrower. In other words the number of equated monthly instalments (EMIs) may increase as the tenure of the loan increases or the EMIs may increase.

For example, for a 15-year home loan of Rs 1 crore, a 5 basis point hike in RPLR would increase the borrower’s EMI by Rs 400 every month.

Does the RPLR hike impact new borrowers?

The interest rate change will be effective only for existing customers. There will be no change in the interest rate for new customers.

How can borrowers reduce their home loan interest rate?

Existing borrowers can reduce their interest burden by reducing the tenure of their loans. Note that the interest rate charged on the loan consists of a tenure premium too. Even though a longer tenure may entail a smaller EMI, the interest burden increases due to a bigger repayment timeline.

Borrowers could also try to make prepayments from time to time. Prepaying a part of the loan reduces the amount on which interest would be charged. Most lenders have a daily-reducing balance policy in which the loan amount is reduced on the same day as the prepayment."

At this point, there is a serious question India’s shadow banks ask themselves: What’s the way ahead?

The fact that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been sending an unmistakable signal to this category of companies was clear for a while now. The choice given to NBFCs was either to stay within a certain size and comply with bank-like regulations (for bigger ones) or choose to become banks.

But here too, there was a catch; the RBI doesn’t want corporate-owned NBFCs to wear the hat of a bank. This made the whole scenario tricky. But, the big eye-opener came when the long-awaited-yet-surprising (going by the timing) announcement of merger by Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and HDFC Bank on April 4.

What invited attention was Deepak Parekh’s initial comments after the merger announcement. Parekh, a veteran in Indian banking, didn’t hesitate to admit that a primary reason or one of the main reasons why HDFC chose to merge with the bank was vanishing regulatory arbitrage. Parekh cited rising cost for NBFCs to raise funds and tight regulations on NPA (non-performing assets) and capital adequacy stipulated by the RBI for NBFCs.

To be sure, HDFC, being the largest mortgage lender with deep pockets, could have continued as an independent entity but still it chose to merge citing the likely tough scenario going ahead. So, what’s the big takeaway from Parekh's comments to other NBFCs?

NBFCs need to rethink their industry positioning going ahead. The primary reason why many NBFCs chose to be so—the benefit of lighter regulations vis-à-vis banks—no longer exists. That's a major point to ponder for other NBFCs, not just the mid and smaller ones but also for the bigger ones. The RBI has grouped NBFCs into multiple layers depending on their size and interconnectedness.

The upper layer falls in the category that are essentially no different from banks in terms of most regulations. It is reserved for companies that are perceived to carry elevated risks akin to banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework.

The regulator on November 12 also came out with a clarification on upgrading of assets that resulted in a rise in reported gross NPAs of most non-banks in Q3FY22. It makes sense for this segment of NBFCs to become banks for future growth and ease of compliance. Becoming a bank will give them access to cheaper funds and freedom to grow business as they wish to.

As Moneycontrol reported in this story, some analysts have already begun hinting on serious consolidation. They say for all practical reasons, it makes sense for mid-sized ones to merge with banks. This will enable them to grow further as well as for regulatory compliance. In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol over the week end, Parekh yet again alluded to the tight RBI regulations for NBFCs and agreed that the central bank is worried about rising number of failures in NBFC space which leaves it with no other options but to act tough.

Going ahead, we will likely see significantly less number of NBFCs in the mid and large segment. Large scale consolidation in the NBFC industry is now very much a possibility. Only the corporate-owned ones may continue in the current form. Others may have to restructure ownership and business model. Some may opt for consolidation and rest try to become banks. A clearer picture will emerge over the next few years.

Mortgage lender HDFC increased its Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR) on housing loans, on which its Adjustable Rate Home Loans (ARHL) are benchmarked by 5 basis points, the company said in an exchange filing on May 1.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) had last month said its board has approved the merger of its wholly owned subsidiaries HDFC Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited with HDFC Bank Limited.

A host of large banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), hiked their marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5-10 basis points last month. After the RPLR hike, HDFC’s adjustable-rate home loans for customers with a credit score of above 750 will now be 6.75 percent as against 6.7 percent earlier.

For loans of up to Rs 30 lakh, customers would be charged an interest rate of 6.85 percent. Loans ranging between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 75 lakh will have an interest rate of 7.10, and those above Rs 75 lakh will have an interest rate of 7.20 per cent. For women customers in all segments, the interest rate is 5 basis points lower, according to a report by Business Standard.

Adjustable-rate home loan (ARHL) is also known as a floating or a variable rate loan. The interest rate in an ARHL is linked to HDFC’s benchmark rate i.e, RPLR, and any movement in HDFC’s RPLR may effectuate a change in the applicable interest rates.

SBI has raised its MCLR by 10 basis points, with effect from April 15, across all tenors (100 bps = 1 percentage point). The one-year MCLR has been revised to 7.1 percent while two- and three-year MCLRs have been raised to 7.3 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively.

The MCLR is a benchmark interest rate, which is the minimum rate at which banks are allowed to lend. Most loans are linked to the one-year MCLR.

Bank, the third-largest private-sector lender in the country, and Kotak Mahindra Bank hiked their MCLR by 5 basis points. While Kotak Mahindra Bank increased its one-year MCLR to 7.4 percent, from April 16, public sector lender Bank of Baroda increased its MCLR by 5 basis points from April 12.

The increase in lending rates comes after the Reserve Bank of India’s hawkish stance in the recently concluded monetary policy meeting last month as it turned its focus to tackle inflation from supporting growth.

Due to the ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance and excess liquidity in the system for the last two years, interest rates are at an all-time low with many lenders offering mortgage loans as low as 6.5 percent."

Shares of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India’s largest mortgage lender, and HDFC Bank have slumped close to 15 percent each after the initial euphoria over their merger announcement on April 4.

HDFC vice-chairman and managing director Keki Mistry spoke with CNBC-TV18 on what the merger means for customers, about concerns emerging over post-merger synergies, particularly in the distribution of housing loans, and also on cross-selling opportunities for HDFC Bank.

The recent selling of shares by investors is due to a lack of communication between management and investors. The deal will be EPS (earnings per share)- accretive from day 1, Mistry said.

Edited excerpts:

The whole discussion around the proposed merger has been from the shareholders' point of view. What would be the impact of the merger on HDFC and HDFC Bank, fund raising?

Now, we will not be borrowing money as a housing finance company. We would be getting money through savings, current accounts and deposits like other banks. So, the cost of funding should come down.

Secondly, we will have the full HDFC Bank platform to distribute housing loans. Today, as you look at it, HDFC Bank does not source housing loans. Ones that do the sourcing of loans for us take about 27% of our business. In half of the places, HDFC does not have a presence in a nearby location. Ideally, we would like to have our offices in a nearby location to meet the customer. In case there is a delay in making payments, we can also contact the customer. So, when we become one entity, the full array of banking branches will be available to us for distribution (of housing loans). The shareholders of the bank will have our 40 years of experience in the mortgage business, which is time-tested and which is reflected in the fact that despite showing growth year after year, our asset quality in retail loans is impeccable. right from the time of the total money losses when we write off individual retail loans. It is less than 2 bps (basis points) of our total business bps. This is cumulative. In a period of 40 years.

Will the merger lead to potentially selling non-housing loans to your HDFC customers?

In terms of our ability to cross-sell, if we look at our customer base, 70% of our customers do not bank with HDFC Bank. These customers have a good association with HDFC because we help them buy a house, which is like the single largest possession. If we go back to these customers and say we are now one entity and ask them to shift their banking needs to HDFC Bank, we will get assistance on it.

Why is there selling pressure on your stocks? What is the feedback that you have received from your discussion with foreign shareholders?

The only reason we think there is selling is because we were not being able to communicate some of these (facts) to our investors after the Board meeting. This is one reason. Another reason is mass-scale foreign selling. Both HDFC and HDFC Bank are extremely liquid counters. Foreign investors are pulling out from emerging markets either due to higher interest rates in the US market or the Russia-Ukraine (war) impact. But the investors we talked to have not expressed any real concern over this (merger). As things get clearer with the passage of time, the stocks will move up logically.

The proposed merger will lead to higher CRR (cash reserve ratio) and SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) requirements. What concessions have you sought from the regulator in meeting the requirements?

We spoke with regulators. We sought some degree of forbearance to create this CRR, SLR and PSL (priority sector lending) over a period of three years. We are awaiting a response from the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) on the matter. We will work through it. We do not believe the regulatory process would impact the synergies that we are gaining and the synergies will more than offset any regulatory cost.

The proposed merger will see the housing book increase to one-third of the bank's book. Hence, there is a feeling that this may lead to a drag on the net interest margins while the operational costs will also increase for the bank if they open more branches. What is your view on the margin pressures that could kick in? Could the return ratios as well drag post the merger?

Why would the net interest margin reduce? HDFC today, as a mortgage company at a higher cost of funding, had a net interest margin in the last quarter at 3.5%. The bank's net interest margin is 4%. When we migrate from a largely wholesale funding structure to a more banking structure, the reduction in the cost of funds logically has to be much more than 50 bps. If it is more than 50 bps, logically it will happen, then automatically the 3.5% net interest margin we are having would be well over 4%...I don't see any drag on the net interest margin beyond an immediate couple of quarters. As far as earnings per share are concerned, it will be EPS-accretive from day one. The combined profitability of the two entities should be more than the standalone profits of HDFC Bank and HDFC as separate entities. The number of shares would come down by the virtue of the fact that the 21% shareholding of HDFC in the bank will get cancelled. So, it will be EPS-accretive from day one.

Analysts say the merger move works well for HDFC shareholders and not as well for HDFC Bank shareholders. What is your take?

HDFC Bank does not have a mortgage product. All banks today have mortgage products. Despite all other banks having mortgage products, HDFC Bank grew its individual loan book by as much as 16% in the December (quarter) period. Housing loans in the banking system are under 10% (of total lending). So, despite the fact that we don't have a banking structure, despite the fact that bank did not source housing loans from different locations, we gained market share in that period. So, imagine when all the branches of HDFC Bank start sourcing loans for us, the quantum of housing loans the bank generates will logically increase. That will be a huge benefit to the bank. Also, the fact that the housing loan book carries longer maturity enhances the overall maturity of loans for the bank and the overall duration of assets of the bank…The benefit of the lower cost structure will move on to the bank. There are enough synergies for the shareholders of HDFC Bank.​"

Saurabh Mukherjea, chief investment officer (CIO), Marcellus Investment Managers, spoke on concerns emerging around the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger, about the sharp fall in the shares of HDFC twins, underperformers Nestle & Asian Paints, and on margins coming down in the Q4 for the consumption companies.

Dismissing concerns around the growth outlook for HDFC Bank going forward, Saurabh Mukherjea, speaking in an interview with CNBC-TV18, did not slash the earnings growth estimates going forward, and said the stock will continue to give high premiums for investors in the long term.

On being asked over some concerns regarding the weakness in HDFC twins after the merger announcement, Mukherjea said HDFC Bank was an outperformer in the private banking space in the last five years.

The analyst believed the stock price movement is momentary and the superior asset quality will keep the returns intact for investors.

Outlining his reason for this outlook, he stated he was positive about HDFC Bank with a long-term view. Mukherjea further said HDFC Bank could deliver around 20 percent, from a long-term perspective.

Mukherjea, reacting to a question on HDFC Bank and HDFC stocks witnessing sell off recently in the run up to the merger, said, ""Last five years have been spectacular. They have just blazed away. 20 percent loan book compounding and 20 percent deposits compounding.”

He also believed no other bank remotely matches up to HDFC Bank.

The analyst said, "" No other bank in the private space has been able to compete with HDFC Bank on both sides of the balance sheet. On gross and net NPAs also, no other private sector bank is even close to HDFC Bank. If HDFC's 2 percent ROA is seen, it is difficult to see any other with 2 percent ROA. If we look at the performance of HDFC Bank in the last 15 years, it is in a completely different league. Even in the last 3 years, no other bank came close to such performance.""

On being questioned again over pre-provisioning operating profits of HDFC Bank slightly looking weaker, Mukherjea said, ""We have to back companies which have delivered through decades in a stellar fashion. So, we back such companies which give 20-25 percent returns on our clients' investments.""

Coming out in defence of the merger, Mukherjea said, ""The merger will bring two very profitable businesses together. We will see their ROEs exceed and growth reaching high.""

The market expert added, ""Currently, HDFC Bank's mortgage runs on HDFC, so HDFC Bank's growth is reduced. When HDFC Bank holds on to mortgages, it will accelerate.""

Since their merger announcement on April 4, shares of HDFC Bank and HDFC tanked close to 15 percent each.

HDFC Bank, the largest private sector lender in India, on April 16 reported a 23 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone net profit at Rs 10,055.2 crore for the quarter ended March 2022 as bad loans provisions declined 29 percent, with further improvement in asset quality. But the lender’s operating performance showed spots of trouble. Operating profit growth was just 10.2 percent for the quarter and the net interest margin was at a record low.

The analyst stated the succession plan for HDFC Bank was taken care of, when asked whether the new leadership will continue to produce the kind of results it gave and if there is a reason to worry.

Dismissing such concerns, the market expert said, ""We have closely monitored the succession planning. Shashi was mentored and trained by the erstwhile CEO. The operating metrics from the time Sahshi took charge are stellar. They are growing at a fast pace. Delivery impeccable on asset quality and growth. I give 10/10 to Sahshi.""

Mukherjea is also extremely bullish on Nestle India and Asian Paints.

The expert termed both the stocks which are market-leading franchises have been compounding consistently, and added, slight margin pressures witnessed by Nestle India do not add any material value.

He said, ""Nestle's share price compounded around 25 percent in the last five years. Profits compounded to 22-23 percent. It is obviously a dominant player in its category. There is food cost pressure. It utterly dominates the category that is a compulsory purchase.""

Mukherjea, reacting to the performance of Asian Paints in the stock market, said margin pressures of the company should not be a concern for long-term investors.

""Whenever crude doubles over a two-year period, Asian Paints' operating gross margins are solid. This results in the share rallying. Share price of Asian Paints in the last 12 months compounded. It has gained rapidly in the last 4-5 years,"" said Mukherjea.

The expert noted rising raw material costs and inflation have acted as a dampener for both the business companies.

Nestle India on April 21 reported a 1.3 percent decline in its net profit to Rs 594.7 crore for the quarter ended March, which came in below Street expectations of Rs 625 crore. It registered a 10.2 percent growth in revenues from operations to Rs 4,002.14 crore.

Talk of the US Federal Reserve going in for tapering quicker than expected and geopolitical tensions around Russia warning Sweden and Finland against NATO membership also had investors worried.

At close, the Sensex settled 1.23 percent lower at 56,463 points, while the Nifty fell 1.25 percent to 16,958 points. Both benchmarks have now declined for eight of nine trading sessions, shedding over 7 percent each. Investors lost Rs 10 lakh crore in market value over this period.

“Intensification of geopolitical tension and hyperinflation as crude and metal price rise worried the market. The Indian IT sector continued to lead the downtrend following sectorial headwinds highlighted in weak Q4 results. Quick sell-off was witnessed during the closing hours led by banking stocks due to FII (foreign institutional investor) selling as the global market weakened,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.

Analysts say the world continues to witness the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war. Over the near term, issues arising from disruptions due to the conflict and sanctions on Russian products would have high negative bearing on global and Indian equities

Here are some of the factors for the falling markets:

1 Worsening Russia-Ukraine war

Russia on April 19 called on Ukrainian forces to “immediately lay down arms” and issued a new ultimatum for the defenders of the besieged port city of Mariupol to give up their resistance.

Russia’s military shelled southern and eastern Ukraine overnight, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying Moscow had launched a new campaign focused on conquering the eastern Donbas region. US President Joe Biden will hold a call with key allies later in the day to discuss the situation in Ukraine. The meeting comes amid efforts to coordinate supplies of heavy weapons to Kyiv as it prepares to counter Russia’s push in the east.

2 FPI selling continues

After a brief respite, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have begun selling in Indian markets, adding to volatility. FIIs sold around $2 billion in equities in the last six sessions amid expected tightening of policy by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on surging inflation.

The RBI in its recent bimonthly policy raised the annual inflation forecast to 5.7 percent from 4.5 percent, which analysts say indicates a rate hike in coming months.

3 Infosys, HDFC Bank’s poor performance

Weak earnings from Infosys and HDFC Bank have spooked markets, analysts said. Infosys’ margins were down 193 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) 21.6 percent. Following this, many brokerages have downgraded expectations with Jefferies India cutting Infosys’ margin estimates by 100-170 bps, pegging it at 21.9 percent in FY22. Nomura Research expects FY23F EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin to drop 100 bps year-on-year (y-o-y) to 22 percent and FY22-24 earnings per share by 5-7 percent primarily on our lower margin expectations.

HDFC Bank and HDFC Ltd have been under pressure for the past few sessions. Both stocks surged over 10 percent after news of the merger of the two companies but have since erased all gains on expectations that the merger will not address investor concerns over slowing growth and declining margins.

Analysts believe post-merger, loan growth will likely slow and be a lot more dependent on economic conditions, and that the ability to distinctly deliver superior loan growth would be challenging.

Despite strong loan growth (21 percent y-o-y), HDFC Bank reported an operationally weak set of numbers with historic low core net interest margin (4.0 percent), muted net interest income growth and multi-years low pre-provision operating profit growth (at 5 percent y-o-y).

4 Fed’s expected aggressive stance

The Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis president James Bullard said the US central bank needs to move quickly to raise interest rates to around 3.5 percent this year, with multiple half-point hikes and that it shouldn’t rule out rate increases of 75 bps.

Fed chair Jerome Powell has said a 50-bps increase is possible at the Fed’s May 3-4 meeting. Comments by his colleagues since have hardened expectations that they’ll make that move, as officials extend a hawkish pivot to curb the hottest inflation since 1981.

5 World Bank cuts global growth

Global markets were under pressure also because the World Bank cut its forecast for global economic expansion this year on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and is planning to mobilise a funding package bigger than the Covid-19 response for nations to deal with various resulting and ongoing crises.

The Washington-based institution has lowered its estimate for global growth in 2022 to 3.2 percent from a January prediction of 4.1 percent.

India’s largest housing finance company HDFC Ltd was on April 19 knocked out of the country’s 10 most-valued companies in terms of market capitalisation after its shares slumped nearly 19 percent in the last two weeks.

HDFC now ranks at the eleventh spot. The top 10 most valued firms of India's are Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, Infosys Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Adani Green Energy Ltd, State Bank of India, Bharti Airtel and Bajaj Finance Ltd.

Shares of HDFC have fallen 12.24 percent over the past one year as against 20 percent rise in the Nifty 50 index. HDFC Bank was down 3 percent in this period.

The steep decline in HDFC shares continued despite the announcement of a mega merger with its banking subsidiary HDFC Bank. On April 4, HDFC announced that it will merge operations with HDFC Bank. The share exchange ratio was at 42 equity shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares of HDFC Ltd.

Both HDFC and HDFC Bank surged over 10 percent after the merger announcement. However, they have since erased all the gains on the expectations that the merger will not address investor concern over slowing growth and declining margins.

The HDFC stock declined nearly 19 percent since the April 4 announcement, wiping off more than Rs 90,000 crore in market capitalisation. HDFC Bank shares too suffered a similar fall with investors left poorer by over Rs 1.66 lakh crore.

Analysts believe that after the merger, loan growth is likely to be slower and will be a lot more dependent on the economic conditions and the ability to distinctly deliver superior loan growth would be a challenge.

""Key risks are slower-than-expected credit growth amid weakening macros due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, further softness in margins due to slower retail credit growth/regulatory buffer built-up in the run-up to the merger, and delay in getting regulatory approval for the proposed merger,"" said Emkay Research in a note to investors.

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, the near-term outlook would be to manage the liability transition. The bank would see a shift in its liability structure and the funding of this would be quite critical to understand near-term margins. It is unclear if the current structure would be approved, given that the bank would have a significant stake in non-banking subsidiaries.

Return on equity is likely to dilute marginally for the merged entity, given the differences in return ratios. Also, there would be an impact due to regulatory requirements, analysts said.

Further, the selling in HDFC shares have been driven by foreign portfolio investors who have been diluting their stakes in bank and non-bank lenders over the past six months.

At 11.45am, shares of HDFC were down 3.5 percent at Rs 2,186 on the National Stock Exchange."
"April 14, 2022 08:22 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/5-reasons-for-fall-in-hdfc-bank-share-price-after-merger-announcement-8362961.html,"Shares of India’s largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, fell by around 12 per cent since the announcement of the merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) with the bank on April 4.

To begin with, why did HDFC merge with the bank?

According to HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh, one of the reasons for the merger is the tightening RBI regulations of non-banks which has made raising money for NBFCs difficult. Also, the regulatory arbitrage for NBFCs compared with the banks have vanished due to the tightening of regulations by the central bank, Parekh said.

The combined entity will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs 17.87 lakh crore. The merger will enable HDFC Bank to undertake larger underwriting at scale.

HDFC Bank, on a standalone basis, had total advances of Rs 12.7 lakh crore while HDFC had Rs 5.25 lakh crore. Of its total advance book, HDFC has 77 per cent of its loans in the individual loan category. HDFC Bank, which has 28 per cent of its loan book in retail and 26 per cent in corporate, can have the advantage of HDFC’s home loan clients joining as the bank’s customers.

The merger, as guided by the parent, is expected to get completed by the second or third quarter of financial year 2024.

Why did the share price fall after the merger?

Analysts say that the market was overly euphoric on the day of the announcement of the merger, but gradually some concerns reared up which resulted in the fall in share price.

Here are the reasons for the fall in share prices of HDFC Bank:

One, concern regarding other HDFC subsidiaries: Analysts say that although the negative impact is short-term, there is a concern among investors regarding regulations on other HDFC subsidiaries like HDFC Life and others. “The merger may weaken the subsidiary. For instance, they may have to sell some shares. So, the uncertainty remains whether HDFC will be able to scale up its subsidiaries,” added Yuvraj Choudhary, Analyst, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

Two, the ability to maintain SLR: According to a research report published by Systematix Institutional Equities, currently, HDFC needs to hold a Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) at 13 percent of public deposits, which post-merger will rise to 18 percent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). “There are concerns related to the SLR requirement and the extent to which the new entity will be able to maintain the same,” said Choudhury. This too could have caused concerns among investors, said analysts.

Three, the need to hold cash reserve ratio (CRR). HDFC did not have any cash reserve ratio previously, and thus, against nil CRR balance in HDFC, the merged entity would be required to hold CRR at 4 percent of NDTL, states the Systematix Institutional Equities report. Higher mandatory reserve ratio requirements would push up the funding costs. According to analysts, this too became a point of concern among investors, which eventually led to the fall in share price.

Four, ability to build PSL: Analysts say that apart from CRR and SLR, investors are skeptical on how the new entity will be able to build the Priority Sector Lending (PSL) against the portfolio and at what cost. Moreover, the cash-to-income (C/I) ratio of HDFC Ltd is around 8 percent, while that of HDFC Bank is around 37 percent. For the combined entity, the C/I ratio is likely to decline to around 32-34 percent, says the research report. The C/I ratio is a key financial measure that shows a company’s costs as a proportion of its income. It is mostly used to measure the efficiency of the bank.

Five, too big for mutual funds: Analysts also say some investors fear the combined entity would be too big for mutual funds. “Since they may cross the threshold of 10 percent in many mutual fund schemes, chances are that these funds may be selling these stocks. While the deal will still take around 18 months to complete, investors are already exiting in anticipation,” said Vijay Singhania, Chairman, TradeSmart, a stock trading platform."

Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC) has sold a 3% stake or nearly 50 crore shares of Bandhan Bank via bulk deals, people in the know told Moneycontrol. As of December end, the mortgage giant held a 9.9% stake in Bandhan Bank.

“HDFC held around 10% stake in Bandhan Bank. Sometime back one and a half percent approximately was sold and today 3.5%, so now they are just below 5%,” one person quoted above said.

“This is to basically comply with RBI regulations. Henceforth, the understanding is that there will be no more sale of Bandhan Bank shares,” one of the persons quoted above said.

Today, shares of HDFC ended 0.2% lower at Rs 2,457.35 apiece on the National Stock Exchange, while those of Bandhan Bank ended 2.9% higher at Rs 325 per share.

In a surprise move on April 4, the HDFC twins announced the merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank. On completion of the deal, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank and all subsidiaries of the housing financier will be owned by the lender.

HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh said the rationale behind the merger included several aspects like less onerous statutory liquidity requirement and cash reserve ratio (SLR and CCR requirements), a favourable interest rate regime, and increased transparency in the realty sector, and giving mortgage customers access to a wider range of services.

Parekh said HDFC Bank in its proposal has asked the RBI to adopt a phased approach to meet SLR and CRR requirements after its merger with HDFC. Further, HDFC Bank also requested the RBI to allow it to “grandfather” certain assets and liabilities of HDFC. Grandfathering is essentially an exemption from a new regulation that may be introduced for a particular sector.

In a post monetary policy committee meeting press conference on April 8, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the regulator has received a proposal from HDFC and HDFC Bank on the merger deal and it is being examined.

“We have received a proposal from HDFC and HDFC Bank with regard to the merger announcement they have made,” Das said. “The proposal has been received and is under examination and we will, in terms of our various regulatory guidelines and other aspects, examine them and as and when a decision is taken, you will come to know about it,” the governor added."

The proposed mega merger between Housing Development Finance Corp and HDFC Bank has triggered talk of consolidation within the non-banking financial company (NBFC) sector. Industry experts are of the view that in order to sustain on a long-term basis, non-banks, especially small and mid-sized ones, will look at the amalgamation route.

This is because the regulatory arbitrage that was available to NBFCs is nearly absent now after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tightened regulations on non-banks. With this, large NBFCs face regulations almost on a par with that of banks.

“RBI has brought about measures such as increased capital requirements for NBFCs, harmonised NPA (non-performing asset) norms with banks, and liquidity coverage ratio being introduced for NBFCs, among other actions,” Y.S. Chakravarti, MD and CEO at Shriram City Union Finance told Moneycontrol. ”In addition, size matters in the financial services space, and larger players expect to benefit from economies of scale and lower borrowing costs. I believe these have been the primary drivers for NBFC consolidation,” Chakravarti said.

Further, high cost of funds, increasing competition, asset quality pressures, competition to attract high-rated borrowers at low rates and lower spreads could be some reasons for consolidation, Chakravarti said.

This is not the first time that consolidation in the NBFC sector has been talked about. Lower-rated NBFCs have struggled accessing liquidity at cheaper rates since 2018 when the beleaguered Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) defaulted on debt repayment, triggering a slew of liquidity problems for the sector. The introduction of the goods and service tax, demonetisation and the pandemic only exacerbated such lenders’ liquidity woes, analysts said.

The IL&FS event proved that NBFCs are an integral part of India's financial system and the RBI, thus, has increased supervision of such entities. The central bank has grouped NBFCs into different categories based on their size and interconnectedness and has made capital norms stricter.

The bigger ones are grouped in the upper layer with tight supervision while stringent regulations will apply to the middle layer as well. The top layer is reserved for companies that are perceived to carry elevated risks akin to banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework.

The regulator on November 12 also came out with a clarification on upgrading of assets that resulted in a rise in reported gross NPAs of most non-banks in Q3FY22.

Analysts’ take

The RBI’s regulatory actions raise the accountability bar for NBFCs, and also cut them less slack than they used to have.

“The harmonisation of some of the key regulatory requirements of NBFCs with that of banks has reduced the leeway which was available to NBFCs in the past. This along with other factors including improved synergies, product or geographical diversification, better shareholder value, access to liquidity or lower cost of funds are the key reasons for the large merger proposals which are in news over the recent past,” said A.M. Kartik, vice-president and sector head of financial sector ratings at ICRA.

Kartik says that in the case of small and mid-sized NBFCs, it is more about the viability, future growth plans and access to funding that is resulting in mergers with relatively larger NBFCs. Access to funding for NBFCs is going to be a key differentiator going forward, he said, as the sector is highly reliant on the banking sector at present.

Bank’s exposure to the NBFC sector is quite high and near their internal sectoral limits, Kartik added. Incremental funding to NBFCs would be partly dependent on the banking sector’s own growth rate going forward.

“One could expect consolidation or M&A activity more amongst the mid-sized NBFCs with other similar-sized ones or larger entities, including banks, for achieving higher growth and/or for product /geographical diversification,” he said.

Jinay Gala, associate director at India Ratings & Research, says the merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank will likely be used as a test case for all upcoming large-ticket mergers in the NBFC sector.

While there is a possibility of small NBFCs merging with bigger ones to gain scale and associated benefits, NBFCs may also look at acquiring fintechs to upgrade and scale their existing technology infrastructure.

“We foresee that there could be an increase in consolidation in the non-bank sector to avail benefits of a larger franchise, larger product basket and a larger reach so that they could remain competitive to other lenders like banks and small finance banks,” Gala said."

India’s home-loan market is set for a dramatic change in the coming years as the country’s biggest housing finance company folds into a bank. HDFC Ltd is set to merge with HDFC Bank Ltd in 12-18 months, subject to regulatory approval. HDFC’s market share in overall housing loans was 31 percent in FY21, second only to State Bank of India (SBI), the largest bank in the country.

HDFC’s amalgamation into HDFC Bank would do three key things to the housing loan market. Firstly, the obvious outcome would be a reduction in the market share of housing finance companies (HFC) and a concurrent increase in that of the banking sector. Secondly, it would impact the growth and margins of HFCs as the heft of a large balance sheet coupled with access to low-cost borrowing would be tough to compete with. Lastly, HFCs may be driven towards riskier developer loans, which come with asset quality risks.

HFC market share reduction

Currently, the home-loan market is dominated by banks and housing finance companies. A study by credit bureau Crif High Mark Ltd estimates that the home-loan market size was Rs 22.6 lakh crore in FY21. Of this, the banking sector accounted for 60 percent while HFCs held 38 percent.

As such the top five lenders (both banks and HFCs) account for 80 percent of the market. Within HFCs, being the largest, HDFC Ltd had nearly half the market share. Therefore, after the HDFC’s merger, HFCs would account for just about a quarter of the housing loan market.

HFCs will struggle to grow

Beyond this it will get interesting for players in the market. Ashvin Parekh, a veteran banking consultant and founder of Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services LLP, believes that large HFCs would find it difficult to grow. “For HFCs the future is bleak, particularly for large and medium sized ones. The smaller sized ones, though, may continue to perform,” he said.

This is because the competition for large-ticket home-loans is already intense and will only increase further. Banks have an advantage here due to their access to low-cost funds by way of public deposits. Emboldened by the low cost of borrowings, banks have been able to capture a large share of the home-loan market by pricing loans competitively. In fact, most banks do not charge any spread over their benchmark rate as home-loans are considered the safest asset.

The banking sector’s housing loan portfolio has expanded by 11.8 percent over the past five years on a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis. On the other hand, growth has been slow for HFCs as they have had to suffer high borrowing costs, especially during the pandemic. Even before the pandemic, the fall of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) dented confidence among HFCs, making their cost of borrowing shoot up.

“Your cost of funds is a key component. HDFC, even before the merger, had the advantage of a large balance sheet, so their borrowing cost was low and they were more competitive. If they turn into a bank, they will gain more because of (the low) cost of funds,” said Prakash Agarwal, director and head of financial institutions at India Ratings and Research. He, too, expects the going to get tougher for HFCs.

This will hurt lenders such as LIC Housing Finance Ltd, PNB Housing Finance Ltd and perhaps even some banks. As such, HFCs have witnessed pressure on their loan growth after the pandemic.

Margin pressure

For HFCs, it is a double whammy: along with growth, their margins may also come under stress. As such, home-loans are products with thin margins as most banks refrain from adding a spread over their benchmark lending rate and non-bank lenders charge low spreads. HDFC Bank’s entry into mortgages with HDFC’s portfolio would heighten the competition on rates.

Notwithstanding its non-bank origins, HDFC commanded the lowest borrowing cost among non-bank lenders, an advantage that would sharpen after it merges with the bank. Incrementally, borrowers would gravitate towards loans priced lower even as the interest rate cycle turns upwards. Again, the margin pinch would be felt most by large HFCs that operate in the large-ticket-loan segment, comparable to HDFC. Smaller lenders may be able to protect themselves given the relatively mild focus of banks in this segment.

Affordable housing segment threat

Affordable housing has been a rising market segment that most lenders have found lucrative enough to pursue in the wake of dispensations from the government and regulators. Affordable home-loans have a ticket size of less than Rs 35 lakh. Further, as mature real estate markets stagnated in terms of growth, affordable housing provided the required support.

The impact on HFCs here could be mixed. While public sector banks have increased their focus, HFCs still account for more than 40 percent share here. In fact, HFCs have been able to claw back their market share, according to analysts.

That said, HDFC has a sizeable market share in the affordable segment although its focus here is recent. The management has indicated that in the new avatar of HDFC Bank, the thrust on this segment will continue. Ergo, HFCs would see their market share coming under threat.

The developer financing conundrum

What analysts fear is the change in the non-retail book of HFCs, which consists largely of developer financing and construction finance. Though HDFC’s non-individual book is less than a third of its portfolio, it is a big lender to real estate builders. Construction financing is a lucrative business in terms of margins as loans to developers carry a wider spread given the inherent risk in real estate. Lending to real estate by banks is heavily regulated and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) frowns upon an increase in exposure. After the merger, HDFC Bank may either maintain its share of developer finance or prune it, depending on regulatory comfort.

At the same time, other HFCs may load up on riskier developer finance from here on. Such loans would be easy pickings in the wake of general pressure on margins in the retail book. While developer finance is good for margins, such risky loans tend to increase the stress level in the portfolio. This segment has been a source of pain for HFCs such as LIC Housing Finance and PNB Housing Finance during the current downturn.

The movement in share prices of HFCs in the past one month reflects the distinction in the quality of books that investors perceive. Those loaded with retail loans have had an easy pass with investors, while portfolios heavy with developer loans have suffered. Some, such as Indiabulls Housing Finance, have intentionally pruned developer finance and focused on the retail business to gain investor acceptance.

The upshot is that HFCs may have to choose between being niche players or merging with banks because the home-loan market is now firmly in the grip of banks."

The proposed merger of HDFC Bank and HDFC Ltd will moderately hurt the lender's profitability in the next 2-3 years, driven by higher funding costs to meet the regulatory liquidity norms, global rating agency Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday. The rating agency, however, affirmed all the ratings of HDFC Bank, including the Baa3 long-term local and foreign current deposit ratings and Ba3 (hyb) Additional Tier 1 securities rating.

The rating affirmation with a stable outlook takes account of Moody's expectation that the financial fundamentals of HDFC Bank will remain stable and robust after considering the financial impact of the proposed acquisition of HDFC by the bank, the agency said in a statement. The two entities' solid commercial and retail banking franchises reflected in their status as the largest private-sector bank and largest non-bank finance company in India by assets will support their funding and liquidity, it said.

On April 4, 2022, HDFC Bank and HDFC announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement whereby the business of HDFC Limited will be merged into HDFC Bank in an all-stock transaction. The boards of both entities have approved the merger and expect the transaction to close by the end-2023, upon completion of closing conditions, including regulatory and shareholder approvals, it said.

The proposed transaction will significantly enhance HDFC Bank's product portfolio with a higher percentage of secured and long-duration mortgage loans, the agency said, adding the merger will also improve the bank's ability to cross-sell retail banking products to the customers of HDFC Limited. The increased scale and comprehensive product offering will help the combined group's drive revenue opportunities and support operating and underwriting efficiencies, it said.

""The transaction will moderately hurt HDFC Bank's profitability in the next 2-3 years driven by higher funding costs to meet the regulatory liquidity norms, including cash reserve ratio, statutory liquidity ratio as well as costs associated with compliance with the priority sector lending norms. Further, the share of market funding will increase in the near term,"" it said. Nevertheless, Moody's expects the bank's strong retail franchise and access to low-cost depositors will help mitigate the impact. It also expects the combined entity's asset quality and capitalisation to remain broadly stable."
"April 06, 2022 01:43 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/merger-of-hdfc-twins-may-drive-up-competition-in-housing-finance-market-say-experts-8323561.html,"The merger of India’s largest mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) with the country’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank is likely to create stiffer competition to existing players in the lucrative home loan market in Asia’s third largest economy, said analysts and industry players.

On April 4, the HDFC twins announced their decision to merge. HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger.

Chairman Deepak Parekh called it a merger of equals. Every 25 shares held by HDFC shareholders will fetch them 42 shares of the bank. The merger is set to create an entity that will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs 17.9 lakh crore.

Analysts and housing finance companies believe that the merger will create a larger customer base, leveraging distribution across urban, semi-urban and rural geographies.

“After the merger, HDFC and HDFC Bank will be the third largest company by market cap in India, occupying a major share in the mortgage sector,” said Atul Goel, MD, Goel Ganga Group & President (Elect.), NAREDCO Pune, apex national body for the real estate and allied industries.

“Hence, a cross-sell opportunity to larger customer base will benefit the company. The mortgage offering would also be more competitive,” Goel said.

The HDFC-HDFC Bank combine will position itself as one of the largest consumer lenders in the emerging markets in Asia, according to a recent report of Morgan Stanley.

The merger will provide better funding franchise for HDFC, eventually leading to greater operational and distribution leverage, particularly given HDFC Bank's strong expansion in interior India over the past 10 years, the report said.

Karthik Srinivasan, an analyst from ICRA said the merger can potentially change the chemistry in the home loan market. “We need to see whether they will be more aggressive or less aggressive, it can be seen after a few years. Their overall portfolio of housing may shift towards bank. Market will become more competitive as HDFC in general has been competitive in their respective segments they have operated,” he said.

The bank has a presence in more than 3,000 cities and towns with about 50 percent of its branches in semi-urban and rural geographies. Through its 6,342 branches, it caters to more than 68 million customers.

While the mortgage lender has assets of Rs 6,23,420.03 crore, turnover of Rs 35,681.74 crore and a net worth of Rs 1,15,400.48 crore as on December 31, 2021, the bank's assets are pegged at Rs 19,38,285.95 crore, turnover (includes other income) at Rs 1,16,177.23 crore for nine months to December 31, 2021, and a net worth of Rs 2,23,394.00 crore, as on December 31, 2021.

Brokerage firm ICICI Direct too said the merger will facilitate larger quantum of credit into the priority sector and enhance wholesale lending. The merger will not only expand their home loan portfolio, but also open up the scope for larger ticket loans, including those for infrastructure. ""There is also a chance that the customers opting for housing finance may get bifurcated,"" the brokerage said.

“The customers from underserved markets would no longer be forced to rely on unorganized moneylenders who charge exorbitant rates of interest. This would have a cascading effect of shattering the debt traps for such customers,” said Pramod Kathuria, Founder and CEO, Easiloan, a digital market place for home loans.

The merger is likely to bring advanced technology infrastructure, Kathuria said.

Analysts said HDFC has always incorporated advanced technology to serve customers. So, it is likely that after the merger, HDFC may even start offering greater hyper-personalised products or services to increase customer loyalty towards the brand, added Kathuria.

HDFC an HDFC Bank merger has been speculated for a while. In fact, back in 2015, HDFC Chairman Parekh had said that his company could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour. But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent sending the idea to backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders.

With the parent finally merging the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry.

This merger follows a proposal by RBI for large NBFCs to convert into banks, after the lending space was shaken up by the IL&FS crisis in 2018."

TT Srinivasaraghavan has spent four decades in Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), including 18 years as managing director of Chennai-based Sundaram Finance. He continues to serve on the board of Sundaram Finance.

He is the one credited with the GQP (Growth, Quality and Profitability) philosophy in the NBFC space. Steady and profitable growth over a long period, as opposed to rapid and aggressive expansion, was his business model. In the last 12 months, he has also been on the advisory panel of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

In this free-wheeling interview with Moneycontrol at his house in Chennai on April 5, Srinivasaraghavan shared his thoughts on the merger between the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India’s No. 1 housing financier, and HDFC Bank, the biggest private sector bank by asset size, and its implications for the banking and NBFC sectors. Edited Excerpts:

It is often said that small is beautiful. How do you see this merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank?

No doubt, it is a transformational event for the banking industry. There are economies of scale that the merger brings. Cross-sell opportunity (mutual funds / insurance/ mortgage loans) is seen by many as one of the drivers for the merger. But I have a slightly different view. The cross-sell concept, I believe, has been overhyped internationally and domestically. It is unlikely that the cross-sell would have been a prime driver for the merger. Even without the merger, that opportunity would have existed.

What could be the reason then?

I could see some reasons beyond the cross-sell opportunity for this merger. Given their size, there is no great advantage in continuing as an NBFC. HDFC, as an NBFC, does not have access to current account and savings bank account money that the bank has. The relative advantage of remaining as an NBFC is diminishing at that scale. Someday it would have come to a point as to how much they would have been able to leverage through term debt as the lenders would have hit their ‘per-borrower’ ceiling. Now as a bank, HDFC Bank would have access to an endless retail franchise. On the liabilities side, it gives them serious clout.

Do you see any other factors that could have triggered the long-speculated-on merger?

It’s no surprise that the merger has taken place. It has been on the cards for a long while. It was only a question of when it would happen. One of the reasons could have been that of management succession. Many of their top management personnel are around 70 and the question of succession in HDFC would have been an issue. This way, they would have access to a larger pool of managerial talent.

What is the implication of the merger on the NBFC sector as a whole?

As for its impact on the NBFC sector ... HDFC is in a completely different league. I think it would not make a big difference in the NBFC space, especially for the small and mid-sized players. For HDFC Bank, it is a massive portfolio addition. The opportunity to target mortgage loan customers is big. They now have huge distribution reach and the muscle power to go and fight State Bank of India (SBI) in the mortgage loan space. With this, the banking landscape has changed dramatically.

What do you see as a major challenge in this merger exercise?

As with all large mergers, cultural integration will be a challenge. Sometimes, too big a size is not easy to manage. The top management may not always have a feel of the ‘on the ground’ customer experience. There is also a possibility of the customers of HDFC being compromised. Also, as you get bigger, pressure to perform better will be higher. Size will build its own pressure.

In the unfolding context, what is the relevance of NBFCs?

NBFCs have played a phenomenal role in bringing the un-served and under-served into the credit mainstream. If you go back in history to the nationalisation of banks, financial inclusion (although such a terminology did not exist back then) was the real intent behind the move. Fifty years later, all we have done is found new jargon (financial inclusion) but we are still talking about the need to cater to the underserved segment. There is still a long way to go as far as financial inclusion is concerned, and that’s where the relevance of NBFCs comes in.

Banks are indeed large and formidable competitors, but that does not mean that there is no room for anybody else. In fact, I have long believed that this is a model of collaboration rather than confrontation where the banks are wholesalers and NBFCs are retailers. Co-lending, priority sector on-lending and business correspondents are all prime examples of the wholesaler-retailer equation.

It is about understanding these businesses, understanding the opportunities and risks associated with these businesses, and very often this requires ground-level knowledge and expertise. NBFCs have traditionally played this role and will continue to do so in the years to come. No doubt, technology will play a major role in helping navigate some of these complexities and progressively become a significant enabler for lenders and borrowers alike. However, the decades-long expertise that NBFCs have developed in financing micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is, to my mind, quite unparalleled.

The level of in-depth understanding that NBFCs have, based on the relationships they have built and cultivated over a long period, their expertise in being able to assess credit, their ability to reach out to their customers in a timely fashion, including giving them forbearance during their times of stress, place them in a unique position that cannot be replaced by technology, nor can they be replaced by large banks because the knowledge that is required to assess, lend and thereafter collect from these segments is indeed a specialised skill, built in many cases, over generations.

In my view, the role that NBFCs have played will not only continue but will evolve into newer opportunities and newer areas.

What could be your advice for smaller NBFCs?

NBFCs have a unique model that is not easily replicable. Many of the smaller NBFCs are still family-owned and family-managed and often three or even four generations of knowledge, relationships, expertise have been built up, which no amount of artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning can substitute. Technology is certainly a great support, a great enabler, but in this uniquely diverse landscape with its varied tapestries, it is, in my view, well-nigh impossible to build models that will answer every situation. There are things that only NBFCs can do, and they should continue to do what they do best."

The upcoming merger of two mammoth entities from the same group – HDFC and HDFC Bank – has created a buzz that is likely to continue well after the amalgamation takes effect. Top management officials have indicated that the process could take between 12 and 18 months as they seek approvals from a host of regulators including the Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Competition Commission of India (CCI) and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).

HDFC twins’ senior management and other industry experts believe that the deal is a win-win for all stakeholders, but official information on changes for customers, if any, will be clearer only closer to the final merger. For instance, will existing HDFC home loan borrowers get an opportunity to switch to external benchmark-linked loans, which is mandatory for banks? Will the merged entity offer lower interest rates to depositors?

Moneycontrol spoke to five experts in the financial advisory space to understand what the mega merger means for investors and retail customers. Here’s what they said:

Vishal Dhawan, Founder and Chief Financial Planner, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors

Actively-managed mutual funds would underperform due to this merger only if the merged entity's stock price outperforms and mutual funds are unable to participate due to investing limits.

The merger itself will take 12-18 months, as it needs several regulatory approvals. So, mutual funds have enough time to decide what they want to do with the excess holdings that they might have in the merged entity, if its weight in large-cap indices is more than the 10 percent investing limit of mutual funds. As this will impact the entire mutual fund industry, the Association of Mutual Funds in India may approach SEBI to ease the individual stock limits. Also, remember that both HDFC Bank and HDFC were relative underperformers on the stock market in the recent past. So, funds that actually had lower exposure to the two stocks would have benefitted to that extent.

So, we should not read too much into it right now, as there is still a lot of time for the merger to be completed. The final weight of the merged entity, whether in the Nifty 50 or any other large-cap index, would depend on how the two stocks perform from hereon, stock performance after the merger, and how the deal gets finally structured. Whether the weight of the merged HDFC Bank-HDFC entity crosses mutual funds’ investing limit or not, investors wanting to take large-cap exposure should in any case prefer low-cost passively-managed funds to active funds. In the last few years, we have seen that large-cap fund managers have found it difficult to outperform large-cap indices.

Anubhav Srivastava, Partner and Fund Manager, Infinity Alternatives

The merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank will lead to changes in domestic and global indices, which may result in many fund managers selling their holdings in these two stocks due to regulatory norms and index limitations. Also, investors should not overlook operational, regulatory, and cultural challenges involved in this merger. Synergies of the merger, if any, will be seen in the long term after the merger goes through. Euphoria seen in the stock prices of these two may not last long, as market participants price in these concerns.

Abhinit Kulkarni, Founder and CIO, Tequity Investing

The merger is beneficial from the perspective of stakeholders of both the entities. The country needs stronger and bigger financial institutions to support the flourishing economy. Bigger banks are vital for reducing the cost of capital, promoting credit growth and maintaining asset quality. The Rs 18 trillion combined balance sheet strengthens the bank’s ability to underwrite more. This merger is the beginning of the next phase of growth, not just for the bank, but also for the Indian banking system. It is the bank’s ""stop me if you can moment!"" From the investors’ perspective, short-term volatility cannot be ruled out, but they should be ready to buy at lower prices.

Preeti Zende, Founder, ApnaDhan Financial Services

Since the merged entity will be a bank, interest rates will be linked to an external benchmark. So, the rates could be more competitive compared to an NBFC (non-banking finance company). Current HDFC customers may get a chance to switch to better home loan interest rates after the merger. Things will be clearer closer to the merger completion, which will take considerable time. As far as HDFC depositors are concerned, even after the merger, the interest rate at which the deposits are made will be applicable till their maturity. If customers want to renew the deposit after maturity, then prevailing interest rates offered by the bank at that juncture will be applicable. Usually, the bank's interest rates are lower than that of NBFCs which means that for current HDFC customers, the chances of getting similar or higher interest rates are dim. Bank fixed deposits are covered under deposit insurance which is not applicable to NBFCs. So, after the merger, deposits up to Rs 5 lakh will be covered by DICGC which is a great relief to existing customers.

Ajay Shaw, Partner, DSK Legal

After the amalgamation, composite services of home loan and banking under one roof will be beneficial for customers of both entities. A possibility of overdraft facility for housing loan may bring a lot of relief for customers with seasonal idle cash, which was earlier not possible with HDFC, as only banks can provide this (facility).

External benchmarking brings not only transparency but also lowers the cost of borrowing over a period of time. Currently, NBFCs do not have to adhere to the external benchmarking regime, but banks have to. The Reserve Bank of India may give some transition time to HDFC Bank to move existing customers of HDFC to interest rates benchmarked to repo rates. But new borrowers will immediately benefit from this move."

This will result in the creation of India’s third-largest listed firm and the markets gave a thumbs up to the move with shares of both firms surging during days trade on April 4.

Veteran banker and HDFC Ltd Chairman Deepak Parekh summed up the deal aptly when he said, “ After 45 years in housing finance and after providing 9 million homes to Indians, we have to find a home for ourselves. And we have found a home in our own family company, HDFC Bank”

But what’s India Inc’s take on this mega-deal which has sent ripples through the industry?

Moneycontrol’s Ashwin Mohan spoke to a cross-section of senior industry executives who weighed in with their views –

Ajay Piramal, chairman of Piramal Group which is present in the financial services segment told Moneycontrol, “ I think this is a tremendous event and a really nice culmination of the contribution that Mr Deepak Parekh has made to the Indian financial services industry. I give him full credit for creating the finest financial services institution, whether it's a bank, NBFC, or an insurance company. I am delighted and was waiting for this day and it has come. This feat by Mr. Parekh reminds me of Dhoni's match-winning six in the 2011 World Cup"".

The head honcho of another diversified conglomerate Harsh Goenka, Chairman, RPG Enterprises called it a “watershed moment” for India’s financial sector. He elaborated, “ The merger has a very strong rationale that includes a mammoth balance sheet which should make cost of funds competitive, significant potential for synergies and a global scale of operations. It’s a win-win for all stakeholders. Ek aur ek gyarah.”

“This should have happened earlier, but better late than never, “ says former Sebi chairman M Damodaran who has founded Excellence Enablers, corporate governance think tank. He believes the proposed merger of these two large entities should be positive for all stakeholders

Veteran investment banker and chairman of DSP Group Hemendra Kothari who is Deepak Parekh’s junior from Sydenham College, Mumbai feels Parekh, the “godfather” of the group and the person behind its meteoric rise over the past few decades will be missed for his experience and astute business sense.

The deal is expected to take around 15 to 18 months to complete and RBI norms do not allow anyone above 75 years to be on the board of a bank. Parekh has already crossed that age. Atanu Chakroborty, the current chairman of HDFC Bank is expected to chair the combined entity with HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan in the corner office.

“ The ratings of the institution will improve and on the distribution side, HDFC Ltd will be much stronger than before ( especially for their insurance vertical),” Kothari added

Speaking about the merger benefits for both the firms, Pramod Kumar, Managing Director & Head of Banking, Barclays India said, “For the bank, it completes its suite of products including having mortgage assets on its own books. To HDFC, the bank can provide even lower-cost funding to the mortgage business. Even though HDFC was always borrowing at very fine rates on its own strengths but still bank deposits can be cheaper than that. Besides, it gives HDFC shareholders an additional opportunity to grow beyond just mortgage and own a much more diversified mix of businesses.”

Addressing some of the key challenges, Kumar added, “ There are some obvious issues to address like Debentures, ECBs, SLR and CRR as well as ownership stakes into several investments that HDFC has in the asset management, life and non-life insurance businesses, which I am sure RBI would need to look into. What we might miss is the HDFC DNA of spawning new and very successful businesses that have created huge value in the past but hopefully, the bank will be able to preserve and nurture that !”

Private equity veteran and ex Citi India CEO Sanjay Nayar feels the mega transaction makes a lot of strategic sense for both the organisations as well as their respective customers. “ There is a clear impetus for the mortgage business on a combined basis. This is a complex deal subject to regulatory approvals and there could be challenges in execution but I am sure they must have proactively addressed those.”

In response to a query on whether the transaction would trigger consolidation in the banking sector, former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar who is an advisor to Baring Private Equity Asia and Kotak Investment Advisors told CNBC TV-18, “It may trigger the desire to consolidate amongst private sector banks, don’t see the further possibility of mergers in public sector banks.

Analysts believe the merger of HDFC Bank with HDFC Investments Ltd and HDFC Holdings Ltd, two subsidiaries of Housing Development Corporation (HDFC), which too is merging with the bank, will have a considerable positive impact on the lender’s customers and the investors and also influence overall banking as well as the lending business of HDFC.

Most analysts are of the opinion that this merger will provide a cross-selling opportunity to the customers of both entities. “The share of longer-tenor secured assets will increase for HDFC Bank as mortgage loans are secured and generally longer-tenor in nature,” said Karan Gupta, director of India Ratings and Research.

In an earlier interview, banking consultant Ashvin Parekh said that if mergers of the banks are done with proper goals planned within a dedicated time frame, it will benefit the system.

Talking about the merger of HDFC twins, he added, “HDFC has been contemplating it for the past few years and they were examining if there could be some relief on the SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) sort of requirement and also on the priority sector kind of lending requirement. They have done it at an opportune time because the NBFC (non-banking financial company) business was coming under more regulatory scrutiny. In that backdrop, HDFC needed to analyse whether it would have been beneficial to continue as an NBFC or become a bank. Both the boards have evaluated it for a long time and worked out on goals and targets.”

Analysts pointed out that the HDFC entities have a huge market capitalisation and HDFC as a group has always rewarded investors well, a trend they see continuing.

“The merger goes well at a time when the economic cycle is going well for India,” said Parekh.

According to several analysts, this merger will be equally beneficial for both customers and the bank. “It could become a more formidable player in the housing finance market with this merger. Moreover, with better cost of funding, it will also help them grow their portfolio. Housing includes long-term assets so it will provide slightly longer stable assets for their portfolio and eventually get better cost of funding for the overall growth. So here is a benefit from the perspective of the bank,” said Prakash Agarwal, director and head, financial institutions, India Ratings and Research.

From the customer’s perspective, there could be some positive aspects that include better implementation of high-end technology to ensure better customer experiences.

“With this merger HDFC Bank gets an unparalleled advantage through the mortgage portfolio providing it a quantum leap in distribution to semi-urban and rural areas with a huge opportunity to cross-sell bank products to a very, very sticky client base.

The combined entity will be able to extract substantial synergy benefits which bodes well for all stakeholders and shareholders,” said Samir Bahl, CEO, investment banking at Anand Rathi Advisors."

HDFC Bank has requested the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow it to adopt a phased approach in meeting key regulatory requirements after its merger with Housing Development and Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC).

The requirements include the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), or the percentage of deposits that banks have to invest in government bonds, and the cash reserve ratio (CRR), or the portion of deposits that banks must hold in liquid cash.

SLR is now 18 percent and CRR 4 percent.

The country’s largest private sector bank by asset size has also requested the regulator time to allow it to “grandfather” certain assets and liabilities of HDFC. Grandfathering is essentially exemption from a new regulation that may be introduced for a particular sector.

“The bank has requested Reserve Bank for a phased-in approach in respect of SLR and CRR, priority sector lending and grandfathering of certain assets and liabilities and in respect of some of its subsidiaries. These requests are under consideration by the RBI in terms of their letter to the bank dated April 1, 2022,” HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh said.

In a surprise move on April 4, the HDFC twins announced a long-anticipated merger between HDFC, India’s biggest home loan provider, and HDFC Bank, its most valuable lender.

After the completion of the transaction, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank and all subsidiaries of the housing financier will be owned by the latter.

Parekh said the rationale behind the merger included less onerous SLR and CCR requirements, a favourable interest rate regime, increased transparency in the realty sector, and giving mortgage customers access to a wider range of services.

“The merger makes the combined entity strong enough not only to counter competition but make the mortgage offering even more competitive,” Parekh said.

Parekh said it will take at least 12-18 months for the merger process to be completed given the need for multiple regulatory approvals.

Asked whether the bank’s subsidiary HDB Financial Services will continue to operate as a standalone unit, HDFC Bank MD and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan said the bank would like to maintain it as a separate entity, “but if regulatory prescription suggests that we have to have an alternative thought process, we will comply.”

Jagadishan said that with the merger, the share of mortgage loans in HDFC Bank’s overall advances will increase. The bank will also be able to meet its priority sector lending target by focusing on affordable housing.

The bank has 15,000 business correspondents presently and with the addition of five more partners, will be able to expand its services to a larger number of customers.

The potential for cross-selling products to HDFC customers and lower cost of funds for the mortgage business will also be in favour of the bank, the management said.

In terms of asset quality, the merger will have minimal impact on the bank; retail bad loans will fall and non-performing assets (NPAs) extended to corporate customers may rise, Jagadishan told Moneycontrol.

He reckoned that the NPA ratio would be around 1.3 percent to 1.5 percent. As of December- end, the lender’s gross NPA ratio was 1.26 percent."

India’s largest housing finance company HDFC is all set to merge with HDFC Bank in an all-stock deal to create a combined entity with a market value of around Rs 12.8 lakh crore.

Top management of HDFC and HDFC Bank as well as industry experts feel the mega-merger is a win-win for the two organisations, stakeholders, customers and even the economy. However, HDFC’s depositors and borrowers are bound to have certain doubts regarding the future of their long-term contracts.

Customers’ interests

What is clear is that the status quo will be maintained until the amalgamation takes effect, which could take anywhere between 12 to 18 months as the proposal will need to be approved by a host of regulators. These include the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and Competition Commission of India (CCI).

The management has indicated that the merger could take effect by Q3 or Q4 of FY24. “HDFC and HDFC Bank depositors will continue to get the rates that they have been getting. After the merger, there will be a harmonisation at the bank’s card rates,” Sashidhar Jagdishan, MD and CEO, HDFC Bank, told Moneycontrol. That is, depositors will be offered the bank’s rates after the merger comes into effect.

Until then, it will be status quo for borrowers and depositors. Currently, a deposit of less than Rs 2 crore with a tenure of two years and nine months will fetch you interest rates of 6.15-6.35 percent per annum. HDFC Bank offers interest rates of 5.2-5.7 percent per annum for comparable tenures.

HDFC’s distributors say that the top officials have been in touch with them and the transition is likely to be smooth.

“This is not the first time such a merger is set to take place. We have handled such situations before—for example, during Gruh Finance’s (erstwhile HDFC subsidiary) merger with Bandhan Bank, though this merger is on a much larger scale.

""We have been assured by HDFC and I am confident that the management will ensure that the transition is hassle-free. The branches could perhaps be allotted to HDFC depositors on the basis of their current addresses. The companies will work out the logistics,” says Hanoz Patel, Founder Partner, Power Pusher Financial Services LLP.

Depositors will have adequate time to make up their minds on letting their fixed deposits mature or renewing them at that juncture.

A switch to external benchmarking regime?

The home loan portfolio of HDFC, a housing finance company, will move to HDFC Bank, a banking entity.

While both are regulated by the RBI even now, banking rules differ on how retail home loans are benchmarked. Banks’ new floating-rate retail loans (sanctioned after October 1, 2019) are linked to an external benchmark , which in the case of most banks is the repo rate.

Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), on the other hand, do not have to link their retail loans to an external benchmark at present, though competition compels them to offer comparable rates.

“The combined entity will be a banking company, so banks’ regulatory framework will be applicable. So new customers of the merged entity will be offered external benchmark-linked rates. It is possible that HDFC’s existing customers will be given a choice to switch to this regime post the merger. These details will be clearer closer to the merger,” says former banker and financial counsellor VN Kulkarni."

Credit Suisse has raised FY23-24 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by two to three percent and expects 17 percent plus return on equity (RoE).

About his outlook when it comes to the bank’s fundamentals, Mukherjea told CNBC-TV18, “I have always said in the last three years that HDFC Bank has been stellar in the way it gained market share. If you add up the gains of the entire private sector banking space and compare that with gains made by HDFC Bank in the last three years, you find HDFC Bank has made significant gains.”

Endorsing the merger plan, he said, “We guess this merger will hasten HDFC Bank’s growth. From the historical 20 percent, it will go up by 2 percentage points. ROE (return on equity) will also go up. This will be a good economic recovery for the bank.”

Asked whether the merger would be more beneficial for HDFC shareholders, Mukherjea agreed, saying the proposed merger will help leverage and create meaningful value for various stakeholders.

“HDFC shareholders are benefited due to HDFC Bank’s lower-cost funding base and established distribution network of the bank,” he said.

He stressed that the merger will also remove a critical disadvantage HDFC Bank has always faced with respect to mortgage assets.

“Until now, since HDFC Bank didn’t have a mortgage book, they used to sell it to HDFC which needed to rotate it far quicker, and this was a disadvantage when compared with” the functioning of ICICI Bank, he said.

Listing other benefits for HDFC Bank from the merger, Mukherjea said, “HDFC Bank will now retain mortgage loans in its balance sheet. For the given amount of ROE, the cost incurred will be much lower. HDFC Bank holding on to home loans will be a big deal for shareholders.”

HDFC-HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances are in favour. But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner saying the regulatory environment is not conducive.

Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders and considering the business synergy between two institutions.

HDFC-HDFC Bank Merger LIVE

But, there is a question on the timing of the merger; why did they choose to do it now?

One key reason could be the emerging regulatory approach of the banking regulator to NBFCs. The benefit of continuing as an NBFC is nearly absent now compared with the older times.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been tightening regulations on the NBFC sector over years, grouping these entities into different categories based on size and interconnectedness and making capital norms stricter.

As per an RBI discussion paper released early last year, these layers bracket NBFCs according to their asset size and systemic interconnectedness.

The bigger ones are grouped in the upper layer while stringent regulations will apply to the middle layer as well. The top layer is reserved for companies that are perceived to carry elevated risks akin to the banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework.

Also Read | HDFC, HDFC Bank merger to create third-largest company in India

If these proposals are accepted as regulations, the top 25-30 NBFCs will have to gradually embrace bank-like regulations. That will minimise the benefit of lighter regulation they have enjoyed so far. NBFCs in the upper layer will have to comply with common equity Tier 1 capital regulations like commercial banks.

They need to maintain a 9 percent CET1 ratio. That apart, these NBFCs will have to comply with large exposure framework and listing regulations.

Clearly, the trigger for the new scale-based approach for NBFCs was aimed at disincentivizing non-banks from growing too big after the IL&FS and DHFL episodes. The regulator doesn’t want a parallel set of financial institutions growing in the financial system at par with the size of banks but enjoying lighter regulation. Also, the RBI wants to bring down the number of NBFCs in the banking system.

For HDFC, which is an NBFC, it makes sense to be part of the bank given the regulatory approach.

So, in a sense, what has aided the merger is the phased regulations from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which has bridged the gap of regulations between banks and non-banking finance companies. Larger NBFCs and banks aren’t very different from a regulatory perspective in terms of scrutiny and capital ratio requirements. Also, as Parekh said in the merger statement, a booming mortgage lending market offers opportunities for home loan lenders.

The Jagdishan factor?

HDFC Bank insiders say compared with the previous boss of the bank, Aditya Puri, his successor Sashidhar Jagdishan was more lenient to the idea of merger. Puri exited the bank in October, 2020. Jagdishan took charge as the new chief in October. “The change in leadership made it easier for the parent to proceed with the merger. At least that’s what the talk is,” said the insider who didn’t wish to be named.

Then there are other factors as well.

Obviously, the merger gives HDFC access to cheaper deposits as well. An NBFC typically raises funds at a higher rate from investors and money markets while a bank has access to public deposits that come at a much cheaper rate through current, savings accounts. That is certainly a beneficial factor for the merger.

What about investors? Prima facie, the deal looks good for investors.

As per the announcement today, every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of the bank for every 25 shares they hold.

“Looking from the shareholder’s perspective, it is a positive measure. Because, the shareholders of HDFC Ltd, who was having a holding company discount issue will benefit because the holding company discount will disappear. And for shareholders of HDFC Bank too, the synergy of the combined entity will benefit them,” said J N Gupta, former executive director at the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

With the parent finally merging the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry. The window for cross selling products and leveraging the strength of the combined balance sheet will give advantage to the combined entity.

Bigger money muscle

The merged entity, with a larger balance sheet will enable HDFC to turn even more aggressive in the market. It will be only second to the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) across all parameters. The combined entity will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs17.87 lakh crores. It will enable the HDFC Bank to undertake larger underwriting at scale.

HDFC Bank, on a standalone basis, had total advances of Rs 12.7 lakh crore while HDFC had Rs5.25 lakh crore. Of its total advance book, HDFC has 77 percent of its loans in the individual loan category. HDFC Bank, which has 28 percent of its loan book in retail and 26 per cent in corporate, can have the advantage of HDFC’s home loan clients joining the bank’s customers.

It also gives opportunities in cross selling of different products in the unsecured loan segment, insurance, credit cards to HDFC’s existing customers.

When will the merger process be completed?

There is still some time ahead. The merger, as guided by the parent, is expected to get completed by the second or third quarter of financial year 2024. The scheme of amalgamation will need approvals from SEBI, RBI, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) and Competition Commission of India (CCI). It will also require approvals from National Company Law Tribunals and finally will be filed with ROC.

With the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger, another giant is born in the Indian financial sector. SBI, the largest in terms of assets in the Indian banking industry, gets a bigger competitor.

India’s largest housing finance company HDFC will merge into subsidiary HDFC Bank which is the country’s most valuable private sector bank through an amalgamation scheme, the stock exchanges were informed today.

On the face of it, the merger is indeed of equals and is a win-win in terms of balance sheet heft, cost synergies and market share. It will also open up space for foreign institutional investors to buy HDFC Bank shares.

That said, there are key regulatory costs here that both the companies will need to carefully assess. The most critical of these are cash reserve ratio, statutory liquidity ratio and priority sector lending norms.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requires banks to set aside four percent of their net time and demand liabilities as CRR and invest 18 percent of NDTL into government bonds under SLR. Further, banks and non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) are required to maintain high quality liquid assets under liquidity coverage ratio norms.

Analysts believe that the merged entity will need to raise funds from the market or steadily build the excess liquidity on the balance sheet to meet the regulatory requirements. Estimates of fundraising are currently Rs 60,000-70,000 crore. To be sure, the management of both the companies have expressed confidence in meeting regulatory requirements.

Nearly 35 percent of HDFC’s borrowings are retail deposits and these would be taken into consideration for calculating regulatory ratios after the merger. In a management call, Keki Mistry, vice chairman of HDFC, said that both the CRR and SLR have been brought down over time and therefore it is easier now than before for the merged entity to meet these.

Yet another factor is the required priority sector lending norms that banks need to adhere to. The RBI requires banks to lend 40 percent of their adjusted net bank credit to agriculture and allied activities, small businesses and affordable housing among others covered under the priority sector.

The combined entity will have a loan book of Rs 18 lakh crore, of which 27 percent would be home loans. Given that HDFC’s large book will get merged, the share of priority sector loans would come down and HDFC Bank would need to meet the norms after the merger. Sashidhar Jagdishan, managing director and chief executive officer of the bank, said that the lender would resort to buying priority sector lending certificates (PSLC) initially to meet the norms. “We have a fair amount of strategies to meet enhanced requirement of the priority sector,” he said in the call.

As such, the companies have requested the regulator to give them time to meet the norms. It remains to be seen whether the RBI will give an extended timeline for the merged entity to tick all the regulatory boxes."

The watchdog had conducted an inspection of HDFC, which was registered with the regulator as Category II Registrar to an Issue and Share Transfer Agent, on September 30 to October 9, 2019, for the period April 1, 2018 to July 30, 2019.

It was alleged that HDFC had violated certain provisions of listing obligations and disclosure requirements regulations and/or norms pertaining to Registrars to an Issue and Share Transfer Agents.

Passing an order on Wednesday, Sebi's Adjudicating Officer Geetha G said that no monetary penalty is warranted in respect of the allegations levelled in the instant matter and disposed of the show cause notice that was issued in December 2021.

According to the order, out of the allegations made in the show cause notice, the noticee (HDFC) was in violation of two aspects -- pertaining to issuance of duplicate shares and deviation from prescribed procedures in case of transfer of dividends.

""The noticee has submitted that it had taken corrective measures pursuant to the deficiencies being pointed out by Sebi, interalia including updation of SOP and appointment of an external auditor for examining cases outside of the sample analysed by Sebi.

""Further, the noticee has already surrendered its Category II Share Transfer Agent Registration to 'Link Intime India Pvt Ltd'. Thus, on an overall evaluation of the allegations and other circumstances, I find that the aforesaid non-compliances are not serious enough to warrant imposition of monetary penalty,"" the order said.

According to Sebi, in the case of procedures to be followed in issuance of duplicate shares, the noticee had taken a considered call not to insist on the same and vested the discretion on its compliance officer to waive the requirement of FIR.

Noting that this is not a case of deliberate or casual non-compliance but a facilitation done to the shareholders at the behest of the Stakeholder Relationship Committee, Sebi said this would ensure that the duplicate share certificates are not issued to the wrong persons.

""It is not out of place to observe that there are instances where the investors have faced difficulties in lodging an FIR. Therefore, in my view, deviation from the strict letter of law can be looked upon as a venial or technical or procedural violation,"" the order said.

With respect to deviation from following the procedures laid down with respect to online transfer of dividends, the adjudicating officer said the RTA has systematically disbursed the dividends through the physical mode. ""I also note that the noticee was functioning as an In-house RTA.

Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd (HDFC) on March 23 said it has approved retail home loans amounting to over Rs 2 lakh crore between April 1, 2021 to March 21, 2022, the highest amount of loans ever approved in a financial year.

Thrust on digital initiatives along with inherent demand for housing loans helped the major housing financier get back to normalcy faster than expected, India's largest mortgage lender said in a stock exchange filing. ""Today, over 89% of retail loans are sourced online, up from less than 20% before COVID-19 pandemic.""

The demand for affordable homes in India is extremely deep and resilient, HDFC said. The affordable residential real estate segment will continue to see strong traction with more developers providing right sized, right priced units which are affordable for end users, it added.

“In over four and half decades, I have not seen a better time for the housing sector than now due to lower interest rates, stable property prices, government’s thrust on affordable housing, improved affordability, favorable demographics, increasing urbanisation and rising aspirations,” said Renu Sud Karnad, managing director at HDFC.

“The demand for housing continues to be from first-time homeowners as well as those moving up the property ladder – generally into larger homes. We are seeing healthy demand across metros and non-metros and demand is prevalent in affordable as well as high-end markets. The sweet spot for housing is still in the price range of Rs 50 lakh to Rs One crore,” she added.

Further, HDFC has over 2.7 lakhs home loan customers who have availed benefits under the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), highest in the industry. As on December 31, cumulative loans disbursed by HDFC under CLSS stood at Rs 45,914 crore and the cumulative subsidy amount stood at Rs 6,264 crore.

Going ahead, in view of the growing risks around climate change, HDFC will also increase its footprint in funding affordable, smart and green housing projects, it said."

The Uday Kotak-led IL&FS board had estimated that the property was worth around Rs 1,200 crore. The deal is done and documentation and processes will be concluded in the first quarter of the next financial year 2022-2023, according to the report.

The building is mortgaged with HDFC for loans outstanding worth Rs 400 crore. Sale proceeds will also be used to pay off those debts.

"February 18, 2022 10:01 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/hdfc-stock-what-lies-behind-the-underperformance-8125861.html,"Home loan growth on the rise

Housing loans have been the corner stone in the chase for retail lending by banks and even non-bank lenders for long. In fact, they formed 8.4 percent of the total incremental loans given by banks so far in FY22. Add that of non-bank lenders and the share rises even further.

HDFC Ltd, being the market leader in home loans among non-bank finance companies (NBFC) has shown resilience even during periods of crises such as the present one triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. HDFC’s assets under management has grown by a healthy 19.7 percent in the past two years despite the pandemic. This, along with pristine asset quality, has underscored the company’s premium valuation with the stock climbing above pre-pandemic highs.

But, since the past six months, the stock has underperformed the broad market even as various economic indicators show improvement, including the real estate sector. HDFC’s shares have dropped 11 percent in the past six months as against the 4.4 percent gain in the broader Nifty 50 index. In fact, consumer goods lender Bajaj Finance's valuation briefly crossed that of HDFC earlier this week.

There are a few reasons behind this underperformance. One, home loan growth has been fuelled by multi-year low interest rates. The interest rate cycle has turned now with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in withdrawal mode.

HDFC is predominantly a retail home loan lender with individual loans forming 77 percent of its book. But it has also been a big beneficiary of low interest rates. Analysts foresee some headwinds on growth here given the expected increase in interest rates. The turn in rate cycle also means that HDFC’s cost of borrowing may inch up, crimping margins. As such, corporate bond yields have already increased over the past six months.

The management, however, has indicated that loan growth would improve further as momentum has continued. “Although interest rate cycles may move up and down, customers who want a home will not hold back,” said Chairman Deepak Parekh in a recent event.

HDFC’s asset quality metrics slipped somewhat in the third quarter with the lender reporting an increase of 20 basis points in its Stage 3 assets (non-performing loans). These loans stood at 2.7 percent of total portfolio. A worrying aspect was that individual loans contributed to this increase of stressed assets. But this has more to do with change in regulator’s rules than fresh stress.

Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd believe that the ratios would normalise over three-four quarters.

Performance of non-individual loans which are essentially loans to developers, and construction loans improved with delinquencies falling by 1.3 percentage points sequentially.

What’s more, the lender has said that it recovered Rs 683 crore from a single non-individual loan account that was restructured in the third quarter. Analysts expect HDFC to report further improvement here in tandem with the recovery in the economy.

HDFC has also been dragged by underperformance of its group companies. Shares of HDFC Bank, HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd and HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd have all slipped over the past one year for varied reasons.

Analysts believe that the current underperformance is likely to be temporary for HDFC. In fact, the fall has made valuations look more appealing for investors now in comparison to others. Brokerages have not materially changed their expectations. “We expect HDFC to deliver a 14 percent AUM and PAT CAGR each over FY22-24. This would translate into an RoA/RoE of 1.9 percent/13 percent in FY23-FY24,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services analysts said in a note.

Expectations on return on equity (RoE) are lower than pre-pandemic level of 15 percent."

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) chairman Deepak Parekh is confident that the strong demand for housing in India is here to stay, with technology playing a bigger role in the real estate sector.

Parekh foresees property technology, or proptech as it is known, to change the landscape, with 3D printing, modelling and increased use of tech in all spheres of the sector.

He was addressing the 4th CII Real Estate Confluence virtually, sharing his thoughts on “What’s Staying, What’s Changing?”

The Indian real estate market was on an upward cycle and had staged a strong comeback after taking a hit following the coronavirus outbreak, Parekh said.

""In over 50 years of my work life, I have not seen housing affordability better than where it is today. I have not seen such easy liquidity conditions and interest rates at such low levels ever before and I have not seen such a burning desire to be a homeowner than in these current times"", opined Parekh.

Also Read: HDFC Capital-backed realty player hires bankers for Rs 1,000-crore IPO

He sees the residential housing as the “big star”, as the desire to own a house had only grown stronger. The demand for housing was continuing to grow among first-time buyers and also those who moved up the property ladder, he said.

Income levels were rising faster than real estate prices because of which the younger generation could afford homes sooner in their life. Thus, the affordability of homes should not get affected, the 77-year-old Parekh said.

In terms of housing prices, Parekh said barring a few metro cities, the affordable housing segment remained stable and the “sweet spot for housing is still in the price range of Rs 5 million to Rs 10 million”.

However, it was important to keep a lookout on the price hike in building materials like steel and cement, as those costs could get passed on to homebuyers.

Also Read: Bajaj Finance briefly snatches NBFC crown from Housing Development Finance Corp as market value rises

The HDFC chairman also enlisted three measures that would help affordable housing. First, shorter construction cycles, second, faster regulatory approvals, and third to enable credit input on GST for under-construction properties.

When it comes to the changes in the real estate landscape, Parekh said the emergence of data centres and India looking to position itself as the global data centre hub.

Tech and clean building

He also spoke about proptech and how construction technology was at an exciting juncture with 3D printing, building information modelling, etc. Home improvement technologies would also see more innovation.

""Don't underestimate the power of India's startups. Home improvement technologies are going to see more innovation, so keep up with the emerging tech"", he advised.

Parekh also forecasted that all incremental funding to financial institutions would have ESG covenant embedded in it and the sector must be prepared for that.

The construction sector must also stay ahead of the curve by working towards a lower carbon footprint and reduced emissions.

Talking specifically about Maharashtra, Parekh said there was merit in continuing the reduced charge on premiums as higher premiums hampered development. Civic bodies could earn more in revenue through discounts.

Predicting better days ahead for the real estate sector, which has had a few rough years, Parekh stressed that the reputation and track record of builders was what mattered the most."

It was another strong day for the market as the benchmark indices rallied more than 1 percent on December 2, driven by sectors like IT, auto, financial services, FMCG and metals.

The BSE Sensex rallied 776 points, or 1.35 percent, to close at 58,461, while the Nifty50 closed a tad above the 17,400 mark, with 235-point gains. The broader markets also witnessed buying interest as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 1.14 percent and 0.61 percent, respectively.

Stocks that were in focus include HDFC, which was the third-biggest gainer in the Nifty50, rising 3.85 percent, to Rs 2,807.80, and Persistent Systems, which rallied 4.41 percent to Rs 4,392.60. Apex Frozen Foods was also in action on Thursday, as it was locked in 20 percent upper circuit at Rs 297.50.

Here’s what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

HDFC

After a short-term price correction, the stock took the support near the 100-day SMA (simple moving average) and reversed sharply. After the reversal, the stock has formed a long bullish candle which support further uptrend.

In addition, a strong intraday price volume rally and promising trend reversal formation also support short-term uptrend. Unless it is trading below Rs 2,700, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 2,950-3,000.

Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 2,800 and Rs 2,750 levels, with a stop loss below Rs 2,700.

Persistent Systems

After a short-term correction, the stock took the support near Rs 3,800 and turned rapidly. After reversal on intraday charts, it has been consistently forming higher bottom formation which support short-term uptrend.

The stock is comfortably trading above the short-term and medium-term averages. For the trend following traders, Rs 4,175 would be the trend decider level, above the same the uptrend wave will continue up to Rs 4,500-4,750.

Apex Frozen Foods

The stock hit a 20 percent upper circuit on December 2. After strong reversal formation once again it succeeded to close above the 200-day SMA which is broadly positive for the Apex Frozen Foods.

On daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a promising trend reversal formation, which support further uptrend from current levels.

For the swing traders, now Rs 280 or 200-day SMA would be the trend decider level. If it trades above the same, then we can expect further uptrend up to Rs 320-345. However, if it closes below Rs 280, traders may prefer to exit out from trading long positions.

Official data print on the GDP will show a 7.8 per cent expansion on a year-on-year basis for the September 2021 quarter, according to a report.

Real GDP will grow 9.4 per cent in FY22 and decelerate to 7.5 per cent for FY23 as the base effects result in the higher growth in the ongoing fiscal wear-off, according to the report by economists at HDFC Bank released on Wednesday.

In FY21, the GDP had contracted 7.3 per cent due to the pandemic. For FY22, the RBI expects GDP to clock a growth of 9.5 per cent, which will slow to 7.8 per cent in FY23. The GDP had expanded by over 20 per cent for the first quarter on the lower base.

The official data for the second quarter is set to be released on November 30. The report by HDFC Bank said some part of the expected 7.8 per cent GDP growth in the second quarter will be due to a low base from a year when the economy contracted by 7.4 per cent but there is likely to be a sequential improvement in GDP growth in Q2FY22.

On a sequential basis, GDP is expected to grow 9.75 per cent in Q2 from a contraction of 16.9 per cent in the second wave-hit previous quarter, reflecting a revival in economic activity.

""With support from pent-up demand and easing of mobility restrictions in the country, economic activity (as captured by a number of high frequency indicators) moved above pre-second wave levels in early August and has remained robust since then,"" the report said.

Agriculture, forestry and fishing growth will come at four per cent in Q2FY22, industry will be at 6.3 per cent and services at 8.6 per cent, it added.

When looked at from a gross value added (GVA) basis, the September 2021 quarter growth will come at 7.3 per cent, the bank estimated, explaining that the gap between GDP and GVA is likely to be driven by higher tax revenue collection and lower subsidy pay-outs in this quarter.

After years spent in being selective while launching fresh schemes, HDFC Mutual Fund has filed applications for rolling out several new ones and has already launched a few this year. HDFC Multi Cap Fund (HMCF) is set to be launched today.

What is the scheme about?

As the name suggests, the scheme will buy shares of companies across market capitalisation. Mutual funds have been launching multicap schemes to fill the void in this product category. SEBI revised its rules for the multi-cap funds last year. According to SEBI norms, multi-cap funds must allocate 25 percent of their assets each in mid-cap, small-cap and large-cap stocks. The remaining 25 percent may be invested at the fund manager’s discretion.

Gopal Agrawal will be the fund manager of this scheme. Agarwal comes with a good track record, having worked at Mirae Asset Global Investments (India) earlier for 10 years. HMCF is the third multicap fund to be launched so far this year.

What worksEarlier, many multi-cap funds held more of large-cap stocks than mid and small caps. So, SEBI created a flexi-cap category. Most of the erstwhile multi-cap funds moved to this new category and continued to have a greater flexibility in investing.

The multi-cap fund will be benchmarked against the NIFTY 500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index, which has 50 percent weight to large-caps, and 25 percent each to mid and small-caps. Investors looking for a blended portfolio are better suited to invest in multi-cap funds.

At present, Agrawal finds mid-caps expensively valued, while small and large-caps are relatively reasonably valued.

Still, multi-cap fund managers have some flexibility. They can shift their allocations depending upon their market outlook, as well as interpretation of the overall economic environment. For example, smaller-sized companies tend to do well when interest rates are on the lower side. If the fund manager sees sector opportunities, he might go overweight on that segment.

But Agrawal says he would do this only if he is really convinced about the prospects of the sector. “A very large underweight compared to the benchmark index may lead to possible underperformance, and a very large overweight could lead to higher risks. We will not go beyond a pre-determined limit for sector weightages. A sector’s fundamentals can change even overnight,” he adds.

In certain industries, the market leaders are mid and small-cap companies.

What doesn’tRupesh Nagda, founder and managing director of Family First Capital, says it is important that investors come with a long-term view as multi-cap funds may go through periods of higher volatility. The impact of market-linked volatility tends to even out over the long term.

“Multicap funds are higher on the risk-return profile compared to flexicap and large & midcap schemes,” Nagda points out.

Nagda adds that if investors already have a well-diversified portfolio of large, mid and small-cap funds, then getting into a multicap fund doesn’t make sense.

Some financial advisors prefer flexicap funds, as there are no minimum investment limits based on market caps and the fund manager is allowed to completely exit from mid and small-caps if she feels the valuations are getting frothy.

Moneycontrol’s take

A multicap fund could give investors a well-diversified equity portfolio. With more fund houses planning to launch multicap schemes, financial planners say the differentiation would be the fund manager’s ability to deliver performance in this category. While Agrawal comes with a good track-record, the multicap category is itself a new one. So, it would be better to let the fund build a track-record before considering it for your long-term investments."

While the financial markets recovered sharply because of monetary easing across the world, the wheels of the world economies have only started moving now, after a prolonged period of painful pandemic. Back home, the baking sector has been in the dumps for a long spell owning to bad loans. Finally, the credit costs cycle seems to be reversing and the economy is likely to step on to a higher growth trajectory. Here are the best proxies for economic growth, and the best part, these stocks still trade below their historic averages in terms of earnings multiples.

State Bank of India (SBI)

If you believe in India, you cannot ignore SBI. The country’s biggest state-owned commercial bank is undeniably also the best in terms of asset quality, capitalisation and underwriting capabilities. After a troublesome few years, the asset quality issues are finally behind corporate banks and SBI being the biggest of all should be a beneficiary going forward.

The growth in credit off-take has been muted thus far and is expected to gain momentum in the coming year. This augurs well for the bank and should help the net interest income and profitability to improve significantly going forward. SBI also gets a big relief from the risks associated with Vodafone-Idea debt after the recent judgment on the case. This will ease the one-time provisioning for the bank, even as there could be potential write-backs going forward. SBI has a high coverage ratio of 70 percent, Tier 1 capital of more than 10 percent and restructured book of 0.8 percent. Credit costs are expected to normalise in the near term. Core operating profit should also improve.

Motilal Oswal is positive about the bank. “We estimate Pre Provisioning Operating Profit (PPoP) at 14 percent CAGR over FY21-23E v/s 6 percent CAGR (FY18-21), enabling SBI to achieve 15 percent RoE by FY23E,” it said.

Apart from SBI itself, it has hidden potential in its valuable subsidiaries like SBI Mutual Fund, SBI Life Insurance, SBI General Insurance and SBI Cards. All have displayed robust performances and turned market leaders in their respective segments.

The contribution of subsidiaries to Sum of Total Parts (SoTP) has increased significantly. As per the report from Motilal Oswal, the subsidiaries now contribute 32 percent to SoTP (42 percent on the CMP). “We expect the robust performances from subsidiaries to continue and add value to overall SoTP. Value unlocking from SBI MF and SBI General Insurance could result in further gains,” it said. The bank’s UNO app is also attracting huge valuations and can be a huge growth engine for the bank in coming future.

As per its report, the brokerage estimated the total value of subsidiaries (post holding discount) at Rs 1,69,800 crore. The total value per share from all the subsidiaries comes at Rs 190 per share, based on which the brokerage expects a target price of Rs 600 for the bank.

HDFC Ltd

The largest mortgage lender stands to benefit the most from the growth witnessed in the realty sector where inventory levels are now at the lowest levels and a slew of new projects are being announced both in the metro and non-metro cities.

The company is seeing credit growth in both the affordable housing as well as in mid to high-end segments. There is a strong growth in individual approvals as well as disbursements which is expected to continue in the near-medium term. With the revival of the economy, this will get only better.

The collection efficiency of the bank is at a high of 98 percent, gross NPAs are 2 percent of the total portfolio which is lowest in the industry and decline is witnessed in both individual and non-individual gross NPAs. Assets under Management have been growing over the past few quarters and provisions as a percentage of exposure at default (EAD) stands at 2.56 percent, strong subsidiaries also add strength to the company. (EAD is the predicted amount of loss a bank may be exposed to when a debtor defaults on a loan.)

CLSA expects 15-16 percent growth in Net interest income (NII) / Pre Provisioning Operating Profit over FY21-24 compared to 8 percent over FY15-20. Jefferies suggests high buffer provisions of 1.3 percent will help bring down credit costs."

India needs more asset reconstruction companies that will lead to increased focus on real estate financing , Deepak Parekh, a financial services veteran and Chairman of HDFC Ltd, said on October 29.

While speaking at a conference organised by the Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (CREDAI) in Mumbai, Parekh said financial regulators are not willing to look at real estate financing.

""We have tried a number of times that real estate is different from industry lending and the land is a big security. We can’t go against them, 90 days due is sacrosanct,"" he said.

In most cases, lenders have land as security but financiers have no choice to respect the view of the regulator, adequate provisions have to be made but incremental funding can’t be done, Parekh added.

If a non-performing loan is there with a developer, whatever additional money financiers give as last mile funding constitutes as non-performing from day one, according to him.

""If a third party lends, it becomes an NPA for them too, it’s a vicious cycle,"" Parekh explained. ""Once an NPA, you can’t finish the project unless the developer sells or monetizes assets.""

More than Rs 1.3 lakh crore loans to real estate are under stress, which constitutes roughly 18 percent of real estate lending including old legacy projects, Parekh said.

Resolutions are happening and global funds and pension funds are looking to invest in India’s real estate sector to counter the low yields in their country, he added.

""Asset reconstruction is something that is knocking on the doors of regulators for approval. For instance, Brookfield and HDFC have entered into a MoU to start a dedicated ARC, "" Parekh said. ""The partnership is important because Brookfield is one of the largest alternative asset managers in the world.""

Such investors with deep pockets and patient capital are needed, according to Parekh. Once regulatory approvals come, which Parekh hopes to come soon, it will be a win-win situation for all and many ARCs are bound to follow.

Developers will get access to last mile funding with ARCs, existing financers already having provided for such loans will have options to sell bad loans seamlessly and focus on incremental lending rather than be consumed with legalities and technicalities of resolution, he added.

""World over these are accepted modes of financing, so we need to catch-up with the rest of the world.""

According to Parekh, the Indian real estate market is in the cusp of new growth cycle.

The housing market moves in cycle and research suggests peak and trough of each cycle typically entails six years, Parekh explained. While the last peak was in 2013 followed by trough condition that came with tight liquidity, leveraged positions, etc.

It takes six to eight year for an upward cycle to start and ""we are there"", he added.

As real estate leads the economic growth and multiplier effect plays out, yet, there is a need to be extra watchful and not repeat the mistakes of past, Parekh added.

He said China’s real estate market saw stress with the fall of Evergrande as real estate market in China contributes to 25 percent of the Chinese economy. The choices for Chinese Government was to allow it to fail or come out with rescue packages, he said.

There’s no housing bubble now (in India) but we should not be congratulating or thumping our chest, he said.

In his message to home buyers, Parekh suggested this is the right time to seize the opportunity as low interest rates are not going to last forever."

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the strategic alliance was signed between IPPB and HDFC Ltd on Monday.

""The partnership aims to facilitate HDFC’s home loans to customers, especially in unbanked and underserved areas with many of them having little or no access to finance, to fulfill their dream of owning a home. IPPB will offer housing loans through nearly 190,000 banking service providers (Postmen and Gramin Dak Sevaks),"" it said.

As per the MoU, credit, technical and legal appraisals, processing and disbursement for all home loans will be handled by HDFC Ltd while IPPB will be responsible for sourcing of loans, it said.

Speaking on the significance of the tie-up, IPPB MD J Venkatramu said financial inclusion cannot be achieved without enabling access to credit as a significant chunk of customers do not have a bank or a financial institution providing housing loans in their vicinity.

The alliance aims to make housing loans available and accessible, using a digitally enabled agent banking channel and position IPPB as a one-stop platform for all banking needs of customers, including credit, he said.

Commenting on this partnership, HDFC MD Renu Sud Karnad said, this alliance will go a long way to promote affordable housing in the remotest locations of our country in line with the Prime Minister’s vision of Housing for All.

"September 17, 2021 09:28 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/hdfc-mutual-funds-first-global-scheme-will-invest-in-23-countries-should-you-invest-in-it-7476081.html,"HDFC Mutual Fund (HDFC MF) rolling out a new Developed World Indexes Fund of Funds (HDWI FoFs). It will invest in a combination of an international exchange traded fund (ETF) and index funds – developed by Credit Suisse – in a manner that tracks the returns of the MSCI World Index. This is the first international fund from the HDFC stable.

The scheme

HDWI FoFs is a passively-managed scheme that will give investors exposure to global markets. The scheme will invest in five global funds that track Europe, Japan, Pacific (ex-Japan), Canada and the US.

The proportion in which the HDFC fund would invest in these global funds would depend on the regional weightages that its benchmark index, MSCI World Index, follows. Typically, other India-based international funds invest your money in one single scheme abroad. HDWI FoFs follows a different approach. Although it will invest across the globe, it would do so by investing in country or region-specific funds, through multiple funds that specialise in those geographies.

What works

Through these five funds, HDWI FoFs will give investors exposure to 23 developed countries.

Unlike a US or a region-focused fund, HDWI FoFs aims to give much wider geographical diversification to investors. Even so, US markets will still have the largest exposure, at 67 percent. Europe will have 19.1 percent weightage. Japan (6.6 percent), Canada (3.3 percent) and other developed markets (excluding Japan, at 3.3 percent) will make up the rest of the portfolio.

Navneet Munot, managing director and chief executive officer of HDFC MF, says the fund gives diversification in the broadest sense.

“There is currency diversification given that the fund will take exposure to several geographies. The fund is also going to be fairly well-diversified in terms of sectors,” he says.

The MSCI World Index has 22 percent exposure to the information technology segment at present, followed by 13 percent exposure to financials and 12.9 percent to healthcare. The remaining exposures are to consumer discretionary (11.9 percent), industrials (10.6 percent), communication services (9.1 percent), consumer staples (7.01 percent) and other sectors.

Munot adds that if earnings growth becomes broad-based over time, this fund could be a good way to capture this growth as it will have exposure to large and mid-sized companies.

Michael Levin, MD, head of asset management, Americas and Asia Pacific, Credit Suisse, says, “At this juncture in global economy and markets, it makes sense to invest in a globally diversified portfolio.”

Financial planners say such a fund is suitable for first-time investors, who don’t have any exposure to international funds. “As this fund’s exposure will be spread across several countries, there is no country-specific risk. For an investor with a conservative risk-profile, this fund makes sense,” says Nishant Agarwal, managing partner and head-family office, ASK Wealth Advisors.

A passively-managed fund is a good way of taking international exposure, as active fund managers have found it difficult to beat market indices in developed markets. The HDWI FoFs is likely to have only 0.4 percent expense ratio for direct plan investors.

The MSCI World Index has shown lower volatility than the Nifty 50 across different time periods. HDFC MF has analysed pertaining to the last 20 years. MSCI World Index (14.3 percent) has also delivered higher returns than Nifty (11.8 percent) over the last five years.

What doesn’t work

Financial planners say that with over 1,500 stocks, the fund seems to be over-diversified.

“While region-specific funds come with higher country risk, there is also potential for getting higher returns from such funds,” says Rupesh Nagda, founder and managing director of Family First Capital.

He adds, saying “Investors getting into this fund should go with moderate return expectations.”

Over the last five years, the MSCI US Broad Market Index has delivered returns of 18 percent, outpacing the world index .

As an FoF investing in overseas funds, the scheme will be treated as a debt fund for taxation purposes. Long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax will be applicable after three years, at 20 percent, with indexation benefit (inflation-adjusted gains).

Short-term (less than three years) capital gains will be taxed at the investor’s tax slab rate.

Moneycontrol’s take

Global diversification is important when it comes to building your equity portfolio and HDWI FoFs aims to offer just that. MSCI World Index has a low co-relation with the Nifty 50, which is what investors need to look for when diversifying their portfolio.

While diversification can bring down volatility, over-diversification can weigh down returns.

The fund is for extremely conservative investors. Due to its excessive diversification, the fund is more likely to give steady but moderate returns. Investors looking for a less-volatile option can consider deploying a small part of their surplus in HDFWI FoFs. If you are comfortable with handling higher volatility, opt for a US-specific or global fund that comes with a good track record and vintage.

The new fund offer (NFO) opens today and will close on October 1, 2021."

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) share price was up over a percent at open on August 3, a day after the company declared its June quarter results.

HDFC on August 2 posted a 1.7 percent fall in its Q1FY22 standalone net profit at Rs 3,000.7 crore. The company had posted a profit of Rs 3,051.5 crore in the year-ago period.

The profit number was above the market estimates, as a CNBC-TV18 poll of analysts had expected Q1 profit at Rs 2,898.7 crore. Total revenue from operations for the quarter came at Rs 11,657.47 crore, down 10.45 percent from Rs 13,017.68 of Q1FY21.

HDFC's Q1 net interest income (NII) stood at Rs 4,146.7 crore compared to Rs 3,392 crore in the previous year, representing a growth of 22 percent.

Net interest margin (NIM) came at 3.7 percent. Capital adequacy remained at 22 percent, while tier-1 capital remained at 21.3 percent.

As of June 30, 2021, the assets under management (AUM) stood at Rs 5,74,136 crore as against Rs 5,31,186 crore in the previous year.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after Q1 earnings:

Morgan Stanley: Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 3,160

NII and Core PPoP growth were strong, individual AUM growth picked up. Non-individual AUM growth is likely to be subdued for a longer term. Stage 2+3 loans appear to have peaked. We trim FY 22/23 EPS estimates by 6%/5%.

Catch all the market action on our live blog

CLSA: Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 3,000

Strong NIM aids PPoP, asset quality deteriorates marginally. The core business outlook has improved and valuations are reasonable.

Kotak Institutional Equities: Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 3,100

Strong performance in Q1 with stable NIM. Marginal rise in stressed loans despite a challenging business environment. Lower disbursements in April and May tempered retail loan growth. The company remains the best mortgage play in India. Improving realty cycle, strong debt market position makes it a favoured pick in the sector. It has large provisioning buffers on the balance sheet and valuations are favourable.

Macquarie: Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 2,960/Sh

Asset quality remains the biggest plus point. Weaker loan growth is due to a decline in the non-individual book. The stock is cheap at current levels.

“The pandemic has reaffirmed that there can be no greater security in life than a home. The inherent demand for home loans continues to remain strong,” the chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation, said at the company’s annual general meeting on Tuesday.

Banks have been aggressively focusing on retail loans, particularly home loans, as a safer bet pandemic has increased risk aversion in the industry.

According to sectoral data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), outstanding home loans grew 10 percent year-on-year to Rs 14.62 lakh crore, as on May 21, 2021. In its financial results for the first quarter of FY22, HDFC Bank reported a 15.34 percent rise in its home loans to Rs 72,266 crore, as on June 30, 2021.

Even in terms of commercial real estate, most companies have not given up their office premises. With the e-commerce boom, demand for real estate is coming from warehousing and fulfilment centres, Parekh said.

Similarly, with the build-up of digital infrastructure, demand for data centres has increased. These are segments of the real estate sector that have the potential to grow immensely, Parekh said.

Economy bouncing back

Parekh said an economic recovery is underway aided by strong economic fundamentals even though the Covid uncertainty continue to pause major challenge.

“In terms of the overall macro-economic environment, the key challenge remains the unpredictability of the virus. The world is still susceptible to recurring waves of infections. Thus, economic recovery will remain uneven and patchy,” Parekh said.

Owing to the second wave of Covid-19, the Indian economy is likely to mirror a trend seen in FY21, where the first half of the financial year is weaker and the second half is significantly stronger, Parekh said.

As indicators of the strength of India’s fundamentals, Parekh pointed to forex reserves and foreign direct investment inflows, which have scaled record highs and the capital markets, which are buoyant. Agriculture growth is expected to remain strong, with foodgrain production estimated at over 305 million tonnes.

“The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is committed to supporting growth through an accommodative monetary policy; and, the government has taken several reforms and measures to alleviate Covid-19 related stress,” Parekh said.

The government has widened the scope of the emergency credit line guarantee scheme to support individuals and businesses impacted by the pandemic. The scheme helps to channel credit to where it is needed the most, Parekh said, adding that the key laggard remains overall credit growth, which continues to remain tepid.

Both the government and the RBI have announced a series of steps to help stressed borrowers in the pandemic period and ensure adequate credit supply. The RBI announced multiple rounds of loan restructuring schemes and moratorium to avert an immediate asset quality shock in the banking system."

Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC) Chairman Deepak Parekh on Tuesday said that while the country's macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong and the recovery is in progress, the unpredictability of coronavirus will remain a key challenge.

Owing to the second wave, the Indian economy is likely to mirror a similar trend seen in FY21, where the first half of the financial year is weaker and the second half is significantly stronger, he said.

""I remain confident that India's macroeconomic fundamentals are strong. Recovery is underway,"" Parekh said while addressing the 44th annual general meeting of HDFC Ltd.

He said, the country's forex reserves and foreign direct investment inflows have scaled record highs, the capital markets are also buoyant and agriculture growth is expected to remain strong with food grain production estimated at over 305 million tonnes.

He further noted that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is committed to supporting growth through an accommodative monetary policy and the government has taken several reforms and measures to alleviate COVID-19 related stress.

""The key laggard remains overall credit growth which continues to remain tepid,"" he said, adding in terms of the overall macroeconomic environment, the key challenge, however, remains the unpredictability of coronavirus.

Also, with the build-up of digital infrastructure, demand for data centres have increased, he noted.

Against the backdrop of the pandemic, Parekh said HDFC had articulated that there are three key monitorables – liquidity, growth and asset quality.

He said, the corporation has been maintaining higher levels of liquidity as a prudent measure.

In terms of growth, the national lockdown impacted individual loans, but once restrictions were eased, the demand surpassed all expectations, he added.

""We are confident that demand for housing will continue to be strong,"" he said.

According to Parekh, asset quality has been challenging for non-individual loans at a systemic level.

The corporation has always been prudent in identifying loans where there could be stress and has adequately provided for such loans, he said.

In FY21, demand for housing was from both affordable housing and high-end properties, he said.

As of March 31, 2021, gross non-performing loans of HDFC stood at Rs 9,759 crore, constituting 1.98 per cent of the loan portfolio. Its assets under management grew by 10 per cent to Rs 5,69,894 crore as of March 31, 2021."

For HDFC, this will give further fillip to its affordable housing loans, which already constitutes over 80 per cent of its over eight million customers as its average loan size is only Rs 27 lakh.

MHADA, the Maharashtra government arm that is into developing affordable housing, on Thursday signed an agreement with HDFC towards this, the mortgage lender said. The arrangement was initiated by the state's Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad, it added.

The Authority during its seven decades of existence has provided homes to nearly 7.50 lakh families across the state, of which 2.5 lakh are in Mumbai.

But, due to lack of housing stock in the past two years, it was unable to conduct the lottery draws as a result only a few hundred houses were offered in 2018 and 2019 despite receiving lakhs of applications.

HDFC Managing Director Renu Sud Karnad said that under this special arrangement, the lender will charge only a flat Rs 2,500 per applicant as processing fee. However, this does not mean allottees have to take loan only from HDFC, she said adding that doing so will make it easier for the homebuyer to benefit from easy and faster processing."

The largest food delivery aggregator’s Rs 9,375 crore IPO has been oversubscribed 1.19 times so far. While the markets celebrated the market launch of one of India’s largest food delivery company’s IPO, several other companies hopped on to show its support.

It all started when Zomato started posting on Twitter. The tweet that was a dialogue from Hera Pheri gained a lot of traction with nearly 23,000 likes. The tweet that said “mereko to aisa dhak dhak horela hai'' displayed jitters right before Zomato's IPO began. Meanwhile, companies and brands cheered for Zomato’s feat and sent their wishes.



mereko to aisa dhak dhak horela hai — zomato (@zomato) July 14, 2021

WazirX, India’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, tweeted saying “Don't worry, we will HODL!” along with a flexed bicep emoji. HODL or ‘hold on for dear life’ is a slang meaning hold on to your assets.

Mobile application Truecaller that has features of caller-identification, call-blocking, flash-messaging, call-recording, responded to Zomato’s jitters asking to ‘block’ its worries along with good wishes. “Saare worries ko ekdum block kardene ka because you've taken the right call. All the best!,” Truecaller said.

HDFC Bank and Kotak Securities also came through and cheered for Zomato’s IPO asking the food aggregator to “chill” along with a tongue-in-cheek comment: “Chill karo, humare saath subah ki ChaIPO.”



Netflix India used another dialogue from Hera Pheri movies while responding to Zomato. “Tu chinta mat le, aur so ja. Hum zor zor se bolke sabko scheme bata denge.”

BigBasket also congratulated the food aggregator and used the moment for marketing with a pun saying “We're here if you ever want to ""stock"" up.”

Pepsi India also followed suit with “We would have done 1+1 on Pepsi to celebrate the Zomato IPO, but our finance team said no.”

Practo, an online doctor consultation app, offered ""a free online consultation with a top doctor” and “even late at night.""

Paytm, whose IPO maybe next in the pipeline after its parent company, allowed its users to apply for IPOs before the actual IPO opening in the markets. Zomato’s IPO is the first one to be launched with this new feature and thousands of applicants on the platform had already placed their orders a day before the IPO.

One97 Communications received approval from its shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting to raise Rs 12,000 crore through a fresh issue of shares, paving way for one of India's largest initial public offerings (IPO) in recent times.

This marketing trend of brands commenting on each other’s social media isn’t new. In fact, brands taking on each other seeming like feuds are also marketing gimmicks to gain traction on social media. However, it was no less than wholesome to watch brands supporting each other especially in a big moment like the launch of the IPO."

HDFC is the promoter and related party of the bank.

The purchase is to happen at a price determined on an independent evaluation report, subject to receipt of necessary approvals including regulatory approvals and approval from shareholders of the bank, it said.

""The aggregate consideration for purchase of 3,55,67,724 shares of HDFC ERGO is Rs 1,906.43 crore, i.e. Rs 536 per share,"" it said further.

HDFC ERGO General Insurance had a gross written premium of Rs 12,444 crore for the year ended March 2021. The company''s net worth stood at Rs 2,927 crore.

""The proposed transaction enables the bank to participate in the growth opportunity of HDFC ERGO and augment HDFC ERGO''s growth prospects leading to long-term value creation by HDFC ERGO to its shareholders,"" it said.

The bank has been a distribution partner of the insurer since 2009.

"June 17, 2021 11:52 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-bank-to-refund-gps-device-commission-to-auto-loan-customers-7046001.html,"On number 5 of India’s most valuable brand is HDFC bank

India's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, said on June 17 that it would refund the GPS device commission to auto loan customers who had availed of such device as part of the auto loan funding during the period financial year 2013-14 to financial year 2019-20. The GPS Commission refund may amount to approx Rs 40 cr for HDFC Bank, according to sources cited by CNBCTV18.

The refund will be credited to the customer's repayment bank account as registered with the bank, HDFC Bank said in a notice published in the Times of India news paper on June 17.

In case such bank accounts are closed, customers can contact the bank from their registered email ids or make a phone call within the next 30 days, HDFC Bank notice said.

This move comes shortly after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a fine of Rs 10 crore on the bank in connection with the irregularities in the auto loan division.

On May 28, the RBI said it has imposed a monetary penalty of Rs 10 crore on HDFC Bank Limited for violation of certain rules and said his action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance.

An examination of documents in the matter of marketing and sale of third-party non-financial products to the bank’s customers, arising from a whistle blower complaint to RBI regarding irregularities in the auto loan portfolio of the bank, revealed contravention of the aforesaid provisions of the Act and the regulatory directions, the RBI said.

In furtherance to the same, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed for contravention of the provisions of the Act/directions, the RBI said.

After considering the bank’s reply to the show cause notice, oral submissions made during the personal hearing and examination of further clarifications/documents furnished by the bank, RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charge of contravention of provisions of the Act was substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty, the RBI said.

The irregularities in the auto loan portfolio pertains to the charges including bank’s executives forcing the borrowers to buy GPS devices bundled with the auto loans and even insisting that loans will not be sanctioned unless they buy these devices.

The devices, manufactured by a Mumbai firm, Trackpoint GPS, cost about Rs 18,000 a piece.

The allegations first surfaced on social media. The bank responded to the charges with the statement only after a sustained social media campaign by one of the whistleblowers against the alleged irregularities and subsequent reports in the mainstream media.

The misconduct by the bank officials was acknowledged by former CEO Aditya Puri in the bank’s AGM when he said an internal probe was conducted against a few erring employees and appropriate action was taken.

In July 2020, the bank had sacked six executives over allegations of corruption and breach of corporate governance standards. The private sector lender fired six senior and mid-level officials after an internal investigation found that they were involved in corrupt practices.

""We had received some whistle-blowing complaints, internal enquiries carried out in the matter on the complaints received has not brought out any conflict of interest issue nor does it have any bearing on our loan portfolio,"" HDFC Bank’s former chief Puri said at the company's annual general meeting (AGM) on July 18.

""Enquiry did bring out another aspect related to personal misconduct exhibited by a set of individuals for which appropriate disciplinary actions have been taken,"" Puri added."

What do they do next? What are the lessons they learned in their eventful journeys? What advice do they have for the current crop of leaders? Veterans Unpacked is a new series of interviews aimed to offer readers lessons from retired bosses on life outside the corner office.

Pradip Shah is credited with having started Indocean, the first foreign, India-dedicated private equity fund in association with Soros Fund Management and Chase Capital Partners. Before that he was managing director of the ratings agency CRISIL, and helped found home loan company HDFC Corp. An accountant by training, Shah got his masters degree in business from Harvard University.

He is chairman of Kansai Nerolac Paints, Sonata Software, BASF (India) and director of Pfizer, Godrej & Boyce and Bajaj Auto, among others. A native of Mumbai, he continues to reside here with his wife and runs IndAsia, a corporate finance and investment advisory.

What have you been up to since hanging up your boots?

The way I see it, I have not retired but continue with my advisory activities at IndAsia, my non-executive roles at Universal Trustees and Grow-Trees.com, as well as chair three listed companies and serve on the boards of four other listed companies, a few unlisted ones, and many not-for-profit organizations.

I also help Trifecta Venture Debt Fund evaluate investments, am a member of the Banks Board Bureau, and during the last year, served as member of a government-appointed committee for economic development of Gujarat post-Covid, and as chairman of IFSC International Retail Business Development Committee.

I have recently been appointed as chairman of the advisory board of Infomo Global, an Australian-Singapore company, and as a member of the Dun & Bradstreet international advisory board. The pandemic means I am overworked, cannot delegate or goof off as I have no hologram of myself to put before a video call!

What keeps you busy now?

As I mentioned, I have a range of activities I am involved in but what I would like to spend more time on is on my charitable foundation Grow-Trees.com. The team there comes up with wonderful themes: Trees for Tribals; Trees for Tigers; Trees for Migratory Birds. Grow-Trees.com is focused on improving the environment for the benefit of all living creatures through the revenue model it pioneered. At a personal level, I do a little mediation and yoga daily and read the Financial Times and the Economist daily.

Looking back, can you tell us about three interesting events or anything that has stayed with you since?

I think getting the business model right in startups is very important, as we did at HDFC and CRISIL, both of which I helped establish. HDFC was the first retail housing finance company in India. Whatever housing finance that prevailed then had failed; at HDFC we developed the system of long-term personal lending based on income and taking alternative security which enabled financing of individuals purchasing flats under construction. At CRISIL, with no help from the global agencies, we created a model that flourished in a business that had never spread its roots outside the USA for 80 years, gave technical assistance to Malaysia and Israel, and created value for all stakeholders - issuers; investors; intermediaries; regulators; and shareholders.

One Interesting event was that when we were setting up HDFC, Mr H.T. Parekh was chairman at ICICI Bank and was occupied till the evening hours when I would update him on the day's events. In those days, IFC would send telexes that were yards long and I would describe the problems to him. One evening, he looked at me and said: ""Enough of the problems. What is the solution?"" I was hardly 24 years old, and it taught me to always look for fixes and solutions.

Another instance happened at CRISIL in 1990, when we were feeling that we were not making headway. Selling the concept of a ratings agency was getting to be hard. So I turned to my boss Mr Narayanan Vaghul, who was chairman, for help. He set a date to address the team of around 20-plus professionals. He was a great motivational speaker and recognized the despondency and said that if things were to get too bad, he would help them with positions at ICICI Bank, if need be. That worked like magic, and for me it meant that motivating a team could make a world of difference.

What do you miss most about the C-Suite?

In an executive position, one can develop and implement ideas - sometimes, one wants to take the reins in one's own hand and execute an idea or strategy.

If you had to relive your corporate career, what would you do differently?

I wish I had carved out time earlier for more activities like Grow Trees. I was keen on doing something in archaeology and indology. I wanted to start an archeology club, and even registered a trademark for it, but then gave it up. I would have also started CRISIL earlier than I did.



I am very impressed by the boldness of talented youngsters in conceptualising ideas, having the confidence to implement them and the latitude they get from financiers and their boards in running up losses! I am also dismayed at the short-termism in remuneration structures of CEOs, the green-washing that goes on, and the inflated PR that is done on ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) - all this is much more visible in the West.

Which business leader in the current crop impresses you?

There are so many of them, indeed so many who shine out on competence, ethics and purpose; so many one has to admire. It's not just financial achievement that makes a leader great but also the larger purpose that they serve along with their companies, and that's what separates the great ones from the good ones.

How did you plan for life after retirement?

I went to Harvard when my father had just died, and worked as a night watchman to make ends meet. Finding it too difficult, I wrote cases for a professor; at CRISIL, I was described as the lowest-paid Harvard MBA in the world. So I had no opportunity to develop extravagant taste. The savings habit was strongly reinforced from that experience. Knowing a little about companies, entrepreneurs and the economy, I was able to invest well. So finances are not a problem.

Currently and for the foreseeable future, my time is fully occupied in work-related matters; if I get a little free time, I like to read: I have a pile of books on my bedside table on subjects like Haiku and other poetry, philosophy, quantum physics, indology, that I continue reading from where I last left off. I have built up a decent home library. When the pandemic is over, we will resume travel. I continue to send suggestions to the government whether it wants them or not, and knowing full well they will be ignored most of the time.

Is there anything you would tell your younger self?

If a time machine were to be able take me back in time, I would tell my younger self to take more career-risks early in life, not wait to travel, and develop a wide range of other interests. In business, I would have started a company or two of my own earlier on in life.

What is your advice for the next cadre of corporate leaders?

Live in a way that you can be trusted to always do the right thing and work not only for money but for a greater purpose. The second is creating the right culture in an organization - for competence, integrity, cooperation, and empathy and respect for each other amongst the team members. The third is to be able to, in one's own way, do something for others with no expectation of returns - it need not be in the form of money. For instance, at CRISIL, we recognized we could make little impact with our finances but a lot more with the talent we had and so came out with a booklet ""Improving the Efficiency & Effectiveness of Not-for-profit Organizations""; at IndAsia, we have tried to be of assistance to entrepreneurs in thinking through business models or troubleshooting problems."

The property in the name of his wife Smita D Parekh was registered on April 9, 2021, registration data accessed by Zapkey.com showed. Stamp duty of Rs 1.5 crore was paid on the property on March 30, 2021. This was at the rate of 3 percent, according to the registration documents.

A spokesperson for HDFC, which finances the purchase or construction of residential houses, commercial real estate, among other related transactions, confirmed the deal. ""There was an independent valuation done by two valuers to ascertain the value of the property so as to confirm that the purchase was at market value,” the spokesperson told Moneycontrol.

The spokesperson said details of the transaction were shared with the HDFC board to seek their prior approval before committing to buy the property.

The property— located in Worli and housed in Artesia, a project launched by K Raheja Corp—is on the 25th floor and has six parking slots. It offers views of the Arabian Sea and the Bandra-Worli Sea Link.

The luxury apartment has a carpet area of 6,770 sq ft and a balcony area of 273 sq ft, registration documents shared by Zapkey.com said.

The deal is the latest in a series of real estate transactions that have occurred in Mumbai. In order to boost the stagnant real-estate market hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra government on August 26, 2020, decided to temporarily reduce stamp duty on housing units from 5 percent to 2 percent until December 31, 2020. Stamp duty from January 1, 2021, until March 31, 2021, was 3 percent.

On March 31, 2021, the Maharashtra government decided not to extend the stamp duty waiver on property registrations and kept the Ready Reckoner Rates (or circle rates—the minimum designated price per sq ft for land or property at which transactions have to be registered) unchanged for the financial year 2021-22. Regular rates of 5 percent are applicable from April 1 onwards.

During the pandemic, several businessmen, bankers, and owners of listed companies bought high-value luxury properties, indicating that stock market money may be finding its way back into real estate.

In December 2020, HDFC vice-chairman and CEO Keki Mistry, bought an ultra-luxury apartment in Mumbai in the same project worth Rs 41.23 crore. The residential deal in India’s financial capital took place as homebuyers scrambled to register properties before the deadline of the 3 percent stamp duty cut expired on December 31, 2020.

The same month, former HDFC Bank boss Aditya Puri’s family purchased a Rs 50 crore property in Mumbai. The unit, located in Lodha Seamont on Malabar Hill, near Raj Bhawan in Walkeshwar, is on the 19th floor and came with seven car parking spaces.

Raheja Artesia has 55 floors. The monthly rent for an apartment of the size bought by Mistry is around Rs 14 lakh per month, local brokers said."

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Mortgage lender, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), on Wednesday said it has cut its home loan rate by 5 basis points to all retail customers effective March 4. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.

HDFC has reduced its Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR) on

which its Adjustable Rate Home Loans (ARHL) are benchmarked, by 5 basis points, with effect from March 4, 2021, the bank said in a statement .

The change will benefit all existing HDFC retail home loan customers, it said.

With the rate cut, HDFC will now offer home loans at 6.75 percent to borrowers irrespective of the loan amount.

Last week, country's largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) reduced its home loan rates to 6.75 per cent. The lender also waived processing fee for its customers , it said. Private sector Kotak Mahindra Bank, too, announced cut in its lending rates recently. The RBI has been prodding banks to cut their lending rates. The RBI has cut its key lending rate, repo, by 250 bps since February, 2019.

The interest concession is based on the loan amount and CIBIL score of the borrower. SBI believes it is important to extend better rates to customers who maintain good repayment history, the bank said.

“SBI, being the market leader in home finance, takes ownership in bolstering consumer sentiments. The affordability for the consumer increases immensely with the present offerings as the EMI will be reduced,” the bank said.

SBI Home loan interest rates are linked to CIBIL score and start from 6.70 percent for loans up to Rs. 75 lakh and 6.75 percent for loans above Rs 75 lakhs, the bank said.

Customers can also apply from the ease of their home via YONO App to get additional interest concession of 5 bps. On the eve of International Women’s day, a special 5 bps concession is being made available to the women borrowers, the bank said.

The home loan portfolio of the bank has crossed the milestone of Rs 5 lakh crore, it said. As of December 31, 2020, the bank has a deposit base of over Rs 35 lakh crore and advances of more than Rs 26 lakh crore with a CASA ratio of about 45 percent. SBI commands over 34 percent market share in home loans and around 33 percent in the auto loans segment, the bank said."

Neha Dave and Anubhav Sahu

The Indian capital markets showed tremendous resilience during the pandemic. Smooth functioning of exchanges and market participants at the time of lockdown is praise worthy. However, yesterday’s outage at NSE exposes the systemic fragilities in the capital markets that need to be addressed.

The trading halt for more than 3 hours, making it longest ever trading stoppage, is an embarrassment for the country’s leading exchange with around 94.4% market share in cash equities and a 100% share in equity derivatives as at end-December.

The market regulator SEBI has asked the exchange to carry out a detailed root-cause analysis of the halt and explain why trading didn’t migrate to its disaster recovery site. The outage was reportedly caused by issues with telecom links of two of NSE’s service providers.

Were retail investors at the receiving end?

The glitch comes at a time when the Nifty has crossed a new milestone of 15,000 and retail participation has shot through the roof. Since many brokers, especially discount brokers, had a hard stop for intraday trades, cash and F&O positions were squared off around 4 and 4.15 pm respectively. NSE opened the extended trading hours at 3.45 pm, leaving very little time for traders to prepare.

Note that average daily turnover for the F&O segment has been on an uptick since Q4 FY20 and that the cash segment had seen a sharp jump from Q1 FY21 onwards. NSE daily equity cash turnover was in the range of Rs 40,000 crore till March 2020 and has swelled to more than Rs 70,000 crore recently. This gives an idea about the impact on the exchange’s business.

Table: NSE Average daily turnover (ADT) comparison

Source: NSE

If we compare the cash segment’s 24th Feb data with that of average trading values in Jan’21, there was a 37 percent drop in both volume and value of traded contracts. This implies a business turnover impact of about Rs 27,000 crore. Since the value and volume contraction is the same, that is the average size of transaction remains same, it is difficult to infer if there is a disproportionate impact on the retail segment.

Given that institutional investors are better equipped on the funds’ front, it would be reasonable to expect that that retail investors suffered more due to the issue.

Institutional investors also have the added advantage of being able to hedge in the derivatives’ market. In fact, the data from the F&O segment does suggest that they resorted to that risk management tactic, particularly in futures, on what was a very unusual trading day. That’s perhaps why the F&O segment is giving a mixed picture and should not be given too much importance in understanding the impact of this event on retail participants.

Impact on market efficiency?

Another issue during trading hours of 24th Feb is that the latency of the order messages was higher than usual. The mean time was almost 50 percent higher than usual days. In layman’s terms, latency is measured as the complete round trip for an order message (includes new, modification and cancel) within the exchange trading infrastructure. This would have also led to weak price discovery/order execution for traders. However, the financial impact of this aspect on retail participants is very difficult to estimate.

Effect on other businesses

The incident has not only left a bad taste among retail investors but also had knock-on effects on several other businesses. For instance, many service providers have systems tied to prices on the exchange. All these came to standstill. NSE earns around 3% of its revenue as data feed charges.

How did the BSE stand out?

BSE was a clear beneficiary as the trading in its cash segment jumped to Rs 40,700 crore – way higher than their daily metric by about 6x and closer to that of its stronger peer – NSE. This figure, of course, would have been even higher if brokerages that were mapped to the BSE were of a similar order as that to the NSE. This brings a business takeaway for financial intermediaries, to have a backup arrangement with the BSE for rare days like this.

Regulatory response

To be fair, trading stoppages are a common occurrence globally and reasons have ranged from software and hardware glitches, cyberattacks and even hungry squirrels. The NASDAQ faced an outage in the early nineties as a squirrel chewed through a power line and a backup power system failed to kick in.

As a matter of fact, there have been a series of high-profile outages in CY20 across the globe. Tokyo Stock Exchange endured in October its worst ever outage, prompting the chief executive to resign a month later.

While outages do occur, there is need for standardization of response for such events.

While the post-issue analysis and follow-on measures might help, the incident also puts the regulator (SEBI) in the spotlight for lack of proper communication during the incident. A clear communication and trading protocol needs to be established. For instance, the decision for extension of trading on the NSE was taken quite late and was bit abrupt. And by that time various brokers had already initiated closing of client positions. SEBI can also consider ways to compensate the retail investors for losses endured due to technical failure. For that, it can levy hefty fines/penalties for such events. This is similar to what brokerages are sometimes liable to pay in case of glitches at their end.

The NSE incident underscores the concerns that technology and digitisation presents to the financial world. Increased frequency of such incidences can roil markets and shake investor confidence. It calls for tighter standards for not only exchanges but also other key market intermediaries like depositories, brokers, banks and others to prepare and avoid for technology failures.

In an unrelated but similar event the largest private sector bank HDFC Bank was pulled up by RBI for frequent outages in its digital infrastructure (internet banking and mobile app). RBI has appointed an external firm to audit HDFC bank’s IT infrastructure and placed an embargo on their new digital launches as well sourcing new business.

SEBI should could take a cue from the same and take appropriate actions to strengthen the digital infrastructure of capital markets."

Milind Barve, 63, will retire from HDFC AMC on February 15, 2021. Barve has spent 20 years as the founding managing director at one of India’s the largest mutual fund houses. In a chat with Jash Kriplani and Kayezad Adajania, Milind Barve traces his journey with HDFC AMC and HDFC Ltd.

Playing the boss

Many people talk arrogantly and are seen as effective bosses. That is not my definition of an effective boss. You have to be aggressive in your thought process, you have to be aggressive in your strategies and how you drive people to achieve them.

I believe in empowering my team and making them feel responsible. I often tell my zonal heads that they know their regions better than I do. It gives them a sense of belonging and ownership.

On why few fund managers left HDFC AMC over 20 years

Salaries are just one part. But we must make employees feel important. I believe in having an emotional connect with them. Today, I know most of my senior colleagues, their families, I know which colleges their children attend, here or abroad, or what are they doing.

What Deepak Parekh taught me…

He emphasized the importance of customer service, being accessible to and compassionate with my team-members. My goal has always been to make HDFC AMC culturally as close as possible to what I experienced at HDFC Ltd, where I worked for 16 years.

The growing years at HDFC

HDFC Ltd was not a big brand in its early days. But it was the first in the world of business and finance to lend money to retail borrowers for buying houses. We had to go from bank to bank for getting the finance for onward lending. It was tough to convince banks about our company and business. Mr Parekh was easily accessible to everyone in the company; even the junior-most. At age 26, when I applied for a job at HDFC, Mr Parekh had interviewed me.

On the early days in Poona (Pune)

There was great work-life balance in my early work years in Poona. I could even go home for lunch. After work, I used to play badminton. But as those were early days of HDFC Ltd, we had to create our own systems from scratch. Mr Parekh and team used to often call me to Mumbai for work, and I eventually shifted there.

On life after retirement

I would like to do something in an advisory role or do philanthropy."

ICICI Direct's research report on HDFC

HDFC Ltd posted better-than-expected profitability on account of better than estimated topline growth. Pick-up in individual business and broadly stable asset quality were also a hallmark for the quarter. Overall asset quality performance was healthy as proforma GNPA was marginally up ~8 bps QoQ to 1.91%. Proforma GNPA in individual and non-individual book was at 0.98% and 4.35% vs. 0.88% and 4.19% QoQ, respectively. Collection efficiency in individual loans for December 2020 improved to 97.6% vs. 96.3% QoQ while overall collection efficiency remained at ~92%. The quantum of loans invoked and restructured under RBI’s resolution framework for Covid-19 related stress was at 0.9% of AUM (~Rs 5010 crore), of which ~26% came from individual segment. Of total restructuring, one large account contributed ~Rs 2600 crore (~0.5% of AUM). HDFC has made provisions worth Rs 594 crore during the quarter, including Covid provisions, thus taking cumulative Covid provisions to Rs 959 crore. Further accretion in restructuring could not be ruled out. However, provisioning buffer was at a healthy level of ~2.6% of advances vs. ~2.8% of stressed asset (1.91% proforma GNPA + 0.9% restructuring).

Outlook

we arrive at a TP of Rs 3100 (earlier Rs 2200), value core business at 2.6x FY23E ABV and subsidiaries at 15% holding company discount. We upgrade our rating from HOLD to BUY.

Highlights

- RBI report encourages conversion of a large NBFC into a bank

- With reducing regulatory arbitrage between a bank and an NBFC, merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank makes a lot of sense

- HDFC can benefit from HDFC Bank’s retail and low-cost deposit franchise

- Merger can enhance HDFC Bank’s cross-sell opportunities and increase capital efficiency

- Pros and cons of merged entity– profitability will come down but may create room for more foreign holding

- Merger will create a lot of synergies and a financial behemoth --------------------------------------------------------

Note from the Editor: We had published this piece in Moneycontrol Pro over a year ago. Now, we are opening the paywall on this to make it accessible to all readers while we continue to cover all aspects of the merger.

With HDFC set to acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank, the merger between the two is finally a reality, which is likely to create the third-largest entity in India in terms of market capitalisation.

In an exchange filing, HDFC announced that the company will merge itself with HDFC Bank following a union of subsidiaries HDFC Holdings and HDFC Investments. A similar announcement was made by HDFC Bank in a separate exchange filing.

This merger between HDFC Bank (CMP: Rs 1,639) and housing finance giant HDFC (CMP: Rs 2,738) had been talked about for a very long period. Ever since the merger of ICICI Bank and its parent ICICI in 2001, there is speculation that the fate of HDFC and HDFC Bank may be similar.

While the talks of a possible merger between the two keep surfacing time and again, a report by an Internal Working Group of the Reserve Bank of India re-ignited such speculations. The IWG recommending that well-run large NBFCs may be considered for conversion into banks heightened the case for the HDFC Bank–HDFC merger.

Once the merger process gets complete, it promises to create a financial behemoth with a loan book size of Rs 15 lakh crore and an asset base of Rs 21.5 lakh crore.

The managements of both entities have always maintained that a merger is possible in the long run if regulatory hurdles are sorted out and if the move is beneficial to all stakeholders.

As per current structure, HDFC owns 21.5% equity in HDFC Bank. Since it was set up in 1994, HDFC Bank under the leadership of Aditya Puri has overshadowed its parent HDFC in terms of growth and performance and has been the Street’s favourite.

Nonetheless, the current structure of two separate entities has worked remarkably well for several years. This gets validated by the fact that the combined market cap of HDFC twins is more than that of Reliance Industries - the country’s most valuable company. And if we take the combined market cap of all the 4 listed companies in the HDFC group, it is just shy of the market cap of the entire Tata group which has over 20 listed companies.

So the moot question is: Why consider a merger?

Create a funding advantageHDFC has done exceedingly well in managing its spreads across interest rate cycles. However, its cost of borrowings, despite being the best among NBFCs, stood at around 7.20% in the second quarter of FY21. In contrast, HDFC Bank’s cost of funding stood below 5%.

Though HDFC’s funding cost has declined in the current fiscal, the reduction has not been proportionate to the fall in interest rates. That’s because HDFC’s deposit book stands at Rs 148,330 crore, constituting 35 percent of total borrowings as at end-September. Though deposits are stickier, interest paid on deposits is generally higher compared to funds accessed from bond markets.

Overall, HDFC being largely a wholesale financier is relatively more exposed to volatility in interest rates and liquidity than HDFC Bank. A merged entity will have a more sustainable and favorable funding profile.

While funding benefits will be real and known for years, the regulatory cost of merging into the bank has been the biggest impediment. However, the RBI is increasingly moving towards reducing the regulatory arbitrage between a bank and an NBFC which makes the environment more conducive for merger.

Reducing regulatory arbitrage supports mergerThe norms on regulatory asset-allocation for banks are quite stringent as they need to allocate 40 per cent of assets towards priority sector loans in addition of setting aide cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR). This makes banks’ asset mix much more inefficient versus non-bank lenders.

The RBI, in 2014, scrapped reserve requirements for infrastructure lending and funding affordable housing through long- term bonds, eliminating the widely-known and biggest stumbling block for the merger. The other regulations like NPA recognition, provisioning, risk weights are almost identical for banks and housing finance companies (HFCs).

Loans to individuals constitute around 75 per cent of HDFC’s loan book as at end-September and it is increasingly targeting the economically weaker section (EWS) and lower income group (LIG) segments in affordable housing since a couple of years. For instance, in the first half of this fiscal (H1 FY21) around 18 per cent of home loans in value terms have been to customers from the EWS and LIG.

With relaxation from RBI on affordable loans, efficiency of a merger between HDFC’s assets with that of HDFC Bank has improved considerably.

The merger makes sense for HDFC on many counts, but what’s the incentive for HDFC Bank?

Merger will entail diversified loan mix and higher capital efficiency for the bankHome loans constitute only 6 per cent of HDFC bank’s loan book as at end-September. The proportion is much higher in case of peer banks. As per the current arrangement, HDFC Bank sources home loans from HDFC for a fee.

With HDFC Bank incrementally focusing on corporate loans and being cautious on unsecured lending (personal loans and credit cards), the loan book is likely to tilt in favour of corporates.

A potential merger will not only lead to a well-diversified loan mix but will also help meet priority sector requirements. The merged entity’s capital efficiency will be higher as housing loans carry less risk weights as compared to other retail loans. Moreover, HDFC Bank’s growing capital requirements can be met by small stake sales in the group’s other key businesses.

Source: Company, data as of end September'20

Additionally, HDFC has 7.7 million customers and around 2.1 million depositors. A merger will help unify the customer base and also increase cross-sell opportunities for the bank.

Merger can create room for more foreign holdingForeign holding in HDFC Bank is capped at 74 per cent and it has already crossed 71 per cent in November ’20. Due to limited room for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to buy HDFC Bank stock domestically, the bank’s ADR trades at significant premium (over 15%) to its domestic share price.

Foreign shareholding of HDFC stands at around 70 percent of its paid-up share capital and accordingly HDFC’s stake of around 21 per cent in the HDFC bank is deemed as indirect foreign shareholding. A merger can open up the window for FPIs as the foreign holding in a merged entity may fall below the current limit of 74 per cent increasing the room for more buying in the merged entity.

A win-win for bothDespite the synergies on cost and capital front, the merger won’t be a smooth ride. Since only part of HDFC’s loans is towards affordable housing (assuming 40-50 per cent of individual loans), the merged entity will have to allocate funds for CRR and SLR on remaining portfolio. This will adversely impact margins and profits. The merger could also lead to a potential loss of some bancassurance tie-up.

But with benefits outweighing the cost, the merger can be a win-win situation for both entities. The exact benefit to the shareholders of HDFC twins will depend on the swap ratio.

While HDFC twins have already created a lot of shareholder wealth individually, it wouldn’t be over the top to say that the merger of HDFC Bank and HDFC will increase shareholder value manifold.

A similar incident had taken place in December 2019, with customers complaining that they were unable to pay their loan EMIs or settle credit card bills on time.

Following this, RBI deputy governor MK Jain had said the regulator had taken into account the outage and deployed a team of experts to investigate the matter.

It was later found that the outage took place because the lender ""underestimated"" growth in payment volumes and the disruption was more of a capacity issue."

HDFC Ltd reported higher than estimated Q2FY21 numbers led by improvement in AUM growth and steady asset quality. However, overall PAT growth was capped due to lower other income during the quarter. Asset under moratorium (by value) was at Rs 7977 crore as on September 2020 (~1.48% of AUM). Asset quality improved with GNPA ratio down ~6 bps QoQ to 1.81% (GNPA - Rs 8511 crore vs ~Rs 8631 crore QoQ). GNPA in the non-individual portfolio deteriorated to 4.19% vs. 4.1% in June 2020.

With an all-round performance on growth, margins and asset quality, HDFC Ltd’s Q2FY21 earnings stood healthy despite lower other income gains. We tweak our EPS estimates by 7% factoring higher loan growth ay 12%(earlier 10%) and lower GNPA at 2% (earlier 2.5%) for FY21. While our forecasts of 2.1% GNPA (vs current 1.8%) and mere 4% loan growth for remainder of FY21 spells conservatism, shock absorbers such as adequate provisions buffers (ECL:49%, ECL/EAD:2.6%), liquidity (4% of BS) and healthy core capital (19.5%) should enable HDFC to maintain superior book and healthy growth. Robust collection efficiency into retail loan book at 96%+ led by stronger recoveries and sustenance of pricing power (3.3% NIMs) defying competition further reinforces our confidence in the continued growth story of HDFC Ltd. Going forward, further stock re-rating (post the recent run-up) would be an interplay of two factors, (a)sustainability of healthy growth and (b)controlled non-individual NPAs (current:4.19%).

State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, and HDFC Bank have started red-flagging such transactions that defy traditional company patterns.

Banks are keeping an eye on companies that have recorded a spike in trading, dealing with unrelated goods and services, or there’s a sudden outflow of money to other countries, said a report by The Economic Times.

“Since April some of the top banks have seen a jump of around 30 percent and in some cases even 50 percent where they have come across as suspicious patterns,” a person familiar with the matter said.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has been inspecting several transactions and even pulled up some of the large public sector banks for taking the mechanism of red flags “casually”, a senior bank official told ET. Regulations demand banks, non-banking finance companies and insurance companies to report suspicious transactions to FIU every month. The report suggests that there are around one million suspicious transactions reported to FIU annually.

The FIU has now initiated investigations in several cases. Banks, too, are bringing in forensic investigators to help identify these red flags. Gaganpreet Singh Puri, leader, forensic services, at PwC India, said “many companies and individuals that were using cash transactions or illegal ways to sidestep or circumvent regulations are now unable to do so"" because of the pandemic and credit contraction. “Therefore, we now see fraud issues simmering and getting called out increasingly,” he said."

HDFC has strengthened its balance sheet further with recent capital raise (shoring up tier-1 to 19.5%) over and above provisioning buffer of 2.64% of AUM and excess liquidity (at >5% of balance sheet). While movement from Morat 1.0 to Morat 2.0 has not been overwhelming (higher print at 16.6% for retail and 39% for non-retail) due to request-based disclosure approach (not collection efficiency), flow into restructuring will still be restricted. Similar to actions in Q4FY20, HDFC might proactively prefer recognising non-Covid stress upfront (rather than restructuring). Disbursement trends MoM (>80% in July) suggest normalisation in a couple of months and start of growth phase post Q3FY21. Factoring-in the recent capital raise, we revise our EPS and BV upwards by 10%/1% and 12.7%/13.4% respectively for FY21E/FY22E.



Outlook

We maintain our stance of excess buffers (credit cost, liquidity, capital) and superior profile to support earnings traction and help consolidate HDFC’s positioning amidst adversity. Maintain BUY with a revised SoTP-based target price of Rs2,423 (earlier: Rs2,345).

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""Increments are higher at mid/junior levels compared to top/senior management,"" the survey said.

The survey by leading consultancy Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP showed that timing and potential impact of COVID-19 were the two most important factors that affected increments in 2020-21.

""Organisations that had already decided their increments before the start of the lockdown in March 2020 have given a higher increment compared with others.

The second joint venture between Hines and DLF has secured a construction loan of Rs 2,600 crore from HDFC.

Hines, an international real estate firm, and DLF formed the joint venture in March last year to develop an office project in Phase-V, Udyog Vihar, NH-48, Gurugram.

Spread across 11.76 acres of commercial land parcel purchased through an auction process conducted by Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC), the project will be developed in two phases - 2.55 mm sq. ft will be developed in phase I, while the rest will be developed in phase II.

The construction will commence soon, and buildings will go live starting 2023, the company said.

“This is a significant development and will augur well for the real estate industry and corporate tenants in India. Having worked as a financial partner with Hines and DLF for One Horizon Center, we are delighted to grow our partnership to set new standards for commercial buildings in India,” said Renu Sud Karnad, managing director, HDFC.

Ashok Tyagi, group CFO, DLF, said, “Implementing international best practices in the Indian conditions has been the hallmark of our partnership with Hines. After a successful collaboration in the past, we are now looking forward to take the relationship forward with the new development.”

“We have been working together with DLF for the past ten years to create landmark developments. We are now taking this partnership to the next level by joining hands to develop future-proof office project incorporating Hines’ latest knowledge from around the world, including intensive involvement of our Conceptual Construction Group and Office of Innovations. This project will be the address of choice in future,” said Amit Diwan, managing director and country head for Hines India.

The project is being designed by award-wining design architect Pelli Clarke Pelli, whom Hines has roped in for the first time in Delhi-NCR for this project.

Hines is a global real estate investment firm with a presence in 205 cities across 24 countries. It entered India in 2006 and has so far invested $400 million equity for development of six projects, of which two are already completed."

Mistry further said that RBI’s one-time restructuring was necessary given how many industries were affected by the COVID-19.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Mistry also talked about HDFC successfully raising Rs 10,000 crore via equity issuance as well as raising just over Rs 300 crore upfront via a warrant issue.

In terms of liquidity, he said, “Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has done a very commendable job in terms of maintaining liquidity in the system. There was a lot of tightness in liquidity in the latter part of March and early April but since then RBI has been very liberal in terms of ensuring that there is enough liquidity in the market and the liquidity reaches even the weaker segments of the markets,""

""So hats off to RBI, it is a great job. My sense is liquidity will remain more or less at these levels, I don’t see interest rates coming down very sharply in the short-term at least because we have some fear of inflationary pickup and there is adequate liquidity in the system. So my sense is these rates will remain at these levels at least for some time,"" Mistry added.

When asked about one-time restructuring, he replied, ""Restructuring was necessary not just for real estate because there are so many industries that have been impacted because of COVID – hotels, airlines, hospitality and of course real estate.

""So when RBI permitted the moratorium, they said the moratorium will be allowed for all loans that were standard on March 1. If the restructuring was also done along similar lines that is all loans that were standard as of March 1 then I think that would go a long way in benefiting every segment of the market,"" he said.

On personal loans, he further mentioned, ""I am not very sure that you would need to do any massive amount of restructuring on personal loans. Let us wait and see, I guess you will have to do it case-by-case, you cannot apply the same yardstick for every single loan."""

HDFC has reported PAT of Rs32.bn (-4.7% yoy, +36.7% qoq), backed by steady operating performance and Rs12.4bn one-off gains from the stake sale in HDFC Life. The company has made additional Covid-19-related provisions of Rs4bn (total provisions at Rs12bn), considering uncertainty over the moratorium. The moratorium rate in Phase 2 fell to ~22.4% of AUM (individual at ~16.6%) from ~27% of AUM (individual at ~22.6%) in Phase 1. These numbers are slightly higher than Street estimates. Our discussion with management indicates that ~39% moratorium remains on t9he non-individual book, which is also on a higher side. HDFC remains our top pick in the NBFC/HFC space due to a relatively longer asset maturity duration (supporting AUM growth), superior liability franchise and a low risk of default (exposure to secured mortgage) as well as a robust collection mechanism (mainly digital). The capital buffer against elevated slippages provides comfort.



Outlook

We are factoring in equity dilution of Rs70bn during FY21E (Rs70bn would be raised through convertible warrants), but do not factor in gains from the stake sale in HDFC ERGO. We raise earnings by ~16.3%/~16.7% for FY22/23E and roll forward to Sept’22E. We maintain Buy (OW in EAP) with a revised TP of Rs2,000, ~1.6x P/B Sept’22E (Std.).

YoY PAT de-grew by 5% as Co. made hefty Rs12bn provisioning led by COVID challenges. While current NPA position is masked by moratorium dispensation, overall morat loans declining to 22% from 27% in phase 1 is quite comforting. Moreover, individual loans morat 2 too declining to 17% from 23% earlier. As retail morat slippages are being tackled effectively, we maintain caution on developer/LRD businesses given macro headwinds.

Q1FY21 also saw HDFC maintaining pricing power (exclusive of negative carry cost, NIMs stood steady at 3.3%) in the heated home loan market with rates revision. Besides, with sizeable capitalization backed by strong internal accruals, subsidiary stake sale gains and another Rs145bn capital raise approval in pipe-line, HDFC stands geared for both organic/inorganic growth opportunities once economy normalizes.

HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh on July 30 urged state governments to offer sweeteners to homebuyers by providing temporary stamp duty waivers to boost housing demand. “Customers today prefer ready-to-move-in homes over those under construction. I do hope that some state governments will offer some sweeteners like say a temporary stamp duty waiver to encourage more homebuyers,” Parekh told shareholders at the 43rd Annual General Meeting of HDFC.

In the residential sector, he said inherent demand for home loans continues to remain strong and the combination of low interest rates, fiscal incentives and softening of realty prices bodes well for new homebuyers.

With regard to the housing sector, he said the inherent demand for home loans continues to remain strong and the combination of low interest rates, fiscal incentives and softening of realty prices bodes well for new homebuyers.

He also discounted the impact of work-from-home (WGFH) culture on commercial realty, saying that many large firms were using the lockdown as an opportunity to buy up properties when prices are low.

Parekh said there is a misconception that demand for commercial real estate will diminish with more companies opting to WFH. “However, many large companies have in fact acquired or leased commercial properties during this period, particularly in Bengaluru and Hyderabad,” he said.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

The commercial real estate sector has been impacted largely due to massive migration of labour, which is making resumption of projects a challenge. “The sector needs support and policies are needed which will encourage labourers to return to construction sites with adequate precautions and protection. This is important because construction is the second largest employment generator in the country,” he said.

Parekh sees demand for real estate from newer sectors like warehousing, e-ecommerce companies and from cloud and data centres as they seek to increase their data storage capacities."

India’s largest mortgage lender HDFC has had a challenging quarter. A 5 percent decline in net profit over the year can be partly attributed to the Rs 1,199 crore additional provisions the non-banking finance company (NBFC) had to set aside during the quarter to cover the likely Covid-19 impact.

That, however, is no surprise and is line with the industry—something unavoidable in the present business environment. Total provisions of Rs 4,452 crore also include Rs 2,453 crore provisions made on bad loans.

What is even more critical is the trend of moratorium loans. According to the figures released by the lender, 22.4 percent of the loans are under moratorium-2 (June-August) as against 27 percent in moratorium one. This means, unlike large banks which have seen a sharp reduction in moratorium-2, HDFC still has a relatively high chunk of loans under the moratorium.

This could be a worry for HDFC investors since this is an unassessed risk at his point. Only after the moratorium period is lifted, the actual chunk of stressed loans will emerge. Also, worth noting is the trend in loan growth. In the June-quarter non-individual loans have grown faster than individual loans.

Non-individual loans refer to loans to developers. In the June quarter, non-individual loan book grew by 15 per cent compared with 11 per cent growth in the individual loan book. The reason is obvious: On account of lockdown and a general slowdown in demand, the retail business didn’t perform well forcing the NBFC to focus more on “lending to select AAA-rated corporates.”

As mentioned above, there is no point is comparing NPA figures this quarter since the moratorium was in effect. Only beginning the third quarter, lending institutions will have clarity on what percentage of moratorium loans has gone bad.

HDFC’s high moratorium figures also give us some idea why Deepak Parekh, HDFC Chairman recently requested the Reserve Bank of India governor, Shaktikanta Das not to extend the moratorium beyond August. At an interaction organised by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) between its national council members and RBI Governor, Parekh said:

“Please do not extend the moratorium. We see people who have the ability to pay are using this not to pay. Another moratorium will hurt us, especially, smaller NBFCs.”

Unlike HDFC, large banks have seen a significant decline in their moratorium loan book. A quick glance through the April-June results of major banks shows that the proportion of moratorium loans on their books has come down compared with the preceding fourth quarter. HDFC Bank has around 9 percent moratorium loans at the end of June while ICICI Bank has around 17.5 percent as on June 30.

The concern here is a significant chunk of moratorium loans are loans given to small- and medium-sized companies and retailers. This is the segment that has been affected most during the lockdown and may default on payments.

In his interaction with the governor, HDFC Chairman said there are many borrowers who are opting for moratorium not because they are in financial distress but simply wants to use the opportunity to preserve capital. This is harming banks and NBFCs, especially smaller ones, Parekh said.

The Covid uncertainty is sure to hit lending institutions in the approaching quarters. Even HDFC can’t be immune to the pandemic effects on the economy."

The reported net interest margin (NIM) stood at 3.1 percent against 3.3 percent in the corresponding quarter last year.

The company made a COVID-19 provision at Rs 1,199 crore.

The company said individual loans under moratorium 2 stood at 16.6 percent against 22.6 percent in moratorium 1. Total loans under moratorium 2 stood at 22.4 percent against 27 percent In moratorium 1.

Gross non-performing loans as of June 30 stood at Rs 8,631 crore (equivalent to 1.87 percent of the loan portfolio) against Rs 8,908 crore (1.99 percent of loans) as of March 31.

The company said the current and previous year's numbers are not directly comparable due to unprecedented disruption like COVID-19.

The company received a dividend income of Rs 298 crore in Q1FY21. Profit on sale of investments during the quarter stood at Rs 241 crore.

""After adjusting dividend, profit on the sale of investments, net gains on de-recognition of assigned loans, provisioning and the impact of negative carry on account of higher liquidity, the adjusted profit before tax for the quarter stood at Rs 3,265 crore compared to 2,684 crore in the previous year, reflecting a growth of 22 percent,"" HDFC said."

Non-banking financial heavyweight HDFC will release its June quarter numbers on July 30 in which it is likely to report a rise in net interest income (NII), but PAT may see a decline.

Other than the numbers, the outlook on asset quality, especially on non-individual loans and moratorium books will be in the focus.

IDBI Capital Markets & Securities (a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDBI Bank) expects a 44 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall in HDFC's Q1 PAT while it expects the NBFC lender's NII to rise 12.5 percent.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects a 9 percent YoY AUM growth for the company driven by non-retail lending.

The brokerage sees an incremental cost of funds at nearly 6 percent from capital markets. HDFC's Q1 PAT, as per Motilal Oswal, may fall 26 percent YoY.

Motilal expects a 6.9 percent YoY growth in HDFC's Q1 NII. However, core income may see a mild drop of 0.6 percent YoY.

Core operating profits and core PBT may slip by 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent YoY, respectively.

On the other hand, Kotak Institutional Equities expects HDFC to report a 10 percent YoY growth in NII while NIM may slip 5 bps YoY.

HDFC's provisions may see a rise of 39.3 percent YoY and PAT is likely to drop 7.5 percent YoY, Kotak said.

As per Kotak, HDFC booked capital gains of Rs 1,240 crore on stake sale in HDFC Life and the brokerage expects the company to make equivalent provisions to boost its ECL coverage.

Dividend income of Rs 298 crore, which was nil in Q1FY20, and fair value gain of Rs 33.4 crore against the loss of Rs 45 crore in Q1FY20, will likely support earnings, Kotak said.

ICICI Bank, which intends to raise as much as Rs 15,000 crore, has hired Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan, apart from ICICI Securities, as book-runners for the transaction, according to a report by The Economic Times.

Mortgage lender HDFC plans to raise as much as Rs 14,000 crore, and appointed Kotak Mahindra Bank as the lead bank, the report said.

Both lenders might officially appoint at least six investment bankers this week, the report added.

People's Bank of China (PBOC) has sold a part of its stake in Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), lowering its holding to less than 1 percent.

China's central bank was not listed in HDFC's shareholding disclosure for the June quarter, which identifies shareholders owning more than 1 percent of the company.

PBOC had raised its holding in the housing financier to slightly over 1 percent during the quarter that ended on March 31, 2020. The Indian government was reportedly not pleased with the fact that PBOC was able to raise its stake in HDFC without setting off any alarm bells.

""They are an equity investor like any other institutional investor,"" Keki Mistry, vice-chairman and chief executive of HDFC told Business Standard.

Mistry added that PBOC had trimmed its stake in April or May and their holding is now less than 1 percent.

""I don't know exactly how much. It is a normal thing, the controversy (which was created) was unnecessary,"" Mistry said.

Market players said, as per the report, that PBOC might have cut its holding in HDFC to avoid the public glare.

PBOC hiking its stake in HDFC had increased scrutiny of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) from neighbouring countries. It had also raised fears that China was trying to take advantage of a plunge in stock prices following the COVID-19 outbreak."

Derivatives & Quantitative Outlook

The NBFC space has remained under pressure and was unable to perform in line with the market recovery in the past. However, in the recent recovery, stocks from the NBFC space witnessed fresh upsides and were major drivers of the index up move. Among heavyweights, HDFC Ltd is likely to move out from its three month consolidation zone. It is likely to test its major breakdown levels of Rs 2150 in the ongoing recovery.

Like most stocks, open interest in HDFC has also declined substantially. From near 35 million shares in February it declined to 28 million shares in March and declined further to 26 million shares in May suggesting no addition of OI despite market recovery. However, in the last month itself, significant fresh addition of open interest was observed in the stock. We believe lower levels were used to accumulate the stock. There is ample room for fresh addition. We expect fresh longs to take the stock further higher.

HDFC is well-placed in the current environment to capture profitable market share. The company has access to low cost of funds, a strong ALM position, comfortable leverage, and adequate provisioning on the balance sheet. While the Tier-I ratio is healthy at 16.6%, it is likely to improve further with the proposed INR140b capital raise and stake sale in the Insurance business. This would help HDFC face any contingency, fund its own growth requirement, and further capture any inorganic opportunities at the parent (portfolio buyouts) and subsidiary levels (M&A opportunities). The share of retail customers (by value) that availed moratorium declined ~700bp in the second phase v/s the first phase. On the other hand, the share of corporate loans under moratorium remains high at 40%. However, we derive comfort from the fact that in the past four years, HDFC has quadrupled its provision buffer to INR110b; thus, its provisions now exceed its outstanding GNPLs. HDFC's most of subsidiaries are among the top three players in their respective segments. The company continues to support them when needed; for example, it infused INR85b equity capital in HDFCB in FY19 and is likely to do so again in the future, in our view. Importantly, the value contribution of subsidiaries/associates has been increasing; they now contribute ~54% to our SOTP v/s 37% five years ago and 34% 10 years ago (refer to Exhibit 29).



Outlook

Due to the COVID-19 crisis, near-term growth is likely to be challenging. However, the medium- to long-term outlook remains strong, especially given the much lower competitive intensity within housing finance companies (HFCs). Sharp decline in incremental cost of funds over the past three months would help maintain stable spreads at 2.1-2.3%. Maintain Buy, with SOTP (FY22E-based) of INR2,150.

Shares of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) gained nearly 2 percent intraday on July 2 after Motilal Oswal retained bullish view on the stock, citing likely increase in market share and much lower competitive intensity within housing finance companies.

It said the fundraising would help HDFC face any contingency, fund its own growth requirement, and further capture any inorganic opportunities at the parent (portfolio buyouts) and subsidiary levels (M&A opportunities).

Over the last 5/10 years, HDFC has reported a stable retail AUM CAGR of 17/19 percent.

""Despite its size, it has grown faster than its next largest peer (LIC Housing Finance – five-year retail AUM CAGR of 9 percent). Importantly, growth over the last three to four years has been driven by volumes rather than value, which is a positive,"" said the brokerage which expects this trend to continue, especially given the strong momentum in the Affordable Housing Finance segment – 36 percent of loan approvals by volume are toward the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Low Income Group (LIG) segments.

""While growth would take a backseat in the near term, we are confident of 12–15 percent retail AUM growth from FY22,"" said Motilal Oswal.

HDFC had reported profit at Rs 17,770 crore for the year ended March 2020 against Rs 9,633 crore in the previous year, with 21 percent growth in individual loans (after adding back loans sold in the preceding 12 months) and 14 percent growth in the individual loan book on an Assets Under Management (AUM) basis as at March 2020.

""The share of retail customers (by value) that availed moratorium declined around 700 basis points in the second phase versus the first phase.

Its provisions as of March 2020 stood at Rs 10,988 crore, which was Rs 6,800 crore over and above the regulatory requirement. The provisions carried as a percentage of the Exposure at Default (EAD) is equivalent to 2.44 percent.

Most of HDFC's subsidiaries are among the top three players in their respective segments. HDFC AMC, HDFC Life Insurance Company and HDFC Bank are other listed entities.

India’s largest private sector mortgage financier Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC Ltd) is all set to join fellow heavyweights like RIL, Bharti Airtel and Kotak Mahindra Bank and raise capital to strengthen its balance sheet. A committee of directors of the firm today approved a massive fund raising exercise of up to Rs 14,000 crore in one or more tranches through a combination of financial instruments.

Earlier this week, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported about the mega fundraising plans of the Deepak Parekh-led housing finance powerhouse. The report had said HDFC Ltd was looking to raise around Rs 12,000 crore in multiple tranches via a combination of a QIP and an NCD (non-convertible debenture ) + warrant or FCCB ( foreign currency convertible bond route) .

It had added that the firm wanted to boost its capital buffers due to the uncertainty caused post the outbreak of COVID-19 and potential concerns on asset quality.

The fundraising could be carried out in one or more tranches via issuance of equity shares or compulsorily convertible debentures, non-convertible debentures along with warrants, foreign currency convertible bonds either through a qualified institutional placement or other permissible modes, the company said in its official statement today.

The HDFC statement added that the said funds are being raised to augment its long term resources , finance organic & inorganic business opportunities that may arise in financial services including housing finance and /or in areas where its subsidiaries operate, and to maintain sufficient liquidity and for general corporate purposes.

The company reported a standalone profit of Rs 2,232.5 crore for the quarter ended March 2020, declining 22 percent due to higher provisions related to COVID-19 and high base last year. Provisions (expected credit loss) increased significantly to Rs 1,274 crore for the quarter ended March 2020 which included the impact of COVID-19, against Rs 398 crore in March quarter 2019.

HDFC said it has made provisions of Rs 10,988 crore as of March 31. This is Rs 6,800 crore over and above the regulatory requirement.

In April this year, the news of Chinese central bank hiking stake in Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) didn’t go well with many in New Delhi. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) had bought a 1.1 percent stake in the housing finance major on behalf of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund SAFE. The government was reportedly unhappy about the fact that no alarm signals were raised over this. In an exclusive interaction with Moneycontrol, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh however downplayed the concerns.

No big deal, said Parekh

“There is no issue here. They (PBOC) have been buying stake since the last two years,” said Parekh. “But they are buying for sovereign wealth fund. The front is the People’s Bank as they must be having the foreign exchange. Since the price came down, they bought more,” Parekh told this website. Central banks and sovereign wealth funds routinely invest in Indian financial institutions and non-financial institutions.

Despite Parekh’s assurance, the concerns remained.

Logically, the tensions on the India-China border, which have resulted in the death of at least 20 Indian soldiers, will have an impact on the bilateral relations. This can impact the business relations between the two countries. In fact, even before the latest border conflict, India was wary of the possibility of the Chinese gaining control of local firms, exploiting the steep fall in share prices.

Many Indian companies had seen their share prices falling due to COVID-19 onslaught on the economy. This evoked interest from multinational investors who smelled the opportunity. India’s concern was mainly on Chinese opportunism. By the second half of April, India began to put in place controls to screen Chinese investment proposals in Indian companies. The most recent trigger was the Chinese central bank’s move to hike stake in India’s premier mortgage financier, HDFC.

What are the rules?

India soon effected some rule changes primarily targeting Chinese investors seeking control of Indian companies. The first such change came a week after the news of the PBOC stake purchase in HDFC appeared in the media. The Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) acted to prevent hostile takeovers of Indian companies whose market valuations had taken a severe hit due to COVID-19 related uncertainties.

""An entity of a country, which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the government route,"" it said. In other words, the government revoked the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) proposal from countries sharing land borders with India to government approval route from automatic approval route.

This wasn’t the end of it. The government is also reportedly planning to tighten the scrutiny on Chinese investments through Foreign Portfolio Investments route (FPI). According to a report, the government, in consultation with stock market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India, is planning to set up a body to scrutinise portfolio investments by Chinese companies in Indian companies.

What about the Reserve Bank of India? There are no specific rules from the RBI that restrict investments in India by Chinese companies. According to a 2004 RBI circular, no person being a citizen of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, China, Iran, Nepal or Bhutan shall acquire or transfer immovable property in India, other than lease, not exceeding five years without prior permission of the RBI.

Further, foreign nationals of non-Indian origin resident outside India are not permitted to acquire any immoveable property in India unless such property is acquired by way of inheritance. The RBI rules also say that foreign Nationals of non-Indian origin who have acquired immovable property in India with the specific approval of the RBI cannot transfer such property without prior permission of the central bank.

The idea behind these hurried measures is simple. Once the investments are routed through the government, it can keep a close scrutiny of the profile of investors and the terms of investment. Globally, such restrictions are common for investments from countries that are considered a threat to the destination country.

China—already a major investor in Indian firms

The flip side of restricting Chinese investments in Indian companies is that it could affect many of the existing investments. Indian companies are already struggling to get investments from foreigners. There is no accurate estimate of combined Chinese investments in India. According to some estimates, it could be a cumulative $26 billion. There are a number of companies where Chinese have invested including technology, finance and engineering. These include some big names including Big Basket, Byju’s and Zomato. A blanket ban on Chinese investments and further escalation between the two countries could jeopardise many in the pipeline.

Why China worries us

Chinese investment activities are looked at with some amount of suspicion because of the perception of China’s aggressive approach to dominate economies and markets. Over the years, China has attempted to dominate the trade and investment areas in Asian countries. This has always attracted the attention of policymakers. China has significant investments in Pakistan also. According to a Financial Times report, China’s $62 billion investment under the China-Pakistan economic corridors are looked at with caution by India for its regional political implications. India fears that increased Chinese presence in Pakistan could create security problems for the country eventually.

For this same reason, and especially in the context of China’s latest aggression on the border, India is unlikely to lower guard on Chinese investments in the near future."

The NCLT has allowed Jet Airways to sell its premises in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) to settle Rs 360 crore dues of mortgage lender HDFC, clear overseas debt and cover corporate insolvency resolution process costs.

Jet Airways' insolvency resolution professional Ashish Chhawchharia had moved the NCLT to seek approval to sell its third and fourth floor in Godrej BKC building to clear overseas debt to transfer the title of six aircraft under Export-Import Bank of the US to the corporate debtor, which would help in maximising value of the defunct airline.

The insolvency professional had sought permission of the tribunal for the sale of the premises after a resolution was passed at the 10th committee of creditors (CoC) meeting held on April 24 with approval of 74.45 per cent votes.

The Principal Bench of NCLT in its order on June 11 granted permission to the grounded airline to sell the premises for utilising the proceeds to settle Rs 360 crore dues of HDFC, as against the mortgage lender's claim of Rs 424 crore.

The property is non-core asset of the grounded airlines, which was never used by Jet as part of its airlines business, the order said.

The lenders have kept the reserved price of Rs 490 crore for the property, it added.

Auction for the same is expected to take place on June 26, according to sources.

The order further said that the US Exim Bank holds a charge over six aircraft, of which cumulative depreciated value is over USD 200 million.

""If the amount payable to US Exim is not paid, US Exim will become entitled to repossess the six aircraft. The US Exim bank has agreed that upon the payment of USD 13 million (approximately Rs 90 crore), it will transfer the title of six aircraft to the corporate debtor,"" the order said.

Therefore, after this payment to the US Exim, the defunct airlines can add six aircraft to its fleet which is around USD 200 million (around Rs 1,400 crore), the six-page order added.

The cash-strapped airline, which was grounded in April 2019, owes more than Rs 8,000 crore to banks, with public sector lenders having significant exposure.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai-bench had on June 20, 2019 admitted the insolvency petition filed by the lenders' consortium led by State Bank of India against Jet Airways."

HDFC share price was down 3 percent intraday on June 12 and the stock was also one of the top losers in Sensex.

The stock price has seen a steady fall in the last 7 days and was quoting at Rs 1,734.80, down Rs 52.30, or 2.93 percent at 09:43 hours. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,742 and an intraday low of Rs 1,711.

HDFC said that it will raise up to Rs 4,000 crore by issuing bonds on private placement basis. The issue size of the secured redeemable non-convertible debentures will open on June 15, 2020. The issue is of Rs 2,100 crore with option to retain over-subscription up to Rs 1,900 crore, the company said in a regulatory filing.

The issue, set to close on the same date (June 15), will offer coupon rate of 7.25 per cent per annum payable annually. The date of redemption is June 17, 2030.

""The object of the issue is to augment the long-term resources of the Corporation. The proceeds of the present issue would be utilized for financing/refinancing the housing finance business requirement of the Corporation,"" Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited said.

The company reported a standalone profit of Rs 2,232.5 crore for the quarter ended March 2020, declining 22 percent due to higher provisions related to COVID-19 and high base last year. But it was supported by lower tax cost (down 44.5 percent YoY).

Provisions (expected credit loss) increased significantly to Rs 1,274 crore for the quarter ended March 2020 which included the impact of COVID-19, against Rs 398 crore in March quarter 2019 and Rs 2,995 crore in December quarter.

Brokerage firm Geojit Securities has a buy recommendation on the stock with target of Rs 2,166 per share. The mortgage market in India is still at its infant stage, with the penetration of 10 percent in nominal GDP, implying huge growth potential over the long term aided by fiscal incentives and interest subvention scheme, said the brokerage firm.

According to Moneycontrol SWOT Analysis powered by Trendlyne, HDFC has high debt with declining revenue every quarter for the past two quarters.

Moneycontrol technical rating is neutral with technical indicators being bullish and moving averages being bearish.

Work from home has become the new normal during the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic and the subsequent lockdown phase, and this has affirmed the need for owning larger apartments, HDFC Managing Director Renu Sud Karnad said on June 10.

“With work from home being the new normal, particularly for working couples and young professionals, the need for homes with larger spaces is on the rise. We believe that all this has not only reaffirmed the importance of a home, but has also built a sense of urgency to own a home,"" she said

To capture the growing demand for homes, HDFC, the country's leading housing finance company, is hosting an online property show featuring over 150 projects from more than 75 developers in the Delhi NCR region. The show starting from June 10 will be a month-long event. Viewers can log on to https://delhi.hdfcpropertyfair.com/ to view the show.

The company plans to extend this to properties in the Mumbai Region next week, HDFC said in a statement.

HDFC's online fair is an end-to-end technology platform, providing home seekers real-time information and connecting every phase of the home buying process at one place. They can view the project photo gallery, access detailed information, explore different configurations and take advantage of various offers provided by developers.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""There are three-four new accounts, which we have classified as non-performing assets (NPAs) in this quarter, I don't want to give any names. Out of that, there are two accounts which were not really NPLs – in the sense that they are not 90-day outstanding but we saw a lot of stress in those accounts and therefore we have voluntarily downgraded those accounts,"" he said.

""So if you remove these two accounts and go strictly by the '90-day' definition, then the gross NPLs would have been 1.7 percent as opposed to 1.99 percent,” said Mistry.

""We have had shocks to the system in the past also. In 2013, 2008-2009, 2002-2003 and many instances we can recall. At times like these, NPLs do tend to inch up.

In the housing loan business, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is a giant with a loan book of Rs 4.5 lakh crore. The lender traditionally chooses its customers well.

That could explain the decent growth in loan approvals even in the fourth quarter that was tough for most lenders. Even then, the COVID-19 onslaught has shown its impact on HDFC’s numbers in Q4. A quarter of the total loan book is under moratorium and asset quality has worsened particularly on non-retail loans.

Take a look at some of the key numbers: about 26 percent of HDFC’s loan book is under moratorium. Retail loans under moratorium account for 21 percent of the individual loan portfolio.

Of the total loan book of Rs 4.5 lakh crore, about 76 percent are retail loans. The average size of the retail loan book is Rs 27 lakh. Non-performing assets (NPAs) of the lender has inched up with overall NPAs as a percentage of loan book at nearly 2 percent at March-end compared with 1.18 percent in the year ago period.

What is important to note here is the break up of NPAs and to identify the pain areas. The asset quality has worsened more on the developer loans which shot up to 4.71 percent from 2.34 percent.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

In the retail loan book, NPAs have risen to 0.95 percent from 0.70 percent. The lender has significantly increased its provisions in Q4 to around Rs 11,000 crore from Rs 5,880 crore in the year-ago period. It has made an additional provisioning of Rs 5,913 crore to counter the impact of COVID-19. The message here is that HDFC indeed expects pain going ahead due to COVID-19.

HDFC, as mentioned above, is a cautious lender while choosing its borrowers. Its retail borrowers are mostly salaried employees with large corporate houses. There is not much concern on this part. But, going ahead what it needs to watch is the performance of developer loans.

In Q4 there has been a big spike in NPAs from this segment. The sharp rise in NPAs here was attributable to exposure toward two or three large developers (around Rs 1700 crore).

“Though we remain comfortable toward HDFC’s coverage, further pain in asset quality is inevitable amid macro slowdown post-COVID-19,” Emkay research said in a note.

In Q4, HDFC has managed to grow retail loan approvals by 14 percent in terms of number of customers and 12 percent in value terms. It has also taken sufficient provisions, much above the regulatory requirements, anticipating tough times ahead.

During a briefing post the results, HDFC’s vice chairman and CEO, Keki Mistry said the lender couldn’t do much business in the second half of March on account of COVID-19 situation. As the lockdown is now extended till May 31 (and possibly beyond that), HDFC will see pressure on asset quality on developer loans going ahead and may see lower loan growth overall."

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) to reduce stake in HDFC Life Insurance and HDFC Ergo -- post-merger with HDFC Ergo Health Insurance -- to 50 percent or below from 51.43 percent and 50.58 percent, respectively.

At present, the corporation holds 52.25 percent in HDFC Ergo Health and 50.48 percent in HDFC Ergo and based on the share exchange ratio, HDFC is entitled to 50.58 percent in the merged entity, HDFC Ergo. The stake needs to be reduced within a period of six months from the date of the merger.

In the case of HDFC Life Insurance Company, the corporation needs to lower the stake by December 16, 2020, to 50 percent or below form existing 51.43 percent holding.

""The stake sales could be worth Rs 1,500 crore – 14 percent of FY21e profit and 1-2 percent of net worth. HDFC may utilize such gains to build buffer-provisions. Regular dividend may go down a bit,"" a brokerage said.

Even as HDFC's stake goes to 50 percent or below (ESOP) conversion can also drive slow dilution), these companies may continue to be consolidated as HDFC may be able to exercise control on the board; dividends and other regulations may also not change, it added.

CEO salaries increased at the country's top mutual fund houses during 2019-20 on robust business growth, with HDFC Mutual Fund's Milind Barve being the highest-paid executive.

According to an analysis of the data made public by mutual funds, the CEO salary given by the top 12 fund houses in terms of assets under management increased in the range of 2-132 per cent in 2019-20 from the preceding fiscal year.

However, CEO remuneration of Aditya Birla Sunlife MF, Nippon India MF and DSP MF dropped by up to 19 per cent during the period under review.

The salaries for chief investment officers also witnessed a rise for most fund houses.

Salary disclosed by the fund houses for 2019-20 was decided in April-May 2019 on the basis of 2018-19 profitability, which was at an all-time high for the industry, according to industry executives.

Overall, the past fiscal was a good year for the mutual fund industry barring the month of March, which saw record declines amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Barve, chief executive of second-largest fund house HDFC MF, claimed the top slot with a salary pay-out of Rs 7.43 crore for the fiscal. His package climbed by 3 per cent from Rs 7.23 crore in 2018-19.

In terms of percentage growth, SBI MF, which is the largest fund house in the country in terms of AUM, gave its CEO Ashwani Bhatia a salary jump of 132 per cent to Rs 51 lakh in 2019-20. He had earned a salary of Rs 22 lakh in the preceding fiscal.

Ironically, Bhatia is the lowest paid CEO among the top fund houses.

Apart from SBI MF, fund houses like UTI MF and Kotak MF too gave a staggering salary hike to their respective CEOs.

Barve is followed by Nilesh Shah, the top honcho of Kotak MF, who received a pay package of Rs 7.32 crore, 68 per cent higher than Rs 4.35 crore received in the preceding fiscal.

ICICI Prudential MF paid Rs 6.98 crore to its Managing Director Nimesh Shah last fiscal, a hike of 12 per cent from Rs 6.25 crore in 2018-19.

Nippon India MF's CEO Sundeep Sikka got a salary of Rs 6.01 crore, which is a decline of 8 per cent from last fiscal, while the same for A Balasubramanian, chief executive at Aditya Birla SunLife MF, was at Rs 5.41 crore, a decrease of 7 per cent.

IDFC Mutual Fund chief executive Vishal Kapoor's pay package rose to Rs 5.12 crore from Rs 5.01 crore, translating into an increase of 2 per cent.

Chandresh Nigam, chief executive at Axis MF, got a salary of Rs 4.8 crore in the period under review as compared to Rs 3.97 crore in 2018-19.

However, he took home a pay package of Rs 17.67 crore, which included a one time pay-out.

UTI MF's Acting CEO Imtaiyazur Rahman took home a salary of Rs 4.48 crore in the past fiscal, a 97 per cent jump from Rs 2.27 crore paid in 2018-19.

On the other hand, salary of DSP MF's Kalpen Parekh plunged by 19 per cent to Rs 4.2 crore in 2019-20.

The salary of Sanjay Sapre, president of Franklin Templeton MF, was not available for 2019-20 as the company's financial year ends in September. Sapre's salary was Rs 3.50 crore for the year ended September 30, 2019, as compared to Rs 2.99 crore in the previous fiscal.

L&T MF top boss Kailash Kulkarni's salary rose from Rs 2.41 crore to Rs 2.7 crore in the period under review.

The fund houses started disclosing salaries after Sebi, in April 2017, directed them to disclose annual remuneration of all employees earning Rs 1.02 crore or above within one month of a financial year, starting with 2016-17.

Earlier, remuneration of all employees earning Rs 60 lakh or above in a financial year was required to be disclosed.

This is part of Sebi's effort to promote transparency in remuneration policies so that executive salary is aligned with the interest of investors. While a few mutual fund houses have complied with Sebi's directive and disclosed the information, others still have to comply with the rule.

The asset under management of the industry, comprising 44 players, rose to Rs 27 lakh crore at the end of March 31, 2020 from Rs 24.5 crore in March-end 2019 and Rs 23 lakh crore in March-end 2018."

Share price of leading mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) fell 2 percent intraday on April 22 after it slashed its lending rate by 15 basis points amid a gradual decline in the cost of borrowing across the system.

The move comes after a few lenders, including the country's biggest lender State Bank of India, trimmed their lending rate.

""HDFC reduces its Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR) on housing loans, on which its Adjustable Rate Home Loans (ARHL) are benchmarked, by 15 basis points (bps), with effect from April 22, 2020,"" the company said in a statement. The change will benefit all existing HDFC retail home loan customers, it said.

New rates will now range between 8.05-8.85 per cent. Rates across the banking system have headed south in the last few months, as the RBI and the government work in tandem to propel the slowing economy. The RBI last month cut the policy rate by 75 basis points to spur growth amid the COVID-19 crisis.

In a separate development, HDFC said it will be issuing secured redeemable Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) for Rs 1,250 crore with an option to retain oversubscription up to Rs 3,750 crore on private placement. The issue opens on April 23, 2020 and closes on the same day.

The purpose is to augment the long-term resources of the corporation. The proceeds of the present issue would be utilised for financing/refinancing the housing finance business requirements of the company, it said in a filing to the exchanges.

HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh on April 14 advised real estate developers to offload their unsold inventories at ‘whatever price’ as they require liquidity at this juncture, especially at a time when the sector is grappling with the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic.

“How do we unwind from this crisis. For starters, the price of real estate has to come down and will come down. NAREDCO has estimated between 10 percent to 15 percent. I have said somewhere that one must be prepared even for 20 percent. For those potential future homebuyers who have got job security or cash flows, this will be an excellent buying opportunity as prices come down,” he said at a video conference organised by real estate developers associations- NAREDCO and CREDAI.

“Be willing to offload inventory at whatever price. Take hits in some projects. Get rid of inventory,” he told the developer community.

To which, Irfan Razack, Chairman and Managing Director of the Prestige Group, countered that when a clarion call goes out that prices should go down by 20 percent, even those customers who want to buy will stop buying. “We are completely reduced to the bone. There is no margin left with developers.”

To this, Parekh clarified that his idea was to create liquidity not by borrowing more, but by selling ready stock. “There is a misunderstanding. When I said 20 percent, I meant existing flats. Flats that are already built and people are sitting on it and not selling it because they want a particular price. Readymade flats can be sold and developers can take a cut. Get rid of the unsold stock and even reduce the price for those projects. How long will you sit on unsold stock. You should be able to move on. In two years, you will have to pay tax on unsold projects. Better to get rid of them and stay liquid,” Parekh said.

He added that new launches are bound to be postponed or delayed and that buying decisions for commercial real estate may get postponed until there is more clarity.

“Let me reiterate that commercial space requirements will not evaporate. This work-from-home may be possible to some extent, but I don’t think we are going to see the entire workforce migrate to the work-from-home culture on a permanent basis. There are jobs that cannot be digitised in our industry,” he told realtors.

He asked the developer community to focus on completing projects rather than starting new ones, “even at the cost of putting new ones on hold.”

Parekh in his speech also advised developers to abstain from borrowing heavily. “Borrowings are a double edge sword. While you can leverage and grow during good times, in bad times it can finish off your business,” he explained, adding that it is better to get an equity cushion rather than going in for debt.

He also advised the developers to concentrate on completing the pending projects on time, rather than going in for new launches. “You can also get into joint arrangements with corporates to complete projects,” he said.

In his recommendation to the state government, Parekh mentioned that a waiver of stamp duty for a limited time period just before the festive season would help in reviving demand as well.

“There is also a need to review the ready reckoner rates on a periodic basis. And also allow staggered payments on levies if you want the developers to come back. If this is not done, no one would be able to pay,” he said.

He also advised the developer community to get into joint development agreements, development management agreements. “Get into these arrangements. Work in partnership. Don’t do everything yourself,” he said while addressing representatives from the real estate sector.

He also recommended a one-time restructuring of stressed real estate accounts and relaxation in classification of NPA norms to 180 days from 90 days to help the sector.

“Today, most of the developers are in a stressful situation and many of them are NPAs or will become NPAs. So, first of all we have to convince the RBI that in the interest of the future of the industry, you have to allow us to do restructuring. Once you do restructuring, we can give you (real estate developers) additional money,” he said.

He said the recommendation has already been made to the Reserve Bank.

He also advised the developer community to use the moratorium as the last resort. “Don’t let it slip into an NPA,” he said.

Parekh said the RBI, for some period of time, should extend the classification of NPAs norms to 180 days from the present 90 days.

""This is absolutely necessary otherwise all lending institutions will have massive non-performing loans and massive provisions to be made. They will start making losses and rating agencies will downgrade everyone and it will be a real disaster because businesses will collapse,"" Parekh said.

He also said that renegotiation on repayment timelines is a better solution than getting into legal tangles. “Unwinding from a legal mess will be very painful,” he said."

""I understand that a number of developers may be worried given that a lot of fires had to be doused recently - RERA, GST, etc"" he added.

He added that there is a need to incentivise migrants to return to the states and construction sites.

However, he pointed out that India is well placed to deal with the situation. ""I don't think we should be too gloomy about macros as we have adequate forex reserves. With oil prices falling, our current account will be in surplus. No country gets the kind of NRI remittances that India does,"" he noted.

Parekh also highlighted the need for a waiver of stamp duty and registration charge on housing for a limited time like September-October period.

Charges such as IQR, TDR cost, and ULC will have to be staggered since no can clear the payment upfront.

Parekh said that the pandemic has merged health, economic and financial crises.

India, China and Indonesia are the only G20 countries that will record positive economic growth, Parekh said.

Stimulus measures given by most countries have been inadequate, according to Parekh.

The Reserve bank of India (RBI) needs to act quickly, Parekh said.

Emerging markets have been impacted more than others, he added. The HDFC Chairman said $90 billion of investments have flown out of emerging economies in March.

""Don't think we have reached the bottom of the equity market,"" Parekh said."

The 21-day lockdown triggered by the spread of the coronavirus has entered into the last 10 days and entrepreneurs, the original hustlers, have had to make a plenty of changes to their daily routine to adapt to working from home (WFH). Their daily schedules have been disrupted and their long drawn out usual meetings have been replaced by video calls. Not to mention the stress of a looming economic slowdown and pressure from investors.

Moneycontrol looks at how a scrum of business leaders is dealing with these fast changing times. In today’s edition of Virtual Leaders Rakesh Khar spoke to Keki Mistry, Vice-Chairman and CEO, Housing Development Corporation Bank (HDFC).

Q: How does your average work from home day look like in the lockdown period?

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

A: My average day is as packed as before. Physical meetings have been replaced by virtual meetings. I have calls on strategy, operations, HR, and then we have global investor calls at various time zones. The time I save traveling to the office has by and large been taken by calls through the day.

Q: What is the profile of your work from home? What takes the most time?

A: Primarily, it is about strategy. This has been an unprecedented challenge. We have various groups to engage with during the day. We have created a special new initiatives team which looks at a greater degree of digitisation. This is an altogether new scenario. This is a new style of working. There are more investor calls to attend than during the pre-COVID-19 era – not necessarily about the company - but about the overall business sentiment.

Q: Do you get to spend more time with the family?

A: Yes, I have not stayed home for such a long time. I get to spend more time with my family. I have daily morning tea with my family and spend time with the family over dinner. On Sundays, there is a greater window to spend time with family. I get to spend about 30 minutes in the morning and one hour in the evening with the family during weekdays.

Q: There is no air travel now? How does it feel?

A: There has been no travel for some time now. I used to travel quite a lot during pre-COVID-19 times. Earlier, on an average, it (travel) used to take up to about 10 to 12 days of a month. I am completely at home now. There is obviously more time at hand.

Q: How do you see the Corner Office change in the COVID-19 era?

A: There are new ways to work that we have learnt. One has to go back (as and when the lockdown is lifted) to work and see what best to take and endure from the work from home experience.

Q: What is a key management lesson you would draw from the work from home syndrome?

A: Key management lesson is that we have to be prepared for every kind of contingency. I have seen many upturns and downturns in my professional career. Obviously, what is happening now is unprecedented. There is learning. From August of 2008 and continued up to 2009, there was a downturn. But, from May 2009, the business started to grow and markets were up and up to March 2010 we had a boom period, like we had never seen before. In my view, once COVID-19 is over, a similar thing would happen.

Let us hope and pray that, once COVID-19 is over (end April or end May or whenever), we get down to normalcy. It may take a couple of quarters or three quarters to settle down, but we will experience that the pent-up demand that got created due to the crisis will ultimately unfurl. We have seen that in every crisis. I presume and believe in the current crisis something similar will happen."
"April 14, 2020 07:46 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/keki-mistry-pitches-for-govt-relief-package-allays-fears-over-pboc-stake-hike-in-hdfc-5140261.html,"Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), the country’s largest housing finance lender, expects the government to soon announce a comprehensive relief package aimed simultaneously at the poor and Corporate India.

In an exhaustive interview with Moneycontrol, Mistry outlined the broad features of the stimulus for India Inc. He also dispelled fears about People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) move to acquire about one percent stake in HDFC. “They (PBOC) are passive shareholders. Certainly, this (stake increase) is not with the objective of either taking over the company or taking over the management. There are enough safeguards in the system and that nobody can go and change the management.”

Drawing the broad contours of the fiscal package, the housing finance leader said, “I expect some announcement in the days to come. A relief package means more money in hands of the people, especially poor. We need direct benefits, both, to poor and the industry. This can happen by lowering taxes (direct and indirect). It will fuel consumption and demand. When I say direct taxes – current 43 percent slab is pretty high –reduce it to fuel consumption,” he reasoned.

Mistry dwelt at length on the likely package. “Sectors that are severely dented by COVID-19 need to be addressed immediately. Airline, hotel and real estate need utmost attention. These sectors need a boost in the form of ability to restructure the loan taken from banks, NBFCs or any other lending institution.”

Asked to specify the loan restructuring pitch, HDFC CEO opined, “There is no one formula. I don’t necessarily mean only moratorium. It has to be case to case – it can include extending the term, providing moratorium, etc., as is the individual company requirement. But this has to happen with proper approval of the lending institution board and that too under the stipulated policy framework.”

Using the real estate sector as an example, Mistry detailed the impact of its revival on the economy. “The real estate sector is a huge job creation sector – construction workers, engineers, plumbers, electricians, etc.– directly or indirectly so many industries depend on it. Cement, power, steel and all the ancillary industries are associated with housing. Imagine the number of jobs that can be created by one construction activity. If we can give a boost to real estate sector, things will definitely get better”.

Asked to draw the timeline for economic activity to resume in view of the lockdown, the HDFC official said it was for the government to take a call on that.

“But whenever there is lifting of lockout (whatever date) it should be done gradually. It should be done in a manner in which economic activity resumes gradually. The most important thing is to get workers back. The creation of jobs is paramount. The state mechanism of giving money to the poor cannot sustain forever. Ultimately we have to ensure that jobs get created, sectors that are responsible for job creation are given appropriate incentives to boost demand and consumption.”

Steps to boost co-efficiency

On the relief package impact on the macroeconomy, the housing lender leader said it was not the time to worry about the fiscal deficit. “You worry if there is inflation. You worry if there is buoyancy which is missing not only in India but also globally. Low oil prices are a positive sign for India and they offer a cushion. Unlikely there will be a spike in oil prices.”

What role does he see for India Inc to help revive the economic sentiment? Mistry argued that industries that produce products with high administrative cost component had reason to be cost efficient. But there is no general template here. Each industry has its own cost structure. Cost efficiency, though, can be the overriding mantra.

“The key today is to conserve cash and not spend too much money. It is also time to fortify the capital structure. You may like to increase the capital base while raising equity. Yes, raising equity means dilution,” Mistry prescribed.

He did not see much scope for any further cuts in the real estate sector giving the narrow margins.

In response to a question on fears about (PBOC’s stake increase in HDFC recently announced by the housing lender, Mistry averred, “There are over 2000 FII accounts with HDFC and PBOC is one of them. There has been no active meeting with them and there is no involvement at all in HDFC.”"

The news of China's central bank hiking its stake in Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) has ruffled feathers in the Finance Ministry, according to a report in Mint.People's Bank of China (PBOC) raised its stake to 1.01 percent from 0.8 percent in India's largest mortgage lender HDFC, possibly during the last quarter of FY20.

""Normally, there would be no need for xenophobic hysteria over this but a central bank buying an equity stake in a commercial entity is unusual. No red flag was raised,"" a source told the publication.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

While is there is no law prohibiting central banks of other nations from buying an equity stake in an Indian company, it is unusual. Central banks typically buy bonds of companies in other countries, not equities.

HDFC had informed stock exchanges about PBOC's shareholding on April 11.

""HDFC stock is also owned by SAMA, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (the country's central bank), purchased on behalf of their sovereign wealth fund.

China's central bank, People's Bank of China (PBOC), has bought a 1.1 percent stake in housing finance major HDFC Ltd on behalf of the Chinese sovereign wealth fund SAFE. The transaction is not for the Chinese Central bank itself, said HDFC Chairman, Deepak Parekh, in an exclusive interaction with Moneycontrol.

“There is no issue here. They (PBOC) have been buying stake since the last two years,” said Parekh. “But they are buying for sovereign wealth fund. The front is the People’s Bank as they must be having the foreign exchange. Since the price came down, they bought more,” Parekh said.

Similarly, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) has also picked up a 0.7 percent stake in HDFC on behalf of Saudi sovereign wealth fund, Parekh said. SAMA’s name isn’t reflected in the names of major shareholders as the holding in the company is less than one percent.

Moneycontrol had earlier reported that the PBOC purchased 1.75 crore shares in HDFC in the March quarter. The Chinese Central Bank now has bought 1,74,92,909 crore shares, or 1.01 percent of the shareholding, according to exchange data. The share purchase is likely to have happened between January and March.

The timing of the share purchase is significant given that HDFC shares have been sliding in recent weeks. Since the first week of February, the shares have fallen 41 percent. But, Parekh said there is no reason to worry on account of PBOC share purchase in HDFC.

HDFC shares have fallen 32 percent from its 52-week high of Rs 2,499.65 on January 14, 2020. In this same period, India's benchmark equity index Sensex lost 25 percent while 50-share Nifty lost 26 percent.

Of late, HDFC has seen significant interest from institutional investors. For instance, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) increased its holding in HDFC Ltd to 4.67 percent from 4.21 percent in December quarter.

Earlier, HDFC's Vice Chairman and CEO Keki Mistry had informed Moneycontrol that PBOC has been an existing shareholder and had owned 0.8 percent in the company as of March 2019. The disclosure has been made now since the stake has hit the 1 percent regulatory threshold, Mistry said.

""They have been accumulating the shares over a year and are now holding 1.1 percent,"" Mistry said.​

Other shareholders

Like PBOC, the Saudi Arabian central bank too has been raking up stake in HDFC over the last few years. It now has a 0.7 percent stake in the company, Parekh said. Other major holders include the government of Singapore which holds a 3.23 percent stake in HDFC.

Temasek, a Singapore state-controlled investment company has investments in a range of Indian companies. Over the years, it has invested 5 percent of its global portfolio in India. Central banks and governments picking up stakes in major financial institutions across the world are common. This is part of the sovereign investment strategy and a way of diversifying their investment presence.

Why China makes news

But the news of China central bank picking up stake in a major Indian financial institution made news probably in the context of China’s aggressive bid to dominate the region. Over the years, China has attempted to dominate the trade, investment areas in Asian countries.

This has always attracted the attention of policymakers. China has significant investments in Pakistan also. According to a Financial Times report, China’s $62 billion investment under the China-Pakistan economic corridors are looked at with caution by India for its regional political implications. India fears that increased Chinese presence in Pakistan could create security problems for the country eventually."

As per CNBC TV-18, while it is unclear when People's Bank of China bought the shares, it is likely that the purchases may have been made in March when the stock prices across the board were plunging in the wake of the rout in global financial markets.

Share prices of non-banking finance companies/housing finance companies, as well as banks, were hit hard on April 3 after a media report indicated that NBFCs/HFCs are not eligible for a three-month moratorium on term loans borrowed and are liable to pay regularly.

Reports further stated that the only option open for NBFCs/HFCs would be a separate LTRO (long-term repo operation) window through which banks can infuse sufficient liquidity in order to smoothen bond market transactions.

Nifty Bank index plunged 5.27 percent and Financial Service index dropped 4.25 percent on Friday. Shriram Transport and Cholamandalam Investment fell the most, down 16 percent and 12 percent.

Among others, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, M&M Financial, SBI, HDFC, Indiabulls Housing, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank were also caught in a bear trap, falling 2-9 percent.

But after discussions with management of various NBFC/HFC, brokerage Emkay cleared that the moratorium is applicable to NBFC/HFCs as well.

""Term loans obtained from banks by all NBFCs/HFCs are fully eligible under the moratorium and our discussions suggest that many NBFCs/HFCs would avail the same. But NBFCs/HFCs are not eligible for deferment of interest on working capital loans,"" it said.

Technically, the brokerage feels not allowing NBFCs/HFCs to defer their term loans during the current crisis would completely deteriorate the entire liquidity measures undertaken by the RBI.

During the recent monetary policy meet (March 25-27), the RBI has offered a moratorium of three months to all term loan borrowers, who are likely to be impacted by the lockdown and social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak.

""Since the deferment is available from banks, NBFCs with an elevated share of bank borrowings (Cholamandalam Investment, M&M Financial, Shriram Transport) may opt for a similar deferment from banks and are relatively safeguarded. However, NBFCs with a higher share of bond market borrowings (LIC Housing) could raise incremental money from the LTRO window at the cost of margins,"" Emkay said.

Its assessment suggests that NBFCs with relatively stronger liability franchise (HDFC, Bajaj Finance) would anyhow be better placed, as their ability to raise funds at lower costs would aid margin disruptions.

After further discussions with management, Emkay indicated that the only unclear aspect of this entire exercise is the rating downgrade of securitized pool of assets of such NBFCs and HFCs.

""As per management, the pool of assets, including such deferred loans, should be exempted from downgrade as the said restructuring mandate is from the RBI,"" the brokerage said.

""In case of ratings downgrade of such pools, NBFCs would suffer further margin pressure due to elevated discounting by pool buyers. Also, many financial institutions may opt to stay away from the securitization of these assets,"" it added.

NBFCs/HFCs are confident of resolving this issue with the RBI and SEBI soon.

Hence, considering above parameters, Emkay feels housing finance companies (HFCs) are better-placed than asset finance companies (AFCs) as the overall impact of the deferment would be more visible in AFCs since recoveries are better among large-ticket secured loans.

HDFC remained its preferred pick with safer asset composition (salaried mortgages), longer maturity duration (72 months) and superior collection efficiency (99 percent digital).

""Cholamandalam Investment has high preference followed by Bajaj Finance post the recent correction; however, elevated discretionary exposure (including auto) and shorter maturity duration keep us cautious. We prefer M&M Financial Services the least due to rising delinquencies and low coverage,"" said the brokerage which advised buying HDFC (with a target of Rs 1,971, potential upside of 31.4 percent), Cholamandalam Investment (Rs 253, potential upside of 102.4 percent), Bajaj Finance (Rs 3,137, upside of 42 percent).

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Mortgage lender HDFC will pick up 7.97 percent stake in Yes Bank for Rs 1,000 crore capital infusion in the cash-strapped lender. On March 14, YES Bank allotted 100 crore shares of face value of Rs 2 each to the Corporation aggregating to 7.97 percent of the post issue equity share capital of YES bank, HDFC said in a regulatory filing on March 16.

The allotment of shares comes ""after giving effect to the allotment of shares to State Bank of India, the Corporation, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Federal Bank, Bandhan Bank and IDFC First Bank,"" it said.

On March 13, HDFC said that it is investing in 100 crore equity shares of Rs 2 each in YES Bank for a consideration of Rs 10 per share (including Rs 8 premium) for an aggregate consideration of Rs 1,000 crore.

As per the scheme of reconstruction of YES Bank, 75 percent of the total investment by the Corporation would be locked in for 3 years, HDFC had said.

SBI has invested Rs 6,050 crore in crisis-ridden YES Bank.

ICICI Bank, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bandhan Bank, Federal Bank and IDFC First Bank have also joined the SBI-led consortium and invested in Yes Bank.

Axis Bank will invest Rs 600 crore by buying 60 crore shares and Kotak Mahindra Bank will infuse Rs 500 crore after purchasing 50 crore shares."

It looks like stars are aligning for Yes Bank after the government notified a rescue plan for the private sector lender led by the State Bank of India (SBI) and joined by others.

The reconstruction deal is good for the depositors. However, it may not have gone down well for shareholders and bondholders. The reconstruction scheme notified on March 13, prescribes a three-year lock-in for all investors, including retail investors, to the extent of 75 percent of their holdings.

“All shareholders holding 100 or more equity shareholders are advised to exercise utmost caution while dealing in the script of the Bank and be guided by the enclosed scheme,” Yes Bank said in a release.

Only retail investors that hold under 100 Yes Bank shares are exempted. The lock-in is effective as of March 13.

Under the circumstance, the deal is ‘good’ for shareholders of Yes Bank as compared to the bondholders who have to face a write-down, suggest experts Moneycontrol spoke to.

This means that when trade of the stock resumes on March 16, any shareholder holding more than 100 shares will be able to sell only 25 percent of his/her shares, while the rest will be under lock-in.

“It is not a bad deal or negative for shareholders considering the fact that government has written off perpetual bonds. In the deal equity holders are not losing everything, instead, there is a lock-in,” AK Prabhakar, Head of Research at IDBI Capital told Moneycontrol.

“Shareholders can still liquidate 25 percent of their holding. But, remember the rescue plan was put in place by the government to rescue the depositors. Ideally, equity shareholders share should have become zero and then new equity should have come, but here the government has given some value to them which is still okay,” he said.

Last week, the proposal, which is a draft, stated that although all of Yes Bank's liabilities would continue as before, the additional tier 1 (AT1) capital bonds that the bank had issued, shall be written down permanently. This announcement has caught the Rs 28 trillion Indian mutual funds (MF) industry by surprise.

Prabhakar further added that it is a good deal and after three years if the bank sustains, shareholders will get a better value.

But, depositors come first

While the primary aim of the final reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank notified by the Centre, which locks-in 75 percent of all shareholding for three years, is a move in the right direction, it may not go down well with most of the shareholders.

In any rescue plan, the interest of depositors comes first. Hence, the regulator and the government is playing by the book and in case of equity shareholders, they have been slightly more generous which shareholders should take with both hands.

“The regulator and govt. has been extremely fair in demanding the same sacrifice of existing minority shareholders as being asked for SBI and other institutional shareholders who have answered the clarion call of the nation and come to the rescue of Yes Bank as an institution – the primary aim is to provide a safety net to existing depositors,” Ajay Bodke, CEO-PMS at Prabhudas Lilladher told Moneycontrol.

“Equity capital is a ‘risk’ capital, and in terms of financial claims, the safest are depositors, followed by Tier II capital, the Tier I capital, followed by preference shares and then comes common equity. Hence, in any rescue plan, it is equity capital is at most risk,” he added.

Bodke further explained that when the enterprise does well, the upside is shared by equity holders and not be debt holders. “Also, in the rescue plan Tier I bondholders have been asked to accept the full write down which is in line with Basel 3 norms, and if Quasi Equity can be written down to zero why should equity holders also not be on the same footing, but the regulator has been generous. Hence, I see no reason for shareholders to complain,” Bodke said.

Reduce volatility

Yes Bank's shares have rallied more than 300 percent after hitting a low of Rs 5.55 on March 6. The cash-strapped lender received a Rs 3,700 crore booster shot from five financial institutions along with SBI. The move is likely to calm the frayed nerves of investors and depositors.

The rescues plan is in the right direction to curb volatility in the stock, suggest experts. “The decision of three-year lock-in may disappoint retail investors especially the one who has invested looking at the momentum, but the intent of the government is to reduce the volatility,” Sanjeev Jain, VP Equity Research, Sunness Capital India told Moneycontrol. “Not to forget that volatility and business operations are different,” he added.

The Union Cabinet on March 13 approved the Yes Bank Reconstruction Scheme 2020, with a higher authorised capital of Rs 6,200 crore as against Rs 5,000 crore as per RBI Draft Reconstruction Scheme 2020.

As per the contours of the scheme, ICICI Bank (Rs 1,000 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 600 crore), Kotak Mahindra Bank (Rs 500 crore), Bandhan Bank (Rs 300 crore), Federal Bank (Rs 300 crore) and HDFC (Rs 1,000 crore) will infuse Rs 3,700 crore as equity into the crisis-hit Yes Bank. State Bank of India will invest Rs 7,250 crore for up to 26 percent stake with a lock-in of three years as against the earlier envisaged 49 percent stake.

It also announced the lifting of the moratorium by 6 pm on March 18 (from April 3 earlier), the third working day after the reconstruction scheme comes into force.

So, has the private sector lender turned a corner and more importantly has become an investment play? Market experts don't think so. They cited asset quality concerns, which could play spoilsport in the future. At best, they see it as a good trading play.

“The current moratorium on deposit withdrawal and capital infusion are just the first steps toward the revival of Yes Bank,"" Emkay Global said in a recent report, maintaining its sell call on the private sector lender. The brokerage sees many more such steps for a 'sustainable long term revival' of the bank to 'survive and thrive independently'.

Ajit Mishra, V-P Research, Religare Broking, too echoed the concern raised by Emkay. Mishra went a step further and advises investors to 'avoid' investing, especially when there are 'a list of quality banking names available at a good bargain'.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Chairman Deepak Parekh termed panic in the market over Yes Bank as ‘unnecessary and an overreaction’.

“The public is reacting as if this is the end of the world. It is a temporary overreaction, which is unnecessary. Panic in the market to the moratorium is completely an overreaction,” Parekh told CNBC-TV18.

He said the problem is bank-specific and not sectoral.

Stating that our financial system is strong, he said, “One company going under or having temporary problems due to lack of capital cannot destroy the system.”

He added that RBI has taken a timely call and that the central bank has the right to 'do whatever it needs to protect depositors'. “RBI has taken a timely call with this move. If they (RBI) had waited till March 14, there would have been a run on the bank. The bank (Yes Bank) needs capital and needs it as soon as possible. There could be a rights issue where some of us may be asked to participate,” he noted.

Allaying concerns as to why the process is taking so long, Parekh said, ""If SBI needs to put in equity in Yes Bank, they need a few days for approvals. If SBI invites other investors, I am sure other banks will join in to protect the financial system. All plans are still being worked out ""

Explaining the rationale of State Bank of India (SBI) participation, Parekh said: “Large number of foreign funds have discussed various options with RBI. Most of these investors are prominent international players that do not have any investment in India. RBI may have needed comfort of an institution like SBI.”

When asked if he was aware of any private player participating in the Yes Bank investment process, he said, “Initially it is SBI's call, if they need anyone to participate they will ask.”

The veteran banker felt panicking depositors had no reason to worry. “I am convinced that Yes Bank depositors will get all their money bank.""

He also allayed depositors' fears with regards to the security of their deposits in case of a merger, saying: ""The government wants to run Yes Bank as an independent entity. It is better to run Yes Bank independently and revive it.""

However, he felt that the bank's depositors should have conducted proper due diligence while investing their money. ""IL&FS was not an accident, but a disaster waiting to happen. Even Yes Bank was a disaster waiting to happen. It was known that the bank's loans would not come back. Yes Bank could have turned around themselves, but now a drastic steps had to be taken by RBI. People should take precaution investing in such companies,"" he said."

HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri denied speculation of differences with HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh over the bank's next leader.

The search for Puri’s successor has been kickstarted ahead of his retirement in October. Puri, who was hired by Parekh, has been its MD since 1994.

“In all fairness, Deepak and I have no differences,” Aditya Puri told The Economic Times.

“We all want the best person in the organisation. He hasn’t even discussed the subject with me… I don’t know for how many months. HDFC has a nominee in the search committee. He is a large shareholder. He also wants what is best for the organisation. There is no difference between the board and anybody. We are all looking at the best interests of the bank.”

The search committee has been told there are strong internal candidates, but they can look for talented external candidates as well, Puri said, adding that there is some merit to the practice of giving preference to insiders.

“Obviously, we know whoever is within the organisation. If a lot of them have created a $100 billion franchise they must be competent. The board also acknowledges that we have very strong internal candidates. But there were some people who felt that we should also look at external candidates, so that we won’t miss out on anyone,’’ Puri said.

He said that while he does not have a veto on his successor’s appointment, the board would consider his recommendations.

Refuting rumours of an overlap between HDFC Bank and its non-banking financial company (NBFC) HDB financial, Puri said they were untrue. He added that he and his successor will together decide whether he will continue his position as HDB Financial chairman."

State Bank of India (SBI) has cut the interest rates on its fixed deposits with effect from February 10.

The country’s largest private lender has lowered the rate by 10-50 basis point in the retail segment (for deposits below Rs 2 crore) and 25-50 basis points in the bulk segment (deposits of Rs 2 crore and above).

SBI’s revised rates comes after the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on February 6 decided to retain the repo rate at 5.15 percent.

But how do SBI’s revised FD rates compare with some other major state-run and private sector banks?

Bank of Baroda (BoB), a public sector bank (PSB), offers slightly lower interest rates on deposits below Rs 2 crore. BoB's rate is 6 percent for most maturity periods of 1 year and above, while SBI's is 6.10 percent.

For term deposits of Rs 2-10 crore, BoB has set an interest rate of 5.10 percent on maturity of 1-10 years. For similar maturity periods, SBI's rate is 5.25 percent for all deposits above Rs 2 crore.

Major private lenders HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank seem to have rates that are slightly higher than that of SBI, atleast in the retail segment for deposits below Rs 2 crore.

ICICI Bank offers an interest rate of 6.20-6.40 percent, with premature withdrawing facility, for deposits below Rs 2 crore, and 6.10-6.30 percent without the premature withdrawal facility. Both rates are applicable for deposits with maturity of one year and above.

On term deposits below Rs 5 crore, HDFC Bank offers a rate of 6.30 percent on most maturity periods of 1 year and above."

Mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) on February 1, said that markets are disappointed with the union budget 2020 as there are no specific incentives for manufacturing or for the real estate sector.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Deepak Parekh, Chairman, said, ""The budget has some very positive aspects as the disposable income in the hands of the middle-class people and people earning lower salaries will increase and so consumption has to increase.""

Other than extending the exemption limit for higher deduction for one more year, the budget has given tax-free for the developers for one more year for affordable housing, Parekh said.

""I think the NBFCs are going through the toughest time I have seen in 40 years. The marginal benefit they have given is the partial guarantee to certain NBFCs and refinance by NABARD for some of the agricultural finance that NBFCs give,"" he added.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman and CEO, HDFC, one of the most definitive voices from India's financial sector, shared his views and expectations from the Budget 2020.

“To my mind there should be four broad themes of the Budget. The first should revolve around job creation. Housing is one of the biggest job creators in the economy, so we will talk about housing in a bit. The second area for the focus should be on capital market reforms. Third area of the focus should be on re-alignment of personal tax rates - particularly to my mind, the withdrawal of the high surcharge, which was introduced last year on high tax payers because that is slowing down consumption, and the forth focus area should be the rural economy. These are the four broad focus areas,” he said.

With regards to real estate sector, he said, “The sector faces two issues. The first is stuck projects. There are so many projects spread all over the country, particularly in the big cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, which are 75-80 percent completed, and not getting the last mile funding that is required to complete the project. We have to find a mechanism to ensure that these projects get the required funding so that these projects get completed and all the home buyers who bought apartments in these projects get a house to stay in. The second issue is with regards to oversupply in the market and therefore how do we revive demand.”

Sharing his views on one-time restructuring for real estate projects, Mistry said, “Today under the regulations, if a loan is a non-performing loan (NPL) in someone's books, then any fresh lender coming and providing funds to that project notwithstanding to the fact that new money could be completely safeguarded, completely ringfenced, properly secured and so and so forth - notwithstanding all of that - the new lender has to classify the loan as a non performing loan from day one. In which case, nobody would want to lend money to a project.""

Therefore when a project is stuck, it is stuck forever. There are no lenders and there is nobody who will buy the apartment. We have to find a solution to this because there are hundreds of thousands of home buyers who have bought apartments in these projects, he added.

""My solution to this would be very simple - we should permit a one-time restructuring of such loans. So, if there is a one-time restructuring of such loans, let us say 3-6 months, then new lenders can provide funding to that project with proper safeguards, and security and ensure that it gets completed, and the homebuyers gets the house which they have paid for. This was done in 2008-2009 very successfully and the whole real-estate sector revived as a result of that,” said Mistry.

Further focusing on housing, he said, “To improve demand, I would suggest 3 or 4 things. One, the interest that is payable on a housing loan currently is tax deductible at the extent of Rs 2 lakh. We probably need to increase that limit to Rs 4 lakh or Rs 5 lakh, and then link it to inflation. So, every year it keeps getting adjusted depending on what the inflation for the previous year was.""

""Two, the quantum of revenue that the government must be collecting on LTCG for real estate must be extremely limited after you consider the various deductions that are available, but it results in a lot of administrative work from the perspective of someone who is planning to sell a house. So, I would suggest doing away with long term capital gains on sale of residential houses provided that the person has occupied that house for a minimum period of time. Let’s say 5 years - if you occupy the house for 5 years, you should not be required to pay any capital gains at the time of selling the property,"" he said.

""Three, is with regards to rented property. Today, there is no demand for rented property. Nobody wants to buy a property with the idea of renting it out because of the tax disadvantages. What happens is that in a rented property, the entire rent which is received is taxable. But the expense that you incur for earning the rent, which is really the interest that is paid, is not tax deductible and therefore the landlord ends up paying a large burden of tax. So, my suggestion is that the entire interest payable on a rented property should be tax deductible,” he further mentioned.

When asked if the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) limit of Rs 25,000 crore for the last mile funding needs to be expanded, he replied, “Let me compliment the government. I think it was a fantastic initiative on the part of the government to set up this fund. So full compliments to the government. However, at the end of the day, what we must realize is that there are thousands of stuck projects all over the country and one fund, so how quickly it will able to dispense money to these thousands of projects after doing due diligence is something that we will have to wait and see.""

""So, along with the fund, we should also have one-time restructuring of real estate loans, which will enable lenders like banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), housing finance companies (HFCs) with proper safeguards to lend money to these projects. I think the amount is sufficient. I don't think we need to worry about the size of fund. That is more than adequate,” he stated.

Speaking about the additional liquidity window for HFCs and NBFCs, he said, “There are two issues around this, when IL&FS happened in September - the first issue was the availability of funds, and the second was willingness on the part of banks to lend money to NBFCs or HFCs. The first part has been fully addressed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), so full compliments to RBI for addressing the issue of liquidity. There is more than adequate or enough liquidity in the system and I don't think that is a cause for concern at all.""

""Second issue is with regards to the willingness on part of banks to lend money to NBFCs, that risk averseness has not gone away. The good, strong NBFCs and HFCs get money with relative ease, but the weaker and not so strong ones are finding it difficult to raise money. This issue needs to get addressed. It can be addressed if RBI sits with the bankers and tells them that we strengthened the regulatory environment, you should now feel more confident to go and lend money to these NBFCs of HFCs, "" he said, adding that the other way to do it would be to set up a separate entity, which buys over these toxic assets of some of these NBFCs or HFCs, leaving behind assets, which are of better quality. If that is done, then the banks will again have the confidence to go and provide funds to the NBFC or the HFCs.

With regards to AUM, he said growth in the individual loans was 16 percent and on a net basis, it was 14 percent. Non-performing loans (NPLs) were marginally up at 1.36 percent in the December quarter as compared to 1.33 percent in September, so it was a 3 basis points (bps) increase, he stated.

However, NIMs and spreads remained the same. ""NIMs in Q2 were 3.3 percent and in Q3 as well stood at 3.3 percent. Spreads at the end of Q2 were 2.26 percent and at the end of Q3 were 2.27 percent,” said Mistry.

The only other significant feature of the loan was that the transition of Gruh into Bandhan Bank happened during the course of this quarter because the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approval happened now, and therefore, under the accounting rules, we had to mark-to-market (MTM) the Bandhan shares based on the share price, he said, adding that they cannot reflect it at cost price, the way we were reflecting the Gruh price. ""So, there is a MTM gain that gets recognised over here but on that MTM gain, we have created the deferred tax liability - in future, if we have to sell it, we have to pay tax, there is a deferred tax liability that is being created,” he further stated.

Throwing further light on loan growth, he said, “Individual loans in the affordable housing segment continue to remain good. Our focus on affordable housing loans continues unabated. If you look at the breakdown of the lending we have done in this quarter, and the nine-month periods, it is almost the same.""

""The loans given to customers, who are in the economically weaker section (EWS) or the lower income group (LIG) would constitute in number terms 36 percent, in value terms 18 percent. For that segment of the market, the demand is fairly strong and robust. The problem is in the high-end market. Demand for high value loans, higher ticket items is slowing down.”

Ahead of the presentation of the Union Budget 2020-21, largest pure play home financier HDFC on Tuesday pitched for a one-time loan recast for realty projects. Its Chairman Deepak Parekh said lenders are not able to write new loans for projects because a new borrowing by an entity which is already a non performing asset, becomes an NPA on day one.

The comments come amid difficult times faced by the realty sector, which has forced the government to announce a Rs 25,000 crore fund to push stuck projects.

It can be noted that the RBI has discontinued the practice of loan recast for the last few years, but has created an exception for small businesses after Governor Shaktikanta Das took over.

""We have requested the NHB (National Housing Bank, sector regulator) and others to take a relook at the provisioning and the NPA issue on projects that are stuck and need the last mile funding,” Parekh told reporters.

“We are talking to the regulators, we have spoken to the finance ministry, one time restructuring is absolutely necessary,” he added.

Parekh said there have been precedents of similar one-time reliefs being allowed by the RBI in the past including in 1993 and also after the global financial crisis.

He said there are a host of reasons beyond financial stress of the promoter alone which lead to NPAs in the case of realty projects, including lack of environmental, tree authority or NGT approvals, which stop a project from taking off.

When asked if he has heard from either the regulator or the finance ministry, Parekh replied in the negative.

He welcomed the Rs 25,000 crore as a good beginning and added that the fund has already approved four proposals but did not share any details of the same.

HDFC has invested Rs 250 crore in the first Rs 12,500 crore fund anchored by SBI Caps and have a representative on the managing board, he said.

Parekh said the remainder fund of Rs 12,500 crore may be anchored by NIIF or some other fund.

Meanwhile, when asked when he sees a revival in the realty market, Parekh asked investors to “forget” about their bets for the next five years on the residential side, hinting that a recovery is unlikely soon.

Parekh said while it is a good time to buy houses for staying, residential property investments may at best yield one or two per cent return if rented out and also said it is better not to rent those out.

He, however, said the commercial market is booming.

The largest mortgage lender will install a dedicated team understanding the startup ecosystem to do the investments, he said.

The announcement comes at a time when there is a lot of focus on the policy front to encourage startups with an objective of encouraging innovation and creating employment opportunities.

Many corporate entities and also the largest lender SBI have been creating in-house funds to invest in startups.

""At the last board meet, I took an idea of investing Rs 100 crore per year in startups,"" Parekh said, speaking at the annual Tiecon event here.

He said just like the idea to branch out into universal banking, the board had reluctance with the idea of investing in startups as well, but underlined that he believes there is a need to invest in ideas of the future in the tech space.

The company will be creating a an in-house team at the headquarters to take charge of investments and exuded confidence that they will start operating in two months.

Parekh urged the youngsters not to get ""consumed"" by the ongoing economic slowdown and exuded confidence that the tide will change soon.

""Do not be disillusioned with the current difficulties. The tide will and has to change,"" he told the younger entrepreneurs, stressing that India will be an important engine for the world.

Recounting his days while starting up HDFC Bank, which has become the largest by market valuations now, Parekh said he pushed the board to get into mainstream banking because of the need to diversify beyond its forte of mortgage finance.

The veteran industry player, who has set up many an entity in the over four decades, said honesty, integrity and accountability are the key attributes that create a successful institution.

He said it is never too late to start, mentioning that HDFC itself was started as a retirement venture by H T Parekh when he was 65 years old.

The new institution went through a string on difficulties from its earliest days, including an initial public offering which bombed, difficulties in arranging loans from LIC for which lawyers had to called-in from Washington for convincing and challenges in getting UTI Mutual Fund, the only domestic asset manager, to invest, Parekh said.

He said despite faced with challenges like absence of security enforcement for defaults, HDFC adopted a unique model open for business and recalled that Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy's first house in the financial capital was bought on a Rs 70,000 loan from his company, granted only on the basis of an appointment letter."

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is expected to report on January 27 around 300 percent year-on-year growth in Q3FY20 profit on the back of de-recognition of investment in GRUH Finance that merged with Bandhan Bank.

The company earlier this month in its BSE filing had said it recorded a fair value gain of Rs 9,020 crore through the statement of profit and loss after derecognition of investment in GRUH Finance. Its shareholding in Bandhan Bank will be classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, it added.

Besides the above, there was no profit on sale of investments in subsidiary or associate companies of the Corporation during the quarter ended December 2019, HDFC had said.

""The company will entail a gain of Rs 9,020 crore on the derecognition of investment of GRUH, of which, as a matter of policy (also seen earlier), the company will make one-third provisions on this windfall gains (thus provisions will be higher by Rs 3,000 crore),"" said Edelweiss which expects profit to grow 298.2 percent YoY and 112.5 percent QoQ.

Net interest income during the quarter is likely to grow in the range of 6-12 percent YoY with strong retail loan growth and moderation in corporate book. Asset under management (AUM) is seen in double digit YoY for the quarter.

Suraksha Asset Reconstruction Ltd (Suraksha ARC) has taken over about Rs 170 crore loan extended by HDFC to realty firm Ansal Housing. Ansal Housing informed in a regulatory filing about assignment of financial assistance by HDFC Ltd in favour of Suraksha ARC with effect from December 31, 2019.

The loan amount was not disclosed in the filing, but sources said that Suraksha ARC has taken over about Rs 170 crore loan book from HDFC Ltd.

Suraksha group had also bid for acquiring Jaypee Infratech but could not succeed. The group is investing in revival of various housing projects across major cities.

In a letter to the realty firm, Suraksha ARC said that HDFC Ltd has assigned in its favour, all the rights, title and interests in financial assistance granted by it to Ansal Housing Ltd.

Now, Suraksha ARC has become the secured lender and all the rights, title and interests of HDFC, with respect to the financial assistance assigned to the borrower, have vested in Suraksha ARC.

""Suraksha ARC has become entitled to recover from Ansal Housing the total dues of HDFC Ltd as on December 31, 2019 along with interest at contractual rates, further interest and other charges from the said date till elate of realization,"" Suraksha ARC said in a letter to the realty firm.

HDFC Chief Executive Keki Mistry, however, added that the realty sector's revival hinges a lot on banks, which are reluctant to lend to stalled projects due to regulatory issues.

As part of its measures to boost growth, the government had in November last year announced a Rs 25,000 crore package for the real estate sector, including a corpus to help stalled projects.

SBI Caps, which is managing the fund, had last month announced the first close of the fund with Rs 10,530 crore commitments from investors, including HDFC.

""We are participating in the fund (with a contribution of) Rs 250 crore,"" Mistry told reporters on the sidelines of an event by industry lobby CII here.

Mistry said apart from the fund, support in the form of bank lending is essential for reviving the sector's prospects and flagged his concerns on reluctance among bankers to lend.

""The problem is that no one wants to do it because when you lend to a project which is NPA in someone's books, you have to straight away classify (it) as NPA from day one, in which case there is a lot of reluctance on the part of banks to participate,"" he explained.

Mistry said HDFC has been going slow on project loans for the last four to five quarters because of the overall conditions, but it is focusing on the individual loans segment with the same vigour as before.

He said the real estate sector is very important for the economy because it helps creates jobs both directly and indirectly.

Shares of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) gained nearly a percent intraday on January 1 after Sharekhan maintained its bullish view on the stock and sees 16 percent potential upside from current levels by end of 2020.

""HDFC is currently available at around 4.2x its FY22E BV, which we believe is reasonable considering its robust operating metrics, pedigree, strong brand recall across product categories and sustainable business model,"" said the brokerage.

Even as the NBFC industry faces its own challenges, the consistency and relative outperformance of HDFC will help it to sustain growth as well as its valuations, it added.

Sharekhan said balance sheet strength (low NPLs and high provision buffer), consistency and quality of earnings continued to be the key differentiators for HDFC.

The housing finance company (HFC) is well capitalised (Tier 1 at 18.1 percent), helped by capital infusions as well as subsidiary monetisation and internal accruals – which are strong long term growth engines, it added.

While over the past few quarters, HDFC has maintained a cautious stance on the wholesale segment's growth, the brokerage believes provision buffers and buoyant subsidiary valuations are supportive of valuations.

It further believes improvement in growth rates and return in equity (ROEs) (led by sustained growth in retail lending and relatively strong developer loan book of HDFC) augur well.

Sharekhan expects AUM growth to remain healthy (on market share gains) with spreads maintained and well-contained credit costs.

Hence, the brokerage maintained its buy rating on the stock with a revised price target of Rs 2,800 per share.

Global brokerage Citi also maintained buy call on the stock and increased its target price to Rs 2,960 (from Rs 2,750 earlier), implying 22.6 percent potential upside.

""We value HDFC at 3.3x Mar-21E P/adjusted BVPS and increased target price for HDFC AMC and other subsidiary,"" the research house said, adding core mortgage business will continue to do well.

The stock gained more than 22 percent in last three months. It was quoting at Rs 2,422, up Rs 8.55, or 0.35 percent on the BSE at 1135 hours IST.

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on December 4 refused immediate relief to banks and Bajaj Finance in the Karvy Stock Broking case.

ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank had moved SAT saying that many of these securities had been used to borrow money from them and had pleaded with the tribunal to either get the securities back to them or put them in an escrow account to protect their funds.

The securities held by over 83,000 clients were given back to them on December 2 after SEBI asked NSDL to do so, forcing Bajaj Finance to move SAT and secure an interim relief on further transfers.

Banks argued that pledged shares cannot be transferred without the consent of banks. However, SAT directed SEBI to hear plea of banks on December 6 and pass an order by December 12.

SAT had earlier directed SEBI to hear Bajaj Finance's plea and pass an order by December 10. Bajaj Finance is the second-highest lender to Karvy on shares. SAT has already directed NSDL to not transfer further shares from Karvy account to clients.

""Bajaj Finance had given loan of worth of Rs 100 crores after 20th June circular of segeration of client and Properitory account. And this circular clearly says that financial institutions can't give loan on client pledge shares categorically. SAT does not have power of invocation which has high courts,"" a source told Moneycontrol.

The lawyer representing banks argued that if court does not freeze securities, then it would be difficult to recover money. He even said the money can be put in an escrow account but SAT has now put the ball in SEBI's court.

""SEBI may not give favourable order to banks and Bajaj Finance. Banks and Bajaj Finance did not do proper due-diligence before giving loans against shares to Karvy even after the June 20 circular. The parliamentary mandate to SEBI is to protect interests of investors,"" a source told Moneycontrol."

The Nifty and BSE-500 indices were up 11 percent in the past three months, a performance slightly better than that of other emerging markets (EMs).

The upmove may be linked to ebullient conditions globally, but India also has had its share of market-moving news, including the corporate tax cuts that drove the bulk of the upside.

“The 2QFY20 results were largely better than expectations, but the bar will move higher now with BBG consensus estimates calling for Nifty EPS growth of 11 percent in FY20 (for EPS positive cos) and 19 percent in FY21,” says the report released on November 25.

The results were aided by lower tax rates which consensus forecasts may not have adequately captured, generally helpful raw material prices, and improving bank asset quality, especially for PSBs.

BNP Paribas remains overweight on India and has placed a target of 40,500 for the Sensex by December 2019, suggesting a potential downside from the current levels.

About 17-18 Nifty stocks are trading at a premium to their historical 5-year averages on a one-year forward P/B and P/E, compared to 10-14 stocks about two months ago. But, the risk-on mode in global markets will keep Indian markets ticking.

“The biggest positive seems to be that even though global growth is slowing, accommodative central banks have kept the markets in a risk-on mode. We expect the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) to cut rates by a further 75bp through June 2020,” says the note.

BNP Paribas also expects another 10bp cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) before the year ends and continued QE, and easing by most Asian central banks, including Reserve Bank of India by another 25bp.

Model portfolio

BNP Paribas model continues to favour private banks and insurance and recommends selective changes in both the lists.

The global investment bank includes some more high-quality consumer-focussed names and dividend-paying PSUs. The prominent largecap additions are HDFC, NTPC, UltraTech Cements, Sun Pharma and Kotak Mahindra Bank, while the midcap ones are P&G, Bharat Electronics, IGL, and InterGlobe Aviation.

The smallcap list remains unchanged. For the long term, BNP believes that it is important to back companies with proven competitive advantages and quality of earnings."

India's largest housing finance company, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), is a key beneficiary of the structural consolidation underway in the housing and real estate finance segments, says Morgan Stanley which has an overweight rating on the stock, citing attractive valuations.

The global brokerage house believes the return on equity (ROE) and the earnings per share (EPS) growth at HDFC is poised to stage a multi-year recovery, supported by structurally stronger positioning among non-bank lenders.

The stock rallied 11 percent in the last one month and 23 percent in one year while in, the last 10 years, it gave a 332 percent return.

While having a bullish stance, the brokerage raised its price target on the stock to Rs 2,900 from Rs 2,600 earlier, implying 24 percent potential upside from current levels.

""Events over the past year or so have polarized funding availability and funding costs within the NBFC/HFC group. Entities with strong parentage and business vintage – like HDFC – have benefited from the market's trust. We believe these changes are likely structural, which implies that funding availability for the likes of HDFC has structurally increased,"" said Morgan Stanley.

While many NBFCs/HFCs grew aggressively in home loans and wholesale real estate loans over the past five years, HDFC stayed conservative.

The brokerage said fixed income markets had been cutting exposure to these lenders due to concerns about the quality of their wholesale real estate books. It thinks many of these players will exit wholesale lending and will also struggle for growth in home loans given lack of funding and thin profitability of that product.

Thus, HDFC's growth runway can improve structurally, it said, adding that ROE should also benefit, given better risk-adjusted pricing and lower cost of funds.

The brokerage believes HDFC will step up growth in wholesale real estate loans (higher-yielding), given its significantly-improved industry positioning owing to the lack of credit supply to this segment.

""Pricing power and underwriting terms should be in its favour. Further, HDFC's funding costs continue to fall because it is the preferred vehicle for fixed income investors; we see more scope for this. This should only enhance HDFC's ability to pick and choose loans,"" it said.

Morgan Stanley expects the loan growth at HDFC to pick up over the next 12 months as competition from other NBFCs/HFCs continues to ease and terms for stronger lenders improve further.

It sees FY20-25 EPS CAGR of 22 percent for its core lending business and expects core ROE to improve from around 13 percent in F20 to around 15.5 percent in FY22 and to around 18.5 percent in FY25, driven both by higher underlying profitability and a pickup in leverage as HDFC's excess capital gets deployed.

In the bull case, the global brokerage house expects the stock to go up to Rs 4,155 per share, giving a return of 78 percent over current levels if there is a strong progress on resolutions in stressed real estate assets and pick-up in demand for housing.

""Fast track real estate resolutions and pick up in housing demand can create senior high yield financing and plain vanilla financing opportunities for stronger lenders like HDFC. We value stakes in subsidiaries and associates at Rs 2,355 per share and apply no holding company discount,"" it explained.

Last week, JM Financial also said HDFC was a compelling buy opportunity given a) superior liability franchise with the largest deposit base within the NBFC space, b) best placed to benefit from lower rates and normalization of credit spreads going ahead (c.130bps credit spreads on the three-year paper versus 90bps two years ago), c) poised to maintain retail home loan market share while selectively increase market share in corporate segment especially developer finance as 35 percent of the overall market (including banks) is either defocusing/recalibrating their strategy/reeling under capital constraints, d) ability to maintain spreads over the years despite increase in the share of low yielding individual loans by 400bps over the last two years to a record high of 76 percent and e) best in class asset quality in a challenging environment with possible monetisation of investments providing adequate cushion against asset quality shocks (for eg. Bandhan Bank stake is valued at Rs 8,400 crore which is 2.2x NS3 assets as of Sep’19).

With the subsidiaries coming of age, the brokerage believes the solid core HFC story of HDFC has got lost in translation. Currently, the core HFC is trading at its historical low valuation of 1.35x one-year fwd PBV.

""We expect asset under management CAGR of 13 percent over FY19-21E with earnings CAGR of 17 percent. HDFC is our top pick in the HFC space and a compelling buy with a target of Rs 2,700,"" it said.

Shares of Housing Development & Finance Corporation (HDFC) gained over a percent in the morning trade on November 27 after Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight call and raised its target price to Rs 2,900 from Rs 2,600 per share.

The research firm is of the view that return on equity (RoE) and EPS growth is poised to stage a multi-year recovery, supported by structurally stronger positioning among non-bank lenders. It has forecasted FY20-25 EPS CAGR of 22 percent for HDFC's core lending business and expects core RoE to improve to 15.5 percent in FY22 and 18.5 percent in FY25 from 13 percent in FY20.

HDFC's valuation looks attractive while a pick-up in loan growth over the next 12 months can be seen, Morgan Stanley said.

At 10:30 hours, the counter was quoting at Rs 2,331.10, up Rs 27.25, or 1.25 percent on the BSE. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 2,352.80 and an intraday low of Rs 2,313.20.

The Sensex hit a record high of 41,120.28, while the Nifty50 climbed to 12,132.45 before witnessing profit-taking towards the close of the session.

Experts say the Nifty rally could extend towards 12,300-12,400 in the near-term. The euphoria is likely to continue in the short-term on the back of strong global cues, buying by foreign investors, reforms by the government, expectations of a revival in earnings growth and consistent money coming into markets via mutual funds.

In hitting fresh highs, Indian markets are following other developed markets and emerging markets like Brazil, Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities told Moneycontrol.

“We at HDFC Securities had forecasted a Nifty target of 12,400 in December 2018 and now we are almost there. FIIs have largely been bullish on the Indian market in November, investing around Rs 18,200 crore till 25th,” Relli said.

“Most of the drivers of the current slowdown appear to be temporary and related to channel financing/GST credit issues. Companies that are able to gain market share from their competitors have been less impacted by the slowdown.”

Relli expects earnings to recover faster with FY20 and FY21 earnings growth being driven by lower corporate tax rates and lower loan-loss provisions. “We remain positive on BFSI, consumer stocks, PSU and Digital/internet stocks. Greater visibility of resumption of corporate earnings growth is necessary for the Nifty to move beyond 12,400,” Relli said.

The government has taken several measures to revive growth and more are expected, and dips, if any, should be used to accumulate quality stocks.

“The Nifty finally managed to touch new high today on the back of strong global cues, FII buying and improvement in market sentiments post a slew of government reforms,” Siddhartha Khemka, Head – Retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Private Ltd, told Moneycontrol.

“While Nifty50 valuation at 22x FY20 is not cheap, we believe that the current momentum can sustain in the near term on the back of liquidity flows and positive sentiments.”

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased the cash withdrawal limits to Rs 50,000 for customers of Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank this week and ordered reopening of its ATMs after a gap of two months.

While the move would allow 78 percent of the bank's depositors to withdraw their entire balance, it is still a long way to go for other customers whose retirement savings or business accounts are locked up in the bank.

Here are some of the key developments from the banking sector, from the last week:

PMC Bank: RBI increases deposit withdrawal limit to Rs 50,000, reopens ATMs

RBI has increased deposit withdrawal limit for Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank customers to Rs 50,000 from November 5. This includes the limit of Rs 40,000 that was relaxed earlier. The move will allow 78 percent of the bank's depositors to withdraw their entire account balance.

The Reserve Bank has also decided to allow depositors to withdraw cash from the bank's own ATMs within the relaxed limit of Rs 50,000.

Lenders count on government's realty fund for NPA relief

The Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), to be set up by the government to revive the housing sector, will come as a major relief to lenders that are looking to shed off bad loans stuck in stalled projects.

Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), said that some developers have been facing troubles only due to a slowdown in sales and had to be declared as NPAs.

Tepid demand forces ICICI Bank to shutter project finance division

Private lender ICICI Bank disbanded its project finance division in September, owing to lack of fresh demand for loans in the infrastructure sector, according to an official.

While the bank is still open to lending opportunities in the sector, it has reallocated the specialised staff to its larger wholesale banking vertical that caters to clients across sectors.

Bank of Baroda expects slippages to ease by March 2020

After reporting an uptick in slippages in the second quarter of current financial year, Bank of Baroda, India's second largest lender, expects asset quality to improve by the March-end.

The state-owned lender expects net non-performing assets (NPAs) to ease below 3.5 percent by March 2020 and slippages to be lower than levels witnessed in the second quarter."

ICICI Direct's research report on HDFC

Given the unfavourable lending environment, advances growth continues to remain slower at 12% YoY to Rs 426739 crore, led by moderation in individual as well as corporate book. Though the individual loan portfolio increased ~15% YoY to Rs 307231 crore and accounted for ~72% of the total loan book, growth in corporate book was curtailed during the quarter at 2.9% YoY to Rs 112194 crore (26.3% of book). Growth in individual loan book, after adding back loans sold in the preceding 12 months remained healthy at 24% YoY.



Outlook

Accordingly, we maintain HOLD rating with a revised target price of Rs 2200 (earlier Rs 2050), valuing core HFCs at ~2x FY21E ABV & Rs 1390 for subsidiary post 15% holding company discount.

We expect allocations to move to non-HRITIK stocks in largecaps and into midcaps (having a market cap above Rs 8,000 cr), Vinay Pandit, Head, Institutional Equities, IndiaNivesh, said in an interview to Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q) It was a historic week for Indian equity markets with gains of nearly 3% for the week ended November 1. What is your view of markets in the coming week? Will the Nifty hit a fresh high or have we topped out?

A) This is in line with our view, where we said that the Nifty will hit new highs around Diwali. Largecap earnings growth has gone up by 15-18 percent, which augurs well for the broader markets and the index earnings.

Two major factors are contributing to this. First, the lower tax rate has averaged out the higher tax provisioning of Q1 over the lower tax for Q2, thereby cutting the tax provisioning for Q2 to 15-18 percent.

Second, the low base effect over the last year’s Q2 is being seen now, especially in auto volumes. We don’t believe that the Nifty has topped out, though multiples may have topped out for certain frontline stocks.

We expect allocations to move to other non-HRITIK stocks (HDFC, RIL, Infosys, TCS, HUL , IndusInd, and Kotak Mahindra Bank) in largecaps and into midcaps (having a market cap above Rs 8,000 cr).

HDFC Life and SBI Life were seen diluting equity and are now in the race to enter the Nifty (free float methodology) potentially replacing Yes Bank/Bharti Infratel.

Q) What is your view of the auto sales numbers for the month of October? Do you think things have bottomed out and can the auto sector be a dark horse in 2020?

A) Auto sales numbers have been encouraging. However, Maruti Suzuki India is still a long way from getting the premium 30x multiples, which it commanded in the past. To get there, it will have to start doing sales volume numbers of 160-170K per month.

However, this will still yield lifetime low margins and ROEs, thereby offering profit-booking opportunity every time it crosses Rs 7,500-7,700. As a house, we have a ‘sell’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 5,700 based on 23x FY21E earnings.

TVS Motor numbers were disappointing on the two-wheeler side. We expect Hero Motors and Bajaj Auto to throw up positive surprises, led by festival season sales, rural demand and strong support to the channel, coupled with a focus on liquidating BS-IV inventory.

Eicher Motors may do well on liquidation of inventory in the system for the quarter. However, competition from Jawa and cannibalising its products portfolio between 500CC & 650 CC, as well as between Classic 350 and Bullet 350, could hamper expectations of incremental volumes.

Exports could throw up major surprises in the coming months as displayed in October data. We expect the pain in CVs (commercial vehicles) to continue for some more time before economic activity picks up significantly while being attractively valued.

The sector witnessed a bottoming out in Jul-Aug’19, and we may see positive spurts on performance for select companies such as Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motors.

Q) The last 11 years data suggest that November usually belongs to the bears. The Sensex closed in the red in November in seven of the 11 years. Do you think 2019 will be different?

A) While such data points will always pop up, we believe broader market trends need to be studied. November in the last 11 years has been positive four out of 11 years. At the same time, September, October, and December have been positive 50% of the time. September 2019 was up 6.3% vs September 2018 (-5.6%). October 2019 was up 4.6% vs October 2018 (-5.6%).

November has started on a positive note and can be expected to close on a positive note just like November 2018, led by good festive sales, lower tax rate giving a boost to corporate earnings and the bottoming out scenario in certain sectors.

These kinds of data points are of little relevance to long-term investment strategies and can be easily ignored. Overall earnings performances of most companies have been good for Q2FY20 vs Q2FY19 when there were more misses than hits.

Analysts continue to be conservative on the back of weak expectations for the year, which is a good hidden opportunity to invest for the long-term in quality stocks at low valuations.

Q) Any important events to watch out for in November?

A) While the government has addressed supply-side concerns, the demand-side concerns need to be addressed as well. While not as early as November, we expect rationalisation of tax slabs in the upcoming budget in February 2020, easing out of the Long Term Capital Gains Tax, and improving corporate governance to be the key factors for the market starting next year.

Indian IIP data may disappoint but seems to be bottoming out over there as well. Green offshoots are visible in several beaten-down sectors like autos and auto ancillaries, NBFCs, banking, infrastructure, defence, apparel retail, domestic pharma, among others.

Q) How is the November series likely to pan out for investors? What are the bright spots if we look at the October series rollover data? Which stocks are likely to be on the list of bulls and those that will remain in the grip of the bears?

A) There is money to be made on the table by investing and trading in quality companies. Good companies are offering enough investment opportunities at low valuations on the back of strong performances and quality corporate governance.

Autos (two-wheelers) and auto ancillaries, resolution of banking & NBFC issues, defence ordering, pick-up in retail, and the strong performance by companies in domestic pharma will keep bulls busy, while airlines, telecom, passenger vehicles, capital goods, real estate will keep the bears busy.

We believe that the overall direction of the market is positive now, having seen time as well as an earnings correction across sectors over the last 18 months.

The positive FII inflows seen over the last 10-15 days coupled with continued inflows into mutual funds (as SIPs inflows continue to make lifetime highs) augurs well for overall markets and long-term direction of Indian markets.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is likely to report healthy earnings growth for the July-September quarter due to dividend from HDFC Bank and stake sale in GRUH Finance. But deferred tax assets (DTA) adjustment and mark-to-market (MTM) loss on its investment in RBL Bank may limit profit growth.

""Dividend from HDFC Bank (Rs 870 crore), capital gains from stake sale in GRUH Finance (Rs 1,630 crore), MTM loss on investment in RBL Bank (Rs 270 crore) and DTA impairment (Rs 275 crore) are one-offs for Q2,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said. The brokerage expects profit growth at 54 percent and pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) at 41 percent YoY.

Net interest income and loan growth could remain in double-digit (around 14-17 percent YoY) during Q2. Brokerages expect corporate loan growth to be slow in Q2.

""We expect HDFC to deliver 15 percent YoY growth in loans under management on the back of 17 percent growth in the retail business (17 percent in Q1 FY20),"" Kotak Institutional Equities said, adding the decline in marginal cost of funds will drive 10 bps QoQ expansion in calculated NIM.

Edelweiss, which sees profit and PPoP growth of more than 50 percent YoY, said individual loan growth momentum would be 14-16 percent in Q2 FY20 though conservative stance on corporate book would lead to AUM growth of 12-14 percent. ""We estimate NII growth of 15-16 percent YoY,"" it added."

Housing finance major HDFC Ltd on October 20 said it has localised its website in six Indian languages, in addition to English, to help homebuyers get home loan related information more effectively.

The website content is now also available in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada, even as English continues to be a widely used language on digital platforms in India, HDFC said.

HDFC Ltd is the only corporate in the financial sector to offer content on its website in six Indian languages, it added.

The growing use of internet and smartphones and rising base of regional language users, particularly in smaller towns, has made it important to focus on building digital properties and content where relevant information is available in local language as well, it said.

Speaking on this initiative, HDFC Ltd Managing Director Renu Sud Karnad said, ""We are happy to share that we are among the few brands in the BFSI space to implement the 'language localisation technology'.

""This is in line with Government's Digital India initiative to let customers access the digital content in the language they are comfortable with. HDFC's website in regional languages will help us tremendously to reach deeper across India to the untapped audience,"" she said.

HDFC was awarded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the best performing primary lending institution in the EWS (economically weaker section) and LIG (low income group) and second best in the MIG (middle income group) category in June 2018.

Besides, in March 2019, HDFC was awarded as the 'Best Private Sector Financial Institution' for PMAY-CLSS at PMAY Empowering India Awards 2019.

Karnad said the new language localisation initiative will further facilitate HDFC to promote the government's flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) to the EWS and LIG customers, particularly in the tier-II, tier-III cities and smaller towns with a vast non-English speaking segment.

""While we are live with our website in six regional languages, we also intend to incorporate many more languages going forward to cater to as many regional users as possible, since consumers prefer to consume content in their preferred language,"" she added.

HDFC as of May 2019 has disbursed subsidy of over Rs 2,345 crore to over 1.1 lakh first-time homebuyers under PMAY-Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), becoming the first housing finance player to achieve this feat.

Also, during the quarter ended June 30, 2019, 35 percent of home loans approved in volume terms and 17 percent in value terms have been to customers from EWS and LIG categories.

HDFC, on an average, has been approving about 8,700 loans on a monthly basis to the EWS and LIG segment, with monthly average approvals at Rs 1,415 crore.

As per a Nasscom and KPMG report, currently there are approximately 52.1 crore Hindi language speakers and 50 crore other Indian language speakers in India. In contrast, English language speakers stand at just 12.5 crore.

Further, internet adoption rate of Indian language users is higher than English speaker users. Indian language internet user base is set to see a healthy growth, registering a CAGR of 18 percent to reach 53.6 crore by 2021.

This growth is likely to be faster compared to English internet user base, which is growing at 3 percent to 19.9 crore.

Indian language internet users are expected to account for nearly three-fourths of India's internet user base by 2021.

It has been observed that there is a high preference for regional languages over English content among Indians as 70 percent literacy rate in India is for non-English languages.

Rapid adoption of mobile internet, affordable data plans and growing digital connectivity have improved internet subscribers base in India. This trend has opened up multiple avenues to improve consumer touch points, mainly offering services in regional languages.

The company is well placed to serve the growing demand. As far as the financial position of the company goes, it is virtually debt-free and gives a 22-25 percent return on equity, as well as, return on capital employed.

Hindustan Zinc: Since zinc warehouse stock levels are at a near five-year low, any spur in demand would directly benefit Hindustan Zinc as it’s one of the lowest-cost producers in the world.

Q) Any top 5 stocks which are fundamentally sound and could turn out to be wealth creators in the next 2-3 years? A) Five Stocks which would be wealth creators for the next 2-3 years would be Hindustan Zinc , HDFC , SBI Life Insurance , Kotak Mahindra Bank and ITC .

Moreover, investing largely depends on the risk-taking appetite of the investor and his will as to where he wants to invest. Ideally, having a balanced portfolio across large, mid and smallcaps would be recommended.

Q) What are your views on broader market indices? We saw some outperformance last month – do you think the momentum will continue? A) The broader markets will outperform. The small and midcap space is in the initial phase of the bull market but during the mature stage, small and midcaps will catch up.

A recent 50 percent correction of the entire rally by the benchmark indices is very normal in such circumstances.

Trade concerns and corporate tax cuts are two diverging factors, but eventually, the fundamental reality will catch up with them as the tax cuts will play a domino effect to boost liquidity and increase the capex capacity of corporates.

Q) Indian markets seem to have caught up/stuck between trade talk woes, and muted economic data back home. Benchmark indices have also given up almost 50 percent of the gains recorded post the corporate tax cut. What are your views? A) The markets will always keep oscillating between varied sets of challenges. However, the underlying strength of fundamentals will eventually manifest in the stock prices in the long run.

Hindustan Zinc, HDFC, SBI Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ITC are the top five stocks to create wealth in the next 2-3 years, Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand. edited excerpts:

Also, millennials are seen educating themselves about the importance of life insurance which would act as a catalyst.

Kotak Mahindra Bank:

Kotak Mahindra Bank would be a great business to invest in given the brand and respect created by the management by succinctly allocating capital to use.

ITC:

ITC would be a good investment at this point. It is a sound company available at a fair price where the management is relentlessly working to improve its retail segment margins which can flair in the near term.

Q) What is keeping FIIs on the sidelines? They have turned net sellers in October as well? What are the big factors which are pushing them away from Indian markets?

A) “Uncertainty is a friend to no one” - FPIs were caught on the wrong footing when the exchequer brought the much-cheered corporate tax cut which overnight decreased the valuation multiples of frontline stocks, making Indian bourses more reasonable in terms of relative valuations.

That being so, FPIs have slowed down selling across Indian equities but have not turned buyers yet. There is every likelihood that they may turn net buyers after the Nifty50 corrects to around 11,000 levels.

Q) Equity mutual fund inflow hits a four-month low in September on profit booking. The total outflow has pulled down the asset base of the MF industry to Rs 24.51 lakh crore in September-end from Rs 25.47 lakh crore at end-August. A slowdown in domestic flows does not spell good news for investors – what are your views?

A) Taking an aggregate view of the mutual fund industry is not appropriate given the fact that around 35 percent of the AUMs are into equities on an AUM size of Rs 25.47 lakh crore base.

Liquid and debt funds are witnessing turbulent times because the economy is ailing under some sort of liquidity crisis. It is therefore natural to expect continued pressure on debt and liquid schemes in the medium term.

However, equity scheme flows are constant at around Rs. 8,200 crore a month which certainly indicates the confidence of retail investors in the equity market.

Q) What are your views on the September quarter earnings from India Inc? Do you think the recent cut in corporate tax rate will lead to more upgrades?

A) Corporate tax cuts will certainly lead to prolific onetime adjustments and not upgrades. However, at an aggregate level, revenues are expected to be slower on a YoY basis.

But, this will not act as a deterrent suppressing the mood of the market. Markets should begin pricing in the revival of the economy given the stupendous Government and RBI initiatives in place.

Q) Fixed income/liquid funds witnessed outflows in September which have been the case for many months now. What should be the strategy of investors while investing in fixed income funds? Important things to watch out for?

A) While investing in Fixed Income funds investors should check the portfolio of investments. The funds should be invested in fundamentally sound large corporates of India, only then one should commit to investing in such income funds.

Q) Which sectors are likely to lead the next leg of the rally for D-Street, and why?

A) The auto sector which faced a lot of flak recently will lead the next leg of D-Street rally with its vehicle scrappage policy.

Given the liquidity crunch and trust deficit in NBFCs, housing finance businesses should come back to become well-positioned biggies.

Q) Does it make sense to go overweight on consumption stocks after the Cabinet increased DA for government employees and the interest is heading lower? What is your outlook on Autos, consumer durable?

A) Dearness allowance to 17 percent which will entail an additional outflow of nearly Rs 16,000 crore may not be significant enough to create an impact on a Rs 2 trillion economy.

But, more than this, it sends out the right signal from the Government that they are using all their might to push economic revival.

Autos will get a boost only if the Government comes out with the scrappage policy and a reduction in GST to spur growth in this beaten-down space as this sector contributes a whopping 49 percent to India’s manufacturing GDP.

Q) Banking stocks have got plenty of attention from the investor community. What are the big reasons for the same?

A) Banking stocks are largely secular and defensive plays in the investor universe as interest income works 24X7 irrespective if the bank makes money or no.

However, the biggest challenge for any banking CEO is ‘asset management’. Due to slowdown and liquidity crisis, the banking sector is facing a lot of flux which is why investors have developed either extreme pessimism or extreme optimism on selected banking stocks which then underperforms or outperforms the index.

Q) Any particular sector which you are advising your client to avoid? If yes, what are the reasons?

A) The heyday for NBFCs are over and the valuation premiums these NBFCs used to enjoy will not come back. Additionally, the incremental growth which they were enjoying for the past couple of years due to the PSU bank clean up drive will not repeat and therefore, NBFCs should be avoided.

The revised rate will apply to both new as well as existing borrowers.

The company has brought down its lending rate to salaried class to 8.25 percent on the lower end and 8.65 percent on the upper end.

Many others have also reduced their lending rates in recent past.

The nation's largest lender and HDFC's immediate competitor in the mortgage space SBI had also cut its key rates by 0.10 percent last week.

""HDFC has reduced its retail prime lending rate on housing loans, on which its adjustable rate home loans are benchmarked, by 0.10 percent, effective October 15,"" a company spokesperson said.

The interest rate will range from 8.25 to 8.65 percent depending on the borrower.

SBI's one-year MCLR, to which the some of its home loans are linked, is now at 8.05 percent. Since Junly, its new home loans are linked to the repo rate.

This gives companies an effective tax rate of 25.17 percent, inclusive of all surcharges and cess.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Deepak Parekh, Chairman, Housing Development Finance Corporation, spoke about how this could revive investments and market sentiment. Excerpts:

Q: How will the corporate tax cut help?

A: It will certainly help the high-tax paying companies. Tax rates come down. Money available for reinvestment and paying a better dividend will be there. You can plough back money and make the company stronger because only 25 percent goes in taxes. It is a great boon.

We want to come on par with other emerging economies where the tax rate is 15-25 percent. The finance minister has rightly said that if you put new investments it will only be 15 percent, which is a motivation for existing companies to start new ventures. It will also motivate manufacturing companies from abroad to come and set up ventures in India because they are used to paying 15-25 percent tax and not 35 percent.

This is an incentive to bring in more FDI. More manufacturing companies coming in will mean more jobs. It is a positive signal that we want to be on par with the other markets and do not want to overtax. We have also made FPI attractive and hence we reduced the surcharge.

Overall, India is making a conducive environment where more money can come in. Domestic companies can expand and foreign companies can come in.

Q: Will it provide a boost to consumption demand?

A: The sentiment has to improve and with measures like this, it will improve. It is a good beginning. They have introduced a new real estate fund. We could see an announcement on how this fund could operate.

Q: What more should be done?

A: The government is under pressure and it cannot afford to lose too much revenue. We have a fiscal deficit target of 3.3 percent this year and 3 percent next year. You can tweak it a little but cannot let 3.3 percent become 5 percent. There has to be some fiscal discipline. The finance minister is working within that discipline. They have an additional income from the RBI special dividend (one-time) of Rs 1.76 lakh crore.

This tax cut move will cost them Rs 1.45 lakh crore for the whole year. Some privatisation of Air India is being done with the government putting a part of the debt of the company into another company. It will make arrangements to auction Air India. We are moving in the right direction. The government is aware of the issues in the economy and is taking appropriate action.

Q: Do you expect any measures to revive the auto sector?

A: I expect that something may come in. But here, the NBFCs have to start lending again. I do not think that the auto companies can do anything. GST collections are lower than what the government had expected. So it is very difficult for them to just slash the GST rates. Revenue consideration is very important for the government.

Q: Is risk aversion coming down in the market?

A: We will have to see what the mood is now in the market.

Q: There are fears of fiscal deficit rising to 4 percent as against the 3.3 percent estimate? What is your take?

A: I do not think that it will rise to 4 percent but it may increase to say 3.6 percent. This is my estimate."
"September 09, 2019 08:49 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rbis-new-loan-pricing-norm-may-put-banks-in-a-fix-4418511.html,"The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) mandate that requires banks to link loans to an external benchmark, could increase the risk of asset-liability mismatch (ALM) in absence of a liquid derivatives market in the country.

From October 1, banks have been asked to link their retail and SME loans to an external benchmark for faster transmission of policy rates. These benchmarks include the RBI's repo rate, 3-month treasury bills yield, and 6-month treasury bills yield. Most banks have opted for the repo rate which is more predictable as compared to others.

Currently, banks use the Marginal Cost-based Lending Rate (MCLR) to price loans that are mostly fixed in nature. The MCLR is reviewed every month, but may or may not be revised as frequently. But if banks opt for RBI's repo rate as the benchmark, the lending rates on loans may change with the reduction/increase in the policy rate. The interest rate under the external benchmark will have to be reset at least once in three months, while the RBI reviews policy rates every two months.

This may lead to ALM risk in banks' books if they are unable to address the interest rate risk between floating-rate loans and fixed-rate deposits.

""All our liabilities are fixed-rate liabilities since floating rate deposits are not very popular. So, only the asset book will be priced on external benchmarks,"" said the head of treasury at a private bank.

A mismatch occurs when cash outflows exceed inflows. As per RBI guidelines, a mismatch should not exceed 20 percent of outflows in the time bucket of 1 to 28 days.

A stress test on liquidity risks that was carried out by the RBI, assumed two scenarios- a 50 percent and 100 percent increase in cash outflows in the 1-28 days time bucket. The results indicated that 25 banks under the first scenario and 36 banks under the second scenario may face liquidity stress, RBI said in its June Financial Stability Report.

Banks could turn to interest rate swaps for rescue. However, the swap market in India is largely one-sided. ""There is no price maker in that market even if banks are willing to access it,"" the treasury head said.

An interest rate swap is a contract between two parties that agree to exchange all future interest rate payments forthcoming from a bond or loan. This typically takes place between fixed and floating-rate loans. The aim is to offset the risk of interest rate fluctuation in the future.

In simple terms, both parties have to agree on what is likely to happen with interest rates in the future, based on what they know today. This leads to speculations as the market players will price in the regulator's future moves.

BP Kanungo, Deputy Governor, RBI recently pointed out the interest rate derivatives market in India continues to be lackluster. ""There is reasonable liquidity in overnight interest swaps (OIS), but there is no appetite, and hence not much trading in other derivatives including interest rate futures,"" he said. Also, the OIS is more of a trading instrument and may not be fit for hedging structural mismatches.

The risk also extends to housing finance companies (HFCs) since they borrow from the money market and will have to compete with banks in the home loan segment. ""In order to manage liquidity and interest rate risk, HDFC has, in the past, swapped fixed rate non-convertible debentures to MIBOR-linked payouts. We expect more such interest rate swaps,"" said MB Mahesh, analyst, Kotak Institutional Equities Research, adding that this will lead to an increase in swap costs and basis risks for HFCs.

Another banker said banks may look for a natural hedge in the current situation. For instance, every bank has a set of Current Accounts Savings Accounts (CASA), that remains constant for a few months as customers use only part of these for transaction purposes. This can be converted into term deposits.

""However, the problem is it cannot be done in isolation by any one bank and has to be enforced by the regulator. The best option we believe could be that regulator enforces all incremental bulk deposits henceforth to be repo linked /flexible,"" Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, State Bank of India said in a report. The RBI's circular, however, only applies to loans and not on deposits as of now.

Bankers are hopeful that the regulator may take some supportive steps to help lenders move to the new benchmarking framework."

In the truncated week, the market managed well to sustain above its crucial support placed at 11,000 amid uncertain global cues and disappointments from domestic developments.

Bulls helped the Nifty to pull out from the lows of 10,900-10,940 to close the week at 11,048, which is positive for the market. However, on a weekly basis, the index closed in the red.

A couple of weeks prior, Nifty closed 1.97 percent higher than was the first positive close, and after that, we saw four consecutive weeks of fall that resulted in a damage of nearly 900 points.

In the previous week, even though, the flows were not satisfactory, Nifty managed to sustain above 10,785, which was the lowest of the current sell-off.

If the index has to surpass 11,181 which is the recent swing high, it requires some more fuel. In the previous week, the Nifty neither broke the lows of prior week nor highs, however, it managed to close near the highest point of the overall range of last week.

Such patterns are bullish in nature especially when they appear at the bottom of the sell-off on a weekly basis. However, for bullish validation, the Nifty requires to surpass 11,181, which is the highest level seen in the last two weeks.

We can expect specific strength in the market if the Nifty closes above 11,181, and above that, it could move towards 11,350 or 11,450.

In case, Nifty fails to surpass 11,181, and on the contrary, breaks below 10,780, then it would be grossly negative for the market.

Sector and stock-specific

Finance and metal companies should be on our watch list this week. If we go through stocks individually, the index heavyweight such as Reliance Industries has reversed the bearishness sharply on the weekly as well as on a monthly basis, which is bullish for the stock.

Nifty IT index closed lower, which is bearish but this would help other heavyweights of Nifty components. Bank Nifty will move higher as they are inversely correlated at the initial stage.

On the other side, HDFC has formed bearish consolidation on a weekly basis. It has formed Head and Shoulders pattern on a weekly basis and closed below the level of neckline support, which is negative for the market.

We had spotted very early the head and shoulder pattern of RIL, which has completed almost its targets and now it is the turn of HDFC, which is also an early spotting.

Our advice to traders and short-term traders is to stay away in taking bullish call for the next few weeks on HDFC.

Bulls failed to hold on to the gains made last week, as bears dragged the BSE Sensex below 37,000 and the Nifty below 11,000 on August 13.

Both global and domestic factors left investors on the edge, with selling pressure at higher levels pushing benchmark indices below their crucial support levels.

The big bull of D-Street, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, in an exclusive interview to CNBC-TV18 expressed concern over the state of the market and slowdown in the economy.

The NBFC crisis, elections and fiscal situations had led to a short-term slowdown in the economy, Jhunjhunwala. He was not bearish on the market at current levels and saw 10,750-11,000 levels on the Nifty to act as the bottom.

The final tally on D-Street: the Sensex plunged 623 points to 36,958. The Nifty50 down 183 points at 10,925.

Sectorally, the Nifty Auto index was down 3.9 percent, followed by the Nifty Infrastructure index that plunged 3.6 percent, and the Nifty Financial Services slipped 2.9 percent.

Four factors that could be weighing on markets:

FM's silence on super-rich tax

Much of the last week’s gain, witnessed in the final two days, were attributed to the expectation that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman would tweak the tax structure for foreign investors, a concern that has been roiling the market.

At a meeting with foreign portfolio investors on August 9, she gave no indication of rethinking the proposal to raise their taxes, a Reuters report quoted some of the investors as saying.

A day earlier, there were reports that the government could exempt foreign investors from the super-rich tax slapped on those earning more than Rs 2 crore a year.

The tax proposed in the budget, ratified by Parliament, saw investors pull $1.8 billion out of Indian equities in July alone.

Argentina crash

Asian markets were trading lower largely on concerns over a drawn out global trade war, protests in Hong Kong and a crash in Argentina’s peso currency.

Investors were also still assessing the wider damage caused by August 12’s crash in Argentina after its President Mauricio Macri became the latest pro-free market, pro-reform leader to be given a beating at the polls by a populist rival, a Reuters report said.

“The peso collapsed 15 percent, equities crumbled 48 percent in dollar terms —the second biggest one-day slump anywhere since 1950— and the bond market crashed, with a 100-year bond that investors had recently gobbled up tumbling 20% as fears of yet another government default spiked,” added the report.

Financials lead the decline

Nifty

The Nifty Bank tumbled more than 700 points, or over 2 percent, led by fall in YES Bank (down 10%) followed by Federal Bank (down 5%), RBL Bank (down 2.9%), IndusInd Bank, and SBI , both down by over 2 percent.

The Nifty Finance slipped 3 percent led by losses in M&M Financials (down 6%), followed by Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, HDFC, and ICICI Prudential which were down by over 5 percent each.

Technical factors

The Nifty, which that reclaimed 11,100 levels for the first time since July for the week ended August 9, breached 11,000 levels. The decline was fierce as the index breached 13-day exponential moving average (EMA), as well as 5-day EMA in a single trading session.

Last week, technical indicators were suggesting a short coverings rally in Indian markets towards 11,200-11,300 levels but the fierce fall on August 13 could make analysts revise calculations.

“If we manage to surpass 11,200-11,300 levels, then the next possible resistance is placed in the zone of 11,450 – 11,500. At this juncture, the pragmatic approach would be to take one step at a time and focus more on individual stocks,” Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst, Technical & Derivatives, Angel Broking said.

“On the lower side, the immediate support is seen around 11,062–10,975 and with a broader view, as long as we are defending 10,782–10,750, there is no reason to worry for.”"

The global investment bank has said that markets could be nearing a bottom.

“We are getting to a bottom in share prices, as our valuation and sentiment indicators suggest, but risks remain on the horizon for the real economy and a slowing global economy,” Morgan Stanley said in a report.

The risk-to-reward ratio favours buying equities, but a V-shaped recovery in stocks depends on the actions of policymakers, says the August 6 report. Investors with a bit of patience will likely be rewarded well in the next 12 months.

The S&P BSE Sensex has fallen around 9 percent from its record high of 40,312.07 touched in early June. The market has continued to head south, weighed down by budget proposal of higher tax on the super rich, selling by foreign investors, slowdown in growth and escalating trade war between the US and China.

Despite the selloff, Morgan Stanley maintains its base-case scenario of 45,000 on the Sensex by June 2020, and a bull-case of 50,000. Its bear case possibility sees the Sensex at 35,000 by June 2020.

“Indian equities look attractive in a relative context amid subdued oil prices, global trade tensions and better relative valuations in what is a low-return world,” says the note.

It, however, says policy action is still needed to protect India’s relative performance, which has sunk since the budget was presented on July 5.

From a portfolio perspective, Morgan Stanley likes financials, consumer discretionary and industrials, both large-and midcaps.

Policymakers could turn to measures such as strategic divestments of public-sector companies, recapitalisation of public-sector banks, trade deal with the US and other countries, rationalisation of GST rates, a new Direct Tax Code, infrastructure spending and fiscal prudence, and a moratorium on higher taxation for FPI trusts, Morgan Stanley says.

Bajaj Auto, M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Dabur, United Spirits, SBI, HDFC, Ashok Leyland, InterGlobe Aviation, L&T, Asian Paints and Sun Pharma are among the top 20 stocks on Morgan Stanley’s focus list."

Q) The most important question which everyone is asking is when will be bottom out? There are no positive surprises from the earnings, the economy is showing signs of a slowdown, and corporate governance issues keep cropping up.

A) The earnings yield in equities should support the Nifty at some point. The Nifty may even rise on the back of a handful of stocks, as has been the case for a while now.

However, given the pain pervading the broader market, the bottoming out process will take time. Sadly, many niggles have ballooned into big concerns, and new headaches have emerged in recent months.

Liquidity and credit availability issues have been a drag on the economy for a long time now, and even multiple rate cuts have not helped their cause either.

Domestic consumption, which is holding up economic growth, has hit a cyclical downturn after several years of a falling savings rate.

Revival in the private-sector investment seems remote because of credit hassles, demand issues and drop in animal spirits.

There is a perception gaining ground that following the initial success in the form of a few low-hanging fruits, the bad asset resolution process has slowed down.

The cautious commentary by a set of private banks, which were unaffected so far, hasn’t helped either. Fears of an encroaching slippage cycle in the retail consumer credit loom large.

Government capex (capital expenditure) has held up so far, but factoring in both the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet borrowings, there seems a risk of further crowding out of the private sector.

The super-rich tax has impacted the sentiment of UHNIs (ultra-high net worth individuals) and FPIs (foreign portfolio investments). Discernibly, socialist positions calling for further job reservations in the private sector and attempts to cancel legacy government contracts in certain states also does not bode well.

Given the weak logistics activity, as reflected by the lull in freight traffic across roads, rail, shipping and even at ports, GDP growth may drop lower before it recovers.

My sense is that the market has entered a long consolidation phase following the buoyant rally that reigned from 2013-end till 2017. The year 2018 was that of a big fall, and 2019 is likely to be another year of consolidation that should last till some point in 2020. The second leg of an upswing seems likely only in FY21.

Q) What do you make of the earnings that have come so far?

A) The result season hasn’t been encouraging, so far. Revenue growth has suffered a multi-quarter dip on account of the auto sector lag, besides the strain caused by other consumption companies.

Tata Motors and Vodafone losses have been a major drag on the already slow earnings. Our sense is that it could get worse as the season progresses.

However, on the bright side, the financial sector earnings are improving notwithstanding the gloomy commentary.

Q) What do you make of the auto sales numbers for July?

A) We expect auto sales to remain weak in July 2019. While inventories have been corrected through OEM (original equipment manufacturer) production cuts, our recent channel checks hint at further deceleration in the retail demand.

In the passenger car space, given the weak inquiries, we expect double-digit declines for all listed players. The CV (commercial vehicle) segment has been hit hard by a multitude of factors: economic slowdown, lower freight rates, higher fuel prices and NBFC crisis.

Consequently, sustained weakness in retail volumes is imminent; hence we expect a 20 percent decline in industry volumes.

Q) How is August likely to pan out for investors? What are the important events to watch out?

A) Though a month-by-month market prediction is invariably difficult, we should hopefully see a semblance of a respite in August, after a largely forgettable July.

The market expects a few decisive steps from the government towards damage control. If it happens, sentiments would get a boost.

Marketmen keenly await the quarterly GDP data. Scenarios of the RBI cutting rates and helping improve credit availability are among the key hopes.

Q) In July we saw a glimpse of selling in top largecaps names, which is not a positive sign if you are a bull. Which will correct the most, the HDFC twins (HDFC Bank and HDFC Ltd) or the Bajaj twins (Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv)?

A) The Bajaj twins seem more susceptible to further correction. The HDFC twins should deliver stable operating performance in the coming quarters notwithstanding the external challenges, thanks to their relatively undemanding valuation, controlled growth in recent years, limited exposure to vulnerable consumer financing segments and access to stable and low-cost funding. Bajaj twins, too, have a robust business model but they could exhibit higher cyclicality.

Q) It looks like things are changing fast on Dalal Street. What is your advice to investors? How can they decide what stocks to keep and which ones to sell out?

A) Firstly, investors must immediately exit companies plagued with governance issues and regulatory overhang, even if at a loss.

Secondly, they should ensure a margin of safety across their portfolios. In the present scenario, anything that’s expensive on FY20 numbers is at a price risk. Even institutional investors wouldn’t want to take a chance with FY21-22 estimates in an uncertain economic scenario.

Last, but not least, the evergreen rule is to own stocks from sunrise industries, those blessed with excellent management with a growing competitive edge and an eye for disruption and innovation.

Investors shouldn’t hesitate to sell if the industry or company has sticky challenges or the competitive position is under threat.

Q) People have forgotten the word ‘multibagger’ in 2019 which was a popular word before 2018. But, given the extent of fall, this might be the right time to look at stocks that could eventually turn out to be multibaggers as the tide reverses. What are your views?

A) It’s a good sign that people aren’t looking up the keyword ‘multibagger’ on the web anymore. This trend shows that market greed has abated, and caution (read fear) has taken over.

However, it doesn’t mean that all will be hunky-dory about investing henceforth. Only after a period of consolidation, small and mid-caps will resurface to relish good times again.

Given a three to five-year time horizon, stock nibbling won’t be such a bad idea, especially if done in a staggered manner. But, since the same set of midcaps and small caps, which zoomed between 2014 to 2017, may not lead the next rally, it’s better to wait for the dust to settle in this segment.

For now, with bad news floating around and more pouring in by the day, our bias would be towards well-established names.

Even holding cash seems a great option. The problem is that I don’t know of anyone who has free cash anymore, given the hit across all asset classes: equities, property and even FMPs.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC

HDFC's Q1FY20 earnings with PAT at Rs32bn up 46% YoY was largely supported by subsidiary stake sale gains (Rs18.9bn) and income on subsidiary investments. The quarter saw steady NIMS at 3.3% although non-individual spreads shrunk moderately. As corporate portfolio slackens, the overall loans stood sluggish at 13% YoY growth as against PL expectation of 15%; said that, individual loan traction stood upbeat at 17% YoY. While HDFC's credit risk profile stands robust, Q1FY20 saw moderate asset quality deterioration reflective of macro slowdown. GNPA at 1.29% stood higher than expectations of 1.2%, ECL provisioning climbed to 1.55% from 1.44% in Q4FY19. As macro headwinds play out, the margin-NPA maintenance conundrum has come to fore. While HDFC maintains competitive superiority the spreads should stand maintained, however, GNPA and loan traction (15%) should see slight downward pressures for FY20.

Outlook

Against this backdrop, we trim our core book multiple to 2.6x (earlier 2.7x) arriving at TP of Rs2,270 (earlier Rs 2,274) at Mar-21 PABV. Downgrade to ACCUMULATE.

ICICI Direct's research report on HDFC

Given the unfavourable lending environment, advances growth was slower at 11.2% YoY to Rs 4,16,597 crore compared to the previous run rate, on the back of moderation in corporate book. Though individual loan portfolio increased ~15.3% YoY to Rs 297502 crore and accounted for ~71% of total loan book, growth in non-individual book was curtailed at 1.5% YoY to Rs 112105 crore. Growth in individual loan book, after adding back loans sold in the preceding 12 months, remained healthy at 24% YoY.

Outlook

Accordingly, we revise our SOTP (15% discount) based target to Rs 2040/share (earlier Rs 2195). Given recent headwinds, we maintain our HOLD (with negative bias) recommendation on the stock.

Shares of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) traded moderately higher amid volatility, as global brokerages raised price targets on the stock after its excellent June quarter earnings.

The stock has gained 10 per cent in last one year. It was quoting at Rs 2,127.90, up Rs 3.80, or 0.18 per cent on BSE at 1225 hours IST.

The housing finance major reported a massive 46 per cent year-on-year growth in June quarter profit at Rs 3,203 crore, driven by a stake sale in Gruh Finance, and showed 14 per cent increase in net interest income at Rs 3,129.8 crore with lower-than-expected loan growth.

The assets under management (AUM) growth at 12.8 per cent YoY was lowest due to non-individual loan book growth at 2.24 per cent YoY, but individual loan growth remained strong at 15.3 per cent YoY.

""Q1 AUM growth moderated further with stable spreads, but some of the large housing finance companies are going slow, which should help HDFC grow on the asset side,"" said Citi, which maintained its buy call on the stock and raised price target to Rs 2,570 from Rs 2,360 per share.

Liability side should benefit from falling wholesale costs, Citi believes, while raising FY20 net profit estimate by 8 per cent to factor in the Gruh Finance stake sale.

On the asset quality front, gross non-performing assets (NPA) were the highest ever for HDFC. Gross NPA in the non-individual portfolio increased to 2.68 per cent against 2.34 per cent. Individual gross NPA rose to 0.72 per cent versus 0.7 per cent on a sequential basis. Overall gross NPA increased to 1.29 per cent in Q1 against 1.18 per cent in the March quarter.

""Asset quality faced some pressure with downgraded exposure to Jet Airways,"" said CLSA, which added that HDFC remained its top pick and maintained a buy call, with a target at Rs 2,770 per share.

Jefferies also retained a buy call on the stock, and increased its target price to Rs 2,435 from Rs 2,310 per share, but cut FY21/22 EPS estimates by 7-9 per cent and forecast an AUM CAGR of 13.4 per cent.

The brokerage also lowered its loan growth and margin estimate for FY21/22 and raised credit cost estimates for FY20, factoring in exposure in a few stressed corporate assets.

The Economic slowdown in India, underlined by the weakness in consumption demand, is temporary in nature and will pick up at the onset of the festive season, said Deepak Parekh, Chairman of mortgage giant HDFC.

“While there has been an across-the-board slowdown in consumption, given the inherent demand and low penetration levels, I do believe this is temporary in nature,” Parekh said in HDFC’s annual general meeting held on August 2.

He said that the demand for commercial real estate has been buoyant across the top eight cities and is coming from the IT sector, e-commerce, professional as well as services sectors.

Parekh added that several investors have evinced interest in the commercial real estate sector. These include pension funds, sovereign funds and private equity players with “deep pockets.”

However, unsold inventory levels are high in upper middle segment and high-end luxury housing where the price of the apartments is above Rs 2 crore. On the other hand, the affordable housing segment continues to see strong demand.

He said that the challenge is re-instilling confidence in lenders to support growth, since they have limited funding to select high-rated non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) amid a risk averse environment.

“As a result, a number of NBFCs and housing finance companies have curtailed disbursements. This in turn has spillover effects into a number of other sectors,” Parekh said.

This is not the first time that Parekh has allayed fears of a slowdown. Earlier last month, in a note to HDFC shareholders, Parekh said that the economy was facing “short-term challenge” and that the poll outcome was a “strong mark of confidence.”

On the contrary, top private lenders and corporates have expressed concerns over deepening slowdown. The International Monetary Fund has cut India’s growth rate projection for FY20 by 30 basis points to 7 percent. Ratings agency CRISIL also revised its growth estimate downwards by 20 basis points to 6.9 percent."

For home loans up to Rs 30 lakh, the financier is offering 8.60 percent now. For women borrowers, the new rate is 8.55 percent, the largest mortgage lender said in a statement, adding the rate reduction will be applicable to existing borrowers as well.

For loans above Rs 30 lakh and up to Rs 75 lakh, the new rates will 8.85 percent and 8.80 percent for women borrowers and for those above Rs 75 lakh, the prices will come down to 8.90 and 8.85 percent respectively, it said.

Earlier this month, State Bank had reduced its lending rate by 5 basis points across all tenors. It had also lowered its one year rates to 8.40 percent from 8.45.

The rate reductions come after the RBI lowered the policy rate by a cumulative 75 basis points to 5.75 percent in three successive steps since February and prodding banks to pass on the benefits to end-customers, as they have lowered only 21 bps as of June.

Indian markets have remained resilient in 2019 despite bad news and even hit new record highs largely on the back of strong buying seen in some key heavyweights, describes as ‘HRITHIK’ stocks by market commentators .

HRITHIK is an acronym for the seven blue chips – HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, Infosys, TCS, HDFC, ITC, and Kotak Mahindra Bank. Six of the seven stocks rose 8-20 percent compared to 4 percent rise seen in Nfity50 so far in 2019.

These seven account for more than 40 percent weight in the Nifty, and any substantial rise or fall in these stocks is likely to dictate the fate of the index.

The Nifty50, which hit a record high in June, went south and broke below crucial support levels on its way down. A close look at the HRITHIK stocks will help us understand this sudden U-turn .

Five—HDFC Bank, TCS, RIL, ITC, and HDFC Ltd —of the seven stocks have fallen 1-7 percent in July. Kotak Mahindra Bank rose 2 percent, and Infosys rallied more than 7 percent in the same period.

Most experts feel that investors are booking profits in the HRITHIK stocks, which were already trading at expensive valuations, and trend could well continue for some more time that would eventually cap the upside for the Nifty50 index as well.

“HRITHIK (HDFC, RIL, INFY, TCS, HUL, INDUS, KOTAK BANK) stocks can perform contrary to the broader market for quite a long time although these will also undergo correction due to relative valuation concerns or profit booking or reweighting of portfolios,” Deepak Jasani , Head, Retail Research at HDFC Securities, told Moneycontrol.

“The rally in these stocks enabled Nifty to break into new high in early June 2019. However, now it may be difficult for the Nifty to make another high till a wider section of the top 100-150 stock starts to perform; of course one would wish for even the small and midcap stocks to start performing,” he said.

Experts are of the opinion that at a time when the economy is showing signs of a slowdown, the HRITHIK stocks could underperform but will not fail or investors will not losses all their money. They could be called safe bets.

“As long as these companies deliver on performance, they will continue to move higher. Corrections will happen along the way. We disagree with the notion that these companies will fail but they could certainly disappoint on growth. Some of these stocks have stellar management and strong barriers to entry,” Sunil Sharma, Chief Investment Officer, Sanctum Wealth Management, told Moneycontrol.

“One or two of them may not succeed but if you look at Amazon, Apple in the US, they have worked for over 20 years, Coke for over 50 years, etc. Certainly along the way business models will change and it is the job of the investor to identify changing conditions,” he said.

State Bank of India, the lead lender to the bankrupt Jet Airways, on July 24 moved an intervention application against mortgage lender HDFC's plea claiming rights over a portion of the airline's BKC property.

The National Company Law of Tribunal (NCLT) adjourned the matter for August 8.

On July 4, the mortgage lender HDFC had moved the NCLT seeking to keep the airline's BKC property out of the bankruptcy process saying three floors of the BKC property are mortgaged with it as collateral for over Rs 400 crore loan.

Meanwhile, the tribunal approved Ashish Chhawchharia of Grant Thornton as the resolution professional for Jet Airways which stopped flying since April 17.

Chhawchharia, who got 81 percent votes of the committee of creditors, was the interim RP since June 20, when the airline was admitted for insolvency.

The liabilities and debt of the airline are over Rs 36,000 crore.

On July 18, the RP had said he received claims worth Rs 24,887 crore in 16,643 claims, including Rs 8,462 crore by financial creditors, against the company as of July 4.

Significantly, he rejected a claim of Rs 229 crore from JetAir, the privately held company of founder Naresh Goyal, which was the general sales agent of Jet Airways and the holding company the Goyals's stake in the airline.

The lenders, who control 50 percent ownership of the airline, after failing to get a buyer, was forced to sent it for bankruptcy on June 17, and on the 20th of the month the Mumbai NCLT admitted the plea.

Last Saturday, the lenders in renewed bid to sell the remaining assets invited expression of interest from interested parties with a deadline of August 3.

Financial creditors, who also include banks, have made 37 claims worth Rs 10,231 crore as of July 4, he said. The list of financial creditors, whose claims have been admitted include 14 domestic banks and financial institutions, 12 foreign banks and eight lessors, the RP said.

State Bank has made a claim of Rs 1,644 crore, including cash credit inclusive of interest, term loans and bank guarantees issued but not invoked, it said, adding its claims worth Rs 19 crore were rejected. Private sector lender Yes Bank has claimed Rs 1,084 crore, followed by PNB's Rs 963 crore and IDBI Bank's Rs 594 crore.

Operational creditors excluding workmen and employees have made a claim of Rs 12,372 crore, with the entire amount being under verification, while the workmen and employees have made a claim of Rs 443 crore which is also under verification, Chhawchharia said.

Apart from this, authorised representatives of workmen and employees have made 11,965 claims of Rs 735 crore, he said, adding other creditors, including other financial creditors and operational creditors, have made 121 claims amounting to Rs 1,105 crore."

Private lender HDFC Bank has been the most consistent banking player on performance, even topping the chart of value creation for all listed companies. However, it leaves a lot to be desired on KYC and anti-money laundering (AML) front.

The findings are part of RBI risk assessment reports (RARs) as analysed by Moneylife, which were procured by activist Girish Mittal under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

According to the report, HDFC has consistently generated high value over the past 20 years, not just in the banking sector but among all listed companies.

The central bank also classified it as 'medium risk' against competitors for its aggressive write-off of non-performing assets (NPAs) in FY12-13, and for meeting provisions required with minimum divergence (Rs 47 lakh). There was also no divergence noted in assessed and reported profits for the period, it said.

For FY13-14, the RAR found no great variance in the projected and actual figures for the past three-year period of the Bank.

The central bank also noted that around 90 percent of HDFC current account holders in FY14-15 were not borrowers, which gives the lender risk-free money and negates interest payment requirements.

However, regular lapses and low compliance was noted in the KYC and AML processes for the entire three years period. Of 1.92 million accounts due for KYC updation almost 64.5 percent were incomplete; while in FY14-15 alone, 32,134 cases of KYC and AML exceptions were detected.

In fact, HDFC Bank was penalised Rs 4.5 crore by the RBI in FY13-14 and Rs 26 lakh by the Financial Intelligence Unit, the appeal for the latter is pending, it said."

A two-member bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya upheld the order of the principal bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) which had rejected HDFC's plea.

The appellate tribunal said it found ""no merits"" in HDFC's petition and said that non-bank financial lenders come under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and should seek remedies from the central bank, not the bankruptcy court.

Passing an order on December 6, 2018, the NCLT had observed that RHC Holding was a non-banking financial company and does not come under the purview of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

HDFC had then approached the appellate tribunal to challenge the NCLT's ruling.

The mortgage lender had moved the NCLT to recover an amount of Rs 41 crore.

RHC Holding, promoted by the Singh brothers, had taken a loan of Rs 200 crore from HDFC in April 2016. RHC Holding had paid the interest for the first quarter on time but later started defaulting on its dues.

According to HDFC, even after adjusting the proceeds from the sale of pledged shares, an amount of Rs 41.09 crore remained due.

To recover the remaining amount, HDFC filed an insolvency plea against RHC Holding before the NCLT.

The NCLAT had in January this year issued notices to RHC Holding and other parties and directed them to file their replies."

Realty firm Vatika Ltd July 9 said it has repaid loans worth Rs 500 crore to Indiabulls Housing Finance and HDFC by monetising its land bank and commercial assets. ""Vatika repaid Rs 80 crore to HDFC and nearly Rs 420 crore to Indiabulls Housing Finance for their respective project-level debt exposure.

Vatika had raised this fund in a phased manner since 2013.

To cut its debt, the company decided to monetise two of its prime land parcels, including a 15-acre plot in the prime area of Gurugram, apart from the sale of residential apartments at its projects, Vatika said.

It also monetised commercial assets by availing Lease Rental Discounting (LRD) to raise funds for this round of debt repayment, the statement said.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is the leading provider of Housing Finance in India with a gross loan book of Rs 4 trillion and about 1.9 million deposits accounts.

During FY19, total loans increased 12 percent year-over-year (YoY) to Rs 4,066 billion. The NII for FY19 stood at Rs 114 billion compared to Rs 96 billion in the previous year, reflecting a growth of 18 percent. Reflecting efficiency, the company’s cost to income ratio stood at 8.5 percent at the end of FY19 down from 9.2 percent in the previous year.

HDFC will continue to benefit from its strong market position, continued growth in loans, healthy asset quality and stable spreads. Also, the company remains focused on marketing, distribution and digitization in order to expand reach and boost operational efficiency.

In terms of macro scenario, the domestic mortgage has plenty upside with low penetration levels. Housing loans as a percentage of nominal GDP in India has remained quite low at around 11 percent which is significantly lower than the levels achieved in most of the developed countries (Thailand-20 percent, China-26 percent, USA-50 percent and UK- 66 percent). Favourable government policies and initiatives focused on affordable housing creates impetus in the housing sector.

Further, rapid urbanization, emergence of nuclear families, young Indian population, increasing disposable income and improving afford ability will continue to be the demand drivers in the sector.

Given HDFC’s solid fundamentals and favourable macro traits, we believe the company is well positioned for long term growth and initiate our coverage on HDFC with a BUY rating and a target price of Rs 2,539 per share.

Considering the on-going challenges that the government is facing to maintain a balance between promoting growth and at the same time ensuring fiscal discipline, we would consider this as a decent budget focused on long term growth and thus assign a 3 rating, Jayant Manglik, President - Retail Distribution, Religare Broking Ltd, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q: Which were the major winners and losers from Budget 2019?

A) The Budget was largely in-line with street expectations. The government has announced steps to promote the growth of the rural economy and boost agri income.

We feel this could be positive for agri stocks like PI Industries, Rallis India, GNFC, Godrej Agrovet. Further, consumer stocks like Dabur India, HUL, Colgate Palmolive India and Britannia Industries that have been witnessing volume pressure in rural areas will stand to be the key beneficiaries of these announcements.

Additionally, the government’s move to allocate Rs 70,000 crore for recapitalisation of public sector banks is encouraging, as it would mean more capital for PSU banks and comply with RBI capital requirement guidelines.

The step is positive for banks like SBI, BOB and Bank of India. Also, the government has proposed to move regulation of HFCs from National Housing Board to RBI, which would be positive for housing finance companies like HDFC, LIC housing finance, GIC housing, etc. as it would improve stability in the sector in the long term.

However, certain moves like an increase in customs duty on gold and precious metals from 10 percent to 12.5 percent were against market expectations of a reduction in the duty. This could negatively impact gold and jewellery companies like Titan, TBZ, Shirpur Gold and Rajesh Exports.

Further, custom duty on indoor and outdoor split ACs was hiked to 20 percent from the current 10 percent. This could negatively impact stocks like Voltas, Blue Star, IFB Industries and Whirlpool.

Q: How do you rate the Budget 2019 on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the best and 1 being the worst)?

A: We feel the budget has largely focused on creating a roadmap for the next five years to promote growth and investments in the Indian economy. These measures are expected to yield results over a longer period.

We feel, given the current slowdown in the Indian economy, the market was expecting few more and immediate growth measures/steps than what has been announced.

However, considering the on-going challenges that the government is facing to maintain a balance between promoting growth and at the same time ensuring fiscal discipline, we would consider this as a decent budget focused on long term growth and thus mark 3 out 5.

Q: Anything specific that could impact investors and markets.

A: The Budget had both its hits and misses. The government rolled out the roadmap for the next five years in order to promote growth, increase investment in key sectors like power and infrastructure.

However, the growth stimulus was lower than market expectations which could have a sentimental impact on the markets in the near term given the slowdown in the economy.

On the positive side, the government lowering its fiscal deficit target (3.3 percent in FY20 from 3.4 percent) would instil confidence amongst market participants.

Q: Top five stocks that investors can look at buying post the Budget.

A: Based on the announcements in the budget, we feel one can consider investing in companies like Dabur, Britannia, Godrej Agrovet, Rallis India, SBI, HDFC, and L&T. These stocks hold promising prospects and would stand to be key beneficiaries.

Once you receive your HDFC Credit Card, visit the nearest ATM Centre to generate the PIN Number.

Before generating your ATM PIN, call the HDFC Bank phone banking number and generate OTP through mobile number. You will immediately receive a number on your mobile number.

Insert the card in the ATM slot and choose the language of your choice. Once that is done, click on the Generate ATM PIN Option. Enter the OTP that HDFC Bank has sent to your mobile phone. After this, you will be required to enter your 10-digit mobile number. Once this is done, you will be given the option to create your own ATM PIN Number. Choose this number and remember the combination, as you will be required to use it for all offline transactions i.e. while using a credit card machine at a store or at a restaurant.

Generate your HDFC Credit Card through NetBanking

Off late, more people prefer logging into their HDFC bank account rather than physically visiting an ATM or a bank branch. HDFC’s NetBanking facility gives you the option of generating your HDFC Credit Card PIN Number. All you need to do is log into your HDFC NetBanking account; once you are in, click on the Credit Card tab. Click on ‘Credit Card ATM PIN’ option. You will be then asked to choose the card whose ATM PIN you wish to generate. Choose that card and give the four-digit ATM PIN combination. You will be then asked to confirm the transaction. Once this is done, you will be sent a message confirming that your ATM PIN has been successfully been generated. Remember this four-digit combination at all times, as it will be required for offline transactions.

Tips to keep your Credit Card PIN Safe

You need to be aware that you could be a victim of credit card fraud, and that there are several methods to keep your bank details secure. All banks, both Indian and international, will give you advice on how to keep your credit card details secure. Here are some of them

- Change your ATM PIN Number frequently: We’re not suggesting you change your ATM PIN number every week, but it is advised that you make the change every quarter. Also, avoid using PIN combinations such as your date of birth or your wedding anniversary date, as these are easily accessible. Instead, think of a code that you will remember as your unique code and work on permutations and combinations around this four-digit number.

- Do not share your PIN with anyone: Your PIN is your number to use and sharing it with anyone could prove costly. Even when you call a bank’s customer representative service, the teller will tell you not to share your PIN Number with anyone, even if the individual claims to be a bank representative. Usually, if you are asked to provide the PIN Number, then you will be asked to do so by entering the four-digit PIN on your phone keypad.

- Check your SMS alerts and Credit Card statement carefully: One advantage of syncing your credit card with your cell phone is that you will be intimated for every transaction you make. In case there is a transaction that is unfamiliar, then alert your bank immediately and block your card at that very moment.

Mortgage lender HDFC on July 4 moved the NCLT seeking to keep the Jet Airways headquarters in the city out of the bankruptcy process.

The HDFC counsel told the National Company Law Tribunal that three floors of the building are mortgaged with the lender.

The tribunal will hear HDFC's plea on July 5 along with the main petition.

Last month, NCLT had admitted the insolvency petition filed by the lenders' consortium led by State Bank against Jet Airways which stopped operations on April 17 after running out of cash.

The tribunal has also appointed Ashish Chhawchharia of Grant Thornton as the resolution professional and asked him to submit a progress report by July 5.

The consortium of 26 bankers led by State Bank took the grounded Jet Airways to NCLT to recover their dues of over Rs 8,500 crore.

The lenders have been trying to sell the airline as a going concern since the past five months, but failed due to many a reason.

Apart from banks, the airline also owes over Rs 10,000 crore to its hundreds of vendors, primarily aircraft lessors and over Rs 3,000 crore to its employees who have not been paid since March.

The airline has been having negative net worth for long and has run a loss of over Rs 13,000 crore in the past few year. Thus it has over Rs 36,500 crore of dues and being a services company negligible assets to recover."

In a letter to the shareholders, Parekh said he is confident that the new government along with the regulators will prioritise re-instilling a culture of trust across the banking and financial sector.

""It is important to stay optimistic and recognise that the economy will tide over some of the short-term challenges it faces,"" he said, adding however, this should not take away our focus from the broader picture that the country stands tall today.

On the strong political mandate that the recent elections gave, he said ""the poll outcome is a strong mark of confidence and the country stands ready to welcome patient capital seeking to earn attractive returns.""

Thanking retail depositors who put their hard-earned money with the mortgage financier, he said HDFC's strength has been its ability to seamlessly straddle between wholesale and retail funding.

""They say, 'little by little, a little becomes a lot.' This best characterises the growth in our retail deposits. We cannot be more grateful to the thousands of small investors who entrust their hard-earned savings with us,"" he said.

Parekh said in the first half of FY19, HDFC was asked why it was not growing as aggressively as others in certain segments of the commercial real estate market.

""We held our ground by consciously staying away from funding what we perceived were riskier assets. Unsurprisingly, in the second half of the year, we were asked what we did differently that enabled us to stay resilient and be the preferred choice in the flight to safety. Perhaps, a combination of experience and adhering to our risk appetite held us in good stead,"" he said.

In the current environment, HDFC worked extremely hard to preserve asset quality and its NPAs have been considerably lower than several others in the financial sector, he said, adding, ""we know we cannot rest on these laurels.""

However, he admitted that the company made a few wrong calls in the non-individual lending segment and underestimated certain risks.

""Many would agree that this is par for the course in any lending business. Yet, we know that stakeholders value us for our transparency and we will not compromise or shy away from owning up to genuine mistakes,"" Parekh said.

He said during the year loans were written off only after all possible options were exhausted. ""Barring these few loans, our ethos of being conservative in our financial decisions has paid us off well. We know that the best time to save for a rainy day is when we have windfall gains. This has ensured that we always have adequate buffers for contingencies"".

Amongst retail finance in the country, home loans continue to stand out - both in terms of growth and asset quality. ""For us, it has been rewarding that our growth has come from increased volume rather than large-ticket loans.""

According to Parekh, there is a need to focus on another demographic aspect - the population of senior citizens which is expected to grow to 173 million by 2025. By 2050, we are estimated to have 240 million senior citizens."

In a letter to shareholders published in the annual report, Parekh said the housing finance company will continue to focus on the government’s initiative of “Housing for All.”

“Amongst retail finance in India, home loans continue to stand out – both, in terms of growth and asset quality. For us, it has been rewarding that our growth has come from increased volume rather than large-ticket loans,” Parekh said, adding, this is reflective of the firm’s deeper penetration and stronger pipeline of supply of affordable houses.

He said retail home loans remained the bright spot and housing has become distinctly more affordable.

Parekh also said HDFC continues to watch its asset quality. “Reflecting back, in the first half of the financial year, we were often asked why we were not growing as aggressively as others in certain segments of the commercial real estate market. We held our ground by consciously staying away from funding what we perceived were riskier assets,” he said.

However, he added that the firm has continued lending to old customers who have honoured their commitments in the past.

Parekh admitted the lender did make a few wrong calls after it underestimated certain risks, but that it had written off loans only after having exhausted all possible options.

“Barring a few loans, the company’s ethos of being conservative paid off,” Parekh said in a letter to shareholders on July 3.

“HDFC's advantage has been its access to diversified resources,” stated the letter.

Parekh also said experience, and adhering to the company’s risk appetite has kept it in good stead.

“Our NPLs have been lower than others in India, but we cannot rest on laurels,” the letter stated. Parekh noted that the company had to work extremely hard in the current environment to preserve asset quality and has consciously stayed away from funding riskier assets."

The foreign joint venture partner Munich Health Germany will pay Rs 294 crore to Apollo Hospitals Enterprise and Apollo Energy to support the transaction. Hence the total deal for Apollo Hospitals stood at Rs 1,630 crore (excluding employee portion).

Apollo Hospitals Enterprises itself will sell 9.96 percent stake for Rs 300 crore. The entire transaction will help Apollo Hospitals cut down its debt taken by pledging shares.

""Apollo Munich acquisition will help HDFC ERGO deepen health insurance presence. HDFC may utilise part of proceeds from Gruh Finance stake sale. Synergies and cost savings post-merger are key to improve profitability,"" CLSA said.

Promoters held 34.40 percent stake in Apollo Hospitals and of which 78.13 percent is pledged for loans.

Here are brokerages' views on Apollo Hospitals after the announcement of the deal:

Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,667 | Return: 23 percent

We have an overweight call on Apollo Hospitals with a target price at Rs 1,667 per share as the insurance stake sale is a major liquidity event and should help reduce the leverage.

Deal is in-line with management's guidance and should help the company in achieving target w.r.t pledge reduction.

Brokerage: Nomura | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,693 | Return: 25 percent

We have a buy rating on the stock with a target price at Rs 1,693 per share as total consideration to Apollo Group from Apollo Munich deal is Rs 1,630 crore.

Apollo promoter shall realise Rs 1,330 crore from Apollo Munich deal and outstanding pledge will reduce to 30 percent following the transaction.

Apollo Munich transaction is an incremental positive for Apollo Hospitals.

Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy

We have a buy rating on the stock as the deal is a good foundation in place and we expect continued ramp-up in FY20.

We estimate Navi Mumbai Hospital to clock revenue of Rs 250 crore in FY20 and its ramp-up will boost new hospital margin in FY20.

Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Hold | Target: Rs 1,250 | Return: -7.5 percent

The purchase of Apollo Munich will help HDFC scale up its general insurance, but the price paid for the deal is too high. The overall impact on corporation should be minuscule.

Valuing Apollo Munich at 3x FY19 book value will have a negative impact of Rs 4.60 per share for HDFC.

But in the case of Apollo Hospitals and the entire Group, the deal will aid in the reduction of pledge shares of promoters. The deal provides promoter Rs 1,330 crore in cash and will reduce the pledge by 40 percent.

We have a hold rating on Apollo Hospitals with a target price at Rs 1,250 per share.

Mortgage lender HDFC on June 19 announced that it will buy Apollo Hospitals Group's 50.8 percent share in Apollo Munich Health Insurance for Rs 1,336 crore. Subsequently, the standalone health insurer will be merged with HDFC ERGO General Insurance.

HDFC will also buy 0.4 percent stake held by a few employees for Rs 10.84 crore.

In a statement to the exchanges, HDFC said that the merger with its general insurance arm will create a strong health insurance franchise with

combined gross direct premium of Rs 10,807 crore.

The foreign joint venture partner Munich Health Germany will pay Rs 294 crore to Apollo Hospitals Enterprise and Apollo Energy to support the transaction.

""The merged insurance entity on a pro-forma basis has a

combined market share of 6.4 percent of non-life insurance industry, with 308 branches across the country. This also makes the combined entity the second largest private insurer in the accident & health segment with a market share of 8.2 percent,"" said HDFC in a release.

The proposed share acquisition will be subject to regulatory approvals by National Housing Bank (NHB), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) and Competition Commission of India (CCI). The subsequent merger of Apollo Munich with HDFC ERGO would be subject to approval of the shareholders, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), and final approval of IRDAI.

""Health insurance penetration in India is still at a very nascent stage compared to the global average, but is expected to drive growth of the general insurance industry in the times to come.

HDFC may offload 4.2 percent stake in Gruh Finance on June 14, according to CNBC-TV18.

The stake sale may be done at a floor price of Rs 290 per share. The base deal size is expected to be around three crore shares with an upsize option.

HDFC has been gradually paring stake in Gruh to meet RBI conditions for Bandhan Bank merger. The housing finance company recently sold 4.47 crore equity shares representing 6.10 percent of paid-up capital of Gruh.

Of the 4.47 crore shares sold, 1.22 crore were sold at an average price of Rs 260.07 on March 28 and 3.25 crore shares at Rs 310.126 per share on May 24.

""The Corporation being a shareholder of Gruh is entitled to 14.96 percent of post-amalgamation paid-up capital of Bandhan, based on the share exchange ratio. However, the RBI has directed the Corporation to hold 9.9 percent or less in Bandhan Bank post the merger. The sale reported under the disclosure is a part of said transaction,"" HDFC had said in an exchange release announcing the offloading of the stake in May.

The RBI had in March granted its approval for the proposed scheme of amalgamation between Gruh Finance and Bandhan Bank."

Shreesh Biradar

For Indians, the best way to earn returns on savings was either investing in real estate or buying gold. The millennials are changing trends in the last decade and mutual funds are more sought after to invest your savings.

If we look at mutual fund AUM data, in the last 17 years, the mutual fund industry has grown at an astounding 20 percent CAGR. Asset Management Companies (AMCs) have been riding the wave and have grown manifold. They make their money charging an expense ratio as a percentage of funds managed. The Total Expense Ratio (TER) charged includes management fees, taxes, brokerage etc.

A SEBI guideline for capping TER was put in place in 1996, which has been obsolete long back. The new SEBI guideline for capping fees went live from April 1, 2019. Mutual funds TER since then has seen a negative trend.

For the unknowns first, let's get to know what is TER.

What is TER? How Does It Differ in Direct and Regular Plans?

Total Expense Ratio aka TER means the cost incurred by a fund house to run a fund. It includes a management fee, legal fees, registrar fee, custodian fee, distributor fee, etc. The major part of the TER consists of management fee followed by distributor fee. The TER is calculated daily and will be deducted by AMCs on the same day, which means your NAV includes the impact of fees on your fund.

The TER working differs for direct and regular plans: Regular plans include a commission paid to a distributor (your bank, your broker or advisor) and direct plans do not (Direct TERs will always be lower than Regular).

For instance, the TER of a regular plan may be 1.25 percent, whereas the same fund direct plan will be lower (assume 0.85 percent). The differential of 0.40 percent goes out as the charges for the distributor.

SEBI Guideline Changes: A limit to the TER

More and more money is getting into mutual funds and SEBI is trying to streamline the mutual fund ecosystem. Last time, SEBI asked the fund houses to merge its various funds based on the philosophy and risk pattern of the investment. Post that, a concept called a TER cap has come into effect from April 1, 2019.

Below are the changes in TER slab based on the AUM of the fund.

The idea is: Expenses do not increase with an increase in AUM. Expenses will be higher for lower AUMs and will taper off as the size of fund increases. This capping has bought cheers to investors, while AMCs have been put on receiving end.

HDFC AMC – Data Shows a Serious Impact

A company can increase its underlying profitability in two ways, either it should be volume driven or margin driven. For mutual funds, it has always been volume driven (AUM), but there was some margin play as well. Now with SEBI guidelines coming into effect, the margins (fee part) will further contract and now the game becomes more of volume driven business.

The below chart shows the growth of fee income for the top five HDFC debt funds and equity funds for direct plans.

The growth in fee income for the last 10 months has been mainly because:

> increase in TERs and

> growth in AUMs.

If we look at the fee income for April 2019, there is a drop. This is mainly on account of lowering TERs owing to regulatory changes. The same has been echoed in TERs of HDFC mutual funds. We can expect lower topline growth for AMCs across the board on account of lowering TERs (unless AUM grows substantially).

For example, the TER of HDFC AMC’s direct plans in April 2019 is down by about 10 percent in the equity area, and 6.6 percent overall, compared to March 2019.

TER Increase – A Phenomenon That Has Been Curbed Since March

In the last few months, AMCs were slowly raising their TER, till March 2019. But since then, the SEBI rule has created a restriction.

The below chart for top 5 HDFC equity funds (direct plans) denotes the substantial drop in TERs post end of Mar-2019.

Funds like HDFC Equity fund and HDFC Hybrid Equity Fund saw a massive surge in TER since July-2018 by 47.4 bps and 63.2 bps respectively. Post March the TER dropped by 23.1 bps and 21.5 bps respectively.

The case has been true even to debt funds, where a slight increase or decrease in TER is carefully monitored unlike equity funds.

The most noticeable change is in HDFC Credit Risk Debt Fund. The increase of TER since June 2018 is at 42.4 bps, the fall after March 2018 is still lower at 18.9 bps.

Are the Distributors Going to Take a Cut?

For AMCs, the cut in fee income is going to be substantial. HDFC AMC has seen a cut of 6.6 percent in total fee income (before costs, versus March) This is despite AUM going up 6 percent in the month!

In direct plans, there is not much of an option, AMCs need to take the hit. In case of regular plans, AMCs might ask a distributor to take a cut in its fees to bring down the TER.

This might not help the AMCs in the longer run as distributors play a major role in fund flows to AMCs. If you cut fees distribution commissions too much, you’ll end up losing these distributors eventually.

The other way to work around is to do it in a sustainable way. For instance, assume a fund with an AUM of Rs 7,000 crore charges a TER of 2.00 percent on regular plan and 1.2 percent on the direct plan. Meaning 80 bps is the distributor charge. According to the SEBI guideline, TER should be at 1.50 percent for TER of that size. The AMC, in this case, might ask distributors to take a 30 bps cut and another 20 bps will be taken by AMCs. This will make direct plans TER at 1.00 percent and regular plan TER at 1.50 percent.

This structure does a few things:

> it cuts income for both distributors and AMCs

> It also disincentivizes larger schemes, where fees were not limited earlier. (compared to smaller schemes)

> It will help smaller AMCs as they might be able to provide more distributor commissions since the TER can be higher for smaller funds.

The View: Are Large AMCs Good Stocks?

HDFC AMC is listed on the exchange, and it’s been an investor darling (Versus the troubled RNAM – Reliance AMC). However, the company may see a decline in earnings on a sequential basis, largely because the TERs have fallen.

However, a lot of debt assets are now moving to the likes of HDFC given the woes of the debt markets. That might just be a saving grace for the company. Over the long term, this may not be a big deal in itself, as the base effect wears off over time. HDFC AMC is excellently managed, has very good RoE and like all HDFC companies, is quite expensive. This TER change is an immediate headwind, which will hurt returns in the June 2019 quarter, but the management is likely to work to make the profit impact lower.

On the risk side, this may just be the beginning of regulation in the mutual fund situation, and even HDFC AMC has received a show cause notice for its behaviour in the Zee-Essel promoter debt handling. That regulatory overhand may prove to be heavier than a one-time hit due to lower enforced TERs.

Notes:

> The above data is only for HDFC mutual funds direct plans

> TERs calculated above are daily average TER for the month.> AUM considered above is daily average AUM for the month.

With Narendra Modi-led NDA set to return to power, there are expectations that a stable government will take steps to fix dents in the economy, especially issues troubling NBFCs .

""Something needs to be done to revive the NBFC sector which is struggling. It provides funding to areas where banks cannot reach out to. There is a need to allay the fear of lending to NBFCs,"" Keki Mistry, Vice-Chairman and CEO, Housing and Development Finance Corporation, told Moneycontrol.

""Representatives from the Reserve Bank of India and the government need to meet to see what can be done to revive the sector,"" he added.

The NBFC sector has been grappling with funding issues as credit lines from banks froze due to the IL&FS mess. In the financial year ended March 2019, most banks had to fully provide for loans given to IL&FS as they slipped into the non-performing asset (NPA) category, impacting their bottom line dearly. Banks have therefore become cautious and are restricting lending to top quality borrowers.

""We have moved to an extremely stringent NPA recognition environment that has created fear among some of the banks, both for SME lending as well as NBFC lending,"" said Mistry.

""I think its an extremely decisive mandate which will give the NDA the ability to carry out a lot of reforms on an uninterrupted basis. The focus of the new government should be on boosting economic growth and job creation,"" he said.

He added that the construction sector creates jobs and supports core sectors in the economy like cement, power, steel and ancillary industries associated with housing."

Irate HDFC Bank customers are threatening to close their accounts with the bank after their response to a controversial post on Facebook written by an employee of HDFC Life. In the post, the employee talks about the possibility of holding a referendum in India to decide whether Muslims should be given citizenship.

The post by the HDFC Life employee was brought to light by Uzair Hasan Rizvi – a journalist with news agency AFP. He tagged HDFC's customer care handle on Twitter to register his protest.

In the tweet, he said, ""Hello @HDFCBank_Cares this person (name withheld) claims to work for @HDFCLIFE wants a referendum on religion. His post is both Islamophobic & Xenophobic His views reflect hatred, as a Muslim, I will have to think twice before using ur services. Ppl like him will be biased to me.""

Uzair has since protected access to his tweets.

HDFC's customer care handle responded to Rizvi’s tweet by acknowledging the post and confirming that the concerned person was their employee and said: ""Hi Uzair, a post has been brought to our attention on social media. We'd like to state that the person in question is an employee of our group company HDFC Life and that we have in turn brought it to their notice for appropriate action. As an organization, and as a group, we strongly condemn such divisive and insensitive comments /views.""

The post itself and the reply by HDFC have since put the cat among the pigeons.

Moneycontrol couldn't independently verify the original post on Facebook as the person's profile is inaccessible.

""At HDFC Life, we strongly condemn such divisive and insensitive comments/views. We have taken strict action against the individual for violating our code of conduct/social media policy and he has been suspended, pending investigation,"" said an official spokesperson of HDFC Life.

However, screenshots of the post in question have been doing rounds on Twitter and Facebook.

Supporters of the post are saying that the bank should not take any action against the employee as he is just exercising his freedom of expression.

You, sir, are a hypocrite. However distasteful, it's his opinion and he has expressed it on his social media account. Where is the freedom of expression?@HDFCLIFE would lost my respect if they take any action against the employee. Need to stand with him.

HDFC May 15 said it has partnered with India Mortgage Guarantee Corporation (IMGC) for a mortgage guarantee-backed home loan.

Mortgage guarantee is a financial product which compensates lending institutions for losses that may arise if a home owner defaults on a mortgage loan.

The risk of the home loan gets transferred from the bank/FIs to the mortgage guarantee company.

With this partnership, HDFC will be able to further penetrate home loan market and access an enlarged customer base, it said in a release.

It will help the company offer more loan to a home loan customer on an enhanced eligibility as also it helps customers to avail loans beyond their retirement period.

HDFC said the finer details of the product are being worked out and will be known to market soon.

""Mortgage-guarantee is already a popular product in international market and this partnership will help diversify our offerings to a wider segment of customers.

""This will also help us to support the government's mission under Prime Minister Awas Yojana Scheme to provide Housing for all by 2022,"" HDFC Managing Director Renu Sud Karnad said.

The partnership aims to address middle age-salaried customers, self employed customers and young salaried customers as also a wide segment of unserviced customers.

""We are witnessing great acceptance of our product in the Indian housing finance sector. We see stepped-up interest in using mortgage guarantee as an effective risk mitigant across lending categories,"" said Mahesh Misra, CEO, IMGC.

Mortgage guarantee or mortgage insurance as it is known in some markets, is well-established in the US, Australia, and Canada with market penetration of 15 per cent in the US and 22 per cent in Canada.

In India, mortgage guarantee is on the rise with market penetration between 5-20 per cent across lenders who are leveraging the product to grow their books, HDFC said."

ICICI Direct's research report on HDFC

HDFC reported loan growth of 13.1% YoY to Rs 406607 crore. Individual loan book which constitutes ~71% of the portfolio continue to grow at a healthy pace of 14.9% YoY at Rs 288819 crore. Growth in non-individual/ corporate portfolio slowed for 2nd consecutive quarter in a row to 8.4% YoY on back of unfavourable lending environment. Traction in individual loan book, after adding back loans sold in preceding 12 months came strong at 24% YoY.

Outlook

Given the business strength, we value the core/ standalone segment at 2.5x FY21E ABV. Rolling over to FY21E estimates, we revise our SOTP (15% discount) based target to Rs 2195/ share (earlier Rs 2050). However, given recent headwinds, we change our recommendation on the stock from BUY to HOLD.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC

Robust revenue (33% YoY), continued strong individual loan momentum (17% YoY) and GNPA decline lead to PAT beat at Rs28.2bn (PLe: Rs27.4bn). While core book positioning strength remains intact, overall loan growth at 12% for FY19 stood tepid; loan sell downs stood elevated at Rs 252bn with FY17-18 (Rs 64.5bn FY18) backlog flowing into FY19. NIMs at 3.3% stood higher than estimates on securitization income recognition on Rs 660mn, but stood 20bps lower QoQ as funding costs caught up. The affordable loan momentum with avg. monthly approvals stands healthy at Rs14bn as against slowing corporate loan growth at 7% (v/s 17% in Q1FY19). Sequential asset quality improved as GNPA declined 4bps QoQ, absolute GNPA still grew higher 18% YoY. While our loan growth (16-18%) and NIM (3.3-3.4%) estimates spell conservatism on account of market apprehensions (competition from PSBs, falling corporate loans traction on concerns), the same stand rightly offset with improving credit costs (~30bps) and GNPA estimates at 1.25-1.3% over FY20-21. Capital sufficiency (19%+), extra provisioning and superior asset quality prompt us to reiterate BUY.

Outlook

Our TP at Rs2,274 based on SOTP metrics values HDFC at 2.7x at Mar-21 PABV incorporating slight moderation in earnings of subsidiaries on account of anticipated subdued capital markets.

Asset quality was stable sequentially, with GS3 % at 1.41% (-3bp QoQ) AUM rose 4.7% QoQ/15% YoY to INR4.6t – growth continues to be driven by individual loans (+17% YoY to INR3.4t). Interestingly, despite ~4x jump in the quantum of loan assignments to INR250b in FY19, the upfront income on assignment was up by only ~60% YoY to INR8.6b in the year. Comparatively, core NII on loans jumped strongly by 11% QoQ to INR25.9b, driven primarily by lower interest expense (-1% QoQ, despite 3% QoQ increase in borrowings). The company hiked wholesale lending rates by average 65bp and retail lending by 20bp in 2HFY19. The borrowing mix remained unchanged sequentially. On a reported basis, spreads improved to 2.3% in FY19 from 2.26% in 9MFY19, implying a 20bp QoQ rise in spreads.

Outlook

The company is sitting with strong capitalization (Tier I 17.6%) – networth has doubled (to INR737b+) over FY17-19, helped by a capital raise of INR120b+, warrant conversion of INR55b+ and strong internal accruals. We largely maintain our estimates. Maintain Buy with an SOTP-based TP of INR2,330.

We witnessed a vertical fall in the Nifty last week after breaking below the level of 11,630. It fell more than expectations due to a decisive break down from 11,550.

All sectors closed about 2 percent lower except for FMCG and technology. Based on the broader formation of the market, it would now be a very tough task for Nifty to cross 11,760, before the outcome of election results.

On the other side, based on sell-off seen in stocks, which is nearly 80 percent of the previous up move, we could expect a sharp bounceback or a pullback from 11,200-11,150.

Of the total losses of 454 points over the previous week, 50 percent of it came from only five stocks and out of these five stocks, one stock has weight of 11 percent in the Nifty.

In the current week, we should study these stocks on charts on a weekly time frame.

Reliance Industries:

The most damaging stock was Reliance industries, which was down by 11.19 percent. It contributed 126 points to the entire erosion of 454 points seen in the Nifty for the week ended May 10.

Technically, as per line charts, it was sustaining comfortably above the level of Rs 1,275 since March 2019 for almost eight weeks; however, in the previous week, Reliance has wiped out all the gains and closed at Rs 1,251.

Such combinations result in either consolidation or lower top, lower bottom formation. For the week, it could find major support between Rs 1,250 and 1,200. A rebound could last up to a minimum Rs 1,320 and a maximum up to Rs 1,350.

HDFC Bank and HDFC:

HDFC twins have eroded 65 points jointly, which seems marginal; however, they impact the broader sentiment of the market. Investors and traders perceive it as “something wrong in the market” because long-term investor and positional traders are also worried.

However, recent erosion is still within the limit and further drop could lead to more worries. Technically, HDFC has major supports between Rs 1,880 and 1,860. On the higher side, Rs 1,970 and Rs 2,000 would be major hurdles.

ICICI Bank and Bajaj Finance:

The other two stocks, which have impacted the sentiment by nearly 50 points are ICICI Bank and Bajaj Finance. Technically, ICICI Bank is struggling to close above Rs 410.

Last week, ICICI Bank dropped below the level of Rs 380, however it managed to close at Rs 385. Further fall could be negative for the stock.

Finally, Bajaj Finance is exhibiting weakness and exhaustion on charts. Some more weakness is not ruled out up to Rs 2,850-2,800.

Fresh buying would emerge only if it is able to surpass Rs 3,200. Technically, it might attract selling pressure or liquidation of long positions at Rs 3,050/3,070 levels.

Housing finance company HDFC is scheduled to announce with its March quarter earnings on May 13.

Research and broking firm Motilal Oswal expects HDFC to report a net profit of Rs 2,374 crore. Net Sales are expected at Rs 2,900.3 crore, the report added.













The numbers are not comparable on a YoY basis as the company will be giving out results with a different accountancy standard (IndAS).











Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is likely to fall by 14.7 percent Y-o-Y (down 9.1 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs 2,595.3 crore.

According to a CNBC-TV18 Poll, net interest income is seen at Rs 3,079.3 crore against Rs 3,001.8 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. On the other hand, net profit is seen at Rs 2,576.2 crore against Rs 2,846.2 crore.

Emkay Global Financial Services expects HDFC’s loan growth to remain healthy at ~17 percent backed by increasing market share in individual loans. The trend in sanctions in the affordable housing segment will continue to be crucial for future growth trends.

Asset quality is likely to remain stable but management commentary on developer portfolio will be a key monitorable, it added.

Research firm Narnolia is of the view that NII is expected to grow at 9 percent QoQ in 4QFY19 driven by margin expansion. AUM growth is expected to still remain under pressure with 16 percent in 4QFY19 driven by individual segment.

NIM is expected to expand in 4QFY19, driven by fall in marginal cost of borrowing by 20-30 bps while Management has altogether taken 70 bps hike in PLR from April which will help in margin expansion. Other Income is expected to decline as dividend income from HDFCAMC has declined to Rs 12 dividend per share against Rs 16 last year, the research firm added.

Key things to watch:

Stability in NIM will be positive

AUM growth could come down to 14-15 percent

GNPA below 1.25 percent will be positive for the company"

Mortgage lender HDFC has put up crisis-hit Jet Airways' office space for sale with a reserve price of Rs 245 crore, as part of efforts to recover outstanding dues. Jet Airways, which temporarily shuttered operations on April 17, owes around Rs 414 crore to HDFC.

""The borrower (Jet Airways) has failed to repay the amount (Rs 414.80 crore) due to HDFC Ltd. Accordingly, HDFC Ltd has become entitled to enforce its mortgage over the immovable property,"" it said in a public notice.

The office, spread over 52,775 square feet carpet area, in Mumbai's suburban financial centre Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), is on the fourth floor of the building 'Jet Airways Godrej BKC'.

The e-auction of the office, with a reserve price of Rs 245 crore, is scheduled for May 15, according to the public notice.

The distressed airline, which had more than 120 planes in its fleet, has been grappling with financial woes. The full service carrier has defaulted on various payments, including salaries to employees.

As part of a resolution plan, State Bank of India-led consortium of domestic lenders have sought bids for stake sale in the airline.

Four entities -- Etihad Airways, TPG Capital, Indigo Partners and National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) -- are learnt to have shown interest in picking up stake in Jet Airways. The details of the bidders are expected to be known on Friday.

Earlier this week, a grouping of Jet Airways' pilots moved the Supreme Court seeking direction to the SBI to provide the assured interim finance for restarting operations.

The petition filed by the National Aviators' Guild has also sought a direction to the Centre and the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to disallow slots of Jet Airways to other airlines on the permanent basis."

"April 12, 2019 05:25 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mutual-funds/is-your-fmp-in-troubled-waters-3806921.html,"After Kotak Mutual fund, other fund houses may also delay payment of redemption amount to their FMP investors.

Fixed Maturity Plans or better known as FMPs are under the scanner after Kotak Mutual Fund told investors of Kotak FMP Series 127, which matured on April 8, that it may not be able to pay the entire redemption amount.

The fund house said it may face a delay in recovering its money that it had invested in the non-convertible debentures (NCD) of two of Essel Group companies, namely Edisons Utility Works Pvt Ltd and Konti Infrapower & Multiventures Pvt Ltd.

As a result, investors of this scheme have got most of their money back, but are yet to get some portion that is stuck in the two instruments, according to Kotak Mutual Fund.

FMPs of other fund houses that are coming up for maturity in the next two months which had invested in beleaguered Essel Group and IL&FS companies, too, are expected to either give the remaining money back to their investors and hope to pay the rest after recovery or roll over the FMPs for another year.

HDFC MF on Thursday announced the extension of its fixed maturity plan — Series 35 — a close-ended scheme due for maturity on April 15, by 380 days.

“The purpose of the roll over/extension is due to current interest rate scenario and portfolio positioning, the yields prevailing in the short maturity bucket present an option for investors to lock-in their investments at current prevailing yields,” HDFC Mutual Fund said.

According to the data from ACEMF, there are almost 100 schemes that have exposure to the beleaguered Essel and its group companies and IL&FS and its subsidiaries.

Total eight fund houses—ICICI Prudential, Reliance, HDFC, Adity Birla Sun Life, DSP,UTI, Kotak, DHFL Pramerica have exposure to distressed companies from Essel Group and IL&FS.

Of these, in 2019, 45 FMPs are coming up for maturity that have exposure to Essel Group and 11 FMPs that have investments in IL&FS.

The data reveals that four schemes of HDFC Mutual Fund, three schemes each of Kotak Mutual Fund and UTI Mutual Fund, and one schemes of DSP Mutual Fund are maturing in April 2019.

Similarly, two schemes of Kotak Mutual Fund are maturing in May 2019 and two fixed term plans of HDFC Mutual Fund, six schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund a 1099-day fixed term income fund from UTI Mutual Fund is maturing in June this year.

After the story was published, UTI Mutual Fund sent a clarification, ""UTI MF's debt exposure in IL&FS Group, in its FMPs pertains to the Infrastructure SPV i.e. Jorabat Shillong Expressway Ltd. which has held back payments pending NCLAT order,""

""UTI MF has already in appeal at NCLAT. The exposure is marginal and has been fully provided for. Therefore, this exposure will not have any impact on the NAV of these schemes on its maturity.""

The fund house also said it does not have any exposure to the Loan Against Shares (LAS) of Zee Group or any other promoter groups.

According to the data from Morningstar, as on December 2018 portfolios mutual fund houses had exposure worth Rs 8,002 crore in debt securities of Essel group companies.

Of which, Rs 1,673 crore was held by FMPs (Kotak AMC’s FMPs held around Rs 381 crore) and the balanced by open-ended schemes. A total of six fund houses had FMPs that invested in securities issued by Essel group companies.

WHY MONEY IS STUCK?

Since August 2018, debt mutual fund schemes have been found investing in securities that have faced several headwinds.

In August–September last year, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) default surfaced and a few of its subsidiaries’ debt instruments were downgraded on the back of weak financials and default in payment of interest and repayment of principal.

We need to wait and watch to know what action capital market watchdog takes on these fund houses.

The Embassy Office Parks REIT (real estate investment trust) issue raised around Rs 4,750 crore last week and on its listing on April 1 the unit jumped 6.3 percent on debut trade against the issue price of Rs 300.

""REITs are a good instrument class but not well understood here. Assets in REITs with assured yields and after three years there is an increase in rentals. Therefore, there is more value and more capital appreciation"" Parekh told reporters on the sidelines of the listing of the Embassy REIT on the NSE.

He said, REITs offer investors who are mostly HNIs, insurance firms and institutional investors, with guaranteed returns of 8-8.5 percent.

""I think the timing for this REIT was right with the good interest rate and pricing. Two-three of our clients are in talks with us to invest in them over the next couple of quarters. I think we will see more REITs being launched soon,"" Parekh added.

Talking about the response from foreign investors, he said, ""January-February have not been good for FPI investments as we saw outflows. However, March witnessed massive inflows mainly on the back of expectations that a stable government will be in power after the forthcoming polls. Investors don't want to miss the bus, it seems.""

He said there have been massive inflows to the tune of $7-8 billion in March. Because of the confidence among investors that feel that there will be a stable government and not a mixed up one with 10 parties,"" Parekh added.

He also explained that the renewed optimism on the domestic market arises from the fact that the US Fed has said it would not increase interest rates in the near-term which is a good sign for us.

""This is because of arbitrage gains as the interest rate gap between the US and India is huge. Also, the rupee has appreciated due to more inflows. This is a positive sign despite election uncertainty,"" Parekh said.

The issue of the country's first REIT was subscribed 2.57 times during its bidding process last month, helping the firm raise Rs 4,750 crore. The issue was in a price band of Rs 299-300 per unit.

REIT is an investment tool that owns and operates rent-yielding realty assets. It allows individual investors to make investment in this platform and earn income.

Embassy Office Parks, a joint venture of Blackstone and realty firm Embassy group, had last September filed the draft red herring prospectus with markets regulator SEBI to launch REIT, touted as Asia's largest in terms of portfolio size of 33 million sqft."

The HDFC Bank MD also backed the Narendra Modi government's endeavour to promote digitisation in the banking system asserting that it is one of the best things to have happened in India.

""The demonetisation was a good move by the Centre, though it had brought hardship to the people initially,"" he said in reply to a question at a press conference here.

Puri said the demonetisation has brought more money into the financial system which will boost economy on long-term basis.

In a sudden decision on November 8, 2016, Modi had banned the currency notes of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 denominations.

On the HDFC Bank's expansion plans in the Northeast, Puri said it proposed to open 100 more branches in the region in three years to take its branch network close to 230.

As a part of this plan, it would also double the number of branches in Sikkim to 18, the HDFC MD said.

He said that the HDFC Bank had started its journey in the Northeast in 2004, and has grown rapidly since then.

As of December 31, 2018 the bank has 126 branches and 203 ATMs in the region.

The expansion plan of the HDFC Bank network will get a further boost from the 650 Common Service Centres (CSCs) to be set up in the region by the Government of India.

The CSCs run by village-level entrepreneurs will bridge the last-mile connectivity in making banking products and services available to unbanked areas."

Gruh Finance, the affordable housing finance arm of HDFC, was taken over in January by Kolkata based Bandhan Bank in a share swap deal.

""RBI's approval had been sought for allotment of 14.9 percent stake of Bandhan Bank to HDFC post-merger. Though there is no apparent regulatory hurdle in this regard, this is the first case going through the RBI regulations of 2016,"" sources involved in the deal told PTI.

The deal will allow Bandhan Bank's promoter Bandhan Financial holding to come down to about 61 percent from about 82 percent, and HDFC to hold around 15 percent in the merged entity from about 57 percent in Gruh.

Meanwhile, Bandhan Bank has denied that it took control of Gruh in a costly deal.

""HDFC is not going to get any board berth and controlling premium in the deal,"" a top Bandhan Bank source said adding that analysts are not taking these factors into account

Moreover, both the companies (Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance) are listed entities and the swap ratio was determined by exchange traded prices on which no one has any control, he said.

The swap ratio for the amalgamation will be 568 shares of Bandhan Bank for every 1,000 shares of Gruh Finance."

Global research house CLSA stays bullish on HDFC Group stocks and expect 25-30 percent potential upside going ahead.

It has a buy rating on both HDFC as well as HDFC Bank with a price target at Rs 2,360 and Rs 2,730 apiece.

In the case of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), CLSA said housing demand is largely stable despite recent events in financial markets and the stock is among its top picks in the financial sector.

It sees scope for healthy growth and market share gains as peers consolidate. Return on equity of HDFC should expand as leverage is optimised, it feels.

In the case of HDFC Bank, the research house said, the NBFC crisis is largely behind, but consolidation could take another 1-2 years. The bank is pushing CASA growth via new channels, it added.

The succession planning is underway, but Managing Director, Aditya Puri can get an extension if the age limit is raised to 75 years, it said.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on expected lines changed its policy stance to 'neutral' from 'calibrated tightening' in its meeting on Thursday and also slashed repo rate by 25 bps.

Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility or LAF stands adjusted to 6.0 percent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.5 percent.

This was the first policy by the new RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, who also heads the monetary policy committee. The decision to change the monetary policy stance was unanimous. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from April 2 to 4, 2019.

“As liquidity pressures abate, borrowing rates and liquidity conditions are likely to improve. Sentimentally, it is a big positive for the broader market,” Vivek Ranjan Misra, Head of Fundamental Research, Karvy Stock Broking told Moneycontrol.

Experts advise investors to stay with sectors like banking, discretionary consumption, heavily indebted sectors like steel, power, real estate and infra which are likely to be key beneficiaries of the rate cut.

Jayant Manglik, President Religare Broking told Moneycontrol that top sectors which are likely to benefit from the monetary easing are infrastructure and real estate. The rate cut will not only help ease the interest/debt burden of companies in these sectors but also leads to demand push.

“Some of the companies to benefit include L&T, KEC International and Kalpataru Power Transmission. Among the real estate companies, Godrej Properties is expected to be a beneficiary,” he said.

Apart from that, stocks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Bajaj Finance, Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Voltas, and Whirlpool could attract investor attention.

Here is a list of top 12 rate-sensitive stocks which are likely to benefit the most from RBI's rate cut in February policy meeting:

Analyst: Vivek Ranjan Misra, Head of Fundamental Research, Karvy Stock Broking

Hero MotoCorp & TVS Motor Company:

Two-wheeler stocks like Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor are likely to be key beneficiaries. The fact that these two stocks are rural-focused and rely heavily on financing for their sales is a double positive for these stocks.

Given the rural focus of the Interim Budget and lower interest rates, it should bode well for the growth of these two companies.

Havells, Bajaj Electricals, Voltas, Bluestar & L&T:

Consumption-related stocks like Havells India, Bajaj Electricals, Voltas and Bluestar, too, shall benefit from a rate cut. Lower rates can also boost capex, thus we would look at stocks like Larsen & Toubro.

ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance:

Banks and NBFCs will also benefit from the change in the monetary policy stance. Among NBFCs, consumer finance-related stocks like Bajaj Finance will benefit as a rate cut would support their growth. Banks are likely to benefit, ICICI Bank is one name we would highlight.

Apart from supporting credit growth, a rate cut should aid their profitability as they would have to make lower provisions towards their employee benefit expenses.

Analyst: DK Aggarwal is Chairman & Managing Director of SMC Investments & Advisors

Asian Paints:

Asian Paints is India's leading paint company and ranked among the top ten decorative coatings companies in the world. The management expects Indian paints industry to grow at around 8-12 percent in the next few years and demand factors remain strong in terms of growth.

Operating margins are likely to improve in the longer term on commencement of the newer plants, lower logistics costs and production of high-margin water-based paints.

Coromandel International:

The company continues to invest towards infrastructure augmentation and capability development to offer a differentiated solution to the farming community.

Government's ambitious plan to double farm income by 2022 & fixation of the minimum support prices for crops brings out a sizeable opportunity for the company.

Also, the increase in prices of higher fertilizer-consuming crops such as paddy, soybean, and sugarcane augurs well for the company.

On the developmental front, the acquisition of the bio pesticides business of EID Parry would enhance the company's market presence in North America & Europe and push incremental revenues from the crop protection segment.

Indian Hotels:

With a strong presence in the high demand, high-occupancy micro markets of Mumbai, NCR, Bangalore, and Goa places it well to cater to rapid growth in the domestic market. Company's performance improved in the first six months of the ongoing financial year despite uncertainties.

Indian Hotels is in the process of selling some of its non-profitable properties internationally. It sold the Boston property and leased it back. The amount was used to pare debt.

Indian Hotels' debt nearly halved in the last few quarters and the company plans to reduce it further by 30 percent in the next few quarters.

Bajaj Auto:

The company has a diversified business model and a strong focus on profitable growth, widening reach in export markets and strategic alliances with global majors.

The management feels that the product mix in exports is deteriorating due to the higher share of Africa which is currently at 45 percent and is expected to increase to 50 percent. Nigeria contributes 50 percent of Africa's volumes.

In the export market, motorcycle growth is mainly driven by the Africa market. On the other hand, 3Ws growth is driven by new markets (contributing 25% of sales) such as the Philippines, Latin America, Iran, and Iraq. The company plans to increase annual capacity in 3Ws (including quadricycles) from 840,000 units to 1,000,000 units.

ICICI Bank:

Business performance of the bank such as domestic loan growth, overall corporate advances, retail loan growth, CASA ratio are continuously improving.

On the development front, it is increasing its presence across the country and working on fully leveraging existing resources and infrastructure. Further, it would also look at implementing additional cost optimization measures during the year, while growing its retail franchise.

"February 05, 2019 10:03 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/fiis-raised-stake-in-nearly-400-companies-in-december-quarter-do-you-own-any-3480201.html,"Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), which were net sellers in Indian markets both in equities as well as debt segment for the December quarter, raised stake in nearly 400 companies in the same period, data from Ace Equity showed.

Foreign investors raised stake in as many as 387 companies from previous quarter which includes HDFC, Bharat Financial Inclusion, Indiabulls Housing Finance, IndusInd Bank, Shriram Transport, Bharti Infratel, ZEE Entertainment and Hero MotoCorp.

Here is a list of top 20 stocks according to percentage holding from the list of 387 companies:

According to data from SEBI, foreign investors were net sellers in October 2018 but then poured money in the following two months i.e. November and December to the tune of Rs 21,000 crore. But, on net basis, FIIs were net sellers in December quarter in both equity and debt, selling assets worth approximately Rs 17,000 crore.

During 2018, they pulled out more than Rs 75,000 crore, including both debt and equity, data showed. FPIs were not just net sellers in India markets in 2018, but they pulled out money from other emerging markets also on the back of strengthening dollar and increasing yields in the US. Specifically for India, higher crude oil prices and fall in rupee added to FIIs' woes.

Despite recent selling by FIIs, analysts are hopeful that foreign investors will return as India still commands higher growth rate when compared to other emerging markets, and further fall in crude oil will only strengthen the macro case for India.

Piyush Goyal in the Interim Budget speech reiterated that India is poised to become a USD 5-trillion economy in the next five years and aspires to become a USD 10-trillion economy in the next 8 years thereafter.

Stating that India is solidly back on track and marching towards growth and prosperity, he said the last five years have seen India being universally recognised as a bright spot of the global economy, he said.

Last month, IMF in a report said that India will further build its lead as the world’s fastest-growing major economy as it picks up pace next year while the global economy is forecast to slow.

India’s GDP is forecast to expand 7.5 percent in FY20 and 7.7 percent in FY21. China’s growth is seen at 6.2 percent in both years. However, there is still election overhang which could mean that flows could remain tepid till some clarity emerges.

“The political arena is wide open and most political pundits have been talking about 3 likely outcomes. However, the markets may still prefer a stable government so that the economic reforms process is not dented. It would be presumptuous to imagine that India would be totally immune to a global slowdown,” Mayuresh Joshi, Fund Manager, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol in an interview in January.

“However, considering its low dependence on exports and a fairly large trade deficit, the slowdown should work in India’s favour. Any global slowdown is likely to hit oil prices and that would benefit India’s trade deficit. It must be also said that Indian markets may be best equipped to decouple from the global volatility in the medium term,” he said.

The IMF cut the global growth forecast from last October’s estimate. The global economy is projected to grow 3.5 percent in 2019 and 3.6 percent in 2020, 0.2 and 0.1 percentage points below last October’s projections.

FIIs reduced stake in 568 companies in the December quarter which include names like Axis Bank, KPIT Technologies, ICICI Bank, UPL, Cox & Kings, HDFC Bank, Tech Mahindra, NIIT Technologies, Yes Bank, Infosys, IDFC, MindTree, Cyient, M&M, RIL, Cipla etc. among others.

They kept their holding constant in as many as 384 companies in December quarter which include names like Tata Steel, Visa Steel, Globus Power, DFM Foods, Kirloskar Industries, Voltamp Transformers, Camson Bio Technologies etc. among others.

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC

HDFC reported PAT of INR21.1b in 3QFY19, 9% above our estimate of INR19.4b, led by NII beat, lower-than-expected opex and a lower tax rate. The company scaled back on the corporate lending business, while the retail lending business was largely unaffected. AUM grew 3% QoQ/15% YoY to INR4.4t, driven by growth of 18% YoY in retail lending and 8% YoY (slowest in past three years) in corporate lending. NII growth came in at a robust 26% YoY (v/s 15% AUM growth), driven by (a) stable spreads, (b) higher assignment income in the quarter and (c) lower leverage due to capital raise and warrant conversion. Reported spreads and margins were largely stable at 2.3% and 3.2%, respectively. Interestingly, calculated cost of funds remained unchanged on a sequential basis at 8.35%.

Outlook

Over the past nine months, HDFC has hiked its home loan rate by 60-70bp, resulting in improved profitability versus the past two years. While corporate loan growth has slowed down, we believe it is only cyclical and should revert to normal soon. We largely maintain our FY19/20 estimates. Maintain Buy with an SOTP-based TP of INR2,300.

Rally in financials and IT stocks, US Fed’s stance on interest rate hikes along with buying among index heavyweights propelled equity markets in India on Thursday. Additionally, investors bet on positive expectations from the Interim Budget 2019 as well.

The Sensex rose nearly 600 points, while the Nifty hit 10,800 in the afternoon trade. Buying was visible across all sectors, with maximum gains seen among banks, technology names as well as energy sector.

The likes of Infosys, GAIL and Kotak Mahindra Bank topped the gainers’ chart.

Here is a list of five factors that are fueling the rally.

Financials, IT stocks rally

Banking stocks have seen a surge during the day’s trade. The Bank Nifty index is up over a percent, and stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank and State Bank of India were trading higher by 1-3 percent.

Additionally, stocks in the technology space are soaring in trade, even as rupee showed some appreciation. The rupee touched 70 per US dollar intraday, but came back to 71 per US dollar levels.

The Nifty IT index surged over 1.5 percent with Infosys contributing the maximum gains. The stock rose over 3 percent, while other marquee IT names such as Tech Mahindra, NIIT Technologies, TCS, and Wipro gained between 1-3 percent.

US Federal Reserve stance

The markets reacted to a slight breather in the rate hike cycle by US Federal Reserve. The US central bank signaled that there could be some patience in the pace of hiking interest rates, amid fears of slowdown in US economy.

As it held interest rates steady, the US central bank also discarded its promises of “further gradual increases” in interest rates, and said it would be “patient” before making any further moves.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the case for rate increases had “weakened” in recent weeks, with neither rising inflation nor financial stability considered a risk, and “cross-currents” including slowing growth overseas and the self-inflicted wound of a federal government shutdown making the US outlook less certain.

“We are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong US macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross-currents. Common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity,” Powell told reporters after the end of a two-day policy meeting.

Nifty breaks above 10,800: back above 20, 50-days EMA

Indian market witnessed a breakout on the January expiry day and a day ahead of Interim Budget. The S&P BSE Sensex reclaimed 36,000 while the Nifty50 also went above 10,800 levels on intraday basis.

It is now trading well above its crucial short-term moving averages such as 20, 50, 5-days exponential moving averages. However, it is still below 200-days moving average placed at 10,840 on the daily charts.

The bounce back was largely on the back of short covering triggered by US Fed response to future trajectory of rates. The US Central Bank kept rates on hold and said that it will be patient in raising rates further amid global slowdown.

A close above 10,840-10,850 level on Thursday will open room for further upside towards 10,900-11,000 levels. But, February 1 being the Budget day, volatility cannot be ruled out.

“It looks prudent on the part of traders to remain on sideline till the events are cleared out of the way. Technically speaking, strength in indices can be expected on a close above 10756 levels where as weakness shall get accentuated further on a close below 10580 levels with an initial target placed around 10333,” Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Budget expectations

Ahead of the Interim Budget to be presented on February 1, 2019, investors are seen placing positive bet on the kind of reforms that could be announced. As such, the buzz of a possible full Budget instead of a vote on account could be played positively by traders in the market.

Additionally, President Ramnath Kovind, in his address to the Parliament, stressed on the government’s focus on doubling rural incomes as well as helping the farming community through various initiatives.

""...As the general elections are just around the corner, the interim budget is the last opportunity for the incumbent government to woo a larger section of the society. It is likely to be more than just a vote-of-account and for now, we expect some alterations to the expenditure schemes. While a package for farmers is almost a given after Mr. Jaitley’s statement to tackle specific agricultural challenges that “can’t afford to wait,” there are also hopes that the government may announce some relief measures on the direct tax front,"" Suhas Harinarayanan, Head-Institutional Equity Research at JM Financial Institutional Securities told Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand.

Index heavyweights see buying

The likes of HDFC twins, Reliance Industries, Infosys, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Tata Consultancy Services have witnessed intense buying.

These are index heavyweights and a rally in such names usually boosts equity benchmarks. Apart from Infosys, HDFC Bank and HDFC have surged 2-3 percent, while TCS is up over 1.5 percent.

ICICI Direct's research report on HDFC

Net interest income declined ~6% YoY to Rs 2685.6 crore, due to higher interest expenses. Margins declined ~10 bps QoQ to 3.2%, while spread remained broadly steady at 2.26% Overall credit growth came in slower compared to the previous run rate at 13.1% YoY to Rs 385520 crore, on the back of declining individual & corporate growth. Individual loan portfolio increased ~15% YoY to Rs 270972 crore and accounted for 70% of total loan book. Trajectory of corporate loans fell to single digit at 7.3% YoY Asset quality moderated slightly QoQ. GNPA ratio was at 1.22% (GNPA - ~Rs 4703 crore) vs. 1.13% in Q2FY19, led by slippages in developer loan book Non-performing loans in the non-individual portfolio rose 28 bps QoQ to 2.46% while individual portfolio stayed steady QoQ at 0.68% PAT came in lower at Rs 2113.8 crore vs. Rs 2467 crore in Q2FY19, down 14% on the back of lower NII & credit growth.

Outlook

HDFC Ltd, due to its superior fundamentals, commanded premium valuations compared to its peers. The company has maintained superior return ratios across economic cycles with RoA at ~2-2.5% & credit growth at 20% CAGR since FY07. Going ahead, we expect PAT of Rs 9344 crore in FY20E. With moderation in credit growth seen in the past quarter, we alter our loan estimates and expect 14.2% CAGR to Rs 467610 crore by FY20E. Other parameters such as NIM/spread and asset quality are expected to moderate, going ahead. We value the standalone business at 2.5x FY20E ABV. We maintain our SOTP (15% discount) based target price at Rs 2050/share. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock. With its leadership position intact in the housing finance space, in the current environment, we expect the company to be able to further gain market share and deliver a strong operating performance.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC

While the knowns in the form of higher base (listing gains from insurance biz:Q3FY18 & likewise from AMC listing: Q2FY19) dragged HDFC's PAT to Rs 21bn (PLe: 26bn), the miss came on account of lower than anticipated growth and elevated GNPAs (non-individual side). Subsequently, PPoP took a beating de-growing 61% YoY, however, low provisioning requirement supported the bottom-line. Loan growth of 17% YoY in individual loan book stood decent, but non-individual side slowed down for the quarter. Slight moderation in spreads both on individual and non-individual book as Q3 proves to be a dampener, reported NIMs stood healthy at 3.5% up from 3.3% a quarter ago given the timely PLR hikes. Incorporating market apprehensions, we envisage 16% loan growth for FY19 and 17-18% over FY20-21E, we tweak our credit costs and GNPA estimates moderately higher as we stand wary of the non-individual portfolio. These should have a bearing on RoAs and we reckon the same should move in the range of 2.2-2.3% over next two years. While superior track record and resilient balance sheet prompt us to reiterate BUY, we closely monitor the du-pont metrics for the non-individual business.

Outlook

Our TP at Rs2,266 based on SOTP metrics values HDFC at 2.7x at Sep-21 PABV.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) shares declined more than 1 percent in the morning on January 30 as brokerages remained positive on the stock but cut earnings estimates after third-quarter earnings

The stock was quoting at Rs 1,899, down Rs 19.80, or 1.03 percent on the BSE at 09:57 hours IST.

While maintaining buy call on the stock with a price target at Rs 2,360 apiece, CLSA said it has maintained stock among its top picks in the financial sector but lowered earnings estimates a bit to factor in a tad weaker topline.

The housing finance major has been gaining retail share but is cautious on corporate loans.

Credit Suisse also slashed its FY19 EPS estimates by 2 percent due to slower loan growth and fee income, though it retained outperform rating with a price target at Rs 2,150.

The research house said Q3 results were largely in line with estimates as HDFC remained better placed and has managed to maintain spreads.

Asset quality continued to see some pressure but individual NPAs are stable, it added.

HDFC's third-quarter profit fell 14 percent sequentially and 63 percent YoY to Rs 2,114 crore due to a high base.

Net interest income growth came in at a robust 26 percent YoY (versus 15 percent AUM growth), driven by (a) stable spreads, (b) higher assignment income in the quarter and (c) lower leverage due to capital raise and warrant conversion.

The company scaled back on the corporate lending business, while the retail lending business was largely unaffected. AUM grew 3 percent QoQ/15 percent YoY, driven by a growth of 18 percent YoY in retail lending and 8 percent YoY (slowest in past three years) in corporate lending.

Its provision for expected credit losses stood at Rs 116 crore for the quarter ended December 2018, narrowing compared to Rs 401.30 crore reported in September quarter and Rs 1,765 crore in the same period last year.

Asset quality slightly weakened in the quarter gone by as gross non-performing assets were higher at 1.22 percent against 1.13 percent at the end of September quarter.

Reported spreads and margins were largely stable at 2.3 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively. Interestingly, the calculated cost of funds remained unchanged on a sequentially at 8.35 percent.

While maintaining buy call on the stock with a target at Rs 2,300, Motilal Oswal said HDFC's retail loan growth is impressive, despite intense competition and a high base. The next few quarters would be even better, given easing competition due to liquidity issues, it added.

Over the past nine months, HDFC has hiked its home loan rate by 60-70bp, resulting in improved profitability versus the past two years.

While corporate loan growth has slowed down, the research house believes it is only cyclical and should revert to normal soon.

Japanese brokerage firm Nomura said overall results were mixed and valuations at 15.5x September 2020 book look reasonable.

The research house maintained buy call on the stock with a target at Rs 2,000 but corporate banks (private banks) are higher in its pecking order."

Neha DaveMoneycontrol Research

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), the largest housing finance company, reported net profit of Rs 2,114 crore in Q3 FY19 as compared to Rs 5300 crore in Q2 FY18 on the back of a healthy loan book growth and stable spreads.

The lender's performance in the current quarter is not comparable on a year-on-year (YoY) basis because in the same period last year (i.e Q2 FY18) the company had reported one –off gains of Rs 5,250 crore on listing its life insurance subsidiary.

Hence, after adjusting for exceptional items and one-time transactions (i.e. profit on sale of subsidiaries and consequent special additional provisions), the operating profit before provisions would have been Rs 2,984 crore for Q3 FY19 compared to Rs 2,352 crore in the previous year, representing a growth of 27 percent.

Loan growth and margin are the two key monitorables for HDFC. While the overall loan book growth slowed slightly, we aren’t too disappointed as it came on a very high base. More importantly, mortgage book growth after adding back loans sold was strong and faster than the industry. This is commendable as the housing finance space is going through turbulent times.

On the margin front, spreads continue to remain in a narrow range of 2.2-2.35 percent irrespective of the interest rate cycle.

Total lending book of HDFC stood at Rs 3,85,520 crore as of December-end, up 13 percent YoY. Growth in the total loan book after adding back loans sold in preceding 12 months was 19 percent YoY.

Individual loan book grew 14 percent YoY (24 percent after adding loans sold) and constitutes 70 percent of the total book. Non–individual book increased 9 percent.

Spreads in the overall book remained almost stable at 2.26 percent (individual book: 1.89 percent and non-individual book: 3.08 percent).

With gross non-performing loans at 1.22 percent, asset quality continues to be pristine. Non-performing loans in the individual portfolio stood at 0.68 percent while that of the non-individual portfolio increased to 2.46 percent in Q3 as compared to 2.18 percent in previous quarter.

The management's thrust on affordable housing segment continued as there was a strong traction in loans sanctioned to economically weaker section (EWS) and lower income group (LIG) segments.

We see HDFC benefiting of the liquidity shift towards strong and top quality names which will help it to continue to gain market share.

While the core mortgage business is on a stable growth trajectory, the financial conglomerate also stands to gain from equally strong performance of its subsidiaries.Follow @nehadave01

Rustomjee is expecting a sales revenue of Rs 5,800 crore from this 5.75 acre project, which is being developed in a join venture with the land owner, its CMD Boman R Irani told PTI.

Housing Development Finance Corporation has reported a 14 percent sequential degrowth in third quarter profit at Rs 2,114 crore and the same year-on-year basis fell 63 percent due to high base.

Profit growth in September quarter 2018 and December quarter 2017 was driven by the sale of a stake in HDFC AMC and HDFC Life Insurance through IPO.

Revenue from operations during the quarter increased 3 percent quarter-on-quarter and 20 percent year-on-year to Rs 10,450 crore, the housing finance major said in its filing.

HDFC said provision for expected credit losses stood at Rs 116 crore for the quarter ended December 2018, narrowing compared to Rs 401.30 crore reported in September quarter and Rs 1,765 crore in same period last year.

Numbers were slightly ahead of CNBC-TV18 poll expectations of Rs 2,086 crore for profit and Rs 10,138 crore for revenue for the quarter.

The company said tax expenses during the quarter at Rs 755 crore fell by 26 percent compared to Rs 1,022 crore in previous quarter, but increased 37 percent YoY.

Loan book stood at Rs 3.86 lakh crore as of December 2018 and net interest margin remained unchanged at 3.5 percent sequentially, said Keki Mistry, Chairman and CEO of HDFC while addressing press conference.

Housing finance major HDFC is likely to report a steep decline in its profit due to elevated provisions, lower capital gains & dividend income, and sharp fall in pre-provision operating profit. Likely subdued growth in NII may also hit bottomline.

According to brokerage houses, profitability is expected to decline by around 60 percent in Q3 compared to year-ago period and by over 10 percent, sequentially.

""Lower capital gains and dividend income (Rs 110 crore in Q3FY19 versus Rs 3,800 crore in Q3FY18) will likely lead to decline in net profit,"" Kotak Securities said.

Net interest income, the difference between earned and interest expended, may also see negative growth despite around 15-18 percent loan growth YoY with slight pressure in margin.

""We expect HDFC to deliver 15 percent YoY loan growth, lower than 17 percent in Q2FY19. An increase in incremental funding cost will lead to compression in calculated NIM to 2.48 percent in Q3FY19 from 2.57 percent in Q2FY19,"" Kotak Securities said.

Emkay expects HDFC's loan growth to remain healthy at around 18 percent backed by individual loans as well as developer funding. ""NIM pressure to remain relatively limited.""

""Disbursement growth is likely to be strong (taking advantage of weak competition) and we anticipate higher teens individual loan growth,"" Edelweiss Securities said, spreads are likely to be stable-to-marginally higher as company has hiked lending rates.

Bandhan Bank is set to acquire Gruh Finance, the affordable home loan subsidiary of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), via a $12 billion share swap, media reports suggest.

A formal announcement on the same could come as early as today evening or January 8, as per a report from The Times of India.

Sources quoted in a report by Mint said that the move is aimed at paring down Bandhan Bank’s founder and CEO Shekhar G's holding to 60.27 percent in line with the regulator’s banking licence rules and expanding its housing finance portfolio.

The rules require Bandhan Financial Holdings to halve its stake to 40 percent from 82.3 percent within three years of starting business. In September 2018, it had placed restrictions on the bank for failing to meet these rules by freezing branch expansion and Ghosh’s remuneration.

The report by Mint also says that shareholders of Gruh, in which HDFC holds 57.83 percent stake, will receive three shares of Bandhan Bank for every five shares held.

Reportedly HDFC may end up with 15.44 percent stake in the combined entity. The housing finance major may pare it down further by around 5.5 percent via share sale to a clutch of public institutional investors or in the secondary market before the merger gets regulatory approval.

This is to ensure it doesn’t fall out of line with RBI’s bank ownership norms, which does not allow the promoter of one bank to hold more than 10 percent in another bank as a promoter.

If the merger goes through, it will create a combined entity with a market value of over Rs 88,000 crore ($12 billion).

Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify the reports.

As per the TOI report, the deal process kicked off when Kolkata-based Bandhan Bank approached HDFC top brass exploring a merger with Gruh, adding that 10 days back, investment banks JM Financial and Arpwood were roped in to formalise the details and give their opinion on valuations."

Our target for Nifty for December 2019 is 14,000, Rajiv Ranjan Singh, CEO, Karvy Stock Broking said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Now that state election uncertainty is over where do you see markets heading?

Yes, as we have seen steady rollovers into December series, and positive news flow from G20 meet, especially trade war truce between the US and China, helping global markets to move on a stronger note.

With a slew of events such as US Fed meet outcome, RBI meeting lined up during December, indices are likely to be volatile. The Nifty is likely to trade in a broad range of 10,600-11,200 with a positive bias.

Do you think the pain in the mid and smallcaps is here to stay?

The mid and small-cap stocks tend to outperform when they are at a significant discount (at least 20 percent) to large-cap valuations, whereas they are at par now.

In the near to mid-term, we expect largecaps to perform better as mid and small-cap valuations are not yet favourable. Over the coming quarters, largecaps are likely to do better. The mid and smallcaps are likely to underperform until their valuations become attractive.

However, we believe that after mid-2019, with decent time correction, conditions may be favourable for mid and smallcaps to perform well.

After a muted 2018, what are your predictions for the year 2019?

We believe that a broad-based economic recovery is underway, and most importantly, capex spending is recovering. This should support corporate earnings and equity markets.

However, in the coming months, general elections remain an overhang. We believe that the formation of a business-friendly government would help drive the next rally in equities. Our target for Nifty for December 2019 is 14,000.

2019 strategy: Top five fundamental safe stocks which are good buys at current levels for a holding period of 1 year?

Our top 5 picks for one year are — HDFC, ICICI Bank, ITC, L&T, and Maruti.

Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in the year 2019?

Since we expect growth in the coming quarters to be led by capex spending, we favour cyclical sectors — banks, capital goods, autos and consumption.

Do you think rupee will continue to appreciate in the near term?

In the near term, the rally in INR is likely to reverse and we may see marginal depreciation towards 72. Oil prices are likely to appreciate to around USD 65/bbl in the near term which will be the driver for the currency market.

Any sector(s) which you think could turn out to a dark horse in 2019?

State-owned banks could be a dark horse in 2019 on account of the peak in NPL cycle, recovery in stressed assets via IBC, low valuations. A broad-based economic recovery will be supportive. Pharma could be a dark horse in 2019 as FDA issues fade, as well as cost competitiveness in global markets.

What should be the ideal strategy for investors for the next one year? How much (in terms of percentage) should be allocated towards equities, fixed income, gold etc.

We expect H2 of CY2019 to be good for equities and believe investors should be overweight equities, especially stocks that are geared to an economic recovery.

While the asset allocation depends on a number of factors like age and risk tolerance. On an average one could allocate 70% to equities, 20% to fixed income, 5% to gold and 5% to cash.

The Indian market rebounded in November after having corrected significantly in September and October. The bounceback helped Sensex reclaim 36,000 and pushed Nifty over 10,900, but there is still plenty of action that one can expect from individual stocks.

Half the stocks in the Nifty are trading below their 5-year average price/earnings multiple, which suggests there is still some value left in them.

Stocks that are trading below their 5-year average PE include Bajaj Finserv, HPCL, Eicher Motors, JSW Steel, Indiabulls Housing Finance, HCL Technologies, GAIL India, Infosys, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, Cipla, and NTPC, among others.

As many as 9 of these 25 stocks more than doubled investors' wealth in the last five years -- Yes Bank, HDFC, IOC, BPCL, Indiabulls Housing Finance, JSW Steel, Eicher Motors, HPCL, and Bajaj Finserv.

PE ratio or PE multiple is a widely-used valuation tool that helps in screening a stock on a relative basis.

The stock market has remained volatile for most of 2018, despite Nifty climbing to a record high of 11,760 earlier this year. The rise in the index was supported by a handful of stocks, as others lacked momentum.

Both Sensex and Nifty slipped after hitting record highs, but the pain was much worse in small and mid-cap indices, which saw double-digit falls from their respective highs.

The BSE Midcap index has slipped 17 percent this year, while the BSE Smallcap index has fallen 28 percent. In comparison, the Sensex is down just 7 percent from its 2018 high.

The Nifty recovered a bit in November, but only a few names were responsible for it. But it is a known truth that consolidation offers an opportunity to buy quality names that are currently trading below their 5-year average PE.

Generally, when a company is trading below its 5-year average PE, it is perceived to be undervalued. But to qualify as a stock worth buying, it should be backed by superiority in business fundamentals, experts suggest.

But, is the valuation methodology enough for investors to hit the buy button? Well, maybe not, suggest experts. The general rule is that when a stock is trading below its 5-year PE, it usually indicates sluggish movement in price, which is further linked to earnings potential.

“The PE multiple is a derivation of factors like earnings growth, operating margin, the fundamental outlook of the company prevailing in the market that decides a future prospectus,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“In general, it indicates the stock is not able to garner earnings potential or company is at bad phase on fundamentally. When there is no earnings visibility, investors will be unwilling to pay price or premium for such a company that in turn halts the stock price,” he said.

Rohira further added that to get a clear understanding, an investor should compare PE of a company with its peers. One should not take PE at its face value.

To make an investment call, it requires a holistic approach and disciplined study from investors which usually boils down to fundamental aspects of a company. Although, most of the stocks which are trading below their 5-year average have also corrected in double digits from their highs but investors should do their own research before pressing the buy button.

We believe PE should not be looked in isolation, Atish Matlawala, Sr Analyst, SSJ Finance & Securities said. A company with higher growth potential could see increase buying from investors which could in turn boost PE multiple of the stock, but the trouble is many of these companies may not grow at the same pace as they grew in the last five years, he explained.

“Sector like NBFC and auto may see their growth taper down as the cost of funds increases. Having said that there are few companies which we believe can give better returns in the medium to long-term perspective. These companies are HCL Technologies, Infosys, HDFC, Tata Steel and Vedanta,” Matlawala said.

He added that average PE will decline with declining growth prospects. It is therefore important to look at PEG ratio to make investment decisions. For the metal sector, one must look at EV/EBITDA ratio to select companies.

Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman and CEO of HDFC, spoke to CNBC-TV18 about the development.

""We got the approval from the Reserve Bank of India sometime back to look at the external commercial borrowing (ECB). Therefore, we are looking at various ways in which the money can be raised,"" Mistry said.

""We have still not zeroed down on any particular method,"" he added.

When asked whether the bond is due in 2018, Mistry said: ""A part of it may happen in 2018 and a part of it may happen in 2019; when I say 2018-2019, I mean calendar year.""

Talking about the cost difference between a dollar bond issuance and a masala bond, he said, “These are things which have to be evaluated.

Shares of HDFC were higher by over a percent on Friday morning as investors cheered the September quarter results.

Brokerages termed the performance to be in line with estimates, but believe that steady asset quality and loan spread bode well for the stock.

The housing finance company reported a healthy 24.71 percent on year growth in second quarter profit to Rs 2,467 crore, driven by income from stake sale in AMC business.

Profit in the year-ago period stood at Rs 1,978.2 crore.

Housing Development Finance Corporation earned profit of Rs 1,000 crore on sale of stake in HDFC AMC in quarter ended September 2018, against reported income on sale of investments of Rs 63 crore in same period last year.

HDFC AMC had raised Rs 2,800 crore through its IPO in last week of July. Founders HDFC as well as Standard Life Investments offloaded stake through this IPO.

Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 2,400

The global research firm said that the profit was slightly better than consensus. Further, it said that the profit was driven by lower net interest income and higher provisions. Overall gross NPL ratio moved lower QoQ to 1.13% from 1.18%, while the loan spread was stable at 2.28 percent.

Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Cut to Rs 2,025 from Rs 2,030

Jefferies has tweaked FY19-21 estimates by 0-4%. It is forecasting AUM CAGR of 18% & BVPS CAGR of 12.8% over FY18-21. Further, the margin was largely stable at 3.5 percent. Asset quality witnessed sequential improvement. Lastly, it said that the one time investment gain from stake sale in the asset management company business led to non-interest income spurting.

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Cut to Rs 2,150 from Rs 2,350

The brokerage house said that Q2 results were in-line with healthy AUM growth of 17% YoY. The profit aided by sale of 4% stake in HDFC AMC, it added. It also said that the company has been able to raise not just commercial papers but also long tenure funds. It has cut EPS estimate by 3-6% on margin pressure.

At 11:02 hrs Housing Development Finance Corporation was quoting at Rs 1,789.50, up Rs 27.80, or 1.58 percent, on the BSE. It touched an intraday high of Rs 1,799.00 and an intraday low of Rs 1,766.80."

Housing finance major HDFC is likely to report double-digit growth in net profit, net interest income and operating profit with healthy asset quality.

The stock, which is known to be a defensive, gained 3.5 percent year to date but corrected 8 percent during the quarter ended September 2018 due to weak market conditions after NBFC and HFC debt crisis.

HDFC is expected to report profit growth in the range of 12-29 percent on one-time stake sale in AMC and likely consistent strong growth in net interest income and operating income. Elevated provisions may limit some bottomline growth.

Axis Capital and Kotak Securities see the highest profit growth at 29 percent YoY while Emkay Research expects a 12 percent rise in bottomline.

""No major surprise on asset quality front and stake sale of AMC will result in one time gain,"" Axis Capital said.

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, is expected to grow in the range of 12-28 percent YoY on healthy loan growth and stable margin.

""Loan growth is likely to be healthy at 15-17 percent YoY with stable margin. Rise in cost of borrowings would be cushioned by a rise in lending rates,"" said Axis Capital which expects NII growth at 15 percent.

Emkay Research, which expects 12 percent growth in NII, said HDFC's loan growth may remain largely steady, but incrementally large part of growth is likely to come from non-individual loans. ""NIMs may remain largely stable. Trend in sanctions in the affordable housing segment will be crucial for future growth trends.""

Prabhudas Lilladher, which expects the maximum NII growth at 28 percent, said NIMs may improve with lower sequential base and stable yields on account of increase rates which should rightly offset cost pressure.

Motilal Oswal estimates AUM growth at 19 percent YoY, in line with the trend in the prior quarters. It expects pick-up in corporate loan growth to sustain.

Asset quality is expected to improve YoY as well as sequentially, brokerage houses said.

Asset quality has remained healthy over past several quarters, and the trend is likely to continue, Motilal Oswal said, adding that asset quality in the corporate loan book would be a key monitorable.

According to Prabhudas Lilladher, gross non-performing assets may fall 46 bps sequentially and 42 bps YoY to 0.72 percent.

Provisions may be elevated QoQ but brokerage houses do not see major concern from the same.

Motilal Oswal expects provisions at Rs 30 crore against Rs 19.7 crore in Q1FY19 and Rs 95 crore in Q2FY18 while Prabhudas Lilladher expects provisions to decline 1.1 percent YoY and increase 376.8 percent QoQ to Rs 93.9 crore in the quarter ended September 2018.

""We maintain higher provisions as reported Stage 3 have stood higher,"" Prabhudas Lilladher said.

Brokerage houses expect operating profit growth in the range of 10-27 percent YoY.

Key issues to watch out for

> Ind-AS impact on earnings

> Treasury management going forward

> Loan growth and uptick in corporate loans

> Movement in spreads and margins (on individual loans)"

Rupak DeBonanza Portfolio

The Nifty started the Wednesday session gap up, but it remained choppy through the day. The index formed a bullish ‘Hammer’ kind of pattern on daily charts on Wednesday which suggests the market is finding short-term support at current levels.

Pharma stocks were the worst performers whereas OMC stocks outperformed the benchmark index for the day. The volatility index (VIX) has witnessed a marginal fall of 0.84 percent during the day.

On the options front, 10,300 and 10,400 Calls added most open interest whereas 10,000 and 10,200 puts ended as most active.

Going forward, the Nifty is likely to consolidate within the range of 10,000 and 10,450. A decisive breakout on either side will confirm the future trend.

Breakdown of lower band of 10,100 may trigger a selling pressure which may take the index towards 9,800. On the other hand, 10500 may act as immediate resistance. A sustained trade above 10,500 may induce further rally towards 10,700.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 7-9% return in the November series:

RBL Bank: Buy| CMP: Rs.493.25 | Target Rs 537| Stop Loss Rs 468| Return 9%

SBI: Sell| CMP: Rs 255.70 | Target Rs 236.50 | Stop Loss Rs.266| Return 7.5%

On the daily chart, the price has breached its trendline support and witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakdown at 255.65. Moreover, the price is trading below its 50 & 21-DEMA which will act as a near-term resistance.

A bearish crossover with bearish range shift in the daily RSI (14) is being witnessed which may induce a negative shift in the stock price.

Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of 252-257.50 for the target of 236.50 with a stop loss above 266.

HDFC: Buy| CMP: Rs. 1741.45| Target: Rs 1890| Stop Loss Rs.1653| Return 9%

The stock after a steep correction has halted near its trendline support on the daily timeline which acted as a support in the previous two occasions.

In the candlestick pattern, the stock has formed a bullish Engulfing on the daily charts near its bottom which has revived hopes for the bulls to move ahead.

Weak global cues led to a 1000-point cut in the S&P BSE Sensex in opening trade on Thursday which pushed the index below its crucial psychological support at 34,000.

In fact, the last three months have been volatile for Indian markets. After hitting a peak in August 2018, benchmark indices have declined by over 10 percent since then.

Analysts have attributed the sudden fall in markets largely to depreciation in Rupee and the rise in the oil prices, which have an impact on the growth-inflation mix.

Apart from that, looming fears of a trade war and the strong dollar which could push global asset managers to take money out of riskier assets and put in treasure is also keeping sentiment subdued.

Although it is difficult to predict the bottom of the market, analysts feel that the recovery is on its way. String commentary from IMF released earlier this week adds to the positive sentiment. Investors are advised to stay with value picks.

“Positive macro environment leads us to believe that equity markets are not heading towards a major crash. However, we believe that we are in midst of a correction which is a part of equities as markets tend to overshoot or undershoot fundamentals,” Karvy Stock Broking said in a report.

“While it is hazardous to predict where the equity markets would bottom, we can say that market could decline by another 5 percent or so. Post that, the markets could potentially stabilize and rally, we expect that Sensex will end calendar year 2018 at 37,500 and end calendar year 2019 at 45,000,” it said.

After a blockbuster performance seen last year, the current scenario is completely opposite to the situation last year. Strong macros and weak micros (corporate earnings) is turning into a scenario of weakening macro variables and stronger micros.

But, volatility is something which traders can use to their advantage. Use the dips in the market to accumulate or buy into quality stocks.

“The scenario has completely changed as to what we saw last year. The transition along with global uncertainties is resulting in a readjustment in debt and equity markets. Accordingly, equity investors also need to tweak their portfolios,” said a Sharekhan report.

“Finally, markets do test conviction. That’s the reason why many tend to book permanent loss in a temporary correction while others use the temporary correction for permanent wealth creation.

The choice is entirely in your hands,” it said.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks which could offer 20-100% return in the next 12 months:

Adani Ports: Buy| LTP: 318| Target: Rs 458| Return 44%

Karvy Stock Broking maintained its buy rating on Adani Ports (APSEZ) which is also India’s largest Commercial ports operator. APSEZ is consistently delivering growth with gaining market share (14.8% to 15.2% as on FY18).

Total cargo volumes grew by 7 percent for FY18 to 180 MMT while all India cargo grew by 4 percent. The container volume has also grown across all ports. Going forward, a healthy growth of container and cargo volumes coming in from the expansion plans are the key positives.

The stock is currently trading at 14.3x, and the consensus values the company at 19.9x for a target price of Rs. 458.

Hero MotoCorp: Buy| LTP: Rs 2883| Target: Rs 3732| Return 29%

Karvy Stock Broking maintained its buy rating on Hero MotoCorp with a target price of Rs 3732 on the back of pick up in rural demand and well as multiple launches planned in the near-term.

The company is planning to formally launch multiple models in scooter and premium bike category in the near-term. This includes a premium Bike (Xtreme 200cc) and a Scooter (125cc). These two models are likely to be launched in domestic as well as the international market.

The company expects to garner higher volumes especially in scooter segment from these new models in the upcoming year. The company reported 14 percent volume growth in FY18. The company generates ~40 percent of its two wheeler volumes from rural areas.

Karvy anticipates demand for two-wheelers from a smaller town and rural areas to improve in the medium term on account of healthy rise in income driven by the normal monsoon leading to better crop production.

HPCL: Buy| LTP: Rs 171| Target: Rs 368| Return 115%

Karvy Stock Broking maintained its buy rating on HPCL with a target price of Rs 368. In FY18, strong operating performance was observed in the company’s refining and marketing business. HPCL has improved its refinery & pipeline infrastructure to keep in line with growing demand vis-à-vis capacity additions and product flow improvements.

Although there was a rise in the share of sour and heavy crude used, efforts made by HPCL over the past 6 years, have resulted in increasing distillate yield of HSD and total yield distillate by 6.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. HPCL’s core GRM of 39 percent on a YoY basis has surpassed the benchmark GRM of 25 percent YoY despite increasing crude oil prices in FY18.

HDFC: Buy| LTP: Rs 1713| Target: Rs 2201| Return 28%

Karvy Stock Broking maintained its buy rating on HDFC with a target price of Rs 2201, supported by healthy AUM growth and stable net interest margins (NIMs).

AUM has continued traction with the growth of 18 percent for another quarter. Growth is similar across an individual as well as a non-individual segment.

Individual loans, including loans sold over last year, has grown by 25 percent. Spreads are stable on a sequential as well as a YoY basis at 2.3 percent. The net interest margins (NIMs) have improved by 10 bps on a YoY basis to 3.5 percent.

HDFC has consistently met the expectations of the market in terms of consistent growth along with stable margins and stable asset quality. It is the best proxy to play on Mortgage business along with Banking, Insurance, and AMC through its subsidiaries. Value unlocking in subsidiaries such as HDFC AMC should support the valuation.

ICICI Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 306.10| Target: Rs 450| Return 47%

Karvy Stock Broking maintained its buy rating on ICICI Bank with a target price of Rs 450 supported by stability in net interest margins (NIMs), stable asset quality as well as attractive valuations after the recent correction.

The brokerage firms also believes that ICICI Bank has already recognized a large portion of stress reflected in (1) gradual reduction in impaired loans (including watch-list and other stress pool) which peaked in FY16 and watch-list now at 90 bps of loans (2) reducing BB and below rated pool and (3) SEC filings.

Karvy maintained strong “buy” on the stock with target price of Rs. 450 valuing subsidiaries at Rs. 100 per share and core banking book at 2.0x FY20 P/B.

L&T: Buy| LTP: Rs 1221| Target: Rs 1606| Return 31%

Karvy Stock Broking maintained its buy rating on L&T with a target price of Rs 1606. L&T’s outstanding order book at the end of June 2018 stood at Rs. 2717 Bn (37% growth Vs Q1FY18) from diversified sectors while the order inflow for Q1FY19 stood at Rs. 361 Bn (3% growth Vs Q1FY18).

L&T’s diversified exposure to various sectors/geographies coupled with its excellent execution capabilities across sectors and its balance sheet strength compared to other peers in the sector has resulted in strong order book build up.

M&M: Buy| LTP: Rs 763| Target: Rs 1081| Return 41%

Karvy Stock Broking maintained its buy rating on M&M with a target price of Rs 1081 banking on new UV launches as well as robust growth seen in the tractor division.

The company plans to launch new UV models in the next 4-5 months. At the same time, it anticipates tractor industry to grow by 12-14% in FY19.

Therefore, Karvy believes M&M’s earnings and stock performance is likely to be directly influenced by the success of its new launches in UV segment and tractor industry growth in upcoming months.

Given its current low base in UV segment (~18K volumes per month), any of the new model becoming a success could easily add significant growth to its UV portfolio.

State Bank of India: Buy| LTP: Rs 262| Target: Rs 347| Return 32%

Karvy Stock Broking maintained its buy rating on SBI with a target price of Rs 347 supported by growth in retail business as well as recoveries seen in the bad loan portfolio.

For the quarter, SBI gross advances witnessed a growth of 5.49 percent YoY to Rs. 19, 90,172 Cr, with domestic advances growth of 7.21 percent YoY to Rs. 17, 23,443 crore as on June 18.

The bankruptcy process will lead to some recoveries. Karvy is of the view that the bank is likely to see one or two fairly big recoveries from these bad loans. The bank is confident about its power sector NPLs, which are going through the Samadhan scheme.

Some of these loans could get resolved during this quarter – that would not change provisioning requirements but would help in reducing the stock of bad loans at an aggressive pace.

Apollo Tyres: Buy| LTP: 202| Target: Rs 280| Return 38%

Sharekhan maintained its buy rating on Apollo Tyres with a target price of Rs 280. The company is set to clock a strong 17 percent CAGR in topline over FY2018 to FY2020 on robust domestic demand and capacity ramp up in Europe.

Ability to take price hikes amid rising raw material costs to sustain margins at 11.5-12%. With 26 percent earnings CAGR over the next two years, Apollo is likely to be the fastest growing tyre company.

Apollo remains our preferred pick in the tyre space. Sharp correction of 24 percent in the past two months offers a good entry point.

Relaxo Footwear: Buy| LTP: Rs 693| Target: Rs 913| Return 31%

Sharekhan maintained its buy rating on Relaxo Footwear with a target price of Rs 913. Increased presence in South India and consumer shift from mass to mid-range product segment would help Relaxo Footwears (Relaxo) report strong double-digit revenue growth.

Rising rubber prices to put pressure on margins in the coming quarters; increased contribution from premium products and gradual price hikes (in-line with competitive action) to support margins in FY2020 (marginally reduced estimates by 4.2%/2.7% for FY2019/FY2020 to factor in higher rubber prices).

Relaxo’s stock price has corrected from its high by 13 percent, in-line with correction in broader indices. The stock remains our preferred pick in the discretionary space due to double-digit earnings visibility in the near term.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

Looking at the recent correction seen in India markets, analysts at Citigroup advise investors to stay with defensive names and with stocks which have earnings visibility for some more time.

The global investment bank, which maintains its Sensex target of 37,300 for March 2019, has removed Yes Bank from its model portfolio post the recent downgrade and added Coal India.

Citigroup feels that volatility could remain a concern in the near term, given high valuations and risks of some moderation in growth in certain segments. Domestic flows have been a big support, but it will be interesting to see if the trend continues.

Citigroup highlights top 10 stock ideas which could give decent risk-to-reward to investors:

Ambuja Cements:

Citigroup expects cement prices to rise over the medium term as M&A activity slows. Additionally, there is a shift in Ambuja’s strategy to focus on profitable growth even though the merger with ACC has been delayed, added the report.

The view is based on 1) strong volume growth since 2017, 2) limestone mines acquisition, 3) plans to commission new clinker capacity and 4) cost focus.

Lafarge’s global strategy includes utilising the best asset base to grow faster than the market, and more investments in growth plus markets (India could benefit). Current valuations provide an attractive entry point.

Coal India (CIL):

CIL’s current valuation are 1-SD below mean and offers a 7 percent dividend yield. Citigroup is constructive on 1) e-auction price support, 2) realization upside from linkage auctions, 3) strong volume growth and 4) limited cost pressures (wage negotiations concluded in FY18).

HDFC:

Citigroup believes that HDFC Ltd will maintain its strong earnings momentum with healthy AuM growth and relatively stable spreads backed by a strong funding franchise.

The company has maintained its spreads in the narrow range of 2.20-2.35 percent over a long period of time irrespective of the interest rate environment. It has a well-balanced ALM profile and is adequately capitalized.

ICICI Bank:

ICICI Bank has been focusing on addressing their corporate asset quality issues which have led to higher slippages/NPA in the past.

The bank is well positioned to leverage its strong liability and retail lending franchise with retail now constituting 58 percent of the total loan book and CASA ratio at 51 percent.

The share of the overseas business, which is lower yielding, continues to decline. With NPA recognition in the last leg, the focus will shift to recoveries and core growth/profitability.

ITC:

ITC is a key holding in the consumer space in our view - positive trends in the key cigarette business, i.e. continued positive volumes are a near-term catalyst, coupled with a stable mix.

This should drive 11% EPS CAGR and 17 percent FCF CAGR respectively over FY18-20E. Valuation discount is compelling vs. peer group. ITC is perhaps the only major consumer stock trading in-line with its last 5 year historical average of 28x 1-year forward P/E.

Maruti Suzuki India:

For the overall Indian PV industry, we expect 10/11% YoY growth in FY19/20 respectively. Maruti should continue to gain market share, given a strong product portfolio. Citigroup expects domestic volume growth rates of 13/12% YoY over FY19/20 respectively.

Currently, the stock is trading at ~12.4x 1-year forward EV/EBITDA, which is close +1 SD above mean but a significant pullback from recent highs of 18x.

While there could be near-term risks to earnings given the way currencies have moved, it does seem adequately priced into the recent stock price moves.

NTPC:

NTPC trades at 10.9x P/E and 1.2x P/BV FY20E. The stock trades 1 standard deviation below historical (since January 2005) mean on both parameters.

Commenting on the business outlook, Citigroup said that Coal related under-recoveries have been more or less resolved from July 2018. Logistical issues faced by NTPC for domestic coal transportation have eased after it signed a MoU with the Indian Railways in Apr18 and paid ~Rs50bn advance towards haulage charges.

NTPC is targeting capacity addition and commercialization of ~4.8GW in FY19E and 4-5GW addition in FY20E. Over the next 3-4 years, capitalization should exceed capex implying RoE expansion as equity invested in under-construction projects starts earning returns.

Petronet LNG:

Petronet LNG is a key beneficiary of India’s rising LNG imports, and its capacity expansion is well timed against this backdrop.

With 90 percent of the post-expansion Dahej capacity already tied up under long-term take-or-pay / use-or-pay contracts and given the significant capital efficiency & scale benefits associated with successive brownfield expansions at the facility, the company offers strong volume and earnings visibility notwithstanding the start-up of new terminals.

Sun TV:

Citigroup thinks that the stock price correction on a YTD basis is overdone and the current valuations at 15x FY20E EPS are attractive, pricing in most concerns. Earnings delivery is expected to be healthy as ad momentum sustains.

Tamil Nadu digitalization boosts domestic subscription revenues (~Rs3.8bn additional revenues by FY20E). The global investment bank estimates 13%/19% consolidated revenue / EPS CAGR over FY18-20E.

UPL:

Citigroup expects 13 percent revenue CAGR with 140bps of improvement in margin over FY18-20E (without incorporating the recent Arysta acquisition), largely driven by higher volumes and market share, the introduction of more proprietary products and better cost efficiencies.

The India season was good and early signs from Latin America (largest market) are encouraging as well, pointing to good earnings momentum over the rest of FY19.

The global investment bank believes UPL’s well-diversified business model is resilient to transient market disruptions and would allow it to consistently grow ahead of the market.

Are you scared because you own non-banking finance company stocks (NBFCs) in your portfolio? Or, are you looking to invest money in NBFCs which are now trading at attractive valuations?

Well, experts feel that the pain in NBFC stocks is likely to continue in the near term and any corrections in some of the stocks are a golden opportunity to buy.

As many as 60 stocks in the NBFC space have fallen up to 50 percent so far in September which includes names like Dewan Housing Finance (down 47 percent), followed by Reliance Capital (down 28%), and Bajaj Finance (down 16 percent).

The recent correction on the back of debt market liquidity concerns prompts the analyst community to review a few strong NBFCs.

Several factors including business tailwinds, robust operating models catering to the retail segment and parental support provide comfort to banks/debt markets and ensure that liquidity remains strong; stress, if any, remains only to near-term net interest margin (NIM), suggest experts.

“We don’t find liquidity risk to any of the NBFCs under-coverage due to factors discussed above. However, the risk-averse stance of debt markets will likely lead to higher funding costs in the near-term,” Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.

“We are building NIM compression into our forecasts, though we do not rule out any near-term risk due to vagaries in the bond market. However, supported by our thesis of strong fundamentals and business trends of NBFCs under coverage, we prefer to look beyond near-term volatility and find value gradually building up in select stocks,” it said.

Experts feel that well-run NBFCs with proven business models across cycles and those focusing on the retail segment that have generally lower credit and concentration risks may be less affected.

Kotak highlights NBFCs which have strong parentage i.e. sovereign/ large financial institutions like LIC Housing Finance, PFC and REC and business houses like Aditya Birla Finance, Bajaj Finance, Cholamandalam, Mahindra Finance, will continue to earn support from debt markets and banks.

Kotak Institutional Equities lists top 7 stocks which are still a great buy at current levels and even on declines:

HDFC: Retain ADD| LTP: Rs 1835| Target: Rs 2,020| Return 10%

HDFC is a large borrower in the bond market with 54 percent borrowings from NCDs and CP, however, overall investor comfort on HDFC will ensure liquidity for the company.

Besides, the company has a dynamic deposit mobilization program which can be scaled up if the debt market fund dries up (as seen in FY2008).

The company had a surplus 15 percent in the one-year bucket in March 2018. Nevertheless, we cut our estimates by 2 percent to reflect lower NIM. HDFC’s core business will trade at 2.8X FY2020E book. Our investment thesis on subsidiaries remains unchanged.

LIC Housing Finance: Upgrade to buy| LTP: Rs 438|Target: Rs580| Return 32%

LIC Housing Finance has the highest dependence on the bond market at 87% of total borrowings. However, comfort in its strong parentage ensures steady funding availability for the company. In fact, PSU banks prefer lending to LIC over other private NBFCs during the period of crises.

However, marginal spreads are currently thin and the company will need to raise home loan rates over the next few weeks. We build NIM compression into our estimates (EPS down 3-5%) but don’t rule out further near-term downside risk.

The company saw a 54% deficit in the first bucket in March 2018, lower than 100%+ deficit in the first bucket during the previous few years. According to the management, high prepayments in home loans help in managing liquidity and hence it keeps the deficit in the first bucket.

However, current valuations (1.3X FY2020E book) factor in the aforesaid risk if one looks at the medium-term. A large retail book (79% home loans and 16% LAP) provides comfort.

L&T Finance Holdings: Retain ADD| LTP: Rs 140| Target: Rs165| Return 17%

Tailwinds in rural business, cleaner book post-write-offs in the wholesale book will drive 18-19% RoE over the medium-term. At the target of Rs160, the lending business will trade at 2.2X book FY2020E.

Reduction in TP from Rs190 reflects a lower multiple for the lending business on the back of an increase in the cost of equity. Its exposure to NCDs is high at 45 percent; however, its parentage provides comfort to debt investors.

Magma Fincorp: Buy| LTP: Rs 126| Target: Rs 165| Target: Rs 31%

We continue to believe that recent operational changes under the new management will boost the profitability of Magma over the next two years, even as loan growth may remain muted in the near-term.

We expect the company to deliver medium-term RoE of about 15 percent. Our revision in the target to Rs165 from Rs200 reflects a higher cost of equity. Being a smaller NBFC, the company is a bit more vulnerable to vagaries in debt market but a lower bond market exposure (23% of total) provides comfort.

Mahindra Finance: Upgrade to ADD| LTP: Rs 411| Target: Rs 450| Return 10%

The rural cycle remains strong. Strong rural cash flows will boost the near-term growth of Mahindra Finance even as NIM may remain under pressure due to competition from banks and NBFCs like L&T Finance.

Its exposure to NCD is 44 percent and CP is high at 16 percent. From a liquidity point of view, the Mahindra Group provides comfort; the company is running positive ALM in the first two buckets.

We expect the company to deliver 16-17 percent medium-term RoE and 21 percent EPS CAGR during FY2020E-21E. At our RGM-based TP, the stock will trade at 2.1X FY2020E book; we add Rs65 as the value of the subsidiaries. Our earnings are keenly sensitive to government spending in rural areas.

Shriram City Union Finance (SCUF): Retain ADD| LTP: Rs 1820| Target: Rs 2120| Return 16%

We believe that SCUF has a strong franchise of lending at the lower-end of the market. Improving growth in business loans will drive 21 percent loan book CAGR and 27 percent EPS CAGR during FY2019-21E. We expect near-term RoA to remain strong at 3 percent and RoE moderate at 16-17 percent.

Shriram Transport Finance: Upgrade to Buy from ADD| LTP: Rs 1161| Target: Rs 1550| Return 33%

Shriram Transport Finance trades at 1.6X book FY2020E. We expect the company to deliver 17-18 percent medium-term RoE. We expect CV sales to moderate hereon, though we note that loan growth will remain strong at 17-18 percent during FY2019-21E on the back of a strong business in used CVs.

Increase in axel load norms will partially offset the pressure of higher fuel prices and augur well for asset quality performance even as NIMs in CV business remains under pressure. As on March 2018, the company has a negative ALM gap in 1HFY19, which is fully covered in 2HFY19.

Increasing competition from banks and the organized sector over the medium term poses a key risk. Besides, its large size and limited segments of operations is a concern. However, these risks are reflected in current valuations, in our view.

"September 24, 2018 04:52 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-stays-in-red-nifty-breaks-11000-five-reasons-why-stocks-are-taking-a-hit-2979011.html,"The market continued to reel under selling pressure on Monday. Liquidity crunch fears, consistent selling by FIIs, rupee volatility, rising crude oil prices and trade war tensions weighed on sentiment.

The Nifty has broken psychological 11,000 levels, falling 175.70 points or 1.58 percent to 10,967.40. The 30-share BSE Sensex dropped 536.58 points or 1.46 percent to 36,305.02.

""We usually see such volatile moves prior to the market bottom or top but it's too early to confirm the same,"" Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking said.

He advised traders should restrict leveraged positions, and in the meanwhile, prefer only hedged trades.

Investors, on the other hand, can start accumulating fundamentally sound counters on dips with medium to long-term view, he said.

Here are five factors that are dragging the market:

NBFC Debt Crisis

Nifty Financial Service index fell 2 percent which indicated that fears of liquidity crunch have not abated yet.

Stocks like Indiabulls Housing Finance, Bajaj Finance, M&M Financial etc. fell 5-7 percent. In addition, the country's largest housing company HDFC itself lost 6 percent, but DHFL recovered recovered some Friday's losses to close 12 percent higher. On Friday, DHFL lost 42 percent.

DHFL clarified that it has not defaulted on any bonds or repayment nor has there been any single instance of delay on any of its repayment of any liability, which boosted sentiment.

Redemption pressure forced DSP Mutual Fund recently to sell commercial paper of DHFL worth Rs 200-300 crore, which raised fears of liquidity crunch in the NBFCs. On top of that, expected interest rate hike may also be pressured NBFCs as most of them are wholesale funded companies.

DSP MF also have some exposure to IL&FS Group which defaulted on interest rate payments. This added more fuel to the fire and made investors worried.

Seeking to calm the nerves of worried investors, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said today that the government would take all measures to ensure adequate liquidity for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and mutual funds.

RBI and capital market regulator SEBI on Sunday said they were closely monitoring the developments in the financial sector and were ready to take ""appropriate actions"" to calm the jittery investors.

Crude Oil Prices

Crude oil prices increased sharply as US markets tightened just weeks ahead of Washington's plan to impose new sanctions against Iran with will be effective from November. In addition, the expectations of major traders and banks that prices could rise over $90 per barrel in coming months also supported.

Brent crude futures were at $79.92 per barrel, up by 1.45 percent from their last close and US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose by 1.31 percent to $71.71 a barrel at the time of writing this article.

US commercial crude oil inventories are at their lowest level since early 2015. And while output remains around the record of 11 million barrels per day (bpd), recent subdued US drilling activity points towards a slowdown, reports Reuters.

Commodity merchants Trafigura and Mercuria said that Brent could rise to $90 per barrel by Christmas and even above $100 in early 2019 as markets tighten once US sanctions against Iran are implemented from November.

JP Morgan expects the sanctions could lead to a loss of 1.5 million bpd, while Mercuria warned that as much as 2 million bpd could be knocked out of the market.

Trade War Fear

The US-China trade war continues to be in focus as both countries imposed fresh tariffs on each other's goods today.

World’s biggest economies showed no signs of backing down from an increasing bitter trade dispute that has rattled financial markets.

US tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory tariffs by Beijing on $60 billion worth of US products took effect today morning (as per Indian time).

The two countries have already slapped tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other’s goods earlier this year.

Soon after the fresh duties went into effect, China accused the United States of engaging in “trade bullyism” and said it was intimidating other countries to submit to its will through measures such as tariffs, reports Reuters quoting official Xinhua news agency.

But Beijing also said it was willing to restart trade negotiations with the United States if the talks are “based on mutual respect and equality,” Xinhua said, citing a white paper on the trade dispute published by China’s State Council.

FPIs turn net sellers in September

Overseas investors have pulled out a massive Rs 15,365 crore ($2.1 billion) from the capital markets in September so far, after putting in funds during the previous two months, on widening current account deficit coupled with global trade tensions.

The latest outflow comes following a net infusion of close to Rs 5,200 crore in the capital markets, both equity and debt, last month and Rs 2,300 crore in July. Prior to that, overseas investors had pulled out over Rs 61,000 crore during April-June.

Technical Factors

The Nifty50 slipped below its crucial support placed at 11,100 levels in the first 60 minutes of trade on Monday. After Friday’s carnage, most analysts suggest that we might be in for some more volatility ahead of F&O expiry.

On the higher side, 11,200-11,220 will act as crucial resistance level for the index while on the downside 10,866 which was the intraday low recorded on Friday will act as crucial support for the index.

“A higher time frame i.e. the weekly chart shows that the index has formed a large bearish bar for the third consecutive week. The weekly momentum indicator has triggered a fresh bearish crossover. Thus the index is likely to continue with the fall & can target 10815 on the downside,” Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol."

In need of cash but IL&FS will not receive any funds from HDFC - Housing Development Finance Corporation - one of its large shareholders.

HDFC, which owns 9.02 percent in the infrastructure and financing company, said it will not provide any loans to the defaulting firm as it awaits the developments of the Board meeting on September 15.

To be clear, HDFC is not a Board member of IL&FS, which has seen multiple downgrades over the past few weeks for defaulting on interest payments to its bondholders.

“We are certainly not going to give them any loans…that is out of question. Whether we will subscribe to the equity or not is something we have to take a call on that. Let us first see who gives subscription to the shares and only then decide,” said a senior source from HDFC.

A day ahead of the IL&FS board meeting, LIC told Moneycontrol that it would facilitate a conditional loan of about Rs 700-800 crore. This is as against the Rs 3,000-crore fund raising that the infrastructure development and finance major is considering to propose on Saturday.

State-owned insurer Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), with a 25.34 percent stake in IL&FS, is the largest shareholder in the company followed by Orix Corporate, Japan (23.54 percent), Abu Dhabi Investment (12.56 percent), Central Bank of India (7.67 percent) and State Bank of India (6.42 percent) among others.

According to sources, “Their (IL&FS’s) biggest problem is they got the arbitration that they are not getting the order from NHAI and hence they have a liquidity issue.”

In the recent months, it was seen that the National Highways Authority of India’s (NHAI) bids in the road sector have benefited small and mid-size construction and infrastructure companies due to aggressive pricing by the bigger players like IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd (ITNL), the road development arm of IL&FS.

With several assets including road projects in its kitty, IL&FS may now look at monetizing some of them to generate funds.

“But it is very difficult to sell roads, so this will take time and IL&FS has a lot of short-term borrowings coming up for maturity…The company’s treasury management has been a little weak. They have funded long term assets out of short term borrowings. And now short-term borrowings are maturing and they do not have the funds to repay it,” the source added.

Apart from the investors, several pension funds, including LIC Pension Fund, have an exposure to the bonds of IL&FS.

Amid a worry of further defaults, IL&FS will suffer the test of times for the upcoming maturities of the short-term bonds it had issued."

HDFC's PAT increased 54% YoY to INR21.9b, driven by healthy AUM growth, stable spreads and timing mismatch of receipt of dividend income (INR5.9b in 1QFY19 v/s INR599m in 1QFY18). Total AUM grew 18% YoY (+5% QoQ) to INR4.19t. Individual lending AUM grew 18% YoY (+4.5% QoQ) to INR3.04t. Corporate lending growth has moderated from 22% YoY a year ago to 18% YoY now. Reported spreads were stable YoY at 2.28% for the quarter, with individual lending spreads at 1.91% and non-individual lending spreads at 3.14%. NIM stood at 3.5% v/s 3.4% a year ago. Note that HDFC has only restated NIM for 1QFY18 (4% to 3.4%); however, there has not been any restatement for spreads.

Outlook

Buy with an SOTP-based TP (FY20E based) of INR2,335. The increase in TP from INR 2,225 comes on the back of higher subsidiary valuation (especially HDFCB and HDFCSL) and an increase in multiple for the core business.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC

HDFC's loan asset growth of 19% YoY was better than expectations of 18% YoY driven from both individual & non-individual but same was visible in NII growth of 21% YoY as (i) impact from IND-AS accounting on interest expenses (Rs1.1bn of impact) and (ii) slightly lower spreads on individual loan book. HDFC under the IND-AS accounting recognized certain weak standard assets under the Gross Stage 3 exposure (2.5% of assets) leading to utilizing the floating provisions to maintain PCR at 28%.

Outlook

We see slight spread pressure in near term but HDFC has already taken increase in PLRs keeping spreads in tight band and asset growth is expected to be better. Maintain BUY with TP of Rs2,287 (up from Rs2,228) based on SOTP valuation with HDFC valued at 2.9x.

Edelweiss' research report on HDFC

HDFC reported a steady core performance for Q1FY19; however, transition to IND-AS led to lower-than-anticipated benefit (provisioning release) during the quarter. Surprisingly, the company disclosed stage-3 assets of ~3.7% with 1.2% as GNPLs and >2.5% of standard stressed loans. Consequently, provisioning requirement was higher at INR44bn (against existing provisioning of INR50bn) that led to lower-than-expected writebacks. Meanwhile, core performance sustained with >18% YoY growth in AUM supported by >19% growth in individual loans, benefitting from Affordable Housing push. Spreads remained steady, driving >19% YoY growth in NII.

Outlook

All in all, the impending impact of transition to IND-AS is key variable. Moreover, valuation at 3.1x FY20E P/ABV (core mortgage) appears to be fair in light of FY20E RoE of 16.5%. Hence, maintain ‘HOLD’.

The Rs 24,000-crore capital raising will increase HDFC Bank's capital buffers by 3 percentage points and help support the lender's over 20 percent loan growth for the next few years, says a report.

The Rs 8,500-crore infusion last week through a preferential allotment to parent HDFC will increase the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by about 1 percentage points to 13.3 percent from 12.3 reported in March 2018, global rating agency Moody's Investor Service said in a report today.

This is the first tranche of the Rs 24,000-crore capital raising plan announced last December.

""If the bank manages to raise the remaining planned capital, its CET1 ratio will increase by a total of 3 percentage points to 15.2 percent,"" it added.

The capital infusion is ""credit positive"" as it will strengthen its loss-absorbing buffers, while supporting balance-sheet expansion, the agency said.

Moody's vice-president for financial institutions group, Alka Anbarasu, further said even though HDFC Bank is more profitable than its peers, the internal capital generation ""has lagged its risk-weighted assets growth"" in the past five years.

The preferential share sale to the parent is part of an Rs 24,000-crore capital raising plan announced earlier. The remaining money will be raised from overseas investors, for which the bank has got necessary government approvals.

The bank has not yet revealed the exact timeline for raising the second tranche and the agency says it will not be difficult for the bank to raise the money from equity markets.

""We expect that the capital raise will support HDFC Banks credit growth of 20-25 percent over the next few years. HDFC Bank is growing at a faster pace than other banks: its average loan growth has been 22 percent over the past three years, versus the average of 6.5 percent for the system,"" Anbarasu said."

Shares of HDFC Bank rose by 1.31 percent to close at Rs 2,149, HDFC 1.54 percent to Rs 1,939.20, HDFC Standard Life 0.51 percent to Rs 476.70 while Gruh Finance fell by 0.96 percent to Rs 341.35 on the BSE.

HDFC is one of the few blue-chip companies in the country which is not run by a promoter family and is professionally-managed with a diverse institutional shareholding.

The group has also seen a very stable top management leadership, while it has prospered in a sector like real estate consistently over decades.

The top-four leaders of HDFC Ltd, including Parekh and Keki Mistry, together have over 150 years of leadership experience.

While the flagship HDFC Ltd group has been in business for the last four decades, HDFC Bank has been in business for 25 years and HDFC Standard Life for 20 years. The fourth listed firm Gruh Finance is also in business for 30 years.

HDFC Ltd currently has 76 percent FII holding which has remained in this range for many years, including in the aftermath of the Lehman crisis that saw foreign investors pulling out money across sectors. The FII holding rose to as much as 80 percent in March 2015."

Aggressive lending practices and possible job losses may restrict repayment capacity of home loan borrowers, according to country’s largest home financier HDFC.

HDFC – Housing Development Finance Corporation – in its annual report said, “Recent analysis by various credit rating agencies has indicated increased stress in the asset quality of loans against property. This stems from aggressive lending practices, intensifying competition and an inability to correctly assess repayment capacities of borrowers.”

Some housing finance companies (HFCs) focusing on the affordable housing segment have shown an above-average increase in delinquencies with gross NPA at 4-5 percent, said a CRISIL report.

HDFC also observes, “Key risks for the housing finance business include possibilities of widespread job losses, which could make servicing of the home loan difficult and a sharp deterioration of asset quality, particularly in the case of non-individual business.”

HDFC’s non-individual loans constitute 27 percent of its total portfolio, which stands at 3.59 lakh crore.

There is an ongoing debate on the number of jobs created in the country. Although, there is no accurate source of new jobs data at present, as per the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), 3.9 million jobs were created between September 2017 and March 2018. Similarly, data for the National Pension Scheme (NPS) for the same period (September 17 to March 18) showed that 465,000 new accounts were created.

Even as HDFC’s non-performing assets (NPAs) are at a lower base, the ratio of net NPAs to net advances increased to 0.80 percent as on March-end 2018 from 0.54 percent a year ago. NPAs of rival HFCs such as Indiabulls Housing Finance remained stable at 0.34 percent as compared with 0.36 percent.

Ashwini Kumar Hooda, Deputy Managing Director, Indiabulls Housing Finance had told Moneycontrol in April that delinquencies in loans up to Rs 2 lakh will force lenders to improve their underwriting.

As per an RBI study, in the up to Rs 2 lakh housing loans slab, NPAs of public sector banks and HFCs collectively stood higher at 10.4 percent in FY17 against 9.8 percent in FY16.

An ICRA report released in June 2018, gross NPA for only HFCs in the sub-segment deteriorated from 3.3 percent as on March 31, 2017 to 4.1 percent as on March 31,2018 driven by greater portfolio seasoning, entity-specific factors in some cases and external events such as demonetisation and implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) impacting the cash flows of the borrowers.

“While growth prospects remain good, given that the borrower profile is more vulnerable to income and external shocks, lenders would have to maintain good origination and lending processes as they expand in this segment” Supreeta Nijjar, Vice President, and Sector Head, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA.

Watch-out lending practices

Deepak Parekh, Chairman of HDFC also pointed out the growing practice of housing finance players picking loans off each other’s balance sheet needs to be carefully monitored.

“With the regulators prohibiting prepayment charges on most home loans, no one gains in this game, except the agent who keeps collecting commissions. Lenders do incur costs while originating loans,"" Parekh said.

He added, “It is thus logical that there be some compensation to a lender -- especially when a customer is poached within a timeframe of say, less than two years. To my mind, regulators should not encourage ‘lazy housing finance’.”

According to analysts, housing finance companies don’t have adequate pricing power to pass on the entire rise in the cost of funds as they operate on relatively narrow margins in a competitive market.

A fallout of which could be, as a Motilal Oswal report highlighted, a trend it noticed was the migration of assets toward high-risk non-core housing loans (which yield 200-400 bps or 2-4 percentage points more than home loans) for a few players, notably LICHF (LIC housing finance) and DHFL (Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd), two large players in the housing finance market.

HDFC’s annual report also pointed out other concerns including unanticipated changes in regulations which could impact the operations of the company.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already decided to tighten norms in the low-ticket affordable loans of up to Rs 2 lakh by increasing the loan to value (LTV) ratio and increasing the risk weight to address rising bad loans.

“It has been observed that the level of NPAs for the ticket size of up to Rs 2 lakh has been high and is rising briskly. Banks need to strengthen their screening and follow up in respect of lending to this segment in particular,"" RBI said in June.

Of around 100 housing finance companies, 15-20 are active in the low-ticket-size segment."

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Chairman Deepak Parekh said in his annual letter to shareholders that a smooth transition within the group will be his top-priority, according to a Mint report.

Hinting at Managing Director (MD) Aditya Puri’s imminent retirement in the letter, Parekh said that the secession plan would require 18-24 months of preparation.

Parekh, who turns 74 this year, added that the boards of the respective companies will look at both internal and external candidates to fill the positions, he said.

“Personally, the task of ensuring frictionless transition is and will be on the top of my mind. That said, it is not as if there will be an announcement right away,” Parekh said, according to the report.

“As passionate and energetic as some of our leaders within HDFC group are about their jobs, the reality is that individuals do get on in age,” Parekh added.

This is the first time Parekh has publicly spelt out his views on a succession plan.

CEO Puri, who has been the managing director of the country’s largest private bank since 1994, had in May put out a road map for transition in an analyst meet. Puri is expected to retire in October 2020."

Neha DaveMoneycontrol Research

PNB Housing Finance’s stock surged earlier this week on reports that HDFC and Kotak Mahindra Bank are planning to buy a controlling stake in the company although both later denied such murmurs.

This comes at a time when market already has been abuzz with talks about an impending stake sale by private equity (PE) firm Carlyle Group and Punjab National Bank in PNB Housing Finance.

PNB holds 32.96% in the housing finance company. PNB Housing Finance is a key subsidiary of PNB with market capitalisation at around Rs 20,000 crore, just a tad below the bank’s market cap. In an attempt to shore up the capital, the bank is looking to sell non-core assets. The board, in its meeting on June 8, approved of stake sale in PNB Housing, ICRA, CRISIL and BSE.

As per media reports, PE firm Carlyle’s 33% stake is also on the block. So, given the total supply of 66%, speculation on the potential buyer will be abound.

HDFC scouting for inorganic opportunities

HDFC, the largest mortgage player, raised Rs 13,000 crore capital in January 2018. It intends to utilise Rs 8500 crore to maintain its stake in HDFC Bank (that is raising capital as well in view of its promising growth outlook) and use rest for organic or inorganic growth across different businesses.

Earlier this year, HDFC explored buying a controlling stake in Can Fin Home Finance as Canara Bank intended to offload its 30% stake in the mortgage lender to augment capital. HDFC has an affordable housing finance subsidiary in form of Gruh Finance. However, geographical and customer segment diversification could have been the reason for considering Can fin homes. While Gruh is Gujarat based and lends mainly to self-employed segment, south based Can fin homes focuses on salaried customer segment. Despite the complimentary business profiles, the deal failed to materialize.

Could PNB housing be a good strategic fit for HDFC?

HDFC in its board meeting in December 17 had clearly indicated its intent for organic and inorganic growth in the affordable housing space. Individual housing loans constitutes 56% of PNB housing’s loan book. Within the same, we believe, the exposure towards affordable housing will be limited. As such, PNB housing is not a good fit for HDFC’s affordable housing expansion plans.

Secondly, PNB Housing has average profitability with return on assets (RoA) at 1.6% for FY18. The lender’s profitability has been primarily impacted by the average net interest margin (NIMs) and high operating costs. While NIMs are expected to benefit from the relatively high proportion of higher-yielding non-housing loans however, this will be partially offset by the impact of high competition on yields in the salaried housing loan segment. Operating cost can improve as it scales up the loan book. So, while there are levers for profitability improvement, a lot hinges on the lender’s ability to manage asset quality going ahead. Its loan book is inherently risky given the chunkier non-individual portfolio and relatively high share of self - employed people in the individual portfolio and needs to be tested through a business cycle.

In contrast, HDFC’s profitability on lending business is relatively better with core RoA over 1.9% for FY18.

So apart from increase in market share and exposure to fast growing self-employed segment, HDFC doesn’t stand to gain much if it buys PNB housing, the fifth largest mortgage lender.

PNB Housing's current valuation – a big deterrent

PNB Housing’s current valuation could also be the big impediment for HDFC to consider the stake in the lender. At the current market price, PNB housing is trading at 3.2 times trailing book. In comparison, HDFC’s core lending business is getting value of 2.7 times trailing book. In terms of forward multiples also, HDFC is relatively cheaper at 2 times FY20e core book vis-à-vis PNB housing at 2.3 times FY20e book. Acquiring PNB housing can undoubtedly consolidate HDFC’s market position, but the latter is unlikely to pay premium value for the same.

While the well-entrenched players like HDFC may not overpay for PNB housing, the financial investors or a new entrant could actively look at PNB housing.

What should investors do?

We believe investors will be better off by staying away from speculation on the potential stake sales in PNB housing and instead consider HDFC.

While HDFC’s headline valuation seems on a higher side, the core lending business is trading at a significant discount to its historical average. One of the argument for the lesser valuation is the fact that HDFC’s core earnings growth in mid-teens is lower in comparison to that of PNB housing and many other smaller housing finance companies (HFCs) that are reporting earnings growth of over 25%. But remember other HFCs are growing on low base. We believe HDFC’s ability to deliver consistent performance across rate and growth cycles in spite of its large size and high competition commands premium valuation. Moreover, there can be immediate upside trigger from value unlocking through proposed listing of HDFC asset management company (AMC).

HomeKraft, an ATS Group company, a developer in the National Capital Region (NCR), has diluted a significant minority equity stake to HDFC Capital Affordable Real Estate Fund – a fund managed by HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd.

HomeKraft will invest over $300 million for development of affordable and mid-income housing across India with a mix of internal accruals, debt and private equity funds, an HDFC release said.

“The affordable housing segment is expected to see healthy growth going forward given the impetus provided by the government through various incentives and subvention scheme. HDFC is delighted to partner with a reputed developer like ATS for their foray in this segment and our funds will provide flexible financing to HomeKraft to meet its capital requirements and address the demand-supply gap in affordable housing in India,” HDFC Ltd managing director, Renu Sud Karnad said in a statement.

HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd is a 100 percent subsidiary of HDFC Ltd.

In December last year, HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd, successfully achieved the initial close of its second affordable housing fund, the HDFC Capital Affordable Real Estate Fund – 2 (H-CARE-2). This will be combined with the HDFC Capital Affordable Real Estate Fund – 1 (H-CARE-1) raised in 2016 to create a $1 billion platform targeting affordable and mid-income residential projects in India’s leading 15 cities.

The primary objective of this platform is to provide long-term, equity and mezzanine capital to marquee developers at the land and pre-approval stage for the development of affordable and mid-income housing in India.

“We’ve had a persistent demand for affordable and mid-segment housing from prospective customers, who aspire for an ATS home but are unable to afford due to budget constraints. We are very happy to partner with HDFC Capital to work together to develop homes in affordable and mid-income segment under HomeKraft”, said Getamber Anand, chairman and managing director, ATS Group said.

HomeKraft is led by Prasoon Chauhan, CEO, along with a team of professionals. HomeKraft is looking to clock sales of 6000-6500 units in the next 3-5 years with expected revenue in the range of $ 600-750 Million.

Projects under HomeKraft would be in the range of Rs 30-70 lakh beginning with projects in NCR followed by rest of India."

Midcap valuations are still high at 20 times while for smallcaps they are at 14 times on a one-year forward P/E, but this is the time to start accumulating good quality mid- and small-cap stocks, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Last 10 years’ data suggests that bulls dominated D-Street in the last 5 out of 10 years. So how is June likely to pan out for investors?

We have a conservative view on the market for 2018, which was initiated since January and is still continuing. This was largely due to premium valuations, increase in interest rate, global and domestic political risks and lack of earnings growth.

On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the market has been underperforming led by hike in bond yield and downgrade in earnings, within which mid and smallcaps had vast correction in price and valuation.

Recently, we are seeing some respite in the market lead by good economic numbers for Q4 GDP and proactive decision by the Reserve Bank (RBI).

The carnage seen in the mid & smallcap space is likely to see a respite as a large portion of the knee-jerk downgrade in earnings is over, domestic political risk is being factored in and hope on future business outlook is high.

From the perspective of flows, FIIs became net sellers in just 3 out of the last 10 years. But, the way they have been selling in the last 2-3 months, do you think June could turn out to be a negative month?

FIIs have been selling their exposure in emerging markets (EMs) due to increase in global risk and bond yield. Yields are still on the higher side but stabilising and awaiting to see the latest update from FOMC.

Though the trend may be up but a large portion of it may be factored in by the market. We sense that market may see some respite from the poor performance of mid and smallcaps in the near term.

While the consumption story is getting better led by Q4FY18 GDP growth, improvement in rural market and good start to monsoon are key positives.

What is your call on Sensex/Nifty by year-end?

We had a target of 10,400 for Nifty, which we are continuing given lower than earnings growth of FY18 than anticipated. We are valuing Nifty at a P/E of 16.5x on a one-year forward basis assuming 15 percent growth in EPS which is lower than 17.5x we valued previously.

This is due to increase in global risk, reduction in global liquidity and lack of earnings growth till date.

Top five stocks which hold potential to give multibagger returns in the next 2-3 years?

InterGlobe Aviation

InterGlobal Aviation (the parent company of IndiGo airline) is one of the most efficient low cost carriers (LCC) with a market share of 40 percent in the Indian aviation sector.

IndiGo passenger traffic grew by robust 31 percent CAGR versus industry growth of 15 percent CAGR, over FY14-FY18. Going forward, expanding market presence through fleet addition and firming up its regional connectivity plans augurs well.

IndiGo’s fleet comprise of 15 percent more fuel efficient models which will cushion its margins and market share even at times of higher oil prices.

In the long-term risk related to volatile oil prices is likely to come down. We remain constructive on IndiGo given RoE of 40 percent, efficient operations and strong balance sheet.

NBCC:

NBCC is a Navaratna Enterprise engaged in project management consultancy (PMC), Engineering Procurement & construction (EPC) and real estate business. Current order backlog of Rs 80,000 crore provides strong visibility for the next 5 years.

We expect execution to ramp up in coming quarters as Rs 10,000cr worth redevelopment project started at ground level with an execution period of 2years. NBCC is at sweet spot considering its huge order book, limited competition and expertise in executing large projects.

Big projects like Pragati maithan (Rs 2,500cr), Irrigation project in Maharashtra (Rs 1,000 cr), redevelopment of Nauroji nagar (Rs 2,500cr) started with an estimated execution period of 24 months. Given strong earnings outlook and executional capability we continue maintain a Buy rating for the stock.

Escorts

Normal monsoon and more state subsidy for doubling the agricultural growth will continue to drive demand for tractors for FY19. EL's expanded portfolio & technology upgrades in tractors have resulted in improved numbers both in existing and newer geographies.

Revenue from Construction equipment and railway segments will continue to reflect sizable improvement in FY19. We expect revenue and PAT to grow by 15 percent/23 percent CAGR over FY18-20E factoring 13 percent YoY growth in the tractor sales and 18 percent in Construction equipment.

We expect EL to trade at a premium valuation of 25x (FY20E EPS) given its strong earnings outlook & massive government push for road infra projects.

Ashok Leyland:

Ashok Leyland (AL) is the second largest commercial vehicle manufacturer in India to witness numerous tail winds like government road infra spending, strategy of defence and Electric vehicle.

AL's growth in the higher tonnage vehicle was 247 percent on a YoY basis post the implementation of overloading ban in some northern states. The industry is likely to witness a demand of 600-700k vehicle if 15 year ban is enforced across the country.

AL holds 95 percent market share in this category (35.2t- 40.2t) and will be a direct beneficiary. We expect AL’s revenue to grow at 17 percent CAGR over FY18-20E- factoring 13 percent volume growth in M&HCV and 23 percent in its LCV business.

Do you think after what happened in Karnataka, the Modi government will become populist in the run-up to the general elections 2019? How are markets going to react?

We feel that BJP has done well in the Karnataka election more than doubling its strength and becoming the largest party in the state. Regarding the risk of becoming more populist, that is limited since they already are under the plan of focusing more on rural and agriculture sector as indicated in the Union Budget 2018-19.

NDA has been doing well in the last set of state elections and market is likely to take this positively for the next general election.

Twenty-one public sector banks (PSBs) have incurred losses totalling Rs 25,775 crore due to banking frauds in FY18. Do you think it will be a wise decision to catch this falling knife?

Out of 21 public sector banks, 19 PSBs have reported PAT losses of Rs 87,000 crore for the year ended FY18 largely on account of higher provisioning for bad loans.

The new norms of RBI on bad loans and increased NPAs will adversely affect the Rs 65,000-cr capital infusion plan of the government for FY19.

Insufficient capital infusion exercise may trouble the PSBs in maintaining the regulatory capital adequacy requirement. It is advisable to keep away from these stocks.

Most of the results for the quarter ended March are out. How do you rate the performance of India Inc? Also, your top 5 stocks to buy post earnings season and why?

The fourth quarter results so far have been trailing below the market expectation. Taking as an example, Nifty50, excluding the result of SBI which has given extraordinary losses factoring stressed assets, expectation was an average growth of 16 percent in PAT on a YoY basis but actual it is only 2 percent growth.

The good performing sectors are NBFCs, Metals and consumption-oriented segments like FMCG, auto and retail. The worst performers are banks, pharma, telecom and cement.

Of the 50 stocks, better-than-anticipated number are only for 16 companies. The best 5 outperformers are Hero Moto, Bajaj Finance, HDFC, HUL and TCS.

Mid & Smallcap stocks have taken a beating in the last 2-3 months. Both S&P BSE Smallcap index and Midcap index are down on a year-to-date basis. What should investors do with stocks that have seen double-digit correction?

Year-t0-date, from the respective 52-week high for indexes, Nifty50 corrected by 8 percent, Nifty Midcap100 by 15 percent and Nifty Smallcap100 by 20 percent.

After the strong correction, prices had become very attractive and valuation had reduced marginally. In case-to-case basis, some prices had become very lucrative.

Valuation was lower but not cheap enough. On a one-year forward basis, (Bloomberg) mid-cap valuation reduced by only 10 percent while for smallcap it corrected by almost 20 percent.

This reduction in P/E is lower than price correction because the actual result in the second half of FY18 was much below than anticipated, resulting in huge downgrade in forecast of FY19 and FY20 impacting the future valuation.

Valuation of midcaps is still high at 20x while for small cap it is at 14x on a one-year forward P/E. This is the time to start accumulating good quality mid and small-cap stocks.

Moving from stocks, most of the funds based on the small & midcap theme are bleeding. What are you suggesting to your clients – hold them and continue SIP, add more money on dips or book profits, if any?

During the start of the year we were suggesting to increase the exposure in largecaps compared to midcaps. We continue to stay with this outlook while along with largecaps we also suggest to have higher exposure in consumption-oriented stocks and businesses.

What is your call on crude oil, and where is it headed by December 2018? Do you think higher prices will make aviation, OMC, tyre stocks slightly unfavourable?

Brent crude has fallen from USD 80/bbl to US 75 this week on reports that Saudi Arabia and Russia are considering easing of production cuts on the back of new US sanctions on Iran. In the near term, Brent crude prices are likely to trade in the range of USD 70-75/bbl.

However, on a slightly long-term basis, the prices are likely to trade in a range of USD 65-70/bbl. Jet fuel accounts for 35-40 percent of the overall airline costs. The ATF has risen by 23 percent on a YoY basis, given higher fuel prices, air fares are expected to increase to adjust margin.

Meanwhile any decision on inclusion of Jet fuel under GST will significantly improve the fortunes of this sector. Oil marketing companies are on a consolidation mode on renewed concerns subsidy burden due to election year. We might see some impact on the earnings of OMCs in the near term due to higher prices and price controls from government.

Do you think we will have a normal monsoon in 2018? What will be its impact on sectors?

Monsoon has hit the southern peninsula before the forecast, market optimism will increase supporting the consumption-led story and rural economy.

Given the government's emphasis on agriculture and allied activities, the effect of 3rd consecutive normal monsoon is likely to be a bumper to the rural economy which is about 45 percent of India GDP. We are very positive on staple and discretionary consumption, auto, durables and agro segment.

Flows into mutual funds have slowed. Is domestic inflow story coming to an end?

We don’t agree to that, we feel that flows to mutual funds will continue to be on the higher side given the trend of financialisation of assets in India. Well it is completely positive that we will have seasonal change in the strength of the inflow.

Also, given the volatility till year and headwinds like increase in oil prices, slowdown in credit growth and higher inflation can impact the flow of funds in the short term."

Ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s key policy rate decision, top lenders raise their marginal cost based lending rates (MCLR) by at least 10 basis points (bps).

One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.

On Friday, just after country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) hiked its MCLR by 10 bps across all tenures up to three years, HDFC Ltd, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank also reciprocated by hiking by a similar margin. Punjab National Bank had revised its MCLR on Thursday.

MCLR is the minimum lending interest rate below which financing institutions and banks cannot give loans.

Most home loans, car loans and other personal loans are largely linked to one-year MCLR and the EMIs across loans are likely to go up, pinching the existing and new borrowers.

On June 6, the RBI is due to announce its key policy repo rate decision, which impacts the banks’ short term funding interest rate, the cost of which most banks pass on to the customers.

Amid rise in non-performing assets (NPAs) from corporate loans, shrinking margins and rising cost of funds due to rise in bond yields, banks have started to increase interest rates.

On a 10 bps increase in the lending rate will increase the EMI on a Rs 30-lakh housing loan taken for a period of 20 years by about Rs 200 per month (which is Rs 2,400 annually), assuming that the current rate of interest is 8.15 percent, which goes up to 8.25 percent after the increase in the lending rates.

SBI

The overnight and one-month tenure marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) have been raised to 7.90 percent (from 7.80 percent), three-month tenure rate is 7.95 percent (from 7.85 percent) while six-month tenure is 8.10 percent (from 8.00 percent) per annum, as per SBI’s website.

For one, two and three years, the MCLR has been hiked to 8.25 percent, 8.35 percent and 8.45 percent, respectively.

Base rate (minimum rate offered on loans taken before April 2016) was kept unchanged since its last revision on April 1, 2018, at 8.70 percent.

On May 28, SBI hiked interest rates on its retail fixed deposits for short to medium term by up to 25 bps.

ICICI Bank

The overnight and one-month tenure MCLR stands at 8.05 percent, three-month tenure rate is 8.10 percent while six-month tenure is 8.35 percent and one-year tenure loans at 8.40 percent.

The one-year rates are kept lower than SBI’s.

HDFC

HDFC or Housing Development Finance Corporation, one of the biggest private player in the home financing market, has increased its Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR), on which its adjustable rate home loans (ARHL) are benchmarked, by 10 bps, with effect from June 2, 2018.

Loans up to Rs 30 lakh will be offered between 8.40 – 8.90 percent to women borrowers while the rest would get it at 8.45 – 8.95 percent. Loans above 30 lakh will be charged 8.50 - 9.00 percent for women and 8.55 - 9.05 percent to other borrowers.

The interest rates differ on different loan product variants.

Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman and CEO of HDFC said, “I think there is an even chance of rate change in this or the next policy. US rates, its bond yields have gone up significantly, oil prices have gone higher and so that has created a situation that there is less liquidity in the system and hence bond yields here have gone up.

This directly impacts cost of funds which has incrementally gone up a lot and so this 10 bps rate hike will offset that and ensure our spreads will remain stable, Mistry added.

Spreads is the difference between interest rates on borrowing and lending.

PNB

Delhi-based second largest government-owned lender Punjab National Bank (PNB) revised its MCLR:

Duration Old MCLR Revised MCLR 6 months 8.25% 8.30% 1 year 8.30% 8.40% 3 years 8.45% 8.55% 5 years 8.60% 8.70%

PNB also revised its base rate 9.25 percent from 9.15 percent previously.

ICICI Direct's research report on HDFC

HDFC Ltd’s earnings were largely in-line, with PBT at Rs 3517 crore (up 19.7% YoY) vs. our estimate of Rs 3500 crore. However, lower than estimated tax rate of 19.1% enabled higher PAT growth of 39.2% YoY to Rs 2846 crore The key highlight of the result was higher than expected credit traction of 21% YoY to Rs 359442 crore. This growth has been the highest in last several quarters. It was largely led by individual loan portfolio which increased by 23% YoY to Rs 251457 crore & accounted for 70% of the total. Non individual book grew by ~17% YoY. Asset quality improved as expected. GNPA ratio stood at 1.11% (GNPA - Rs 4019 crore). NNPA remained nil. The NPA in the individual book fell by 3 bps QoQ at 0.64% while that of the non-individual portfolio remained steady QoQ at 2.18%. NII increased by 11% YoY to Rs 3064 crore. Reported NIMs were at expected levels of ~4% while spread was steady at 2.29%. Full year FY18 PAT was at Rs 12164 crore vs. Rs 7443 crore in FY17 Consolidated PAT for Q4FY18 was at Rs 3961 crore (up 29% YoY). Full year FY18 consolidated PAT stood at Rs 16255 crore.

Outlook

HDFC has commanded premium valuations over the years due to its consistent track record in earnings. Return ratios have remained healthy across economic cycles with RoE >20% & RoA ~2.2-2.5%. Going ahead, we expect PAT of Rs 11641 crore in FY20E (up 14.8% YoY). We have largely maintain our loan estimates and expect 17.2% CAGR to Rs 494049 crore by FY20E. Other parameters such as NIM/spread and asset quality are estimated to be stable, going ahead. We value the standalone business at 2.9x FY20E ABV. We maintain our SOTP based target price of Rs 2250/share and our BUY rating on the stock. HDFC remains a portfolio stock.

Edelweiss' research report on HDFC

HDFC’s Q4FY18 PAT of INR28.5bn surpassed expectations on lower tax rate (19%, benefiting from DTA credit utilisation), even as core profitability was softer. NII growth remained soft at ~13% YoY, which, coupled with modest net fee income (INR650mn), led to sub-13% revenue momentum. However, there were signs of pickup in growth—overall loans jumped >21% YoY (~16% average run rate in past eight quarters) led by individual segment (up 23% YoY, benefitting from Affordable Housing and no sale to HDFC Bank). GNPLs were steady at 1.11% (1.15% in Q3FY18), but provisions rose as HDFC utilised gains from stake sale (of INR2.65bn) to shore floating provisions (INR800mn). With steady operational performance this quarter, valuation at 2.6x FY20E P/ABV (core mortgage) appears fair for RoE of 16.5% in FY20E. Hence, maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

However, valuations at 2.6x P/ABV for core RoE of 16.5% appears fair. Maintain ‘HOLD/SP’.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC

HDFC's NII growth of 12.6% YoY was slower than expectations on slightly higher interest cost and opex. Loan growth came at 18% YoY (21% YoY incl. loans sold) with individual loans continuing to lead growth. Spreads also remained stable at 229bps but cost pressures have moved up and hence HDFC has increased PLR by 20bps effective 1st Apr'18 which will keep spreads steady. Management expects loan growth to be at 17-18% YoY, with similar growth in non-individual book. Loan growth momentum has improved and with stable spreads and hence, core operations is likely to remain upbeat.

Outlook

We have largely retained our estimates and revised our TP to Rs2,228 (up from 2,222) as we roll over to Mar-20. We have already factored Rs50bn warrant conversion in our estimates base for FY19.

HDFC Ltd. (HDFC) reported a 22% beat on PAT, helped by a lower tax rate (20% v/s estimate of 30%). Core PBT (up 11% YoY) was in line with estimate. The company made one-off provisions of INR800m, in line with its policy of 30% of one-off gains, to strengthen the balance sheet. The quarter was also marked by healthy AUM growth (+18% YoY/+4%QoQ), sequentially stable cost of funds (calculated) despite rising bond yields, and stable asset quality. Loan growth in the retail segment remained steady (+5% QoQ, +18% YoY), while that in the corporate segment (+2% QoQ, +17% YoY) was marginally lower than the trend in the past few quarters. Overall, the share of retail home loans was up 50bp QoQ at 72.9%. HDFCB has not bought back loans over the last two quarters, leading to a rise in the share of on-book AUM to 90% v/s 88% a year ago. Asset quality was steady, with the GNPL ratio in retail and corporate lending largely unchanged sequentially at 1.11% and 2.18%, respectively. Reported spreads were steady at 2.29% for 4QFY18 and also for full-year FY18. However, gross fee income declined 11% YoY to INR2.4b. C/I ratio (excl. one-off gains) was up 50bp YoY to 6.3%. Capital raise of ~INR130b happened toward the end of quarter, and thus, there was not much benefit on NII during the quarter.

Outlook

HDFC’s retail loan growth is impressive, despite intense competition and a high base. Over the past four quarters, corporate loan growth has also picked up smartly. Also, with access to multiple sources of borrowings, we believe HDFC will be able to manage spreads well in this environment of rising GSec yields. We build in recent capital raise of ~INR130b in our estimates (of which we expect it to invest INR85b in HDFCB). We largely maintain our estimates. Buy with an SOTP-based TP (FY20) of INR2,225.

Akash Jain

HDFC is one of the quality names in the housing finance space. We are bullish on the prospects of the company for long term. At current market price, the company seems fairly valued.

However, this company should be looked as a long term story on Indian housing finance space. In the near term, we expect a moderate upside of 20 percent by FY19 end.

Despite increasing competition in the home loan market with rivals State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, HDFC has managed to maintain its market share. HDFC has grabbed market share by being consistent in keeping interest rates among the lowest in the industry. It has also maintained a healthy asset quality over the past several quarters.

Earlier this month, owing to increasing cost of funds and upward interest rate cycle, HDFC hiked its mortgage rates for loans above Rs 30 lakh by up to 20 basis points while those below Rs 30 lakh, which include priority sector loans, have been increased by 5 basis points.

HDFC has surpassed street expectations by registering a whopping over 39 percent in standalone net profit in Q4FY18 to touch Rs 2,846.22 crore. Standalone revenue from operations came in at Rs 9,327.84 crore during the quarter, rising by 10.34 percent from Rs 8,453.41 crore a year ago in the same period. Also, the revenue surged by 7.65 percent, compared to Rs 8,665.13 crore of Q3FY18.

NII or net interest income met expectations to grow 4 percent to Rs 3,249 crore. Last year in the same period, NII stood at Rs 2,852 crore, including the one-time gain of stake sale in its life insurance subsidiary.

For FY18, the standalone PAT increased by 63.43 percent to Rs 12,163.69 crore in comparison of Rs 7,442.64 crore in the previous fiscal FY17. Revenue during FY18 stood at Rs 35,229.89 crore, up by 6.24 percent, as against Rs 33,159.60 crore in the previous fiscal.

Profit on the sale of investments was Rs 294.31 crore for the quarter following entire stake sale in subsidiaries HDFC Realty and HDFC Developers to Quikr India. Profit on sale of investments during the year-ago period was at Rs 48.62 crore. After adjusting for the exceptional items and one-time transactions (i.e. profit on sale of subsidiaries and consequent special additional provisions), the profit before tax would have been Rs 11,397 crore for the year ended March 31, 2018.

Total loan book stood at Rs. 359,442 crore, up by 21 percent over last year. Of these, total individual loan disbursements grew by 29 percent and the average size of individual loans stood at Rs. 26.4 lakh. The non-individual loan book grew at 17 percent.

The individual loans grew to 73 percent of the total loans, up from 72 percent a year ago. Of the individual loans, 38 percent of home loans approved in volume terms and 19 percent in value terms have been to customers from the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Low Income Group (LIG).

Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as at March 31, 2018 stood at Rs 4,019 crore, which is 1.11 percent of its loan portfolio. The NPAs of the individual portfolio increased marginally to 0.64 percent from 0.61 percent last year while that of the non-individual portfolio worsened to 2.18 percent from 1.16 percent a year back.

Provisions and contingencies in March quarter shot up 21.6 percent year-on-year and 89.5 percent sequentially to Rs 180 crore due to additional provisions. It has made an additional provision of Rs 80 crore to shore up the provision & contingencies account and thereby recognise provisions towards specific loans against future risks.

Consolidated total income was at Rs 21,248.79 crore, growing by 17.78 percent from Rs 18,040.59 crore, the same period a year ago. On consolidated basis, PAT stood at Rs 3,961.17 crore in Q4FY18 which was up by 28.63 percent from Rs 3,079.33 crore in Q4FY17, but down by 40.71 percent from Rs 6,681.54 crore in Q3FY18.

On consolidated segment-wise revenue break up, loan business by 13.43 percent YoY to Rs 10,226 crore in Q4FY18, while life insurance business rose by 8.64 percent to Rs 9,794.81 crore, general insurance up by 4.52 percent to Rs 931.67 crore, and asset management business grew 16.94 percent to Rs 529.99 crore.

For entire FY18, consolidated PAT was at Rs 16,254.96 crore, up by 47.08 percent against Rs 11,051.52 crore in FY17, whereas total income stood at Rs 69,141.67 crore, increasing by 13.18 percent as against Rs 61,087.63 crore in FY17.

HDFC earned a profit of Rs 5,257 crore from the initial public offer of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Limited (HDFC Life) and had created an additional special provision of Rs 1,575 crore as a charge to the statement of profit and loss, both were exceptional items.

HDFC, the country's biggest private sector mortgage lender, is likely to post a 20.5 percent rise in net profit for the fourth quarter ending March 2018, as per a Reuters poll estimate.

In its earnings to be announced today, the lender is likely to report a 20.5 percent year-on-year growth in net profit at Rs 2,464 crore as compared to Rs 2,044 crore in the year-ago period.

Its net interest income (NII – difference between interest earned and expended) is expected to rise to Rs 3,232 crore, the poll estimated. In the year-ago period, NII stood at Rs 2,852 crore, the lender had made a one-time gain of stake sale in its life insurance subsidiary.

The asset quality is expected to remain stable and its corporate loans and the affordable housing segments will be keenly watched by the market, analysts said.

Despite increasing competition in the home loan market with rivals State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, HDFC has managed to maintain its market share.

The Keki Mistry-led home financier has grabbed market share by being consistent in keeping interest rates among the lowest in the industry. It has also maintained a healthy asset quality over the past several quarters and is likely to continue the trend.

HDFC has one of the best home loan portfolios with the lowest level of NPAs that stand at around 1 percent. This is also because a large portion of about 70 percent of the bank’s portfolio consist of loans to the salaried category of borrowers.

The Reuters poll has projected that loan loss provisions could increase by 25 percent to Rs 185 crore, as against Rs 148 crore reported in Q4FY17.

Brokerage house Prabhudas Liladhar sees gross NPAs at 1.12 percent (against 1.15 percent year-on-year). “We expect Loan growth to be better led by retail. Non‐retail should soften on higher base of demonetisation, while spreads should be steady. Asset quality may see slight improvement, while HDFC may report high provisions from sale of assets,” it said.

According to a Kotak report, “With an improvement in momentum in the retail business, we expect HDFC’s loan growth to inch up to 18 percent (17 percent in Q3FY18).

Net interest margin will likely expand by about 30 bps QoQ. This is in line with seasonal trends of higher collections in Q4. Large capital issuance (Rs 13,000 crore) will boost NII by about Rs 100 crore,” the Kotak report added.

Earlier this month, owing to increasing cost of funds and upward interest rate cycle, HDFC hiked its mortgage rates for loans above Rs 30 lakh by up to 20 basis points while those below Rs 30 lakh, which include priority sector loans, have been increased by 5 basis points."

ICICI Direct’s earnings estimates for HDFC

Improved credit traction, as seen in the last two quarters, may continue. We estimate 18% YoY increase in advances to Rs. 349,837 crore in Q4FY18. This may be led by individual loan segment. Asset quality is expected to remain under control. Reported NIM is expected to be steady QoQ at 4% while spread of 2.3% would be maintained. PAT of Rs. 2,300 crore is estimated. The QoQ decline in PAT is owing to large capital gains in Q3FY18 due to a stake sale in the life insurance arm. Dividend income of Rs. 330 crore is expected while capital gains of Rs. 300 crore are expected (Rs. 265 crore due to sale of stake in two subsidiaries namely HDFC Developers and HDFC Realty).

The bulls managed to hold on to momentum despite muted global cues in the morning to push the Nifty index back above 10600 levels for the first time since February 5, 2018, and formed a bullish candle on the daily candlestick charts on Tuesday.

The index flirted with 10,600 levels on more than one occasion in the recent past but Tuesday’s sessions was a mark of strength from bulls. But, for the rally to gain momentum, the Nifty has to close above 10630 levels.

The Nifty took support at its 5-days exponential moving average (DEMA) placed at 10,573 and then bounced back above 10600 levels towards the close.

The Nifty which opened at 10,578 rose to an intraday high of 10,636. It slipped marginally to hit an intraday low of 10,569 in the first half of the session. The index finally closed 29 points higher at 10,614.

The way Nifty managed to climb all wall of worries and close above 10550 levels may well force bears to cover their short which could push the index higher towards the April expiry, suggest experts.

India VIX fell down by 9.47 per cent at 11.89. Overall, lower volatility is supporting the major bullish bias in the market. The Volatility is now at the lowest daily close seen in the last four months since 22nd December 2017.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,576.6, followed by 10,538.9. If the index starts moving upwards, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,644.4 and 10,674.5.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 25,042.1. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 24,956.93, followed by 24,871.77. On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 25,125.33, followed by 25,208.57.

"April 10, 2018 10:12 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/in-a-first-since-december-2013-hdfc-raises-lending-rate-by-20-bps-2546377.html,"After HDFC Ltd, largest mortgage financier in private sector, raised its lending rate by 20 basis points (bps), home buyers are set to shell out more in their EMIs or the equated monthly installments.

The retail benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) increase by HDFC is the first since December 2013, signaling a rate hike cycle in loan rates across the finance sector.

With this rate increase, loans between Rs 30 lakh to Rs 75 lakh will be available at 8.55 percent (against 8.35 percent) for women borrowers and 8.60 percent (from 8.40 percent) for others. For loans above Rs 75 lakh it will be 8.65 percent for women and 8.70 percent for others.

On loans under Rs 30 lakh (priority sector loans) a woman borrower with HDFC will now have to pay 8.40 percent, up by 5 bps from 8.35 percent, while other borrowers will be charged 8.45 percent.

Despite no rate increases by the Reserve Bank of India, several banks have started raising interest rates since late 2017 because of the high cost of funds.

Between July 2017 and now, 10-year government bond yields have also risen 100 bps, which largely reflect interest rates by lenders. Although yields have come down since February-March, they are still high.

It started with the private sector lenders like Axis Bank, Yes Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank raising their marginal cost of funding-based lending rates (MCLR), and gradually percolated down to all the banks in the system including the largest lender State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Allahabad Bank.

“All lenders have increased it by up to 20 bps from their October to November levels. They will remain around these levels of over 8.40-odd percent. I believe the current levels will remain for now, unless bond yields spike from current levels of 7.25 percent,” said Ashwini Kumar Hooda, Deputy MD at Indiabulls Housing Finance.

Last month, SBI marginally increased its base rate to 8.70 percent, up 5 basis points, from 8.65 percent. This was the first rate hike in five years from the SBI.

SBI has attributed the base rate hike to the increase in term deposit rates. According to a senior SBI official, the cost of deposits go up, it is followed by increase in the base rate (minimum lending rate) as well.

Since January 2015, when the accommodative cycle of monetary policy commenced, the median base rate has declined by 80 bps, as against the cumulative decline of 200 bps in the policy repo rate. Since April 2016, MCLR has declined by as much as 105 bps in some cases, RBI data shows.

However, given that interest rates are on the rise both globally and domestically, cost of borrowing is only bound to up go from here."

The increase in the Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR), on which it benchmarks the Adjustable Rate Home Loans (ARHL), is effective from April 1, an official statement said.

A company spokesperson said the rate hike is progressive, between 0.05 percent to 0.20 percent, with the lowest hike applicable to the low-ticket size loan.

A loan for under Rs 30 lakh by a woman borrower, which is the lowest rate offered by the lender, will now be available at 8.40 percent, the spokesperson said, adding for others it will be 8.45 percent.

Loans between Rs 30 lakh to Rs 75 lakh will be available at 8.55 percent for women borrowers and 8.60 percent for others, while those above Rs 75 lakh will be for 8.65 percent for women and 8.70 percent for others.

Ltd said in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand. Here's an edited excerpt from that interview:

Q) The year FY18 pared most of the gains, thanks to steep correction seen in the month of February and March. How is FY19 likely to pan out for investors – will it be a year belonging to the bulls or bears will keep the gains in check?

A) FY19 is difficult to call because there are too many moving parts. There is the rate tightening cycle in the US, hardening of commodity price, particularly oil and then the “gorilla in the room” – political uncertainty.

As against these negatives, the earnings vibrancy is the key and equally balancing positive. Our assessment is that investments made during this fiscal will yield very good returns and purchases will be at reasonable valuations and not elevated levels what was the case in the second half of 2017-18.

Q) What is your index target for the financial year 2019? Do you think it will be possible to reclaim 12,000 on Nifty and Sensex could rise above its previous record high of 36,443?

A) Investors should work with flat to low single digit index returns. Sentiment may get tested because of negatives mentioned above. The year would be a year of consolidation and patience will be tested as also the conviction in equities.

Q) Any top five stocks which you think are ideal wealth-creating ideas which investors can look at buying in the coming FY for a period of 2-3 years?

A) Private sector retail lenders will continue their stellar performance. They will gain market share at the expense of PSU and then there is the underlying growth momentum.

Top banks like HDFC, IndusInd Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank can deliver index beating returns over the next 3 years.

Investors with risk appetite could consider Yes Bank, RBL Bank and DCB Bank. Within the NBFC space we like Bajaj Finance and Capital First and its future avatar IDFC Bank.

Q) Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in the coming financial year and why?

A) Although we are very positive on private sector banks and Consumption stories in auto, retail, aviation, entertainment, building material and appliances, spectacular trading bounces may be visible in cyclical commodity businesses, infra construction companies, real estate, chemicals (due to China factors), fertilisers etc. Traders and short term investors could target these sectors.

Q) Do you see Modi 2.0 as we inch closer to national elections in the year 2019?

A) Your guess is as good as mine, but BJP getting an absolute majority is a far-fetched scenario. Base case scenario is an NDA majority with smaller parties throwing their weight around.

Governance may suffer; but hopefully, the major reforms would have been completed in this term itself, that being GST, NPA resolution and removal of impediments for large infra projects.

Q) Mid and Smallcaps which hogged the limelight in FY18, do you think the trend will continue in the next financial year? If yes, why?

A) Earnings will come through but PEs will compress which means that there would be sideways consolidation. The base will be formed for another spectacular up move in 2019 post general elections, cooling of commodity prices and completion of rate tightening cycle.

Q) There is a big hue and cry about crude. Do you think that the black gold could trade above $75-80/bbl?

A) Seems improbable but not impossible. If its takes place gradually, it will be absorbed and markets will look beyond these uptrends.

Q) What should be the portfolio composition of investors in the coming financial year assuming he is in the age bracket of 35-40 years?

A) 30-35 percent into Banks / NBFCs (private sector and retail focussed), 30-35 percent into consumer oriented stocks (Auto, Retail, Avaition, Entertainment, Building material and appliances), 15 percent in Capital Goods / EPC companies 5 percent in niche exporter / special situation.

Hold Cash at 10 percent at all times to take advantage of extreme volatility which will be the highlight of the next 12-15 months

Q) Do you think earnings is likely to bounce back in double digits in FY19?

A) Yes very confident of earnings growth but not so sure about stock price appreciation post earnings performance."

We are constantly on a learning curve, which makes it easier for us to take life decisions. In financial matters too, we look for handholding and a guiding path, especially during 20s. And who else can be better teachers in wealth management than the ladies of our house?

Yes, women have been mastering planning and budgeting since generations. Our grandmothers and mothers are adept in planning the monthly budget as per the family’s needs-be it grocery or other household items. Despite huge expenditure, they still save money for emergencies or certain financial goals.

Likewise, investments and tax planning are no different from budgeting. It involves saving and investing in different instruments to achieve short-term and long-term goals.

In a bid to impart her learnings in financial matters to her sister, an older sister wrote a heartfelt letter:

Dear Swati,

Congratulations on your new job! You’ll be stepping into the professional world now and I am as excited as you are. This is your first job and I am sure you will shoulder the responsibilities with aplomb. As you will be earning now, I want you to take up another responsibility now which is financial planning.

Remember, that pink piggy bank you had when you were 5? You would put whatever money you had in it. It is time to step up now. In order to lead a financially independent life, you will have to take certain decisions for yourself.

You should identify short-term and long-term goals such as going on an exotic vacation, buying a car for yourself, maintaining a good lifestyle even after retirement, pursuing your passion, etc. This is the age you can save as you don’t have any dependency.

Like you save for your smartphone and laptop, start saving for your future. You have to save for investments, health and retirement.

You will see how your savings will grow into a huge corpus, which will come in handy in future. And, don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your investments in FDs, Ulips, Shares etc.

Likewise, a health plan is very important. Remember when I had met with that minor accident few years ago? It was my health plan that helped me. I will suggest to buy a health plan as it is important. It will immune you from any financial distress in case of any ailment.

Also, start a term life insurance policy. Get insured. As you plan to work, you have to take up a term insurance policy and become financially empowered. Your term insurance policy will be beneficial for your family in future. You will save taxes too and this saving can be invested again.

I am writing to you so that you don’t take financial planning lightly.

Yours,

Didi"

“A worsening macro as evident in rising bond yields, which capture fiscal concerns and inflation, remains a key worry. We raise the weight on IT Services in our model portfolio to neutral keeping in mind the macro worries,” CLSA said in a note.

Ten stocks on which CLSA maintains its overweight stance include names like ICICI Bank, SBI, HDFC, ICICI Pru Life, IndusInd Bank, L&T, Astral, Sadbhav, Godrej Properties, and Sobha.

The low base of demonetisation helps the YoY comparison in Jan-18 but the monthly indicators are not as good as those in Dec-17. CLSA’s two-year growth analysis suggests that growth in certain categories, such as cement, diesel, and steel, came off marginally.

The encouraging trend in tractors and partially in two-wheelers (2Ws) as well offers visibility on the expected rural demand recovery. “On an absolute level, the 12-14% demand growth trend in cement keeps us optimistic on the housing market recovery theme as well,” the report added.

CLSA has been underweight on IT Services as the growth outlook has been weak due to structural reasons. “While that view has not changed, we believe that the worsening macro situation in India and the possibility of cyclical growth recovery in the US makes a case for the underweight to be cut,” said the report.

The global investment bank added TCS and L&T Technology Services to the model portfolio with 3ppt each. This has been funded by removing Tata Steel from the portfolio and bringing down RIL to neutral weight.

The property remains CLSA single-biggest overweight sector with 6ppt and this signifies our confidence in our view of a housing market recovery. “Financials and Industrials remain the other overweight sectors. Staples, Materials, and Telecom are the underweights,” it said."

The EWS comprises people with an annual household income up to Rs 3 lakh, while LIG includes those with income greater than Rs 3 lakh and up to Rs 6 lakh.

The government launched its flagship PMAY(U) scheme on June 25, 2015, to provide housing for all by 2022.

Homebuyers who had invested in embattled real estate group Jaypee have sought a moratorium on their existing home loans and have written to the banks asking that EMIs should not be deducted till such time that a resolution was hammered out on the delivery of flats.

The banks, however, have said that they require the approval of National Housing Bank (NHB) before agreeing to it, lest the loans are classified as non-performing assets.

“…till the commencement of insolvency proceedings, there has not been a single default and all of us have serviced the loan regularly. We are all law-abiding citizens who have no intention of committing any default with regard to the home loan. However, in the peculiar facts and circumstances, it is only appropriate that there is a moratorium on the EMIs till the time there is any clarity on the entire issue and no penal interest is levied on the unpaid EMIs. Since matter is pending before the Honourable Supreme Court as well as before the NCLT, we are hopeful of an early resolution,” homebuyers, who had invested in Jaypee Infratech Ltd and Jaypee Associates, have written in a letter to banks.

“You are, therefore, requested to instruct your branches not to raise any further demand for the time being and keep the EMIs in abeyance and not to charge penal interest on the unpaid EMIs till there is some clarity on the issue of possession/refund with regard to the projects of Jaypee. Kindly do not treat the non-payments as defaults but only a necessary outcome of the peculiar circumstances and the present scenario,” they said in a letter written by their counsel.

Keki Mistry, vice chairman and CEO of HDFC said, ""I don't know. Nothing has come to me yet. Also, for any moratorium, we need the NHB to approve it. Theoretically, even if we approve it, the NHB has to agree to it. Otherwise, we will have to classify it as NPAs.""

Another senior executive from the same home loan company also refused receiving any such letter but remained optimistic on the resolution of the case. ""The way it (case under the NCLT) looks currently, there are people interested in it and it should be resolved...""

Emails sent to ICICI Bank did not elicit a response. Calls made to the NHB chairman also remained unanswered.

The letter by homebuyers also goes on to state that Right to Information (RTI) response received by them revealed that loans were issued by banks even before the projects were sanctioned by Noida Authority “which is a contravention of RBI/NHB regulations. It is noteworthy that in this entire gambit, the homebuyers are the ones who have been caught between the lenders and the builder.”

“The homebuyers who were mere bystanders to this entire process and who bonafidely paid each and every financial demand raised by you and the developer at all times duly performing their obligations under the contract, are the ones who have been most severely prejudiced and punished without any fault. It is well known that the property at present is non-existent and it seems very clear that the developer is unable to either develop or deliver the proposed project,” the letter says.

""While you benefit from our regular payments of EMIs, we are left in the lurch and are forced to pay monthly EMIs for a property, which at the moment doesn’t even exist and also housing rentals,” it says.

“While some of us had no option but to stop paying the EMIs because of extreme financial burden of rents and EMIs, they run the risk of adverse effect on their CIBIL scores, which would disentitle them for any future loan. In fact many of us have started receiving legal notices and threatening calls from you for payment of EMIs,” it added.

On August 9 last year, the Allahabad bench of the NCLT had accepted lender IDBI Bank’s plea and admitted Jaypee Infratech as a case under insolvency resolution for defaulting Rs 526 crore. It appointed Anuj Jain as the insolvency resolution professional from BSSR & Co.

The SC ruling came after over 20,000 home buyers in the Jaypee Infratech’s projects raised concerns of not getting back their money as the first right of dues would go to the banks and other operational creditors. While some buyers have paid the full amount to the company, there are others who may have paid either 60 percent or perhaps 90 percent of the amount.

The Finance Minister introduced a long-term capital gains tax of 10 percent if the gains exceed Rs 100,000 without allowing the benefit of indexation.

However, all gains till January 31, 2018 will be grandfathered and short term capital gains remains unchanged at 15 percent.

The Nifty was down 80 points or 0.71 percent on Friday morning and was trading below the 11K mark at 10,938 while the Sensex fell 256 points and was trading at 35,650. The fall in the benchmark indices was aided by midcaps, the Bank Nifty and the Infra space.

But the sectors which traded in the green included the IT space led by stocks like Info Edge, TCS, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra. The CNX Pharma index gained over 1 percent led by stocks like Sun Pharma, Lupin, Glenmark Pharma, Dr Reddy's Labs and Aurobindo Pharma.

IT from the FMCG space jumped 2.4 percent. Edelweiss Financial has maintained a hold on ITC with a target price of Rs 313 as Budget 2018 left the tax structure for cigarettes unchanged which was much softer than our anticipation, it said.

The house expects the stock to re-rate due to improving prospects.

Morgan Stanley has maintained an overweight rating on ITC with target of Rs 320 as there was no change in cigarette tax. It is of the view that the next trigger is volume growth and outcome of GST Council meeting. The research firm expects very low probability of introduction of additional GST tax slab for cigarettes.

The top Nifty gainers included ITC which jumped over 2 percent followed by Dr Reddy's Labs, Sun Pharma, Lupin and HCL Tech. The most active stock apart from ITC was State Bank of India which was down 1 percent while Ashok Leyland, TCS and Reliance Industries were the other active stocks.

The top Nifty losers included names like Indiabulls Housing Finance which fell over 3 percent followed by HDFC, ONGC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank, each shedding 2 percent each.

The top Sensex gainers were Info Edge, ITC, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, Bajaj Finserv and Fortis Healthcare. The top losers included PC Jeweller which tanked 15 percent followed by Vakrangee which was down 10 percent. Cummins India and eClerx were the other top losers.

Baaj Auto from the Nifty was one of the few stocks which hit fresh 52-week high. The stocks which hit new 52-week low included names like Allahabad Bank, Cummins India, LIC Housing Finance and MCX India.

The market breadth was in favour of the declines on Friday morning with 222 stocks advancing while 1383 stocks declined and 409 stocks remained unchanged. On the BSE, 348 stocks advanced while 1766 stocks declined and 64 remained unchanged.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC

HDFC's core performance adjusting for onetime gains were slightly above expectations as NII growth was better on back of strong loan growth of 19% YoY from all segments. HDFC booked Rs52.0bn of investment gains from HDFC Life IPO and as a policy provided Rs15.8bn (30% of gains) as contingent provisions helping further strengthen balance sheet. Company also got benefit of tax credit on investment gains and hence had lower tax leading to beat in earnings.

Outlook

We have slightly revised our growth estimates upwards and adjusted tax rate lower for FY18. We revise our TP to Rs2,160 (up from 2,000) and retain BUY with stable spreads and improving growth.For all recommendations report, click here

Interest rates are likely to remain stable for the next 3-4 months and may see a slight increase as the government tries to maintain its fiscal deficit target of 3.2 percent, according to the chief of country’s largest housing finance company HDFC.

Helped by extraordinary gains from the HDFC life IPO and a surge in affordable housing loans, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) reported a net profit of Rs 5,670 crore for the quarter ended December 2017, an increase of 233 percent over the Rs 1,701 crore reported in the same period in FY17.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman and CEO of HDFC, said his company will continue to grow in all businesses including affordable housing, which is being pushed with the help of the government’s Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.

HDFC is also awaiting the approval of its shareholders to raise Rs 11,301 crore through private placement of shares, and a further Rs 1,896 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Excerpts from Mistry's interaction with Moneycontrol:

Apart from one-time gains, what factors have contributed to business growth during the quarter?

We have seen good growth in individual loan disbursements, which grew by 27 percent in the nine-months. Also, 39 percent of total approved loans have been in the EWS (economically weaker section) and LIG (low income group) segments with about 8,000 loans. In value terms, it would be about 20 percent of total loans and monthly average approvals stood at approximately Rs 1,300 crore.

What is the average loan size given to these sections vis-à-vis the overall average for HDFC?

The average loan size is Rs 10.24 lakh for EWS and Rs 17.38 lakh LIG segment, while HDFC’s overall loan average is Rs 26.20 lakh. This reduced a bit from 26.6 lakh a year ago and 26.3 lakh in the previous quarter.

Will your focus change to these two segments from here on?

We are focusing on every aspect of the market. The lower income group has seen strong growth and hence we are not restricting ourselves.

Where do you think interest rates are headed?

Clearly, rates have bottomed out and I don’t see rates increasing in a hurry. They will remain static for the next 3-4 months and a host of factors that are not under our control will determine the way forward. Unless there is a big slippage in fiscal deficit though, I do not expect it to happen and I think it would be maintained at the level estimated.

If the fiscal deficit is kept under control, perhaps rates could come down a little. Oil and inflation are worries but markets have considered the fiscal deficit slippages and if that is not taken care of in the Budget, then rates could come down. This is for the B2B (business to business) segment. For consumers, it will remain stable for now.

The Economic Survey said that NPAs in the individual housing loan books of banks and HFCs have risen to 11 percent. Do you see it rising more?

I don’t think there is stress in home loans but the stress that you are referring to could be in the loans given against property (LAP) segment.

What about the self-employed category?

I don’t think so. In the self-employed category also there are different segments. You can have professionals like doctors, lawyers, chartered accountants or engineers. Or you can have businessmen like the local shopkeepers, kirana store owners, etc. Only that they may have to pay higher interest rates but there is no stress."

Equities resumed their record-setting spree today after an upbeat growth forecast by the Economic Survey gave fresh impetus to investor sentiment.

The BSE Sensex spurted 233 points to end a fresh lifetime high of 36,283.25, while the broader Nifty too finished at record 11,130.40.

India will re-establish itself as the world's fastest growing major economy with GDP expanding by 7-7.5 percent in 2018-19, up from 6.75 percent in the current fiscal, said the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament today.

The beginning of February derivatives contracts and unabated foreign fund inflows amid encouraging corporate earnings added to the optimism, brokers said.

The 30-share Sensex, after opening on a strong footing on optimistic buying by participants, gathered momentum to touch an all-time high of 36,443.98.

However, it shed some ground on profit-booking, before finally finishing at 36,283.25, up by 232.81 points, or 0.65 percent -- surpassing its previous record closing of 36,161.64 hit on January 24.

The 50-share NSE Nifty too closed at a fresh life high of 11,130.40 points, up 60.75 points, or 0.55 percent.

It broke its previous closing record of 11,086 reached on January 24.

""Benchmark indices continued their up-move supported positive global cues and strong liquidity. Market cheered the GDP growth estimates of 7-7.5 percent for 2018-19 released by the Economic Survey.

""Currently market is expecting a good Budget with focus on fiscal prudence and reducing rural distress. Additionally, good Q3 results from index heavyweights have taken markets to new high. But due to premium valuation, investors were cautious on the mid and small cap stocks,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.

The Economic Survey for 2017-18 said the GDP will grow on the back of major reforms which would be strengthened further in the next financial year.

Meanwhile, foreigners bought shares worth Rs 937.31 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) sold shares to the tune of Rs 965.67 on Thursday, provisional data showed.

Shares of the country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki emerged as the top performer among Sensex components, climbing 3.85 percent after the company reported 2.96 percent increase in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2017.

Stocks of mortgage lender HDFC Ltd rallied 2.66 percent after the company today reported over two-fold jump in its consolidated net profit at Rs 6,677.06 crore for the third quarter ended December 2017.

Other major gainers were TCS, Hero MotoCorp, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Tata Steel, Bajaj Auto, HDFC Bank, Sun Pharma, L&T, Infosys, M&M, Wipro, Coal India, IndusInd Bank and Asian Paints, rising by up to 2.48 percent.

Dr Reddy's, Bharti Airtel, ITC, Yes Bank, ONGC, Axis Bank and SBI ended in the negative zone, falling up to 5.92 percent.

In sectoral terms, the BSE auto index gained the most at 1.60 percent, followed by IT 1.16 percent, tech 0.92 percent, consumer durables 0.60 percent, metal 0.24 percent, capital goods 0.17 percent and bankex 0.14 percent.

However, PSU, infrastructure, healthcare, oil and gas, power, realty and FMCG ended in the red, falling up to 1.22 percent.

In contrast, the broader markets were under pressure as investors trimmed their positions at higher levels. The BSE small-cap index declined 1.10 percent, while the mid-caps fell 0.73 percent.

Sentiment was also buoyed by positive opening in European markets, tracking record closing at the Wall Street on Friday, brokers said.

In the Eurozone, Frankfurt's DAX was up 0.06 percent, while Paris CAC 40 gained 0.03 percent in their late morning trade. London's FTSE was up 0.13 percent.

The relentless rally seen in Indian equity markets has surprised many technical analysts’ on D-Street which are now hinting at caution at least in the near-term.

A cautionary stance is necessary at current level as the index is trading near key resistance levels, but is it the time to go short? Well, as long as Nifty trades above key support levels, traders should avoid taking contra bets at current level and ride the momentum on the upside.

A large part of the euphoria could be attributed to pre-budget rally as investors are factoring a big bang growth focused Budget from the Modi government.

It will be futile to go short in this market at current level and investors should wait for a confirmation, that’s the word of advice coming from technical pundits who are tracking markets on a daily basis.

“The Nifty registered breakouts across the time frames which is suggesting that the bull is still young and getting strengthened further with broad-based participation as laggards like IT have also become active and making new lifetime highs,” Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.

“Metals have a long way to go which may help indices in maintain higher levels. Hence, post-budget if market sustains above the critical supports of 10300 (on monthly closing basis) one can expect the momentum to remain intact and in that scenario, we will not be surprised to see indices trading close to 13,000 levels between December 2018 to March 2019,” he said.

Considering the factors we have seen strong rally so far in the year 2018, mild profit booking decline is possible to post Budget but that would also be short-lived and investors who are looking to enter markets should have cash ready to be deployed.

“Riding the Bull Run, corrections are short lived. Profit booking would hit investors the most who are overleverages and have to clear the balances. For long-term investors, buy on dips is the right strategy,” Ritesh Ashar – Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at KIFS Trade Capital told Moneycontrol.

“The current rally is largely on the back of strong Q3 earning and expectations from upcoming Budget. Investors can remain invested in quality stocks and quality management,” he said.

So where is the index headed?

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst, Technicals & Derivatives at Angel Broking

Ideally, when a particular move is in its early days, it is very easy to project targets. But, the kind of move we have witnessed in last 13 months, it becomes slightly tricky to give any particular figure as a target especially after 30% rise in such a short span.

Technically speaking, for the current year, the next projected level is around 11,700 and then possibility of 12,000 cannot be ruled out.

Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan

The Nifty50 can reach 11,300 over the next few sessions. Various technical parameters suggest that the trend is far from over, though there is the possibility of a pause for a breather.

Among sectors, IT & private banks have led the rally in its recent leg & now Metals look set to carry the baton forward.

Ritesh Ashar – Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at KIFS Trade Capital

We see Nifty at 12,000 levels by December-2018. The last rally was led by small and midcap but this time it could be largecaps which will contribute to the new highs in the market.

We have already witnessed the participation of largecaps in January 2018 which is likely to continue. The foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are also back in action, ad in the month of January till date, they have poured over Rs 5,000 crore.

Pushkaraj Sham Kanitkar, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital

We see Nifty50 rallying towards 12,500 by December-end. Profit booking could be on cards post Budget which should be used to buy in to quality stocks. Investors should avoid going long at current levels and wait for dips rather than chasing stocks at high valuations.

Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan

The last leg of the Nifty move was swift (from 10,000 to 11,000). It just took 50 days to move past this key milestone. As we have a derivative expiry on Thursday, we could see short covering and then a bit of a cool off.

It is heartening to see index getting support from quality large caps e.g. Infosys, HDFC, HDFC Bank, HUL, and Reliance Industries. We continue to be positive on the markets and investors should look out for buying into quality banks (HDFC Bank, IndusInd), NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Consumer names like HUL and Marico.

HDFC board has approved fund raising worth Rs 11,301 crore by issuing 6.43 crore shares at Rs 1,726.05 per share to investors, including global private equity biggie GIC Singapore, KKR and Premji Invest.

Housing Development Finance Corporation or HDFC's committee of directors in a meeting held on Saturday approved to the ""issuance of 6,43,29,882 equity shares if Rs 2 each of the Corporation on a preferential basis"", HDFC said in a release to the stock exchanges on Saturday.

It will further issue such number of equity shares through Qualified Institutional Payment (QIP) to raise up to Rs 1,896 crore

The fund raising would be subject to approval of the members of the Corporation, it added.

The investors to whom the shares are proposed to be issued through preferential allotment include Waverly Pte. Ltd (an affiliate of GIC) - 3.01 crore shares; OMERS Administration Corporation - 1 crore shares; Silverview Investments (a KKR affiliate) - 92.69 lakh shares, and Carmignac group companies - 91.40 lakh shares, Azim Premji Trust and PI Opportunities Fund - I - 28.96 lakh shares each.

The meeting commenced at 8.45 am and concluded at 9.55 am.

In December, the largest private housing finance player had said it planned to raise capital of up to Rs 13,000 crore through private placement, QIP or on a preferential basis in the next one year.

HDFC will also infuse up to Rs 8,500 crore in its subsidiary HDFC Bank — in which it holds 21.01 percent stake at present.

Keki Mistry, Vice-chairman and CEO of HDFC had said apart from infusion in the bank, the capital raised would be used to buy more portfolios into the health insurance segment, investments in distressed real estate assets and other inorganic growth opportunities including buying other housing finance companies."

Four of the 10 most valued companies together lost Rs 21,319.22 crore in market valuation last week, with Infosys and State Bank of India (SBI) emerging as the worst hit. HDFC Bank and ITC also suffered losses in their market capitalisation (M-Cap) for the week ended Friday. The gainers were Reliance Industries (RIL), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Maruti Suzuki India, Housing Development and Finance Corporation (HDFC) and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC).

However, the cumulative gain of these companies (Rs 19,739.62 crore) was less than the total loss suffered by the four firms. Infosys' M-Cap slumped Rs 11,541.88 crore to Rs 2,26,977.90 crore. The valuation of SBI tanked Rs 8,934.18 crore to Rs 2,67,162.06 crore and that of HDFC Bank declined Rs 597.61 crore to Rs 4,85,272.61 crore. ITC's M-Cap slipped by Rs 245.55 crore to Rs 3,20,730.92 crore.

On the other hand, the valuation of TCS soared by Rs 11,600.58 crore to Rs 5,16,934.22 crore. The M-Cap of HUL surged Rs 3,560.56 crore to Rs 2,96,122.31 crore and that of RIL jumped Rs 1,615.04 crore to Rs 5,83,347.34 crore. ONGC's valuation rose by Rs 1,604.15 crore to Rs 2,49,798.92 crore and that of Maruti went up by Rs 939.47 crore to Rs 2,93,964.68 crore.

The m-cap of HDFC advanced by Rs 419.82 crore to Rs 2,73,252.05 crore. In the ranking of top-10 firms, RIL stood at number one position followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, ITC, HUL, Maruti, HDFC, SBI, ONGC and Infosys. Over the last week the BSE Sensex rose by 116.53 points or 0.34% to end at 34,056.83, its lifetime high."
"December 21, 2017 03:35 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfc-capital-closes-1-bn-affordable-housing-fund-2466419.html,"HDFC Capital Advisors, an arm of mortgage leader HDFC, has closed its second affordable housing fund, creating a USD 1-billion corpus, the lion's share of which is flowing in from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.

With the latest round of funding commitment from the Abu Dhabi sovereign fund, and those from HDFC which is the sponsor, the fund has raised USD 550 million as the corpus.

Called HDFC Capital affordable real estate fund-2, it will be combined with the first fund raised in 2016 together creating a USD1-billion corpus targeted at affordable and mid-income residential projects in top 15 cities, HDFC said in a statement today.

The new funds will have a development footprint of 75 million sqft across affordable and mid-income residential projects in the leading 15 cities over the next two-three years, it added.

The main objective of this fund, headed by Vipul Roongta, chief executive of HDFC Capital Advisors, is to provide long-term equity or mezzanine capital to marquee developers at the land and pre-approval stage to develop affordable and mid-income housing.

Earlier this week, HDFC had said it would raise up to Rs 13,000 crore selling almost 5 per cent to investors. This would be the first equity raising by the company in a decade.

The company had also said it was open to inorganic growth in the affordable housing segment and that a portion of the money to be raised would be set aside for this.

The funds align with the government goal of increasing the overall housing supply, including the housing for all by 2022 initiative, HDFC said, adding ""the primary investor in both the funds is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.""

HDFC will be the sponsor and HDFC Capital Advisors will be the investment manager for the second fund. Investor and sponsor fund have committed USD550 million so far.

Commenting on the financial commitment for the funds, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said, ""these funds will play a significant role in achieving the 'housing for all by 2022' objective.

""Affordable housing will not only act as a growth driver for the real estate industry but will also be a catalyst for the overall growth. Since lack of flexible, long-term capital is one of the key challenges facing developers, our funds will focus on providing access to financing at attractive rates and on flexible terms.""

Terming the Indian housing market presents as compelling investment opportunity, Khadem Al Remeithi, executive director, real estate & infrastructure department, at the Abu Dhabi sovereign fund, said ""our investment aims to meet strong demand for early-stage financing of housing projects and encourage continued growth of the affordable and mid-income residential sector.""

HDFC chief executive Keki Mistry said affordable housing is a critical component of quality urban infrastruct ure as also a growth-driver for the real estate industry.

""These two funds will look to partner with developers to form long-term platforms focusing on affordable and mid- income housing,"" Mistry said.

HDFC managing director Renu Sud Karnad said funds will help address the demand-supply gap in affordable housing apart from ensuring flexible financing to quality developers.

HDFC Capital Advisors gives investment advisory to real estate private equity financing and is the investment manager to these two funds.

Created in 1976,the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has been focusing on long-term value creation and manages a diversified global investment portfolio across over two dozen asset classes."
"November 27, 2017 12:02 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hdfcs-mistry-says-consolidation-in-real-estate-sector-likely-in-3-4-years-2447867.html,"In an interview with Moneycontrol's Delhi Bureau Chief and Economy Editor Gaurav Choudhury, HDFC Vice Chairman and CEO Keki Mistry spoke at length about a range of issues from the state of the real estate sector, the money market and possible listing of HDFC Mutual.

Here are the edited excerpts:

What’s your view on the current state of the real estate industry?

I won’t say that there is no demand for real estate or that demand is very weak and prices are falling. In some locations prices have been falling, like the Delhi-NCR region, which is (currently) not the best performing market in India.

Having said that, on a pan-India basis, the demand is good and prices have not really come down in a significant manner. Yes, they have not increased. But barring a few locations, there have been no real reduction in property prices.

We have seen this happening many times in the past that there is fear that prices will come down and people will stop buying houses. Then, something happens in the market and something happens in the economy, something happens globally, which changes sentiments.

There are instances of builders going belly up. Isn’t that a cause for worry?

There aren’t many builders that are going belly up. The builder community in India is a very large community. You must be having hundreds of thousands of developers in the country. Obviously, there are big ones and there are small ones. Some of the very small players may not be doing well, and may be in some difficulty. Most of the bigger ones will be doing well. Out of thousands of corporates, there will be four-five-six corporates that are not doing well.

What is the sense you are getting from trends in the home loan market?

Actually, in reality, there has been no reduction in offtake of credit. Believe me. If we add back the (retail and individual) loans we sold in the last 12 months (up to September), we had a 23 percent growth in our loan book. Because we sold loans, our outstanding loans in the balance sheet increased by 15 percent, and on an assets under management (AUM) basis increased by 16 percent. On a base as large as ours, that is reasonably strong growth. I don’t think demand has slowed down or there is any dearth in demand.

There is a view that despite a subsidy of Rs 2.4 lakh for first home buyers under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), demand in the `affordable housing’ segment hasn’t really grown. What is your view?

The government has incentivised people to buy houses in two ways: one, there is fiscal benefit that is being provided for housing loans. The interest you pay on a housing loan is tax deducted every year. The quantum of deduction is Rs 200,000. The principal repayment of a housing loan is considered as a saving. Repayment of housing loans up to Rs 150,000 qualifies as savings. So, between the interest and principal repayment of a housing loan, the interest rate effect of taking a housing loan may be coming down to 8.4-8.3 percent to as little as 3.5 percent.

In addition, there is also a subsidy scheme (PMAY). It was announced sometimes in late-March. The individuals are categorised into three different categories (under the scheme). The lower income group, which is the economically weaker section, the middle income group 1 and the middle income group 2. In the middle income group 2, for example, if three conditions are satisfied, then on any loan that you take to buy a house, on up to Rs 12 lakh of the loan, there will be a 3 percent subsidy. This subsidy amount will be paid on the life of the loan on a discounted basis. Our average loan amount today is Rs 26 lakh. Of this, the subsidy amount is Rs 2.4 lakh. The customer gets a loan of Rs 26 lakh. But, when he has to pay back the loan, he doesn’t pay Rs 26 lakh. He pays back Rs 23.60 lakh. So, Rs 2.4 lakh is virtually like a gift given by the government. I guess this availability of subsidy has to be more widely publicised.

One of the conditions (for this scheme) is that you should not be owning any other property at point in time. That acts as a bit of a constraint, because most families will have some property somewhere or the other. It may not be in that city, but in their native place. By virtue of having that property they become disqualified of availing of the subsidy.

The second condition is with regard to the size of the dwelling unit, which has now been raised to 150 square metres, which is decent. Most houses in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns will have an area, which is less than a 150 square meters.

The third condition is with regard to the income of the individual, which should be up to Rs 18 lakh a year or Rs 1.5 lakh a month, which is also reasonably alright.

In some ways, the condition of not owning a property acts a disincentive.

It is only the first condition that needs to be looked at.

People who would otherwise be eligible, fall out of the subsidy scheme because of this. We are saying that the subsidy should be available to people who are using the new property they are buying as their primary residence and they do not own any other property in that city. But, if they own some property somewhere else, then it should be alright.

How has the sluggish job creation in recent times affected demand in the real estate industry?

The important thing to understand here is that the average age of a person buying a house is in mid-to-late thirties. The average age of an HDFC customer is 38 years. Less jobs getting created, therefore, doesn’t in any significant manner, change the sentiment of buying a house. What is important is that people who have been working for a long time, continue to hold their jobs. As long as they hold their jobs, their confidence level is fine, their sentiments will be alright and they will look to buy a house.

In India, there are some developers who are operating at an interest cost of 8 to 9 percent, while a majority are still working at around 14-15 percent or even more. Will the latter category survive? Do you think a consolidation is expected?

Absolutely. In the builder community, there are very strong builders, there are not-so-strong builders and relatively weak builders. What has changed over time is that there are more stringent regulations that have come into place. RERA is a not only a very important regulation, but also a stringent regulation as far as developers are concerned. A smaller developer may find it difficult to survive in this regime. So, therefore, it is possible to see some consolidation.

When do you see the consolidation happening?

Next three to four years.

In India, home loans are one of the most secured assets for the lenders as the slippage rate is minimal. Do you think, home loan defaults could rise because of multiple reasons: delayed projects, funds shortage for developers and an uncertain job market?

There are different reasons why defaults take place. What are you talking of are two-three very specific cases, two in the north and one in Pune. Otherwise, by and large, builders going belly up is not a very common thing. People do not generally default on paying dues for a variety of reasons. One, the money is used to buy the house, which in most cases is the primary residence of the individual. You may take a car loan, an auto loan or a consumer durable loan, you may default on these loans. But the last loan you will default is a home loan.

Secondly, all loans that are given in India are repaid through equated monthly instalments (EMIs). In India we have not adopted, fortunately, what used to be very prevalent in the US ten years ago, which caused the subprime crisis, which is `interest only’ loans where you don’t pay back the principal, you service your loan only through the payment of interest. The principal repayment comes many, many years later. If property prices come down, and come down sharply, you can run into negative equity.

In the US, you are not personally liable for the loan. You are only liable to the property that you have purchased. Therefore, a lot of these properties came to the market for sale, which caused defaults. That sort of situation will never happen in India. One, because people are personally liable for the loan, your liability is not restricted to the property. Two, most people who take the loan, stay in the house. There are certain emotional, sentimental and social values attached to that house. Thirdly, the loan is repaid through EMIs, which has a principal component.

What is the status of the proposed merger of HDFC Ltd and HDFC Bank?

It is not in our hands. We have said many times that there are regulatory costs associated with the merger. It is not something we are working on at the moment. The regulatory cost arising out of a merger comes out of the fact that on the existing balance sheet of HDFC, which is about Rs 3 lakh crore, we have a cash reserve ratio (CRR) requirement, we have a SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) requirement, a priority sector lending requirement if we were to fit the HDFC balance sheet into a bank structure.

We had, in the past, sought permission from the regulators to grandfather the existing balance sheet and count the CRR, SLR and priority sector lending only on any incremental funding that we do. The regulators were not in favour of doing it. We have not gone back and represented to the regulators in the last two or three years. Without regulatory concession, a merger is very difficult.

So, the merger is off the table?

As of now, it is off the table. If something changes from a regulatory standpoint, we will revisit it.

Is HDFC’s ownership structure and the extent of foreign holding also a factor?

HDFC’s entire 22 percent shareholding in HDFC Bank is considered foreign. But, 100 percent of our shares are not held by foreign institutional investors (FIIs). Seventy-seven percent of our shares are held by FIIs. So, if we were to merge with the bank, purely only a market price basis without considering any premium or discount, then 77 percent of 21 percent will be counted as foreign and 23 percent of the 21 percent, which is the domestic shareholding, will become local. Foreign ownership will actually reduce in a merged entity than in separate two standalone entities.

When do you plan to list HDFC Mutual and HDFC Ergo?

(For listing of) HDFC Mutual we are discussing with our partner, Standard Life. Once we are ready with a decision, we will certainly communicate. My sense is that in the next 12 months we should look at a listing for sure.

What about HDFC Ergo?

There are no immediate plans. We have not had any discussion with our partner. It is something we will bring up maybe 2-3 years later, but currently there is no plan to list HDFC Ergo as we speak.

To what extent has demonetisation helped cutting cast transactions in real estate deals?

The belief or the perception that there are massive amounts of cash in residential real estate is wrong for the simple reason that tax laws in India were amended a few years ago to say that when you sell a property, your sale price will be deemed to be the higher of the price that you are transacting or the price of that property in the location as determined by a ready reckoner. For every area in the country, the government has put up what should be a standard or nodal property price. If you transact at a price, which is lower than that price, you will still end up paying capital gains tax based on the higher price.

What about secondary market property deals?

I am talking about (the) primary (market). Secondary (market) is a problem. Secondary (transactions) is not in anyone’s control. It is a very, unorganised kind of market. Having said that, if you look at the breakdown of transactions between primary and secondary, more than three-fourths of the transactions will be in the primary market.

Do you think the volume of cash transactions in secondary realty deals have come down post-demonetisation?

I think so. I don’t know how much cash still exists in these markets, because it is very difficult for us to know that. But, having said that, there is fear in people’s mind because of demonetisation, fear that they will be put to task if they have lot of cash with them or have unaccounted money with them. In my view, there is a fear in people’s mind. In bulk of the transactions, there is much greater fear than there was a year ago."

JM Financial's research report on HDFC

HDFC Ltd reported PAT of Rs. 21bn (15% YoY, inline with JMFe) as AUM growth improved to 18% YoY with sustained traction in individual loans (up 16% YoY on AUM basis), while the corporate book grew 23% YoY. Adj. NII growth moderated to 13% YoY in 2Q18. While we expect some pressure on spreads due to recent lending rates cuts, however, pickup in non-individual segment would offset the decline. GNPL ratio remained stable sequentially at 1.14%. While individual GNPL remained stable at 0.65%; non-individual GNPL increased 9bps QoQ to due to slippage of one developer account (of INR 1.6bn) to NPL. Credit cost (including provisions for standard assets) remained stable QoQ at 12bps and coverage ratio increased to 27% (vs. 26.4% in 1Q18).

Outlook

With a gradual pick up in the high-margin corporate book, we expect core operating profit growth of 18% by FY20E (vs. 14% in FY17). We value HDFC using the SOTP method and maintain BUY with a TP of Rs1,890.

Led by robust growth in both individual and non-individual segments, HDFC has reported a strong growth in loan disbursement during 2QFY18. Its overall loan book growth remained healthy at 18% YoY led by continued pick-up in non-individual loan book (+24.3% YoY and +2.6% QoQ) owing to strong pick-up in lease rental discounting and construction financing. Sustained pick-up in growth of high-margin non-individual loan is encouraging, as the share of corporate loan in overall loan book increased to 31.1% in Sept’17 from 29.7% in Sept’16. Reported profit also grew by 15.0% YoY and 35.1% QoQ to Rs21bn led by strong growth in core operating income along with higher dividend and trading income.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday kept its key lending rate—the repo rate—unchanged at 6 percent, dashing hopes of lower borrowing costs for households and the companies ahead of the festival season.

The six member monetary policy committee (MPC), headed by RBI governor Urjit Patel, kept one eye firmly on the rising inflation that is perilously inching towards the RBI’s 4 percent threshold level.

The MPC reiterated that it is imperative to reinvigorate investment activity which, in turn, would revive the demand for bank credit by industry as existing capacities get utilised and the requirements of new capacity open up to be financed.

Recapitalising public sector banks adequately will ensure that credit flows to the productive sectors are not impeded and growth impulses not restrained.

In addition, the following measures could be undertaken to support growth and achieve a faster closure of the output gap: a concerted drive to close the severe infrastructure gap; restarting stalled investment projects, particularly in the public sector; enhancing ease of doing business, including by further simplification of the GST; and ensuring faster rollout of the affordable housing program with time-bound single-window clearances and rationalisation of excessively high stamp duties by states.

Interest rate sensitive stocks are almost trading flat. Among the big banking names, State Bank of India was up 0.64 percent at Rs 252.90 while ICICI Bank was in the red, down by 0.5 percent at Rs 277.05. HDFC Bank and Axis Bank were trading lower in the red down by 0.41 percent and 0.49 percent respectively.

Reliance Securities' research report on HDFC

HDFC has reported a strong 20% YoY growth in loan disbursement during 1QFY18 led by robust growth in both individual and non-individual segments. Its overall loan book remained healthy at 18% YoY led by continued pick-up in non-individual loans book (+22.4% YoY and +6.9% QoQ) owing to strong pick-up in lease rental discounting and construction finance. Sustained pick-up in growth of high-margin non-individual loan is encouraging, as the share of corporate loan in overall loan book increased to 29.9% in Jun’17 from 28% in Sept’16.

Outlook

We reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock with an upwardly revised Target Price of Rs1,995 (from Rs1,786 earlier) primarily due to higher valuation of subsidiaries/associates.

Among the index names, as much as 9 stocks rose to fresh record highs in July which includes names like Power Grid, Adani Ports, HUL, and ITC.

ITC which hit a record high slipped 11 percent last month after GST Council last month raised the cess on cigarettes. But, ITC's Q1 managed to meet estimates, as profit grew by 7 percent to Rs 2,560 crore and cigarettes EBIT jumped 9 percent.

Largecap stocks are playing catch-up after years of underperformance as the economy looks on strong footing, strong global as well as domestic flows, political stability, pro-growth reforms as well as attractive valuations.

“The Indian equity market witnessed a strong comeback towards the end of month backed by strong earnings report and favourable macro data. The major turn in the market comes from a large cap space where we witnessed a strong rally after a sluggish performance in past,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“With improved economic fundamentals favouring well-integrated companies in large cap segment coupled with improved business margin & innovative products at the edge, the large cap stock posted a strong performance,” he said.

Rohira further added that a concern over an increased valuation in mid & small cap stock prompted investors to behold with bellwether stock which also contributed to price movement.

Leading from the front was Reliance Industries which gained momentum soon after announcing its results for the quarter ended June 30. The oil & gas major reported 28 percent YoY growth in net profit to Rs9,108 crore and recorded beat on most parameters.

Reliance Industries rallied nearly 17 percent, followed by SBI which rose 14 percent, Wipro gained 11 percent, HDFC added 10.5 percent, and Bharti Airtel rose 10.1 percent in the month of July.

“Large cap stocks like Reliance, ITC, HDFC, DLF IndusInd Bank and L&T have still left room for upside,” Abnish Kumar Sudhanshu, Technical Analyst, Aadya Commodities Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

Among the index companies, Infosys, HDFC Bank, ONGC, Maruti Suzuki were not far behind and made their presence felt last month.

In July, India caught up on its performance compared to its global indices. The MSCI India was up 7.4 percent, outperforming MSCI EM by 2ppt.

On a YoY basis, India continues to underperform MSCI EM and BRIC indices even as India is now outperforming the MSCI DM index.

Sensex's month on month performance was the best since Mar-16. Further, Sensex outperformed small and mid-cap indices during the month even as Sensex has underperformed the broader indices on YTD and YoY basis, Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Market breadth rose with 82% of the stocks trading above their 200DMA. The monthly derivative turnover rose to a new life high and monthly cash volumes rose to its second highest level in history (first being in June-09), it said.

Largecap stocks have mostly underperformed small and midcap peers but July stood out as a strong month in which the tables reversed in favour of the big names.

However, the large part of the rally came from financials, especially from private sector banks, which rose in anticipation of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and strong June quarter results.

Largecaps do give valuations comfort but growth comfort still lies with small and midcap names, suggest experts.

“We must understand that large cap outperformance has largely been anchored by financials which have higher weightage in the index. Moreover, as the earnings season progressed, most of the large cap have witnessed improved profitability and hence the positive reaction to stock prices,” Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICI Direct told Moneycontrol.

“At the current levels, on a broad base, while large caps offer valuations comfort, midcaps provide growth comfort. We note growth comfort continues to be preferred both domestically and globally,” he said.

He further added that investors need to be market cap agnostic and prefer capital efficient business models with healthy growth visibility going forward."

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) shares touched a fresh all-time high of Rs 1,798, up as much as 4 percent in afternoon trade Friday. The rally was in addition to 5.83 percent upside seen in previous session.

It was driven by value buying, especially after June quarter earnings. Even analysts retained their positive stance on the stock.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its target price on the stock to Rs 1,925 (from Rs 1,791 earlier) and Deutsche Bank also upped target price by 2.2 percent to Rs 1,840 (from Rs 1,800 earlier). Both have maintained buy rating on it.

""We value HDFC's standalone business at Rs 1,925 valued at P/B multiple of 3.4x (same as earlier) which we justify on basis of 1) best in class return on equities at over 20 percent, 2) book consists of highly preferred mortgage assets. The target price includes subsidiaries value of Rs 895. This increase in value is largely driven by higher valuation for HDFC Bank,"" BofAML explained.

According to the research house, the growth story is intact and asset quality remained manageable after Q1 earnings. Gross non-performing loans (NPL) ratio moved to 1.12 percent in Q1FY18 (from 0.79 percent in Q4FY17) mainly due to one corporate account; and retail NPLs at 65bp (versus 61bp QoQ).

It believes that home loan sector is at an inflection point and industry leader such as HDFC is likely to be a key beneficiary.

HDFC reported a mixed quarter as loan growth was higher at 18 percent YoY (despite competitive pressure in mortgages), spread was slightly lower QoQ at 2.29 percent (but higher than 2.26 percent in Q1FY17) - due partly to non-accrual of interest on NPLs.

Retail grew 16 percent, while corporate growth remained strong at 22 percent. Retail loan (72 percent of AUM) disbursements grew 21 percent YoY.

HDFC's profit after tax declined by 17 percent YoY - due to elevated base as HDFC had booked sizable profits on sale of its stake in HDFC ERGO in Q1FY17 and a higher tax rate of 34 percent (30.7 percent in Q1FY17. Excluding this one-off, the profit before tax growth was 15 percent YoY in Q1FY18.

Net interest income grew at 16 percent and individual loan grew by 16 percent with individual non-performing loans steady at 0.65 percent.

At 14:58 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 1,795.85, up Rs 67.35, or 3.90 percent on the BSE.

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC

HDFC’s 1QFY18 core PBT growth of 15% YoY beat our estimates by 3%. Reported PAT missed our estimate by 3%, driven by marginally higher taxes. Continued pick -up in corporate loan growth (+7% QoQ, +22% YoY) helped HDFC to report healthy core income growth (+16% YoY; 6% beat).

Outlook

We upgrade estimates by ~5% to factor in better- than -expected corporate loan growth. We expect core PBT CAGR ~14% over FY17 -20. We expect AUM CAGR of ~16%. Buy with an SOTP - based TP of INR1,900.

Every year with commencement of new Samvat (Hindu New Year), astrologically, based on planetary position, certain new sectors start getting strong astrological support & start outperforming, while some others sectors which were performing earlier start underperforming. Some sectors/stocks remain laggards. Stocks of astrological supported sectors outperform resulting in exorbitant gains irrespective of market behaviour, either bull market or bear market.

Predicting bullish sectors of next Samvat 2074

Every year we release sectors of new Samvat in the month of March/April when new Samvat starts. But this year, we shall prepone release of next Samvat sectors, which are going to get strong astrological support & stocks from those sector outperform markets. Purpose of releasing sectors of next Samvat earlier is that investors & traders should get maximum advantage of down trend of markets by good timing.

We firmly believe that these special astrological positions present very unique opportunities to investors and traders both. This opportunity, if utilised properly, can safeguard your existing portfolio and simultaneously optimise your future investments and trading also. Successful investing and trading is all about good timing only.

Needless to mention our innumerable past predictions, where most stocks from the SECTORS of SAMVAT gave exorbitant returns & certain stocks appreciated by over 500 percent.

During current Samavat 2073 among other sectors – dyes/chemical/sugar sector received strong astrological support & outperformed and gave exorbitant return. Many stocks from dyes/ chemical sector appreciated by over 500 percent

Sectors which get very strong astrological support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

But the index managed to close the July expiry above 10,000-mark.

The 30-share BSE Sensex shed 290 points from day's high, to close with only 0.84 points gains at 32,383.30 driven by the rally in HDFC Group stocks. The index hit an intraday all-time high of 32,672.66.

The 50-share NSE Nifty fell 0.10 points to 10,020.55 after hitting an intraday record high of 10,114.85.

Experts expect some consolidation in near term as the current rally driven by liquidity and hopes of political stability is not commensurate with the fundamentals.

UBS Securities believes that from a fundamental perspective, the risk reward is unattractive.

“From a long-term perspective, these are not levels to be entered into. Valuations are not justified as some of global investors have trimmed positions in India,” he told CNBC-TV18.

Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities feels the Nifty should consolidate after the recent up-move but the bias would remain on the positive side. Nifty has the next major hurdle at 10300, he said.

ICICI Securities also said after a strong rally of over 6 percent in July, the index may undergo a temporary consolidation in the coming month owing to overbought conditions on the weekly scale.

However, the research house believes any intermediate consolidation in the current juncture should also be used as an incremental buying opportunity as it does not foresee the index going below its immediate support base placed around 9700 region.

The broader markets underperformed benchmarks, with the BSE Midcap index down half a percent on weak breadth. About 1,842 shares declined against 875 advancing shares on the BSE.

The Nifty posted biggest absolute gains in a series since March 2016, up 5.4 percent and Nifty Bank rallied over 7 percent in July series but the Nifty Midcap underperformed, up 4.4 percent.

HDFC was the biggest gainer among Sensex stocks, up 5.83 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 1,728.50 as brokerage houses raised target price on the stock post Q1 earnings.

With maintaining buy rating, Deutsche Bank raised target price by 2.2 percent to Rs 1,840 on HDFC as it has factored in higher target price on HDFC Bank that gained 2.18 percent today.

Yes Bank also ended at record closing high of Rs 1,786.75, up 4.33 percent after analysts retained bullish stance on stellar earnings performance and stock split.

Maruti Suzuki gained 0.2 percent after mixed set of earnings. Profit missed estimates due to dealers' compensation on GST while operating margin contracted by 150 basis points due to higher commodity prices and sales promotion & marketing expenses. Revenue increased 16 percent on strong volumes.

Dr Reddy's Labs lost 3 percent as Q1 profit dropped 57 percent YoY due to lower North America sales and GST hit India business. Credit Suisse retained underperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,200.

ICICI Bank, ITC and Idea Cellular fell 1-2 percent ahead of Q1 earnings later today.

Bharti Airtel was down 2.4 percent as Kotak downgraded the stock to reduce with increased target price at Rs 430 (from Rs 400 earlier) as the risk-reward is unfavorable now though execution is solid.

TCS (down 2.76 percent) and Infosys (down 2.16 percent) were under pressure as the rupee hit 1-month high post Federal Reserve meeting.

Kotak Mahindra Bank and Asian Paints gained more than 1 percent while Reliance Industries, Tata Motors and Lupin were down 1-2 percent.

Asian markets ended higher as investors digested corporate earnings and Federal Reserve decision. European markets were flat at the time of writing this article.

Exposure of Rs 909 crore to the large notorious insolvency account Essar Steel pushes HDFC’s non-performing assets higher at Rs 3,513 crore, or 1.12 percent of total loans.

The mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), which reported a second straight decline in quarterly profit, disclosed that it has provided for 25 percent of the exposure and may increase the same unless it gets settled at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

Essar Steel, a non-performing asset (NPA) with HDFC, is one of the 12 accounts identified by the Reserve Bank of India to be admitted to the NCLT for insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

Keki Mistry, Vice-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, “The minimum 50 percent provision requirement applicable for banks does not apply to us…We had made provisions for it (Essar Steel) much in advance. We made 25 percent provisions and would increase it unless it gets settled before that.”

Mistry said the Essar Steel account is an old loan given for building a housing colony and some other work at their units.

HDFC Life and Net Profit

In the first quarter of FY18, HDFC’s net profit fell 16.8 percent to Rs 1,556 crore in the three months ended June over the comparable quarter last year.

The profit reduced because of a higher base in the year-ago period, when it had made a one-time gain from selling a stake in its subsidiary HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company to partner ERGO International AG. On an adjusted basis, the net profit before tax is up 15 percent.

Mistry said, because of the Essar Steel loan, the NPA now stands at 1.12 percent of total loans. Excluding Essar Steel account, its gross NPAs would have been at 0.80 percent, almost similar to 0.79 percent in the June quarter last year.

The profit after tax was also impacted by the high tax rate this quarter at 34 percent compared to 30.4 percent last year as this quarter had less dividend income and no profit on sale of investments. This reduced the profit after tax.

“We expect a sharp decline in tax rate as we would look to sell some of the shares of HDFC in the offer for sale of HDFC Life which will not carry capital gains tax as it will become a listed entity,” Mistry said.

HDFC will file the red herring prospectus for HDFC Life IPO by October and aims to launch the IPO this year itself.

On growth, Mistry said, “Very clearly, the effect of demonetisation is completely behind us. The new business each month is much higher…April to June saw 24 percent jump over last year in demand for new home loans. So, the momentum or push for people to buy homes is high.”

On a monthly comparison, Mistry said the new home loans in February saw 11 percent growth over last February, March and April saw 40 percent rise each over March and April 2016, May saw 27 percent and June saw 24 percent increase over last year."

Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol Research

A mega merger has been initiated with IDFC and Shriram Group agreeing on exclusive discussion. This is significant.

Firstly it is a mega-financial conglomerate in the making after HDFC, ICICI and Kotak. For IDFC, it completes the metamorphosis of an infrastructure lender to a Universal Bank. Finally, for the Piramal Group, it marks an entry into commercial banking.

Details are awaited, but most likely a holding company structure will emerge out of the merger of IDFC and Shriram Capital. This will have the existing non-banking businesses of IDFC (that are presently under IDFC Ltd) and also the life, non-life insurance as well as the retail broking and financial product distribution businesses of Shriram Capital.

Shriram City Union Finance (SCUF) will be merged with IDFC Bank to begin with while Shriram Transport will be a fully owned unit of the holding company and could either be merged with IDFC Bank at a later stage or get de-listed (depending largely on RBI’s view on allowing holding company to own a bank as well as an NBFC).

How does it benefit IDFC Bank?

Ever since its conversion to a bank, IDFC Bank has been candid in its aspiration to grow the retail book and shed the tag of an infrastructure lender. As of now, only 24% of the assets are retail. The Bank had acquired a small micro finance company Grama Vidiyal Micro Finance in the past. A merger with SCUF, a lender catering to mostly small borrowers in rural and semi-urban areas with products ranging from SME lending, two-wheeler financing, lending against gold and small ticket housing finance should help expanding its retail footprint.

However, the liability picture would worsen as the book size gets bloated with the merger. IDFC Bank’s proportion of deposits to total liabilities is only 18% and the share of CASA (current and savings account) is 5.2%. Inability to build up deposit base matching the asset book will impact margins as SCUF will also have to comply with regulatory requirements (SLR and CRR).

Moreover, IDFC Bank with a legacy of corporate financing professionals and the recent hires from peer private sector banks, is culturally a very different entity compared to the small-ticket southern India focused lender like Shriram City Union. While an integration on paper looks simple, the reality might pinch for several years.

The Piramal angle

Finally, RBI’s stance on the merger is critical for Piramals to own a stake beyond 5% in IDFC Bank. But such a restriction will put a valuation cap on Shriram City Union which wouldn’t go down well with the shareholders.

Incidentally, Piramal Enterprises owns 20% in Shriram Capital and close to 10% in shriram Transport Finance and SCUF. Since Shriram Capital has 33.77% stake in SCUF, Piramal’s overall stake in SCUF stands at 16.7%. As this analysis suggests, the upside for SCUF shareholders is limited.

If the deal takes place at a valuation less than 3.5X FY17 book of SCUF, the shareholders of SCUF stand to lose. For the existing shareholders of IDFC Bank, the short run the upside is contingent on the price paid for merging SCUF. In the long-term, however, once the integration issues and the asset liability mismatch are tackled, it can expect to gradually command a valuation of retail lenders.

In the table below we have assumed the deal to happen at a slight premium to the current market price (3.5X SCUF book, current valuation 3.3X book) of SCUF and the entity to migrate to non-performing asset recognition on a 90-day past due basis from the current 120-day.

For the shareholders of Shriram Transport, with is marquee institutional ownership, de-listing will come about only at a significant premium. Given the relatively large book size, a merger with IDFC Bank is unlikely in the near future unless dictated by the regulator.

Is there any stakeholder who benefits?

Of the four listed entities, while we definitely do not see upside for shareholders of SCUF, Shriram Transport shareholders can still expect some respite from premium on de-listing. For IDFC Bank, short-term gains are contingent on valuation paid to merge SCUF whereas long-term gains can only accrue if the myriad integration challenges are overcome within a reasonable period.

For IDFC Ltd shareholders it is a clear big play in the holding company umbrella (despite the valuation discount that comes with it). The non-financing businesses of Shriram Capital are likely to come under the holding company IDFC Ltd.

While Shriram Life with 0.5% market share and Shriram General with 1.44% market share are relatively smaller entities in the respective businesses, it will nevertheless create a conglomerate with presence across the entire spectrum of financial services. IDFC has been an underperformer and as our analysis suggests, there is still a lot of value if the wheel is steered in the right direction.

While lot more details will emerge in the coming three-months, Shriram group’s shareholders should brace for turbulence as Piramals enter banking through a complex merger with IDFC."

Edelweiss Securities' research report on HDFC

We met the top management of HDFC to gauge the company’s performance amidst strong government/regulatory support towards promoting the housing sector. Key takeaways: (1) HDFC has positioned itself well in the market with launch of “HDFC Reach” scheme and has witnessed strong momentum in the government’s credit-linked subsidy scheme (CLSS). This, coupled with preponed demand, probably prior to GST and RERA implementation, has led to strong traction in disbursements; (2) there is a risk of increase in NPAs in the non-individual category given ~INR9.1bn exposure towards a NCLT-referred account. However, with adequate provisioning in place, the P&L impact will be minimal; (3) the HDFC Life and Max Life merger is being restructured with the target of listing both the life insurance and AMC businesses in FY18 itself. Despite sturdy operational performance and potential value discovery, valuation at 3.9x FY19E P/BV (core mortgage) appears fair for core operating profit growth of 14-16% and RoE of 20% in FY18/19E. We maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

Given its market leadership, HDFC will be a key beneficiary of government/regulator’s thrust on housing sector providing visibility on growth. Best-in-class cost ratios and adequate provisioning buffer will ensure steady operational performance. However, with couple of non-individual accounts showing stress, asset quality performance in this segment will be a monitorable. Value discovery through listing of HDFC Life and HDFC Mutual Fund will be a positive trigger. With the stock trading at 3.9x FY19E core mortgage book, we maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ with SoTP-based target price of INR1,593.For all recommendations report, click here

HDFC Life, one of the country’s leading private sector life insurance companies, will decide on the initial public offering (IPO) in its Board meeting in July, confirmed a senior official of the company.

“IPO will happen first for sure. The merger will take its own sweet time to happen. We will decide on the IPO dates in our Board meeting in July. The reworking on the merger would be post the IPO. We cannot keep waiting as we are ready to go public,” said the company official.

The meeting of the Board of directors of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) is scheduled to be held on Wednesday, July 26, 2017 while its subsidiary HDFC Life's Board of directors will be meeting on July 17.

In June 2016, Max Financial Services and HDFC had said they had received a board approval for the merger of their life insurance businesses, Max Life and HDFC Life, respectively.

On asking if there is a possibility of the merger being called off, the official said that as on today the merger is on. ""It could be re-worked and mostly it should happen.""

The merger of HDFC Life and Max Life, which was announced in August 2016, ran into rough weather after the insurance regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) refused to approve the merger structure in its current form.

Here, Max Life was to merge with its holding company Max Financial Services first, which would, in turn, would merge with HDFC Life. Since Max Financial Services is already listed, HDFC Life would get auto-listed post the merger.

However, after the application seeking in-principle approval was sent to Irdai, in November 2016, the regulator expressed concerns around Section 35 of the Insurance Act 1938, which does not allow merger between one insurance business and another (non-insurance) business.

In this particular case, Max Financial Services was a non-insurance company.

As per the agreed valuation and exchange ratio, the relative valuation of HDFC Life and Max Life was decided to be 69 percent and 31 percent, respectively.

HDFC Group was to own a 42.5 percent stake in the merged entity, with Standard Life holding 24 percent and Max Group 6.6 percent."

The momentum which propelled the Nifty50 to reclaim Mount 31K, up 17 percent so far in the year 2017 could well slow down, but there will be plenty of stock specific action.

The index is languishing in a narrow range and most of the stocks have already corrected in double digits in the past 10 days. Hence, if there is a dip, analysts advise investors to pick up quality stocks which have a good fundamental story.

Most experts have a target of 32,000 – 33,000 on the S&P BSE Sensex which translates into an upside of about 5 percent. Investors will be better off staying with stocks which can outperform markets by a wide margin.

“Well, our target is based on fiscal year ending (March). We have a base target of 33,000 for Sensex as on March 2018, which is a marginal return of 5% from the current level,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“This target is based on one year forward P/E of 17.5x assuming that valuation will continue to be on the upper end led by earnings growth. We have a Sensex EPS CAGR of 15% for FY17-19,” he said.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks which investors can look at on dips for a minimum period of 12 months

Disbursements improved by 29.5 percent on a QoQ basis to Rs105.2bn in 4QFY17 as against Rs81.2bn in 3QFY17 primarily due to the revival of the demand post demonetisation.

Further, Government’s effort to revive growth in the infrastructure sector and rural economy in Budget 2017-18 augurs well for STFC. As overhang of demonetization is behind, we expect gradual improvement in performance over next few quarters and reiterate our BUY.

HDFC: BUY| Target Rs1786| Return 10%

The introduction of shorter duration of loans and linking the LTV to the tenure has resulted in a margin of safety for a 12-month loan increasing to 23 percent from 4 percent earlier.

It is time to be stock specific, maybe that’s the approach mutual fund managers are taking right now at a time when the market trades near record highs. The Nifty50 which has come off slightly from its record high but has gained over 17 percent so far in the year 2017.

Fund managers remained selective when they shopped for stocks in the month of May. They remained net buyers in 65 percent of the Nifty50 stocks, Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Stocks in which funds have more than 2 percent stake include names like Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Power Grid, Infosys, TCS, L&T, State Bank of India, ITC, M&M, ICICI Bank, Eicher Motors etc. among others.

Among the Nifty50 names, highest net buying in the month of May on a month-on-month (MoM) basis was witnessed in Vedanta (up 27 percent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 17 percent) and Tech Mahindra (up 17 percent).

The Equity asset under management (AUM) rose for the sixth consecutive month in May to scale a new high of Rs 5.2 trillion, highlighted the report.

In the month of May, MFs showed interest in private banks, metals, consumer, technology, auto and infrastructure — these sectors saw a MoM increase in weights.

Among the Nifty50 names, top conviction buys include names like HDFC Bank where almost 19 funds have more than 2 percent exposure, followed by ICICI Bank with 16 funds having an exposure of 2 percent and 12 funds have exposure to State Bank of India.

Almost 5 funds have exposure in both Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC while 4 funds have exposure in Yes Bank and 3 funds have holdings in Axis Bank.

Rate sensitive stocks have been fund managers’ darling in the last few months especially private sector banks. Private Banks sectoral weight rose 17.3 percent which as the top sector holding in May, followed by Auto (10.7 percent), Capital Goods (8.7 percent) and NBFC (7 percent).

“Since banks are a play on the economy, they can sustain earnings growth for a long time. Particularly, ICICI Bank is attractively valued while HDFC and Kotak are high-quality stocks that have a track record of delivering superior returns,” Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

Among the IT or technology sector names Infosys remained in the spotlight. Despite global headwinds which have contracted margin for some of the top IT companies, almost 11 funds have holdings of more than 2 percent in Infosys while for TCS it is just 1 fund.

Mutual funds are betting on stocks which have good earnings visibility are stocks from sectors like IT and pharma which are facing some headwinds are valued very low.

Some quality names in both these segments are available at attractive valuations which are attracting smart money into these stocks.

“Clarity from Managements of IT majors on underperformance has helped to rope in some Bargain Hunters into the sector,” Rajesh Shanbhag, Advisory Head – Alternate Channels, Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“However, Indian Prime Minister’s meet with US President which is scheduled for this month-end will be closely watched where the H1 B VISA issue is to be addressed,” he said."

“In the case of HDFC, MFs would have added positions due to the whole sector coming under the limelight in May 2017. Among other sectors, MFs bought Shares of metal companies like Tata Steel, Vedanta, JSW Steel, Hind Zinc and Hindalco as the outlook on these companies improved,” he said.

The AUM of Equity Fund increased by 2.7 percent or Rs 13,394 crore to Rs 5.18 lakh crore for the month of May 2017 over April 2017, IDBI Capital said in a report.

The rally was broad based as nearly 100 stocks hit a fresh 52-week high while as much as 35 stocks surged to fresh record highs on the BSE.

As much as 94 stocks hit fresh 52-week highs on the BSE which include names like IGL, HUL, Bayer CropScience, HDFC, Colgate-Palmolive, UPL, Pidilite Industries, LIC Housing Finance, Godrej Industries, Voltas, Motherson Sumi etc. among others.

Stocks which rose to fresh record highs on the BSE include names like Hero MotoCorp, ShardaCropchem, Siyaram Silk Mills, Balkrishna Industries, IndusInd Bank, Escorts, Finolex Industries, Rupa, Laurus Lab, VBL etc. among others.

The Indian market has been fresh record highs on a regular basis in the last couple of months. Benchmark indices are already up more than 17 percent so far in the year 2017 after a flattish close for the calendar year 2016.

Apart from the strong macro environment, the Indian market is also getting the benefit of strong global liquidity and stable global backdrop. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have invested pumped in over $4 billion so far in the month of May.

Given the fact that valuations look little-stretched investors should avoid putting fresh money into equities instead look at diversifying. But, they carry on with long positions, if any.

Analysts are not ruling out a possibility of a further boost if monsoon turns out to be better than expected. The Indian economy is on the cusp of recovery and even though latest GDP print showed slight deceleration but analysts are confident of the growth rate of 7 percent from next quarter onwards.

Given the fact that markets are trading at record highs, some bit of correction cannot be ruled out, but that would be more of a buy on dips. Hence, asset allocation becomes key.

“My advice for investors would be looking at their asset allocation carefully. I wouldn’t be overly aggressive in terms of going into equities at this point in time and be extremely overweight,” Prashasta Seth, CIO at IIFL Asset Management Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“An individual investor has to kind of look into his asset allocation before taking a call. Valuations are a bit stretched but macroeconomic environment is very conducive for equities. It hasn’t translated into earnings as yet but there is a chance that over the course of the next one or two years this will translate into earnings,” he said."

Although, the market gained upside momentum but failed to hold on its gains on the upper edge and witnessed some selling pressure twice when the market reached on top leaving behind a spinning top candle formation on the Nifty daily charts.

The immediate support zone for the coming session is placed at 9,565-9,570 and if the index sustains below these level for long would activate bears in the market.

Top five stocks which can give up to 5 percent return in this week:

UPL: BUY| Target Rs875| Stop Loss Rs815| Return 3.5%

The stock rose for the third consecutive session on Monday and witnessed a very strong closing above its immediate resistance above Rs842. The next trading session will likely to attract some more upside as the counter is gaining strength from the rising momentum indicators e.g. RSI and MACD both.

HDFC: BUY| Target Rs1,655| Stop Loss Rs1,560| Return 3%

The stock has attracted buying momentum during Monday’s session and closed at Rs1,598 with high volumes which is above its immediate resistance of Rs1,592.

The counter is expected to continue its upward rally in the coming sessions as the momentum indicator MACD is generating fresh buying signal on the daily charts.

BPCL: BUY| Target Rs788| Stop Loss Rs741| Return 4%

The stock is headed northwards for the fifth consecutive session where buying was very well supported by rising volumes along with 20-DMA and fresh MACD crossover.

The candle formation on the daily charts is still convincing and is hinting towards more upside to come in the coming session.

Tata Communications: BUY| Target Rs 740| Stop Loss Rs688| Return 4.9%

The counter witnessed heavy buying volumes in Monday’s session as it crossed above its 20- DMA during the intraday trades and touched 50-DMA during the same session.

The stock gained on the back of strong buying momentum which was supported by 200-DMA on the daily charts since past couple of sessions and closed slightly higher than Rs705 which is above its immediate resistance of Rs693.

Power Grid: BUY| Target Rs 221| Stop Loss Rs203| Return 5.7%

The stock has now started moving on the higher side since the last two sessions, suggesting some more positive momentum to come in the next session as the counter has crossed above 20 DMA during intraday and even marked its closing above those levels.

The stock is likely to attract some more northwards movement in the coming session and more upside is expected over short-term.

After State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and HDFC, Axis Bank has decided to cut home loan interest rates by 30 basis points (bps) to 8.35 percent for loans up to Rs 30 lakh for the salaried segment borrowers.

Axis Bank rates are now the lowest in the industry as the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC and LIC Housing Finance offer 8.35 percent to its women borrowers while the rest of the customers are offered home loans at 8.40 percent to boost affordable housing.

The revised rate will be with effect from May 16, the bank said.

For the self-employed segment, the loans up to Rs 30 lakh will be charged an interest rate of 8.40 percent.

On loans from Rs 30-75 lakh, Axis Bank will charge 8.65 percent to the salaried segment and 8.70 percent to self-employed borrowers. The rates for home loans over Rs 75 lakh are 8.70 percent and 8.75 percent for the respective segments.

For all banks, the final interest rates charged will be about an additional 20-60 bps (basis points) of marginal cost-based lending rate (MCLR).

Rajiv Anand, Executive Director, Axis Bank said: “There is a large, genuine and mostly unmet need for affordable housing and the government’s thrust and commitment towards this is noteworthy. The bank has been at the forefront of fostering an ecosystem for credit delivery to this segment and believes that the current downward revision in its rates will help more people realize their dream of buying a home.""

Earlier this month, SBI, which is also the country’s largest bank and has the largest home loan market share, started offering home loans up to Rs 30 lakh to salaried borrowers at 8.35 percent. For loans over Rs 30 lakh, the bank will charge 8.50 percent. It will continue to charge 8.60 percent interest on loans of over Rs 75 lakh."

Private sector player ICICI Bank today slashed home loan rate by up to 0.3 per cent for loans of up to Rs 30 lakh, bringing it in line with the country's largest lender SBI.

ICICI Bank said in a statement that it has reduced interest rates by up to 30 basis points for home loans up to Rs 30 lakh in its bid to boost affordable housing.

With this reduction, salaried borrowers can avail home loans at among the lowest rates in the industry, the country's largest private sector lender said.

Salaried women borrowers will get home loans at 8.35 per cent and others at 8.40 per cent, it said.

Last week, State Bank of India had reduced its affordable home loan rates by up to 25 basis points, offering a lower rate of 8.35 per cent to new women borrowers.

With around 26 per cent market share, SBI is also the biggest player in the home loan segment. HDFC, the second- largest player in the space, offers loans at 8.65 per cent to women for loans up to Rs 75 lakh and 8.7 per cent for others.

This move would be followed up by other lenders both in private and public sector space to stay in the competition.

With paring of rate, ICICI Bank said its customers taking home loans in the affordable segment will also have the option to select the type of interest rate.

In both these cases, the reduction in interest rates is 30 basis points from the previous rates.

They can enjoy the benefit of floating interest rate or a fixed interest rate for the initial two/three years followed by floating rate.

""Further, borrowers can also choose to link their home loans with Marginal Cost of funds based Lending rate MCLR-6 Months or I-MCLR-1 Year. The bank is the first to offer such flexibility to customers. The reduced rate will be effective from May 15, 2017 for new borrowers,"" it said.

ICICI Bank MD Chanda Kochhar said the bank is committed to supporting the government's vision to provide housing for all by 2022.

""In line with this commitment, we have reduced the home loan interest rates for the affordable housing segment. With this announcement, customers of Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Low Income Group (LIG) can avail the dual benefit of low interest rates from us and the Credit Linked Subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana,"" she said.

This initiative, along with the bank's expansion of home loan business in tier II cities, will empower a larger section of customers to realise the dream of owning a new home, she added."

Axis Direct's research report on HDFC

HDFC’s Q4FY17 PAT at Rs20 bn (up 32% YoY after adjusting for Q4FY16 one-offs) was in line with our expectation. Stringent cost controls helped set off impact of high-than-expected provisions. AUM growth was decent at 16% YoY; with both retail &non-individual loans contributing equally. NIM improved 15bps QoQ to 4.1% and headline asset quality was stable (GNPA at 79 bps).

Outlook

HDFC enjoys tailwinds from GoI’s push for affordable housing (extended to middle income households) and benign interest rate environment. It has delivered healthy loan growth (16% average over the past 5 years) on an ever-increasing base. Recent inorganic acquisitions in life & general insurance businesses would also start paying dividends in medium term. Maintain BUY with TP of Rs 1,850.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC

HDFC’s 4QFY17 net income was a slight beat on estimates at Rs 20.4bn (PLe: Rs 19.9bn) on back of lower opex and tax rate. Overall, loan book grew at 16.2% mainly led by non‐individual book, while individual loans continue to grow on softer trajectory of 13‐ 14%. Management reiterated it would target to grow overall loan book at 15‐16% with non‐individual growing at 15‐18%.

Outlook

Here's a round-up of the major developments from the world of banking this week:

* Bad loans ordinance

Friday brought some good news for the banks and the Reserve Bank of India and bad news for the loan defaulters.

In order to clean up the bad loan mess, President Pranab Mukherjee cleared the government's ordinance to amend the Banking Regulation Act, thus empowering the RBI to issue directions to banks to initiate insolvency resolution process in the case of loan defaults.

Banks have been saddled with bad loans worth nearly Rs 7 lakh crore while total stressed assets are to the tune of over Rs 9.6 lakh crore.

The government is giving control to the RBI and banks to target specific stressed assets and take action against chronic loan defaulters.

Is this the right time to invest in real estate?

Among other results, the biggest housing finance private company HDFC witnessed growth coming back into the real estate market. HDFC’s Vice Chairman and Managing Director Keki Mistry sees this as a good time to buy real estate with prices and interest rates at their lowest.

Mistry does not see further scope for rate reduction unless good monsoons and muted oil and commodity prices help.

Housing finance company HDFC share price declined further on Friday, down 1.5 percent intraday on profit booking as the stock seems to have priced in stable earnings reported by the firm on Thursday. Analysts so far have maintained their ratings on the stock after quarterly earnings.

Company's standalone profit for January-March quarter slipped 21.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,044.20 crore due to high base. The profit in Q4FY16 included gain on stake sale in HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company. On sequential basis, the net income grew 20.16 percent.

Net interest income during the quarter surpassed analysts' expectations, rising 26.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,122.6 crore, with loan growth of 14 percent. Growth in asset under management (AUM) was at 16.1 percent YoY, which was also ahead of analysts' estimates of 15 percent.

Analysts expect the stock to give 2-21 percent returns over a percent of one year.

Macquarie | Rating Neutral | Target Rs 1,635 | Upside 4.5%

With maintaining neutral rating on the stock, the research firm increased target price to Rs 1,635 (from Rs 1,570 earlier) after raising FY19 EPS by 3 percent to build slightly higher loan growth.

Macquarie also raised loan growth estimates slightly and built a 16 percent FY16-19 CAGR from 15 percent earlier. Expensive valuations are a key catalyst for the stock going forward, it feels.

With respect to the outlook on the affordable housing segment, prospects look healthy, though supply of affordable housing units could be a potential near-term dampener, the research house says.

CLSA | Rating Buy | Target Rs 1,900 | Upside 21.5%

CLSA assigned a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,900, saying HDFC is among its top picks in the sector.

While disbursement growth was low in second half of FY17, it expects these to improve and HDFC will benefit from push for affordable housing. The global research firm sees 16 percent CAGR in profit over FY17-20 with high core return on equity that will support compounding-led returns.

CLSA was a tad disappointed due to 7 percent fall in fees, which was partly due to low rise in disbursements.

Motilal Oswal | Rating Buy | Target Rs 1,797 | Upside 15%

With having a buy rating on the stock and target price of Rs 1,797, Motilal Oswal says HDFC's retail loan growth is impressive, despite intense competition and a high base.

Over past three quarters, corporate loan growth has also picked up smartly - this remains a key for overall spreads, considering individual spreads are under pressure, it adds.

The research house largely maintains estimates for FY18/19 and factor in compression in spreads by 10bp in FY18. It expects AUM CAGR of around 14 percent, with core profit before tax CAGR of around 9 percent.

On its results, it says the firm's asset quality was stable QoQ, with gross non-performing assets at around 0.8 percent. Individual disbursement growth of 2/10 percent YoY for Q4FY17/FY17 was a disappointment.

Edelweiss | Rating Hold | Target Rs 1,593 | Upside 2%

HDFC's earnings have moderated to lower teen's trajectory, partially due to softer core mortgage profitability, though better profitability of non-core segments lent support, Edelweiss says.

Meanwhile, the company's market leadership, superior asset quality and best-in-class cost ratios will fuel 14-16 percent operating profit growth over FY17-19, it feels.

However, valuation at 3.65x FY19 core mortgage book appears rich. Hence, the brokerage house maintains hold with SoTP-based target price of Rs 1,593.

While operationally HDFC has been steady, valuation at 3.65x FY19 price-to-book value (core mortgage) appears fair for core operating profit growth of 14-16 percent and return on equity of 20-21 percent in FY18/19, Edelweiss says.

At 12:14 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 1,541.50, down Rs 22.90, or 1.46 percent on the BSE.

Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman and CEO of HDFC believes that the demonetisation impact on residential real estate is over and demand for loans has come back since the beginning of this year.

“I don’t see interest rates moving down further. This is the bottom of the interest rate cycle. Only if you have a very good monsoon and the global outlook for oil and commodity prices looks muted then we can see a rate cut. But that to me looks difficult,” Mistry said speaking to Moneycontrol.

Since January 2015, the Reserve Bank of India has slashed key interest rates by 175 basis points (1.75 percentage points). In the last policy in April, the central bank had hinted at a hawkish policy walking a more ""neutral"" line than ""accommodative"" going forward. This means that the scope for further reduction in interest rates is unlikely.

For most banks, currently the 12-month MCLR (marginal cost based lending rate) is in the range of 8-9 percent. After the spread or bank margin, the actual home loan rate could be higher by at least 20-50 basis points.

Property Prices to be Stable

On property price movement, Mistry does not see much movement but expects select regions with excess supply to remain stable.

“On a pan India basis, property prices will move in with inflation but certain pockets will see some movement otherwise... I never think prices will come down but it will be a function of demand and supply. So, if there is excess supply, say in places like central Mumbai, the prices may remain stable or come down,"" Mistry said.

Posting its fourth quarter results, HDFC made a net profit of Rs 2,044 crore. In the same quarter a year ago, HDFC had posted a net profit of Rs 2,607 crore.

Excluding last year’s one-time profit on sale of investment in HDFC Standard Life Insurance, the comparable profit had grown by 14 percent for the quarter and 11 percent for the full year FY17. The company’s average loan size per person edged down to Rs 25.60 lakh from Rs 25.70 lakh last year.

No Cash in Residential Real Estate

According to Mistry, there wasn’t much cash in the primary real estate and hence the demonetisation impact did not last beyond two months.

“In the last 3-4 years, especially after the changes in tax laws, the cash component in the primary real estate market has almost completely disappeared,” he said.

Mistry expects the home loan demand to continue to increase as people have got confidence from lower interest rates, stable property prices and government’s credit linked subsidy scheme (CLSS).

“With media reports saying that prices will further come down, people would have waited in November and December but from January people started buying again because interest rates are at an all-time low and government has also come out with the CLSS scheme which has helped the middle-income customer,” he said.

Under CLSS, for middle income group (MIG) buyers, two income segments are covered. For MIG-1 consumers ranging from Rs 6-12 lakh income levels, an interest subsidy of 4 percent has been provided for loan amounts up to Rs 9 lakh.

Moreover, for MIG-2 consumers with an annual income ranging from Rs 12-18 lakh, an interest subsidy of 3 percent has been provided for loan amount of Rs 12 lakh."

Global factors like easing of political risk in Eurozone post favourable French elections results, and expectations of US tax reforms also boosted market sentiment. The Nifty gained 2 percent (at 9,304.05) during the week despite consolidation in later part of the week due to extended weekend and mixed global cues.

On the monthly basis, the market continued northward journey for fourth consecutive months. In fact, the year so far has been good, with Nifty posting 13.66 percent gains year-to-date (up 1.42 percent in April, 3.31 percent in March, 3.72 percent in February and 4.6 percent in January).

Such a stellar performance is unlikely to continue in the coming truncated week as well as in May. With expensive valuations at current level, the market has to consolidate more before moving towards another psychological 9,400 mark on the Nifty and volatility index also indicated the same trend, experts say.

The market will remain shut on May 1 (Monday) — Maharashtra Day.

They expect minor correction and every dip is likely to be bought. Major correction, according to them, is unlikely due to favourable domestic factors like consistent buying by domestic institutional investors despite FIIs' selling, better-than-expected earnings so far (indicating faster recovery in FY18) and stability in economic reforms after recent state & municipal elections. Lower crude oil prices also played supportive role for the market.

Following the recent run up, Indian VIX i.e. volatility Index, has reached the lower end of the range currently placed at 10.87. As VIX has a tendency to revert back to mean, a reading so low warrants a rise in the volatility in the coming sessions, which could lead to minor corrections, says Prasanth Prabhakaran, Senior President & CEO at YES Securities.

While movement at the Index level could remain muted, stock specific movement on account of the ongoing earnings season could be seen, he adds.

Rakesh Tarway, Head of Research at Reliance Securities says he expects markets to consolidate at current levels in the broad range of 9,100-9,500 levels for few weeks as some amount of consolidation would take place after a sharp up move.

The option data continued to suggest a strong support at 9000 with an open interest of 44 lakh shares in put options. On the upside, 9500 has the highest open interest of 42 lakh shares in call options.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services expects some volatility in global market also due to its influence on next week's Federal Reserve policy. Currently, domestic market is amongst the expensive market in the world with a P/E of 18x on FY18 basis, he says.

According to experts, the only negative factor that can stall the rally (in near term) would be the crisis between US and North Korea due to missile tests by the latter. If that intensified then the Nifty can break 9,000 level, they feel.

Here are eight factors that will chart market direction next week:

It further says channel check suggests, retail off-take in 2-wheeler segment is expected to remain weak followed by pre-buy of BS-3 vehicles in the previous month.

Technical Outlook

Technical analysts expect 9200 will act as a support level in near term and on the upside, 9400 will be major resistance.

Nagaraj Shetti of HDFC securities says the short term trend of Nifty is slightly weak and there is a possibility of minor correction for next week. The overall chart pattern as per larger timeframe is positive and the expected weakness is unlikely to damage the broader uptrend of the market for near term.

The maximum downside levels to be watched for this correction is around 9180-9150 for the next 1-2 weeks and Nifty could eventually bounce back and could register new all-time highs, he feels.

""We continue to maintain initial upside target for Nifty around 9380-9400 levels for the next month (Nifty made a high of 9367 on April 26). The next upside target to be watched is around 9650-9700 levels over the next 2-3 months,"" Shetti says.

Rohit Srivastava, Fund Manager – PMS at Sharekhan says 9300-9274 is a key support zone where the correction can subside and upside can start.

He feels the overall trend remains positive from medium-term perspective, with the respective targets pegged at 9500. On the way up, the swing high of 9367 will act as an intermediate hurdle, he says.

Country's largest mortgage lender HDFC Ltd plans to raise Rs 5,000 crore through rupee denominated bonds (masala bonds).

""The board of directors in its meeting on May 4 will consider the proposal for issuance of rupee-denominated bonds to overseas investors up to an amount not exceeding Rs 5,000 crore under automatic route during 2017-18,"" HDFC said in an exchange filing.

The allowed limit of Rs 5,000 crore in a fiscal is over and above the amount that companies can raise through automatic route of external commercial borrowings (ECBs).

In 2016-17, the corporation raised a total of Rs 5,000 crore through masala bonds, which is the maximum permitted amount a company can raise through such instruments in a financial year.

Also, the Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd (HDFC Ltd) was the first firm in India to tap the route after RBI permitted it in 2015.

Shares of HDFC stock closed 1.93 percent down at Rs 1,537.05 on BSE today."
"April 27, 2017 04:38 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/quikr-set-to-diversify-further-may-acquire-hdfcs-realty-and-digital-businesses-2266953.html,"As Quikr diversifies into new businesses, it now plans to acquire two arms of HDFC - brokerage business HDFC Realty and digital business HDFC Red - in exchange for a 5 percent stake in the online classifieds platform, reports Mint.

While the deal size is estimated to be around Rs 350-Rs 400 crore, the equity deal will fetch HDFC more money. With the new valuation of Quikr, which has risen to USD 1.5 billion (Rs 9,600 crore) following multiple acquisitions over the past 12 months, a 5 percent stake would be worth Rs 480 crore.

Quikr's strategy

The company is venturing into new businesses including real estate, automobiles, jobs, services and customer-to-customer sales. Industry experts say the move can help Quikr penetrate deeper into new properties. It will also benefit by being able to follow up on real estate leads it generates on its web site.

In the past, Quikr acquired platforms such as Salosa, Stayglad and ZapLuk which are into home services, and real estate startups such as Commonfloor and Grabhouse. In addition, recruitment firm Hiree and automobile services company Stepni are also part of Quikr.

What's in it for HDFC?

Through this deal, HDFC will get access to Quikr’s platform to sell mortgages. Also, the broking business is getting irrelevant for HDFC and the company is seeking leads but more refined ones. Hence, it is looking to enter a partnership with Quikr."
"April 24, 2017 04:04 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-reclaims-9200-and-over-250-stocks-hit-fresh-52-week-high-on-bse-2264331.html,"Bulls dominated D-Street since the beginning of trade as the Nifty reclaimed its crucial resistance level of 9,200 in afternoon trade on Monday, while the Sensex rallied over 300 points. If that wasn’t exciting, over 250 stocks on the BSE hit their fresh 52-weeks high.

Asian markets including India rose after market favourite candidate, Emmanuel Macron, won the first round of the French presidential election.

Macron will now face far-right leader Marine Le Pen in a May 7 runoff, with opinion polls on Sunday predicting an easy win for him in the final clash, said a report.

The outcome led to a mass unwinding of safe-haven trades in favour of riskier assets. The momentum picked up pace in afternoon trade ahead of the results of index heavyweight, Reliance Industries.

Experts think that the momentum is likely to continue as the system is flushed with liquidity and the index is finding support at lower levels, which is a bullish sign.

“This bottom-up stock picking will continue. Obviously, when you are in a bull market, you would have individual stocks and areas where you would find short term pockets of excesses and bubble, but on balance I think stock picking continues,” Sanjay Dutt, Director, Quantum Securities said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

“Both fund managers as well as smart money, the private client group is looking for opportunities. Retail continues to be hesitant at the first correction, at the first pause, they tend to run and book profits, but they are also getting confidence slowly,” he said.

The rally in the market was led by realty, banks, capital goods, auto, and infrastructure stocks while healthcare stocks saw profit booking decline.

At 02:10 pm; the Nifty Bank rose was trading 300 points higher at 21,852 led by gains in HDFC Bank, Bank of Baroda, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Canara Bank, Yes Bank, Federal Bank, and State Bank of India.

The S&P BSE Realty index was trading 3.1 percent higher at 1982 led by gains in Indiabulls Real Estate which rose 6.9 percent, followed by DLF which rose 4.1 percent, and Oberoi Realty which rallied 3 percent.

The S&P BSE Capital Goods index was trading 1.6 percent higher at 17,728 supported by gains in Thermax (up 3.2 percent), Fag Bearings (up 2.7 percent), L&T (up 2.5 percent), Solar Industries (up 2 percent), SKF India (up 1.8 percent).

Here’s what experts are recommending:

Analyst: Prakash Gaba of prakashgaba.com

Ambuja Cement: The stock looks good for trading. Investors can go long in the stock for a target of Rs 255, and a stop below Rs 240.

Balkrishna Industries: Balkrishna Industries is another stock that looks good to me. Technical targets on the upside could be in the vicinity of Rs 1,475 zones, stop below Rs 1,400.

Analyst: Rahul Shah, Vice president -Equity Advisory Group, Motilal Oswal

Tata Motors: Tata Motors in automobile space has been languishing for quite some time now. The risk to reward ratio could be favourable just buying it with a stop loss of Rs 437 as the stock can go to Rs 460 levels.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: All private financials are looking quite well such as IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank. But, among three, Kotak Mahindra looks interesting.

“We have seen some longs added and technically also stock has done quite well. My sense is one should go long in Kotak with a stop loss of Rs 872 and target of Rs 910,” said Shah.

GEPL Capital

A lackluster week ended with a loss of 31.40 points or 0.35 percent at 9,119.40 on the NSE. The index has shown a bearish follow-up to the Engulfing candle of the earlier week, with a lower high of 9,217 against a high of 9,247 in the earlier week.

This observation indicates weakness in the short-term and prices may see further price correction towards 8,950 – 9,000 levels. Thus, 9250 - 9275 now remains strong resistance zone.

Higher time frame remains bullish with 'higher top and higher bottom' formation still intact and hence weakness in the short-term towards 9,000 to be a buying opportunity. Change in directional trend will only be seen below 8,950 levels.

Here is a list of top 5 stocks which can deliver up to 15% return in the short term:

Aditya Birla Nuvo: BUY| Target Rs 1800| Stop Loss Rs 1563| Return 10%

AB Nuvo has given an engulfing bullish candle on the weekly chart. On the backdrop, it has created a fresh 11-week high. GEPL capital maintains a positive orbit over the last two & half months, as indicated by positive alignment of shorter-term moving averages like 15 & 25 DMA and also longer term moving averages like 50 & 200 DMA.

A steady rise in delivered quantity accompanied by a surge in positions on Thursday signifies strength. The futures side remains pretty light. “We expect a move onto Rs 1,715 (around 5%) from current levels, which if crossed further may move onto Rs 1,800. A stop loss can be placed a bit below the multiple touch points Rs 1,563,” said Kanitkar.

Apollo Tyres: Target Rs 272| Stop Loss Rs 210| Upside 15%

The stock has created a 3-week high accompanied by a huge rise in the volume. A breakout from a long consolidation spanning 6 months, aided by a fall in crude oil and rubber prices, a raw product basket.

The weekly pattern since March 2017 has shown a bull bias after a good consolidation spanning, 2-3 months. “We expect a move onto Rs 272 (around the 10% from the 52-week highs) stop loss placed a bit below the breakout level of 210,” said Kanitkar.

HDFC: Target Rs 1575| Stop Loss 1445| Return 4%

A bellwether amongst the Nifty50 heavyweights, the stock has shown an all-time weekly closing high, with a strong bull grip. The earlier move from Rs 1364 to Rs 1531 has met with a 38.2% retracement in last week, which saw a correction to Rs 1467.

We feel prices may move in a bounce back till the recent high around Rs 1531 and then may extrapolate till Rs1575. A fair risk-reward seems possible with a stop loss for the trade be placed at Rs 1445, a bit below the 50% retracement of earlier rise.

Bharti Airtel: SELL| Target Rs 297| Stop Loss Rs 355| Return 13%

The scrip has remained perineal weak all through the last 2 years, with recurring selling seen around the Rs 370-380 mark.

The recent move saw the formation of a lower top around Rs355 as compared to the Rs380 levels created in last week of Feb 2017. The same cause has seen a break of the 20-DMA after a gap of almost 3 months.

A dipping RSI around 43 indicates the waning strength in the prices. A break below the 200 DMA placed at Rs335 may put the stock in a downward spiral with possible targets around the Rs297 mark.

The negative move can be negated if the stock manages to reclaim recent top placed at Rs355, and hence the stop may be placed a bit above the level on a closing basis.

JSW Steel: SELL| Target Rs 175| Stop Loss 205| Return 7%

In line with the overall weak trajectory in the metal sector (a 4% correction in the index over the week), the prices have remained falling off the cliff over the whole of last 2 weeks.

The last week once again saw a substantial rise in the delivered quantity indicating a consistent selling at higher levels with the prices waning all through the week.

The relative strength index (RSI) after having reached overbought levels around 72 has softened off a shade short of the 50 mark, showing a waning strength.

The prices are on course for a correction towards the 3-month lows of around the Rs175 mark. The bearish view would stand negated only on a closing above the recent high placed at the Rs205 mark."
"April 23, 2017 03:16 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/hdfc-expects-govts-housing-subsidy-scheme-to-be-game-changer-2263795.html,"HDFC, which is optimistic that the government's interest subsidy scheme will boost affordable housing, has already disbursed about Rs 400 crore under the plan and sees a huge growth potential going ahead.

The Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) to boost demand for affordable housing can be a game changer and help revive the real estate sector, which is facing a multi-year slowdown, and other related industries, HDFC MD Renu Sud Karnad said.

Under the scheme, the government provides interest subsidy up to 6.5 per cent to first time home buyer with household income up to Rs 1.5 lakh per month.

""The scheme can be a game changer. I think, it could be a catalyst to bring about revival in the housing sector, which in turn will lead to very positive impact on the economic growth as almost 269 industries big and small depend on the housing sector,"" Karnad told PTI.

The subsidy scheme coupled with benefits provided to developers on construction of affordable housing will create a extremely positive impact, she said.

HDFC has provided loans worth Rs 400 crore to over 2,900 customers in EWS/LIG category under this scheme so far and has granted subsidy worth Rs 58 crore.

Asked about the target going forward, Karnad said, ""At this stage, it is difficult to quantify. But, we see a huge potential.

""At HDFC, our responsibility is to take this PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana) to the real beneficiaries by educating them. In fact, we have created special teams across the country just to promote these initiatives by the government.""

HDFC MD said the loans for MIG (middle income group) categories have just begun this month.

Last week, HDFC organised a seminar in the national capital witnessing participation of over 100 developers from the Delhi-NCR.

The officials from Ministry of Urban Development and Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation and the National Housing Bank also participated in the event.

""We have also created a special film to educate our staff. We are also visiting other corporates to educate them for the benefit of their employees,"" she said.

Karnad said these schemes can have a domino effect across the spectrum from middle to high cost housing.

""Our average loan in TIER II and TIER III Towns is less than Rs 15 lakh though our all India Average is around Rs 25.5 lakh,"" she added.

Under this scheme, interest subsidy gets credited upfront to the loan account of beneficiaries through Primary Lending Institutions like HDFC resulting in reduced effective housing loan and Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI).

On the eve of new year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced interest subsidy of up to 4 per cent on loans taken in the new year under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana.

In urban areas housing loans of up to Rs 9 lakh and up to Rs 12 lakh will receive interest subsidy of 4 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, while in rural areas loans up to Rs 2 lakh will get an interest subvention of 3 per cent."

Gruh Finance's results don't usually grab much attention because of the company’s consistent performance. Coming from the stable of HDFC (58.55 percent owner), the predictability of its numbers makes it at times almost boring.

All the more reason to whip up some interest and try and understand the company; also, it operates right at the heart of rural India and to understand Gruh is to understand what is happening in that market.

The broad numbers were consistent as ever. After-tax-profit for Q4 FY17 at Rs 110.5 crore grew by 26 percent aided by 22 percent growth in net interest income (the difference between interest income and expense), modest rise in expenses and a steep fall in provisions.

Margins were stable year-on-year at 5.75 percent, driven by 70-80 basis points reduction in both yields and cost of funds. Gruh has rarely disappointed on asset quality and this time was no different. Gross NPA was stable at 0.31 percent and net NPA was nil (0.09 percent in Q4 FY16).

The figure that gave us a lot of comfort from Gruh’s earnings was the growth in disbursement. In the previous quarter, disbursements at Rs 925 crore were down. It was reassuring to see disbursement at Rs 1,255 crore – showing year-on-year growth of 16 percent and sequential growth of 36 percent. Loan growth, too, grew by a respectable 19 percent. Being the first full quarter post demonetisation, the numbers should allay fears of critics who were apprehending lingering stress in rural India on account of demonetisation.

But the moot question for investors remains: Albeit the pristine quality can it still justify the valuation at 10.6X FY18 book?

While we admit that there is certainly no room for any multiple re-rating, we are reasonably confident of the company maintaining 20 percent kind of earnings trajectory. For risk-averse investors looking at high quality businesses with decent earnings growth, a predictable high teen equity return might be worth exploring.

A lot on the macro front has changed for this company and it will remain a key beneficiary of government’s agenda of “Housing for All by 2022” and the recent sops announced for affordable housing.

There have been numerous regulatory provisions for Housing Finance companies. Notable amongst them are:

• Reduction in risk weights from 50 percent to 35 percent for loans with loan to value ratio of less than 80 percent.

• Spread cap on NHB’s (National Housing Bank) Rural Housing Fund (RHF) scheme increased from 2.0 percent to 3.5 percent.

• 100 percent deduction in profits for entities undertaking housing projects for flats up to 30 square metres in four metro cities and 60 square metres in other cities

• Refinance target of HHB increased to Rs 200 billion in FY18 from Rs 170 billion in FY17

• Specific limit for mutual fund’s investment in the debt of Housing Finance Companies increased from 10 percent to 15 percent.

• Infrastructure status accorded to affordable housing

In addition, the recent interest subsidy scheme for the middle income household should go a long way in making affordable housing really affordable for common Indians.

Middle income groups with annual incomes above Rs 6 lakh and up to Rs 18 lakh per year are eligible for interest subsidy on housing loans under the new CLSS(MIG).

As against the initial scheme which provided loans of up to Rs 6 lakh at a subsidised rate of 6.5 percent, housing loans of up to Rs 9 lakh and Rs 12 lakh will now get interest subvention of 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively. With an average ticket size of less than Rs 10 lakhs, almost the entire customer base of Gruh will be beneficiary of the interest subvention scheme.

Although the rather hallowed valuation makes the investor cautious, the stock has unique moats that makes it a compelling idea to look at for the medium-term. The stock hasn’t participated in the recent rally in the markets although it has risen by 43 percent in the past one year. With markets staring at multiple headwinds in the near-term, investors should keep their eye on high quality names like Gruh Finance for an opportunity to accumulate."

The index broke its last three sessions’ narrow range of 90 points (9,160 – 9,250) on the downside and closed below 20-DMA for the first time in the last three month.

This observation indicates weakness in the short-term and prices may see a further correction towards 8,950 – 9,000 levels. Thus, 9,250 – 9,275 remains strong resistance zone.

Higher time frame remains bullish with 'higher top and higher bottom' formation still intact and hence weakness in the short-term towards 9,000 to be a buying opportunity. Change in directional trend will only be seen below 8,950 levels.

Here is a list of top 5 stocks, which can deliver up to 12 percent return in the short term based on technical parameters:

Bank of Baroda: BUY| Target Rs 191| Stop Loss 163| Return 8 percent

The stock has given an engulfing bullish candle on the weekly charts. On the backdrop, it has created a fresh 3-week high in the past week.

The domestic brokerage firm maintains a positive orbit over last month and a half, as indicated by positive alignment of short-term moving averages like 15 & 25-DMA and also long term moving averages like 50 & 200 DMA.

A steady rise in delivered quantity, accompanied by a lightening of positions on futures side, is a positive sign for the bulls. GEPL expects a move onto Rs 183 (around 5 percent) from current levels, which if crossed further may move onto Rs 191. A stop loss may be placed a bit below the multiple touch points Rs 163.

Engineers India: BUY| Target Rs 172| Stop Loss Rs142| Return 9.5 percent

The stock has created a 3-week high accompanied by a huge rise in the volume and even the weekly pattern in the calendar year 2017 has shown a consolidation bias after a strong upsurge seen in the last 9 months.

A strong base creation around the Rs 150-mark, accompanied by a convergence of 50 DMA & 100 DMA as seen in a positive orbit over last month & half. GEPL expects a move onto Rs 172 (around the 52-week highs) from current levels with a stop loss placed a bit below the convergence zone Rs 142.

HDFC: BUY| Target Rs 1575| Stop Loss Rs 1445| Return 6.7 percent

A bellwether amongst the Nifty heavyweights, the stock has shown a down leg in the current month of April. The earlier move from Rs 1,364 to Rs 1,531 has met with a 38.2 percent retracement in the current week, which saw a correction to Rs 1,467.

GEPL Capital feels that prices may move in a bounce back till the recent high around Rs 1,531 & then may extrapolate till Rs 1,575. A fair risk-reward seems possible with a stop loss for the trade be placed at Rs 1,445, a bit below the 50 percent retracement of earlier rise.

Bharti Airtel: SELL| Target Rs 297| Stop Loss Rs 355| Return 12.7 percent

The scrip has remained weak all through the last 2 years, with recurring selling seen around the Rs370-380 mark. The recent move saw the formation of a lower top around Rs355 as compared to the Rs380 levels created in last week of Feb 2017.

The same cause has seen a break of the 20 DMA after a gap of almost 3 months. A dipping RSI around 43 indicates the waning strength in the prices. A break below the 200-DMA placed at Rs335 may put the stock in a downward spiral with possible targets around the Rs297 mark.

The negative move may be negated only on the creation of a higher level as compared to the recent top placed at Rs355, and hence the stop may be placed a bit above the level on a closing basis.

JSW Steel: SELL| Target Rs 175| Stop Loss Rs 205| Return 8 percent

In line with the overall weak trajectory in the metal sector (a 4 percent correction in the index over the week), the prices have remained falling off the cliff over the whole of last week.

The last week saw a substantial rise in the delivered quantity indicating a consistent selling at higher levels. RSI after having reached overbought levels around 72 has softened off a shade short of the 50 mark, showing a waning strength.

The prices are on course for a correction towards the 3-month lows around the 175 mark. The bearish view would stand negated only on a closing above the recent high at the 205 mark.

"April 06, 2017 07:07 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rbi-sees-room-for-banks-to-cut-lending-rates-2254193.html,"Loan borrowers can still keep up hopes of further reduction in bank lending rates as the Reserve Bank of India sees further scope for transmission from policy rates.

After banks announced a sharp reduction in MCLR (marginal cost based lending rates) in January, most banks have kept the lending rates unchanged in the last three months.

“Banks have reduced lending rates, although further scope for a more complete transmission of policy impulses remains, including for small savings and administered rates,” said Urjit Patel, RBI Governor, in his monetary policy statement.

On Thursday, the central bank left policy repo rate — the rate at which RBI lends to banks — unchanged at 6.25 percent. Typically, a lending rate cut is preceded by a deposit rate cut for transmission of interest rates from the policy rate cut.

Since January 2015, the RBI has cut repo rate by 175 basis points (bps) while banks’ lending rates have declined by about half, especially on the base rate.

Although ahead of the monetary policy decision, three banks including State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank and Indian Overseas Bank had reduced their respective base rate earlier this week.

About 67 percent of banks’ loans are pegged at base rate.

A base rate is the minimum lending rate set by banks largely based on average cost of borrowing.

In order to bring in more transmission of policy rate into banks’ loan rates, from April 2016, RBI asked banks to adopt MCLR which is more sensitive to policy rates while taking an interest rate decision.

Post-demonetisation (up to March 31, 2017), 27 public sector banks have reduced their one-year tenure MCLR in the range of 50 to 105 basis points, and 19 private sector banks have done so in the range of 25 to 148 bps, RBI said.

The pricing of interest rates on new home, auto and consumer loans are more or less inclined towards the one-year MCLR rates.

Even as the policy rate remained unchanged since November 2016, the one-year median MCLR declined by a cumulative 70 bps since then.

As per RBI, the monetary policy transmission strengthened in the second half of 2016-17, aided by the surfeit of liquidity with the spur in current and savings account deposits by nearly 40 percent.

During November 2016 – February 2017, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) of banks for fresh rupee loans was down by 69 bps, whereas the average lending rate on outstanding rupee loans declined by 13 bps only over the same period.

This leaves further room to cut base rates pegged on loans of borrowers prior to April 2016.

Earlier this week, SBI brought down its base rate by 15 basis points (bps) to 9.10 percent effective April 1. HDFC Bank has reduced its base rate by 25 bps to 9 percent, while IOB cut rates by 20 bps to 9.50 percent."

HDFC, the country's biggest private mortgage player, will raise Rs 3,300 crore by issuing the largest masala bonds in the country.

""Under the USD 750 million MTN programme, the Corporation earlier on Friday launched an issue of Rs 2,000 crore ($306 million) plus a greenshoe option ($198 million or Rs 1300 crore),"" HDFC said in a statement.

Masala bonds or rupee-denominated bonds are those wherein an Indian company raises money from overseas investors in Indian rupees.

HDFC said it has received an ""overwhelming response from 29 investors across Asia and Europe. The aggregate demand for the transaction was 2.16 times at Rs 4,315 crore ($657 million).""

The Rs 3,000-crore issue of unsecured rupee-denominated bonds bears a fixed semi-annual coupon of 7.35 percent per annum (better price than the previous 7.87 percent) and has a tenure of three years and one month maturing on April 30, 2020.

""The bonds are unrated and will be listed on the London Stock Exchange. This issue is the largest issuance of masala bonds out of India,” it said.

The Reserve Bank of India had granted HDFC permission to raise Rs 3000 crore in December after it exhausted its limit of Rs 5000 crore.

Since then, 68 companies have come out with 383 bonds and have successfully raised Rs 2,00,111 crore using BSE's debt platform, the stock exchange said in a statement today.

The data is available till March 22.

Yesterday, HDFC Ltd and IREDA successfully raised Rs 1,498 crore and Rs 200 crore respectively by issuing bonds on private placement basis, which has helped achieve the Rs 2 lakh crore milestone.

""In comparison, companies raised around Rs 10,000 crore from rupee-denominated bonds, also called masala bonds, in the last 1-2 years,"" he said, noting that investors are now more receptive to the new assets class.

The funds have been mobilised from various sources, including banks, mutual funds, insurance companies, foreign portfolio investors and corporates.

The head honchos of the banking and financial services sector are cashing in on the recent rally in the markets by selling their shares. As the benchmark indices hit new highs in March induced by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s landslide victory in key states, the top brass of HDFC, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have cashed in by liquidating a part of their holding.

On March 15, HDFC Vice-chairman and CEO Keki Mistry sold stock worth Rs 16 crore, while Axis Bank Executive Director (retail banking) Rajiv Anand sold shares worth Rs 1.29 crore. Chanda Kochhar, managing director and CEO at ICICI Bank, sold 100,000 shares for Rs 2.86 crore.

Typically, company insiders — promoter or key management personnel — selling stock is perceived as parameter to gauge the performance of the company and the confidence they have in the firm’s future. For corporate chieftains, selling stock becomes mandatory to generate liquidity to exercise the stock options allotted in previous years.

A large part of the senior management’s compensation comes in the form of stock options which tend to mature at regular intervals and need to be paid for when they get converted, a senior banker said. This is a big reason for the sale in the month of March as the previously allotted options tend to mature in the new fiscal year.

Explaining the rationale behind Mistry selling shares in the market on March 15, an HDFC spokesman said: “The reason the shares were sold was to generate liquidity to exercise old ESOPs, else these ESOPs would lapse as they need to be exercised within a given time frame.” Mistry has bought more than double the shares than what he sold on March 15.

Axis Bank CEO Shikha Sharma had on March 3 and March 7 sold securities worth Rs 2.57 crore.

Responding to Moneycontrol’s emailed query, an Axis Bank spokesperson said Sharma is not a net seller of Axis Bank stock. “As reported on NSE and BSE websites, Ms. Sharma has been consistently buying shares of the bank through exercise of ESOPs and has correspondingly sold shares, leaving her net holding steady,” the spokesperson said in an email.

Given that shares get converted every year and new allotments are made ahead of a board meeting at the start of a new fiscal, many employees sell stock for liquidity. Since stock options are part of compensation, most professionals tend to liquidate their holding to take care of other personal expenses such as buying a new house or education of children."

With commercial banks frowning at the low 5 percent credit and blaming it on weak industrial activity, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said this should not be viewed negatively as corporates are deleveraging on one hand and are raising money from the debt market on the other.

""Credit offtake of 5 percent should not be viewed as a negative because there are number of things that go into credit offtake. Look at the deleveraging that is taking place among in the industry.

""I can give you an example of dozens of large corporates who have sold their assets and have paid pack their lenders with inflows from foreign direct investment. So, its deleveraging that is reducing banks' outstanding credit,"" Parekh told the India Today Conclave here.

Citing the examples of Essar selling its refinery to Rosneft of Russia, DLF selling its assets to GIC of Singapore, or GVK sale to Fairfax as the clear example of deleveraging, Parekh said in the last one year alone, nearly USD 40 billion worth of deleveraging has happened in the domestic industry.

Parekh said another reason for lower credit growth is that industries are accessing the bond markets in an unprecedented manner where the rates are much cheaper than what bank loans, to meet their fund working capital requirements.

""Companies are now accessing the bond markets directly, bypassing the banks. Transmission of interest rates is immediate in the bonds market compared to banking. FDI would be the highest so far that again goes to reduce the debt,"" he said.

As per the latest RBI data, India Inc borrowed only Rs 98,440 crore from banks in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, while they raised Rs 1.8 trillion from overseas in the same period. Out of this, Rs 96,294 crore were through ECB route, and rest Rs 11,500 crore came in through masala bonds.

He said lower raw material prices are also resulting in weak credit offtake.

""Oil credit was a huge amount in the banking sector but now that has come down very significantly following the crash in crude prices,"" he said.

On the talks about a national bad bank, he suggested it should be piloted with one or two banks only. ""Bad bank cannot be for the system. It could be piloted with one or two banks to put their loans in the bad banks to begin with,"" he said.

Parekh said both the Reserve Bank and the finance ministry are working with the Bank Bureau Board at different ways and methods of trying to contain the NPA problem, which has crossed 15 percent in the current fiscal year.

He also hoped that some progress would be achieved on the NPA front this year itself. Media reports said banks have lined up as much as Rs 20,000 crore worth of bad loans to be sold to ARCs in the current month alone."

Technically, the breakout in the Nifty is more compelling with momentum indicators continuing to confirm the market highs.

Unlike the Kospi 200's breakout, the Nifty's attempt to breakout above 8,994-9,191 is being confirmed by its daily momentum indicator, he says.

Momentum and breadth confirmation of a break above the 8,994-9,191 resistance zone would trigger the bullish implication of the 2015-to-date trading range, he adds.

Balanco feels such a move would open the door for a move up to the following target levels seen between 10,350 and 12,000.

HCL Technologies

Macquarie says HCL Technologies is its top pick in the large cap Indian IT services space as the company has been striking a good balance between payout and merger & acquisition investment.

On buyback, the brokerage house says without shareholder nod, company can buy back shares up to 10 percent of shareholder equity and with shareholder nod, it can buy back up to 25 percent of shareholder equity.

The company will consider a proposal for buyback of shares on March 20.

Macquarie says return of capital and US visa reforms are two dominant themes for Indian IT sector.

United Spirits

CLSA has downgraded United Spirits to sell post recent run-up, saying regulatory issues continued as Karnataka government raised alcohol taxes on Wednesday.

It feels tax rate hike will lead to a product price hike of 7-8 percent by the company. Hikes are manageable for the company but it leaves little scope for margin-accretive hikes, the brokerage house says.

Hardening in input prices could raise concerns on margins, according to the research firm. Key stock drivers are SC verdict on liquor ban & effective GST, CLSA says.

Karnataka has raised additional excise duties (AED) by 6-16 percent on alcohol from April.

Goldman Sachs says Karnataka government's 5.5 percent VAT removal on alcohol offset up to 16 percent hike in additional excise duty but there was no VAT levied in the off-trade channel.

United Spirits will need to raise prices by 2-4 percent across key brands, it says.

Zee Entertainment

CLSA has a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 580 as the management expects advertising spending to normalise in FY18.

Company's focus is on improving the viewership of flagship channel Zee TV. Sale of sports business will boost pay-out, the brokerage house says.

JSPL

Deutsche Bank has upgraded JSPL to hold with a target price at Rs 112, saying its upgrade premised on improving confidence in steel volume ramp-up.

Steel volume growth and cost savings will drive 90 percent EBITDA growth over FY17-19, it feels.

Bank of Baroda

Deutsche Bank says for Bank of Baroda, the worst of non-performing loan worries is behind and net interest margin pressure will sustain.

FY18 should witness recoveries on asset quality front, it believes. The bank expects 15 percent return on equity by FY19 and the brokerage house is building at 12 percent return on equity in its expectations.

Deutsche has a buy call on the stock with a target price at Rs 205.

Titan Company

Goldman Sachs has increased its target price on the stock to Rs 521 from Rs 496 after it raised FY18-19 EPS estimates by 5-7 percent.

Bharat Electronics

Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on Bharat Electronics with a target price at Rs 1,800 as it has reasonable confidence on company's orders, execution & margin EPS.

The research firm says better execution environment will drive growth on a large opportunity basket. It expects average order inflow run rate of Rs 13,500 crore per year for FY17-19.

Apollo Hospital

The company highlighted that most of its capex budget has been spent and focuses on improving execution. It is confident of further improvement in pharmacy margins.

While maintaining buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,530, CLSA says focus on execution will enable company to improve revenue growth.

Stronger hospital & pharmacy performance will offset losses in new venture, CLSA feels.

Laurus Labs

Citi has initiated coverage on the stock with neutral rating and target price of Rs 580, saying the company has global leadership in high growth APIs and its move to formulations augur well for long-term growth.

The brokerage house believes formulations related expenses will suppress EBITDA margins by 400-500 basis points and valuations are reasonably fair at 22x FY18 EPS estimates.

Financials

CLSA says HDFC remains its top pick in financials segment as the expansion of subsidy scheme by government is positive for housing finance companies.

Housing finance companies should benefit from uplift in credit demand. Subsidy extension on housing loans can bring down interest cost to 4-5 percent, the brokerage house says.

Consumer

Deutsche Bank has upgraded HUL, Colgate and Emami to buy in consumer space.

The brokerage house feels up-stocking by 'trader' wholesale can potentially benefit staples. It sees 15-17 percent potential upside for HUL, Colgate and Emami.

Jubilant Foodworks, Titan Company, ITC, HUL, Nestle and GSK Consumer are top picks in the space."

Cetrum Home Finance, the Centrum group's housing finance arm that was launched last month, plans to have a loan book of Rs 250 crore by the end of the first year of operations.

The Centrum group is among the early birds from the brokerage space to enter the home finance segment along with JM Financial, after the Modi government began to focus on affordable housing in a big manner.

""We have just opened our first branch in Indore. The second branch will be formally opened in the third week of March in Baroda. Since we will be focusing on a hub-and-spoke model, we will have nine hubs in three states (MP, Maharashtra and Gujarat) and 37 spokes by next March,"" Cetrum Home Finance managing director and chief executive Sanjay Shukla told PTI.

Shukla, who was heading Centbank Home Finance (home finance JV of Central Bank) before joining the Centrum group, said that he hopes to have ""a loan book of Rs 250 crore by March 2018 and Rs 1,000 crore loan book by March 2019"".

On the initial equity capital, he said promoters have already infused Rs 50 crore and will infuse a similar amount shortly. The rest of the growth capital will come in from bank funds. He also said the company will not be tapping the debt market to raise funds initially.

Shukla, a home finance veteran having worked with all the standalone players, was the first MD of Tata Capital as well as the first senior employee of LIC Housing, said they just tied up with sectoral regulator National Housing Bank to draw the benefits from the PM's affordable housing scheme.

He had also worked with ING Vysya Bank, Citibank Mortgage, HDFC and Gruh Finance.

In the initial years, the company will be focusing only on tier 2 and 3 towns in the four states of Maharashtra, MP, Gujarat and Rajasthan, and will be only in the affordable housing space, Shukla said, adding the average ticket size will be in the Rs 15-20 lakh range.

Shukla said the company has hired around 25 now and will have 125 heads by the end of the next financial year.

The Budget 2017 has proposed complete tax deduction on profits from housing projects with flats measuring 30 sqm in the metros and 60 sqm in other cities so that the government attain the goal of housing for all by 2022.

The 5.5 year fixed rate notes were issued by the bank's branch in Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC) and carry a coupon of 3.25 per cent, it said in a statement.

The notes were sold under the RegS format and were offered at an issue price of 99.447, it said.

The bank had given a pricing guidance of up to 155 bps over the US treasury which is around 2 per cent, and the 3.25 per cent coupon reflects an ability to compress the pricing.

The bank had launched the issue, which was a part of its USD 7.5 billion medium-term notes programme, yesterday and the money raised through such offerings is generally used for international lending.

Global rating agencies S&P and Moody's had rated the proposed senior unsecured notes at BBB- and Baa3, respectively.

Assigning BBB- rating to the debt instrument, S&P said the rating on the notes reflects the long-term issuer credit rating on the largest private sector bank in the country.

Moody's Investors Service said the Baa3 rating to the proposed RegS notes issued under its USD 7.5 billion MTN programme will have a maturity of 5.5 years and will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.

Since the past two years, debt raising by domestic companies have been on a low gear given the poor investment climate here. Nearly half a dozen companies raised around USD 1.82 billion from overseas markets in January this year.

Out of this, USD 1.40 billion were foreign debt in January and the rest were funds raised via rupee-denominated bonds, according to the Reserve Bank data.

Keki Mistry, HDFC’s vice chairman and CEO, on Monday said that boards of companies should consider offering stock options to independent directors to improve their compensation standards. Mistry was speaking at an event of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

“Globally, providing Esops [Employee Stock Ownership Plans] to independent directors has been a common practice to attract better talent,” he said. The role and functioning of, and compensation to, independent directors have in recent times become an issue of debate and concern, as has the issue of their ‘independence’, itself.

“More than in any other time in history, boardroom discussions are focussed on issues of corporate governance, accountability and disclosures. The voice of shareholder activism has never been louder and the focus of regulators has never been so intense,” Mistry added.

But he declined to comment specifically on matters relating to the boardroom conflict seen at Tata Sons or the more recent public spat between the Infosys board and its founders, saying, “what happens in any company is best known to them than to the outside world.”

More such stories from Forbes India

The cases of Infosys and Tata Sons have raised several questions of trust within the board, the role of independent directors and issues relating to resolution of conflict.

Mistry, who is also chairman of the National Council of Corporate Governance, also suggested introducing the concept of a ‘lead independent director’ on company boards to improve accountability and try to resolve matters of conflict.

“Conflict resolution is important. When there is a conflict between the chairman and directors it is important to have a lead independent director. Every company must have a lead ID, as in the West. This is present in India, but in a small way and yet to be formalised,” he said.

“Trust but verify has become the new motto for institutional investors as they seek to monitor their investments in listed companies. The issue is not how to prevent dishonesty but how to make dishonesty accountable in a timely and meaningful manner,” Mistry said.

Mistry advised that to tackle controversial topics, the chairman of a company should speak to independent directors outside the boardroom. “This ensures that everyone can express their views frankly.”

Former Sebi chairman, M Damodaran, who was attending the CII event, agreed with Mistry and called for allowing stock options to independent directors.(This article was first published in Forbes India.)"

The move assumes significance in the wake of the government's push for the low-cost housing sector.

According to the big wigs of the housing finance industry, this move will help get an increased flow of capital in the underlined companies.

Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman and CEO of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) said, “It is positive. The total debt funds in the mutual fund industry is roughly about Rs 12 lakh crore. So, this should release an additional capital of Rs 60,000 crore, so we have more funds now. Mutual funds would definitely want to deploy more money where they get higher returns with lesser risks. Affordable housing is definitely that space.”

The additional funds will come the way of the top rated housing finance companies from this move.

“Out of the total AUM, debt mutual funds are worth 10 lakh crore and 15% of this has been allowed to invest in housing finance companies,” said Mahendra Jajoo, Head-Fixed Income, Mirae Asset Global Investment.

“Companies like DHFL, HDFC Ltd, LIC Housing will be benefitted from the hike in investment limit,” he added.

Mutual funds tend to invest only in the top-rated companies, which are just a handful right now, this Rs 60,000 crore could go to only three or four players. As per the new norms from SEBI, debt mutual funds can now invest up to 15% of their total net assets in housing finance companies. The norms have been relaxed as part of the efforts to channelize more funds towards affordable housing activities. Earlier the debt mutual funds were allowed to have an exposure of only up to 10% as regards housing finance companies. In a circular, SEBI has stated mutual funds would need to ensure that the additional exposure to the securities issued by housing finance companies have high investment grade rating. Besides, the entities should have been registered with the National Housing Bank (NHB). The guidelines for sectoral exposure in debt oriented mutual fund schemes put a limit of 25 percent at the sector level and an additional exposure not exceeding 10 percent (over and above the limit of 25 percent) in financial services sector only for HFCs. ""In light of the role of housing finance companies especially in affordable housing and to further the government's goal under Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana (PMAY), it has now been decided to increase additional exposure limits provided for HFCs in financial services sector from 10 percent to 15 percent,"" SEBI stated."

The company's networth stands at USD 12.4 billion. According to buyback rules, if TCS wants to avoid a shareholder nod, it can opt for a 10 percent buyback of shares which would be around USD 1.24 billion. With a shareholder approval, the company can go up to a 25 percent share buyback which will be USD 3.1 billion. A 25 percent buyback would not be difficult for the company, whose cash on books currently is at Rs 43,169 crore (USD 6.4 billion). Promoters of the company, who hold around 73.3 percent stake, are likely to participate in the buyback. If they don't, their total holding will cross the 75 percent mark, which is against Sebi rules. Analysts also believe the buyback is likely to be marginally EPS accretive, as it enjoys a 6-7 percent earnings yield, which is a little more than the yield it enjoys on cash. If the buyback is going to be in lieu of the company's dividends, then investors may be left dissapointed. TCS' dividend payout in the previous fiscal was at Rs 43.50 per share.

The 30-share BSE Sensex fell 18.33 points to 28315.92 and the 50-share NSE Nifty lost 1.95 points to 8791.60 despite positive Asian cues.

Global fund reallocation is positive for the Indian geography amongst the emerging markets, and new fund flows are likely, he feels.

Growth of the auto industry is expected to continue in 2017 across all vehicle categories-commercial and passenger vehicles, as well as two and three-wheelers. But it is unlikely that the industry will maintain the sales growth of 2016 due to the note ban impact and the uncertainty regarding the GST, says Dun & Bradstreet in a report.

The report, however, does not quantify its proejction.

In 2016, auto sales grew 9.2 percent driven by two- wheelers that moved up by 9.6 percent from 0.7 percent in 2015. At the same time, cars clipped at 7 percent and commercial vehicles grew 7.8 percent.

Key things to watch out for would be net interest margin, asset under management and asset quality.

Analysts say if net interest margin comes above 3.75 percent (against 3.8 percent in Q2), asset under management at 15 percent and gross non-performing assets below 0.85 percent (against 0.75 percent in Q2) then that will be positive.

Foreign institutional investor (FII) selling in emerging markets (EMs) has been relentless recently and among EMs, fund managers are trying to figure out which are expensive and which deserve to be expensive, he said.

Post Budget, there is no rush for foreign money to flood in to the market and instead even if the source of FII selling dries up and domestic investors remain emboldened — encouraged due to the Budget provisions — there is a reasonable chance that the market might have put in a bottom, he further added.

11:45 am FII view: Ridham Desai of Morgan Stanley says there is a high level of uncertainty caused by the currency exchange, the upcoming Union Budget, general anti-avoidance rule (GAAR) and GST implementation, impending state elections, and flux in US policy.

However, valuations are attractive and set the case in favour of stocks, he feels.

He is overweight on consumer discretionary, financials, and technology and underweight on consumer staples, energy, materials and telecom.

In focus list, Desai says he is replacing LIC Housing Finance with analysts' favoured non-banking finance stock, Bajaj Finance.

Oil prices inched up supported by a weaker dollar and expectations that OPEC and other producers will cut output as part of a deal to curb global oversupply. Traders said that prices were buoyed by a weakening dollar, which makes fuel purchases cheaper for countries that use other currencies domestically, potentially spurring demand.

Geojit BNP Paribas' research report on HDFC

Net Interest Income (NII) grew 10.8% YoY in H1FY17 mainly driven by 17% YoY growth in individual loan segment. However, net interest margin (NIM) declined 7 bps YoY to 3.1% mainly due to increased competition and reduction in the proportional contribution of higher yielding corporate loan book. With rising share of individual loans, we expect NIM to remain around current level over FY16-18E. The company reported adjusted net profit growth of 9.3% YoY to Rs 3,242cr. We expect adjusted net profit (excluding one-off income) to increase at a healthy CAGR of 14.2% over FY16-18E backed by higher NII and lower operating expenses.

Outlook

While the housing finance sector may see some near-term pain, the long-term prospects of HDFC remain intact given its competitive edge over its peers through strong growth in business, stable margin and well-managed asset quality. Further, other key components i.e. HDFC bank, Gruh finance, Insurance and Asset management businesses too will continue to strongly contribute to the parent’s valuation. Hence, we assign BUY rating on the stock with a TP of Rs 1,400 based on sum of the parts (SOTP) methodology where we value its standalone business at Rs814 (P/ABV of 3.0x for FY18E) and subsidiaries at Rs 586.

Most economists believe the RBI will cut the repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to a six-year low of 6.00 percent at a policy review, and follow that with at least one easing next year after the scrapping of high-value bank notes severely curbed consumer demand.

Oil prices eased early in Asia as crude output rises in virtually every major export region despite plans by OPEC and Russia to cut production, triggering fears that a fuel glut that has dogged markets for over two years might last well into 2017.

9:45 am Expert take on Italy Referendum: Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned after suffering a heavy defeat in a referendum over his plan to reform the constitution. The defeat has raised questions about market stability, but analysts at UBS and JP Morgan feel that the markets will take the jitters in their stride. Italian referendum is unlikely to have as big an impact as that from Brexit or Donald Trump’s victory in the recently-concluded US Presidential elections, Geoffrey Dennis of UBS Investment Bank told CNBC-TV18. Strong US jobs data only adds to the view that the US Federal Reserve will raise rates now, he said, adding that global markets have already priced in a rate hike by the US Fed mid-December. He further said that UBS expects two rate hikes by the US Fed next year. James Glassman of JPMorgan told CNBC-TV18 that Italian vote count and Renzi’s resignation was on expected lines and hence market reaction to the outcome of the referendum will be limited.9:30 am FII view: Christopher Wood of CLSA says the issue for financial markets is whether a further bond riot would start to prove negative for equities.

He says Greed & fear's guess is that, at some point between 2.5 percent and 3 percent percent on the 10-year Treasury, equity investors would start to view the scale of the bond sell-off as negative.

That in turn could pose trouble for widely followed 'risk parity' strategies which would not do well in an environment where bonds and stocks went down together, a double whammy that has not happened in America on a quarterly basis since Q109, he feels.

9:30 am FII view: Laurence Balanco of CLSA says tactically, he is looking for a minor pullback to relieve the momentum extremes seen in leading markets (US and Japanese equities, US dollar, US 10-year yield, copper).

While these extremes warn of a short-term reversal, the fact that momentum has confirmed the highs suggests that such a pullback should be short-lived and followed by further gains into Q1 2017, he adds.

He says the Achilles heel to this equity market advance would be a US 10-year yield breaking above 3.05 percent, which is the resistance zone provided by the upper boundary of the 35-year downtrend channel.

It is also close to the level where the rolling 12-month correlation between the S&P 500 and the US 10-year yields switches from positive to negative, Balanco feels.
