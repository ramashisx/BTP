2023-11-20 13:10:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sam-altmans-ouster-unlikely-to-impact-openais-partnerships-with-it-companies-experts-11771841.html,"Sam Altman, former CEO, OpenAI

The ouster of Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO and the face of the AI boom, is unlikely to have a long-term impact on the company’s existing business partnerships with Indian IT services companies and the pace of generative AI innovations, said industry experts.

Over the past year, even as demand continued to slow down in a tough business environment, IT companies banked on customers’ generative AI curiosity to win deals, leading to billions of dollars being invested to develop industry-specific use cases of the technology and upskilling employees.

Altman’s abrupt firing on November 17, shook the technology world as it comes at a time when competition from big tech rivals Google, IBM and NVIDIA is intensifying.

In the short run, said Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of management consulting firm Everest Group, Altman’s exit is unlikely to affect OpenAI’s partnerships and commercial agreements. But in the long run, it may affect the company’s ability to raise capital, which could make it a less attractive partner, he told Moneycontrol.

OpenAI, which started as a ‘non-profit’ organisation, later transitioned to a hybrid ‘capped-profit’ company, letting it raise funds externally, while ensuring that the original non-profit operation would still benefit. It has so far raised $10 billion from Microsoft at a valuation of almost $30 billion, as it invests in building computing capacity.

This structure, however, led to a lot of confusion reports suggest. OpenAI is structured in a way that the non-profit owns and controls a subsidiary that received funds from Microsoft, causing Altman to not have a say in the AI unicorn’s boardroom workings.

According to the company’s charter, its principal beneficiary is “humanity”, not investors.

Phil Fersht, CEO, HFS Research, a global business research consultancy, expects confusion and some chaos in the short term. The whole episode, he said, smells like a “coup d'état, with Altman becoming too powerful and not pandering to the OpenAI board”.

“However, the AI revolution has so much momentum, with many enterprise clients seeking so much support and advice from leading services firms when it comes to AI, that services firms will work even harder with Altman’s successor to ensure continuity and progressive value as these technologies evolve and mature,” he told Moneycontrol.

IT services companies such as Accenture, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra have in recent times been in overdrive to build their AI capabilities and offerings.

Billions at stake

While not pertaining to OpenAI’s ChatGPT alone, generative AI’s current boom has seen billions being invested by IT companies to develop the tech with ChatGPT and other partners like Google. IT companies have already charted their next few years of business growth around AI’s rapid evolution.

As of Q2FY24, TCS already has more than 250 generative AI opportunities in the pipeline and it has completed training over 100,000 employees in this field.

Infosys had over 50 active generative AI projects in the pipeline. In fact, it announced three large deals in Q2: a $2-billion contract with an existing customer to provide AI and automation-led development and maintenance services over five years; a $1.5-billion deal with Liberty Global over five years; and an MoU that was signed for $1.5 billion, where the spend is over 15 years.

HCLTech, too, had earlier said that it has over 140 external and internal generative AI projects at various stages of maturity—from PoCs to implementation. The company will be training around 20,000 associates in generative AI skills and has set up three global labs.

Meanwhile, Wipro is investing $1 billion to strengthen its AI capabilities over the next three years. It will train 250,000 associates in required skills. Accenture is investing $3 billion to enhance data and AI capabilities in the next three years.

Internally, too, these companies have started seeing an increase of up to 30 percent in productivity by using generative AI for coding and several other functions.

But now, as OpenAI’s future remains uncertain, it’s going to be up to the partners or the IT services companies to “determine the level of risk / reward they want to be in with OpenAI or go with Sam’s new company,” said Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research, a technology advisory firm.

Queries sent to TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Capgemini and LTIMindtree didn’t elicit any responses at the time of publishing. Any comments from the companies will be updated in this article later.

Beyond OpenAI

Also, analysts unanimously believed that while ChatGPT got the ball rolling for generative AI in November 2022, giving investor Microsoft a head start, the quick catchup by Google and other rivals have made the technology and its future prospects too big to fail or to be controlled by one company.

As Bendor-Samuel put it, “The cat is out of the bag, and the Gen AI race is on, without regard to what happens at open AI. There is so much investment in this area that even if Open AI stumbles the overall pace of innovation will continue unabated.”

Fersht added, “If OpenAI derails as a result of this, it will hinder innovation in the short term, but nothing is slowing the pace of innovation in AI, and we’ll see other entities emerging at the forefront of this rapidly evolving industry,” he added.

Security and governance concerns

Moreover, the biggest takeaway for enterprise customers right now from Altman’s exit will be to focus on improving and fixing security and governance loopholes amidst fast-paced innovation. This was one of the primary concerns of OpenAI’s board amid Altman’s aggressive push on releasing new features and innovations, as security may have taken a backseat.

“The balance between too much governance and not enough innovation was the challenge the board faced,” said Wang. “The big worries were ownership of training data, impact of untested models, unwanted bias detection. Google has been the most careful and the most innovative. Microsoft has been very careful and the most adaptive. OpenAI was the least careful and the fastest innovator.”

Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder and CEO of market intelligence firm Greyhound Research concurred, adding that the company had faced flak for issues around ethical use of data to train the model and, more importantly, the intellectual property and compliance issues that customers can face.

""This is because Microsoft, as a key investor, is already significantly using the technology in their products, and this commercialisation is not the agenda with which the company was founded,” he told Moneycontrol.

Fersht added that concerns surrounding trust, security and compliance are massive for enterprises when it comes to AI and are only just starting to exacerbate.

Manish Maheshwari, former Twitter India head and co-founder of Fanory.ai, a platform that leverages AI for creators, believes OpenAI's recent move to part ways with Altman signals a significant shift towards prioritising ethical AI development over immediate commercial benefits.

“At the heart of Silicon Valley's evolving ethos is a deep-seated tension between commercial success and ethical technology development…This decision, while bold, has left many in the tech industry both surprised and contemplative about the future direction of AI,"" he said.",1178,-0.1607093328521365

IT services industry veteran Peeyush Dubey is joining Tech Mahindra as its new chief marketing officer. Dubey announced this on X (formerly Twitter) on November 14, days after the company's CEO designate Mohit Joshi shared that a new CMO has been appointed by Tech Mahindra as a part of the ongoing internal restructuring.

Prior to joining Tech Mahindra, Dubey was the CMO at both Mindtree and LTI until 2022, when he joined AI analytics solutions firm TheMathCompany. He comes with nearly three decades of experience in the IT services industry, having worked for over a decade with Infosys as a global marketing head.



I am thrilled to share I have joined @tech_mahindra as CMO! Look forward to contributing to the next phase of growth of this iconic brand.

— Peeyush Dubey (@ThePeeyushDubey) November 13, 2023

Dubey is yet another former colleague and Infosys leader hired by Joshi, who joined the company after a long-standing career with Infosys. Joshi has already hired Atul Soneja who too was an Infosys veteran, as the chief operating officer (COO) at Tech Mahindra.

Moneycontrol had exclusively reported last week that Tech Mahindra is tapping Richard Lobo, the former executive vice president and head of human resources at Infosys to join as the company's chief human resource officer (CHRO). Lobo is currently an HR consultant and strategic advisor at embattled edtech unicorn BYJU’s.

Tech Mahindra's restructuring

During the company's Q2FY24 earnings conference on October 26, Joshi officially announced the internal restructuring, wherein the company will now have a vertical-wise focus for delivery instead of Tech Mahindra’s previous geography-focused structure. Overall, Joshi has created six focused business units: Americas Communication, Americas Technology Media, Americas Diversified, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan), and India.

.

The reshuffle, which will be effective January 1, will see some top leaders take on new roles. As part of that change, the current CHRO and head of marketing, Harshvendra Soin, is shifting his base to Australia to lead the consolidated Asia Pacific and Japan business.

Joshi had also said in the conference that the company has made an offer to the new chief marketing officer, who will come on board in the next few months; and is in the process of looking for a new CHRO.",402,0.9996700286865234

Top Indian IT companies including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys continue to gain favour among enterprise customers in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and others, amidst a cut in tech budgets and macroeconomic weaknesses persisting in the overall European and US markets.

The Nordic IT services market within Europe grew to $29.5 billion in 2023 from $24.4 billion in 2018, according to data from UnearthInsight. To be sure, this is still a relatively smaller IT services market by size as compared to the United Kingdom and continental Europe.

The top Indian IT companies, which also include HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra, have been expanding their presence in the Nordic region by building centres, framing localised strategies and hiring a dedicated employee base in these countries.

TCS has almost 20,000 employees in the Nordic countries and also one of its biggest customers, Telenor, as per UnearthInsight’s data. TCS’ headcount has doubled from about 9,000 in 2018.

Infosys has over 2,500 employees in the region. It opened a centre in Sweden in December last year. Wipro has over 2,000 employees and HCLTech has about 1,600 employees in the region.

After sustained growth in Finland, Tech Mahindra announced a new local innovation centre in Espoo in September.

Experts and analysts called this demand uptick from Nordic customers a reflection of the price competitiveness, ability to become long-term strategic digital transformation partners, and the quality hi-tech services provided by Indian IT services companies.

Pricing opportunities

“If you look at a differential between a local tech services or global tech services firm versus Indian tech services firm, it's easily 10 percent to 15 percent, or in some cases, up to 18 percent,” said Gaurav Vasu, founder of market intelligence firm UnearthInsight. “Infosys’ Danske Bank deal is a good example of the growing popularity of Indian IT services firms.”

Infosys bagged a five-year digital transformation deal worth $454 million from Danske Bank in June 2023.

Vasu said that inflationary pressures are expected to continue in the Nordics too, but instead of curtailing overall tech spending, they are opting for vendor partners with strategic capabilities.

“They are open to choosing more optimal partners who can help them sustain at 4-5 percent of revenue, as technology spend reduces from about 6 percent over the next three to five years. European clients believe Indian pure plays will actually help them with around 1.5 to 2 percent cut and partner with them to sustainably deliver the outcomes,” he added.

How deal wins trended for the Indian IT companies in Nordics

Pareekh Jain, founder of EIIRTrend, said a lot of the business from regional service providers are now going to Indian IT companies in the Nordics.

“Indian IT firms are seeing more market share in these regions as compared to global counterparts. As technology is improving, these IT firms are able to invest in new technologies at a scale that regional service providers might not be able to… Only MNCs can invest,” Jain told Moneycontrol.

He added, “Nordics is the first preference for the Indian IT companies outside their other core geographies because it’s easier to access. There aren't many language constraints as most people speak English. Also, unlike countries like Germany and France, Nordics are more open to outsourcing and do a lot of business in other countries.”

Vasu said Europe-specific tech partners have not been able to manage the cost inflation situation and the pricing situation as well as Indian players.

Spending recovery

According to data from technology research and advisory firm ISG, Nordic expenditure on managed-services outsourcing is now close to pre-pandemic levels. The managed-services business recorded a 9 percent increase in annual contract value in the first half of 2023.

Chris Owen, principal consultant, Nordics, ISG, said this growth in tech spending across the Nordics was driven by the manufacturing and financial services sectors. Even the recent fall of the region’s currencies, especially against the dollar and the euro, played a role.

“This has increased the pressure on companies with local revenue bases to optimise costs via technology-driven transformation, alongside partners with accelerators to help. The primary driver, however, continues to be access to talent, partnering with experts to help organisations on their digital journey, and the maturity of the Nordic enterprise buyers is high (some even 4th generation outsourcers now). So we see this being procured from a truly global mix of providers, albeit ones who offer at least some local delivery resource,” Owen told Moneycontrol.

While the Indian IT companies have had customers in the Nordics, the market has accelerated in recent years and they are looking at it more strategically because the US and European markets remain uncertain, EIIRTrend’s Jain said.

Nordic companies are also more open to selling their captive centres as not many of them were big and scaled-up, he added.",816,0.44768221269954334

Tech Mahindra is in talks with Richard Lobo, former executive vice president and head of human resources at Infosys, to take on a global role as the company’s chief human resource officer (CHRO), people in the know told Moneycontrol. The IT services major is currently undergoing a leadership restructuring with CEO-designate Mohit Joshi set to take over from December.

An Infosys veteran, Lobo is currently an HR consultant and strategic advisor at embattled edtech unicorn BYJU’s. He was Joshi’s colleague at Infosys. Joshi was a president at Infosys overseeing several functions, including financial services, insurance, healthcare & life sciences and sales operations.

Moneycontrol has learned that Lobo is currently evaluating three offers: from Cognizant for the role of India HR head; from Tech Mahindra for a global CHRO role; and from a listed Indian IT company, whose name could not be ascertained.

Cognizant CEO Ravi Kumar S, too, is an Infosys veteran, who served as the company’s president.

Both Joshi and Kumar had non-poaching agreements with Infosys for a year, to be served from the date of their resigning. Kumar joined Cognizant in January 2023 and the clause may no longer be applicable in his case. Joshi, however, may still be bound by it.

But that wouldn’t be a hurdle in hiring Lobo, as he resigned from Infosys a few months ago and has been working at a different company, BYJU’s, ever since.

Joshi also recently hired another Infosys veteran, Atul Soneja, as the chief operating officer (COO). Prior to joining Tech Mahindra, Soneja was the COO of CitiusTech for two years.

Tech Mahindra didn’t comment on detailed queries sent by Moneycontrol at the time of publishing and Lobo, too, could not be reached for comment. This article will be updated to reflect any comments from them.

Tech Mahindra’s restructuring

Joshi officially announced the internal restructuring during the company’s second quarter earnings conference last month, wherein the company will now have a vertical-wise focus for delivery instead of Tech Mahindra’s previous geography-focused structure. Overall, the new CEO has created six focused business units: Americas Communication, Americas Technology Media, Americas diversified, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan), and India.

The reshuffle, which will be effective January 1, will see some top leaders take on new roles. As part of that change, the current CHRO and head of marketing, Harshvendra Soin, is shifting his base to Australia to lead the consolidated Asia Pacific and Japan business.

Joshi had told the media during the earnings conference that the company has already made an offer to the new chief marketing officer, who will come on board in the next few months; and is in the process of looking for a new CHRO.

Tech M’s washout Q2 performance

As he takes over the company, Joshi has a big challenge ahead: to turn Tech Mahindra, which gets nearly 40 percent of its revenue from the communications, media and entertainment (CME) vertical, around. The segment has been hit lately as customers are looking to cut discretionary tech spends. Tech Mahindra now wants to diversify its business into other verticals such as financial services and healthcare.

The company's second quarter ended September 30 was disappointing in terms of performance. CEO and MD CP Gurnani called the past two quarters as the toughest he has seen. Gurnani is retiring from the top role on December 19.

Tech Mahindra's net profit plunged 61.6 percent YoY to Rs 494 crore during the second quarter. Consolidated revenue for Q2 declined 2 percent YoY to Rs 12,864 crore, while the EBIT margin or operating margin plunged 210 bps QoQ to just 4.7 percent.",642,-0.5214250683784485

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TECHM) reported another quarter of weak performance, with revenue declining 2.4% QoQ in constant currency (CC) to USD1.6b, which missed our estimate of a 1.1% decline. The weakness was primarily caused by a continued slowdown in CME, which was down 4.9% QoQ and BFSI, which was down 2.8% QoQ. However, Manufacturing showed continued strength with 2.3% QoQ growth. EBIT margin (adjusted for organizational restructuring) contracted 150bp QoQ to 7.3% in 2QFY24, below our estimate of 8.7%. TCV of USD640m (+78% QoQ/-10.6% YoY) improved in 2QFY24 after reporting two consecutive quarters of decline.

Outlook

We are staying on the sidelines because we believe that the current valuation adequately accounts for the uncertainties surrounding growth and margin. We reduce our FY24/FY25 EPS estimates by 2-10% due to sluggish growth and a subdued outlook. Reiterate Neutral with a TP of INR1,040 (premised on 19x FY25E EPS).

Tech Mahindra posted another weak set of results—revenue declined 2.8% QoQ (2.4%, CC terms) to USD1.55bn, below our estimate. Reported EBITM declined by 210bps QoQ to 4.7% and adj. EBITM fell by 140bps QoQ, also missing our estimates. Weakness persisted in CME (down 4.9% QoQ), which is unlikely to see any near-term material recovery, with 5G spends not picking up. Deal wins improved QoQ to USD640mn, but stayed lower YoY due to weak discretionary spending and elongated sales cycle. Management has announced organizational restructuring, to simplify & streamline the business into six strategic units, for fostering deeper client relationships. It plans to share its detailed business plan and growth strategy with investors in Apr-24. We cut FY24E EPS by a sharp ~28%, factoring-in the Q2 miss and near-term weakness, while lowering our FY25-26 estimates by under 3%, anticipating recovery in performance as the new management’s strategy & execution starts showing results.

Outlook

We maintain BUY with revised TP of Rs1,330/share (from Rs1,360) at 18x Sep-25E EPS.

YES Securities' research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TECHM) reported weak financial performance for the quarter. The sequential revenue growth and EBIT margin were below expectation. Revenue declined by 2.4% QoQ in cc terms. (down 2.2% QoQ in INR terms, down 2.9% QoQ in USD terms), led by CME segment (down 4.9% QoQ). There was sequential decline in EBIT margin (down 206bps QoQ) on lower revenue. Employee attrition continues to moderate as LTM attrition was down ~2 percentage points QoQ to 11%. The near term demand environment remains challenging as the clients remain cautious regarding the evolving macroeconomic situation and that is reflected in slowdown in discretionary spending and it continues to impact near term revenue performance. The continued weakness in Telecom vertical is expected to result in muted revenue growth for FY24. Falling employee attrition, improving employee pyramid and focus on better revenue mix is expected to support operating margin going ahead. We estimate revenue CAGR of 8.1% over FY23‐25E with average EBIT margin of 11.5% over the period.



Outlook

We maintain our NEUTRAL rating on the stock with revised target price of Rs 1,190/share at 16.0x on FY25E EPS. The stock trades at PER of 25.5x/15.4x on FY24E/FY25E EPS.

ICICI Securities research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra’s (TechM) Q2FY24 result, as expected, was weak on all fronts, including revenue growth and margins. Sequential revenue decline was further exacerbated by weakness in communication vertical globally (where TechM has still very high reliance and which may prove as Achilles heel in Mohit Joshi’s (MD & CEO designate) turnaround efforts at TechM, in our view) and TechM’s conscious efforts to deliberately move out of non-core geographies, clients and service lines. Business rationalisation may continue in Q3FY24E as well, given certain projects need regulatory approvals before closure/divestiture. This, along with weak macro outlook for discretionary tech spend, implies that signs of demand revival for TechM may only reflect from FY25E.

Outlook

Given the above backdrop, we cut our FY24-26E EPS estimates by 26%/19%/8%, led by both lower revenues and EBIT margins. We expect TechM’s EBIT margins to move up from 6.1% in FY24E to 11.4%/14.8% in FY25E/26E on the back of various levers (refer EBIT margin walk in Exhibits 3 & 4). Our revised 12-month target price now stands at INR 1,372 (vs prior INR 1,590), implying 20% potential upside, and we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.

Shares of Tech Mahindra are likely to open lower in trade on October 26 following the IT player’s earnings report for the quarter ended September. Tech Mahindra saw revenue fall 2.4 percent QoQ in constant currency terms to $1,555 million, on a slowdown in the Communications, Media & Entertainment (CME) segment.

TechM also posted a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 494 crore for the second quarter of the current fiscal, over 28 percent lower on a sequential basis, falling below estimates.

Factors impacting earnings

The CME revenue stood at $575 million, lower by 11.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) in Q2FY24. However, Nuvama Institutional Equities said that the challenges were not limited to CME as the Enterprise business reported a third consecutive quarter of revenue decline of 1.5 percent QoQ, as well.

The management attributed the weak revenue performance to soft macros and business rationalization exercise, which is expected to continue for one or two quarters more. Motilal Oswal said that the company may experience a decline in revenue for FY24, on weakness in the BFSI sector and the need to rationalize low-margin accounts.

The new CEO proposed a new organisational structure—the new go-to-market business units will have six strategic units. More details will be shared with investors in April 2024.

Brokerage calls

Goldman Sachs maintained its ‘sell’ call on Tech Mahindra, as the global brokerage expects a muted near-term outlook for all IT spends in the telecom vertical. It forecasted that the revenue growth for FY24 might fall 4.4 year-on-year.

HSBC cut its target on the IT services company from Rs 1,100 per share to Rs 970 per share as the revenue and margins missed ‘already muted expectations’. The recovery projected is likely to be very gradual, and as the clean-up continues, lower margins must be factored in.

Choice Broking maintained its 'underperform' rating, said that although the company has a healthy pipeline for H2, it remains cautious as the deal conversion cycles are taking too long. The restructuring might help focus on top client accounts.

Tech Mahindra’s CEO designate Mohit Joshi announced restructuring of Tech Mahindra’s businesses effective from January 1, ahead of taking over the charge from December. This comes at a time when the IT services major has reported two consecutive quarters of a disappointing set of earnings.

The new reorganisation will have a vertical-wise focus for delivery instead of Tech Mahindra’s previous geography-focused structure, Joshi shared at a media roundtable on October 25 during the company’s Q2FY24 earnings announcement.

The reshuffle will see some of the top leaders take over new roles, including the current chief human resource officer (CHRO) and head of marketing Harshvendra Soin shifting his base to Australia to lead the consolidated Asia Pacific and Japan business.

Tech Mahindra is also making some new leadership appointments. Apart from onboarding Atul Soneja as the new COO, the company has hired a new chief marketing officer and a CHRO, who are expected to join over the next few months.

According to Joshi, the overall business has been consolidated down to six core strategic business units.

“We have cut the Americas business into three business units. We have got Europe business where we have consolidated the telecom and non-telecom businesses into a single strategic unit and we have also consolidated our Asia Pacific and Japan business under a single leader, who will be based out of Australia. We have carved out India business into a separate business unit given the very unique nature of the market,” he said.

IT services delivery has been consolidated under Soneja, which was so far broken up into various market or geography-based units.

“I think this consolidation gives us a wonderful opportunity to streamline, focus, drive resilience, service line innovation, and the margin improvement we are looking for,” Joshi said.

Consolidation of business units

“Historically, a lot of our capabilities were fragmented. The design capabilities were sitting outside of the IT services organization, the engineering capabilities were split into multiple units across the world. And our delivery was organized on a geographical basis, not on a vertical basis. With this reorganisation, I think we will continue to drive a lot of resilience for our clients,” Joshi said.

Joshi added that this will also bring stability and drive an improved cost structure, as a consolidated delivery organization with the ability can help drive greater productivity and service line innovation.

While the company is looking to shift revenue dependency from communications, media and entertainment (CME), and manufacturing to diversify into healthcare, financial services, and retail segments, Joshi maintained that the former segments will still continue to be the core of what Tech Mahindra’s focus is.

CME head quits

Manish Vyas, a Tech Mahindra veteran who is the CEO of network services and head of CME, which accounted for nearly 40 percent of the company’s revenue has quit to pursue his entrepreneurial interests, Joshi said, adding that his last date of work will be in mid of November.

Vyas was reportedly also in the running for the CEO role. As of now, his verticals and accounts have been split between different leaders.

During the company’s Investor Day in March 2023, current CEO and MD CP Gurnani said that product and platform business opportunity will be the next growth driver for the company. The vertical which had then already touched $450 million in revenue, was expected to cross $1 billion in less than three years. Vyas was at the helm of it.

In fact, a part of Vyas’ own vertical, 5G solutions, had leapfrogged almost five-fold in terms of revenue to over $600 million in FY22 from $125 million in FY21. 5G solutions was on track to reach $1 billion in revenue in FY23.

During the company’s Q2 earnings, however, Gurnani said that he had misjudged and been over-bullish on the 5G opportunity in terms of market timing as customers had to stop capital expenditure for the time being due to the challenging macroeconomic environment.

Gurnani’s last quarter

Gurnani too is set to retire on December 19 and this was the last quarterly earnings conference that he addressed.

After reporting a weak quarter, he told the media, “All I can tell you is for H2FY24, the deal pipeline is very, very strong. I know there could be reasons for either quick closures or long closure, but that's the nature of the business.”

“I would love to finish strong since this is my last quarter when I come in front of you. I'm mighty proud of what we have achieved since we went public in 2006. But at the same time, I do know that this quarter, I'm reporting a negative growth rate. I'm also reporting a drop in margins. But at the same time, confident about the future,” he said.

Tech Mahindra missed out on street estimates on all counts including revenue growth, net profit, and even EBIT margins.

Net profit fell 61.6 percent YoY at Rs 494 crore driven by slowing demand in the telecom and communications segment and delays in deal cycles. CME was down by 4.9 percent QoQ.

Consolidated revenue for Q2FY24 declined 2 percent YoY at Rs 12,864 crore, missing Moneycontrol’s estimate of a marginal decline of 0.01 percent YoY coming at Rs 13,127 crore. On a QoQ basis revenue was down by 2.2 percent.

IT services firm Tech Mahindra reported a net employee addition of 2,307 sequentially for the quarter ended September 30, bucking the industry-wide trend of slowdown in hiring and revenue guidance amid macroeconomic challenges and demand uncertainties.

The total headcount for Q2 was 150,604. As of the first half of FY24, Tech Mahindra's total headcount had dropped by 1,796.

The attrition rate dropped from 13 percent in Q1 to 11 percent in Q2, continuing the trend of declining attrition rates since the start of fiscal year 2023.

This quarter, all of India's Tier-I IT companies have reported a steep decline in headcount. Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) lost 6,333 employees, Infosys' headcount dropped by 7,530, HCLTech reported a decline of 2,299 employees, and Wipro was down by 5,051. Adjusting for Tech Mahindra's headcount increase, the top five Indian IT companies overall lost 40,744 employees in H1FY24.

During the last quarter, Tech Mahindra's Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director CP Gurnani said that the company was focusing on building generative AI talent. As of Q2, Tech Mahindra had upskilled around 10,000 associates.

Meanwhile, CEO-designate Mohit Joshi, who is set to take over the position in December when Gurnani retires, has reportedly been restructuring and reshuffling duties among the company's senior management over the past couple of months in an effort to enhance sales and consolidate delivery.

In January 2023, speaking to Moneycontrol at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gurnani said that hiring will be higher when attrition is higher, and net hiring will be low when attrition starts declining.

“Hiring cannot always be linear. The reality is that AI, data, and automation are part of our lives. If it is not linear, revenue goes up. If you don't hire, please do take into account that we are becoming more efficient with automation,” he had said.

Tech Mahindra announced its Q2FY24 earnings on October 25, missing analyst estimates on all counts of consolidated revenue, net profit and EBIT margins.

IT services major Tech Mahindra reported a 61.6 percent fall in net profit to Rs 494 crore year-on-year for the quarter ended September 30, signalling a washout second quarter driven by slowing demand in telecom and communications segment and delays in deal cycles.

Communications, media and entertainment (CME) currently account for nearly 40 percent of the company’s revenue. CME business is down by 4.9 percent QoQ and 11.5 percent YoY.

YoY net profit was significantly below Moneycontrol’s estimates of a decline of 37 percent YoY touching Rs 822 crore. It also missed QoQ growth estimate of 18 percent.

Consolidated revenue for Q2FY24 declined 2 percent YoY at Rs 12,864 crore, missing Moneycontrol’s estimate of a marginal decline of 0.01 percent YoY coming at Rs 13,127 crore. On a QoQ basis revenue was down by 2.2 percent.

The company’s EBIT margin or operating margin came in at 4.7 percent, which is worse than the previous quarter’s 6.8 percent. This was a significant miss from Moneycontrol’s estimate of 8.9 percent.

The deal total contract value (TCV) stood at $640 million, up from $359 million in the last quarter.

CP Gurnani, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Tech Mahindra, said, “The year is being characterized by a challenging demand environment and prolonged macro uncertainties calling for a very tactical approach. We have doubled down our strategy of working closely with clients, helping them to streamline and modernize operations as they reprioritize their resources.”

Rohit Anand, Chief Financial Officer, Tech Mahindra, added, “We have taken actions to reduce the exposure to non-core areas of business. These actions will, over time, help us improve our financial performance and enable long term sustainable growth. A consistent dividend payout reinforces our commitment towards creating value for our shareholders.”

Tech Mahindra’s board announced an interim dividend of Rs 12 per share for FY23-24.

Tech Mahindra now wants to diversify its revenue dependency from CME to other segments such as BFSI and healthcare. The CEO designate Mohit Joshi is currently reshuffling duties of the senior management to achieve the same, as competition from peers intensifies in a weaker demand environment.

This was Gurnani's last quarter as he is set to retire on December 19. Joshi is set to take over after December 19, following the retirement of Gurnani.

This comes at a time when Tier-I IT companies are already slashing revenue guidance for FY24 amidst macro headwinds, despite expecting a strong order book for the next two quarters.

Tech Mahindra closed at Rs 1,141.70 on BSE, down 13.45 percent from the previous day.

Worst two quarters

Speaking to the media, Gurnani said that the last two quarters were the most difficult ones he has seen, after being through quite a few cycles in his life and seeing several ups and downs.

""In terms of market timing, in terms of service offerings, I thought we were poised for riding some of the technology investments, particularly 5G and now I don't think the wave was strong enough for 5G at that moment, and somehow some of our customers had to stop the capital expenditure or reduced their capital expenditure because their operating costs became very high,"" he added.

Gurnani said that many of the customer corporations borrowed money and with rising interest costs, some of them faced a little more difficulty, then he had anticipated.

Joshi's restructuring plans

Joshi acknowledged while Q2 has been a challenging quarter, but he remains very optimistic about the fundamental strength of the business and the long term opportunity that Tech Mahindra has. As he takes over, he has made some significant changes in the IT major's organisational structure, which will come into effect from January 1, 2024 onwards.

""Just a few words on the reorganisation... what we've done is consolidated down to six core strategic business units. We have cut the Americas business in to three business units. We have got Europe business where we have consolidated the telecom and non-telecom businesses into a single strategic unit and we have also consolidated our Asia Pacific and Japan business under a single leader, who will be based out of Australia. We have carved out India business into a separate business unit given the very unique nature of the market,"" he explained.

Joshi added, ""From a delivery perspective, we have appointed Atul Soneja as the COO, who will be driving the consolidated IT services delivery, which historically was broken up into various market units. I think this consolidation gives us a wonderful opportunity to streamline, focus, drive resilience, service line innovation and the margin improvement that we are looking for.""",771,-0.491230059415102

Tech Mahindra is likely to report dull fiscal second-quarter earnings on October 25. The IT firm’s Q2 FY24 net profit is expected to decline on a year-on-year (YoY) basis while its revenue is likely to remain flat due to lacklustre performance in the communications vertical, delayed telecom revenue and weak discretionary spends, according to analysts.

Tech Mahindra’s EBIT margin is likely to be the major concern as brokerages expect a big contraction in Q2 FY24 on an on-year basis. The company’s deal wins are also expected to remain muted in the quarter under review, on account of weak macro and slow decision-making.

The IT major's net profit may decline around 37 percent YoY to Rs 822 crore, per the average of six brokerages’ estimates. However, sequentially, there might be an 18 percent rise. The quarter may witness certain one-time costs, said analysts.

Weak communications segment to hit revenue growth

For the quarter ended September 2023, Tech Mahindra's revenue may fall marginally on a year-on-year (YoY) basis to Rs 13,127 crore, according to the average of six brokerage firms’ estimates. Analysts expect its revenues in constant currency (CC) terms to also see a slight fall with weak performance across communications and enterprise segments.

Pressure likely on margin due to wages, bad debt

Tech Mahindra’s EBIT margin is likely to contract by around 620 basis points (bps) on-year to 8.9 percent because of wage hikes, the absence of bad debt provision, and various business restructuring actions, according to the median estimate.

The pressure on margins will partially be offset by reduced subcontract cost, the expense incurred when a company outsources specific projects to subcontractors. Sequentially, margins may recover 210 bps, following the sharp decline in the previous quarter.

Tech Mahindra Q2 FY24 Result Expectations

Deal wins remain weak in Q2

Analysts expect deal wins to be weak on a YoY basis due to weak macro and slow decision-making. ""We forecast net new TCV (total contract value) of $400-500 million. We expect quarterly financials to have limited sway in the near term with a focus on turnaround under Mohit Joshi,"" said Kotak Securities, adding that the recently announced organisation structure can lead to a few exits at the leadership levels.

Key monitorables

Employee addition and visibility on telecom and 5G will be among the key monitorables going ahead. The focus will remain on the turnaround strategy and implications of the recently announced organisation structure that will be effective January 2024. The timing of divestments of low-margin businesses that will aid margins but adversely impact revenue growth will also be keenly watched.

Moreover, investors will watch for the outlook for margins in FY24, margin normalisation timelines and aspirational growth and margin levels. Outlook for vulnerable segments such as XDS, ERD and network services, which have higher exposure to discretionary spending, will also be eyed. Investors will also monitor management commentary on the health of the deal pipeline and positioning in cost take-out deals.

Other key monitorables include any revenue leakage in existing accounts and positioning in vendor consolidation events, the outlook for revenue growth in top telecom clients and requests for furloughs in retail vertical and BPO services.

Tech Mahindra (Americas) announced on October 23 that it will divest its 30 percent holding in Avion Networks Inc. for $50,000 to Kanchana Raman, the promotor of Avion Networks Inc. The expected date of completion of the sale/disposal is on or before October 31, 2023.

Tech Mahindra (America) Inc (TMA), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tech Mahindra Limited, currently holds 30 percent share capital of Avion Networks Inc.

The company said in an exchange filing that the buyers are not related to the promoter or promoter group of Tech Mahindra Limited.

Explaining why it is divesting its stake in Avion Networks, the information technology and software services provider said: “Since there was no contribution in terms of turnover or net worth in the consolidated turnover or net worth of the company from this entity, it was decided to divest Tech Mahindra’s stake in Avion Networks to optimize the compliance cost and risks.”

Tech Mahindra had formed a joint venture with global telecom technology firm Avion Systems in 2015 to offer network design and software engineering services for the deployment and management of mobile networks and the transformation of these networks to cloud-enabled, virtual and open systems software-driven networks.

As information technology companies gear up for the upcoming July-September earnings season, brokerage firm Nomura believes continued weakness in demand and sustained macro uncertainty will adversely impact their financials.

""We believe the void created by the lower number of small-sized and discretionary projects along with delays in client decision-making and ramp-up of won projects in certain cases will lead to both revenue and margin disappointments in the near term, given the ‘sticky’ nature of costs,"" the firm stated in its report.

Growth divergence to continue

Nomura expects largecap IT players to report revenue growth in the range of -1 percent to +2 percent on-quarter, while midcaps are likely to fare better with expectations of 0.7 to 3.3 percent sequential growth in constant currency terms.

Among largecap players, the brokerage firm forecasts LTIMindtree to deliver the strongest revenue growth at 2 percent sequentially, while Tech Mahindra is likely to emerge as a laggard in the pack, with a de-growth of 1 percent in the September quarter.

Among midcaps, Birlasoft is likely to emerge as the winner, with the strongest growth expectations of 3.3 percent, while Mphasis may report the weakest growth at 0.7 percent on-quarter.

The EBIT margin for industry majors like Infosys, Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree, Persistent Systems and L&T Tech will also remain under pressure with salary hikes and weak revenue growth playing as major

headwinds.

Given the divergence in financial performance across the IT pack, management commentaries on the deal pipelines and timely ramp-up of projects will take the centerstage.

On that front, Nomura expects, HCL Tech and Infosys to retain growth guidance for the current fiscal.

No sign of revival in discretionary demand

Nomura sees multiple headwinds hampering the growth trajectory for IT companies in the near term, and hence, the firm has rolled out a cautious stance on the sector. It also attributed limited visibility of a significant turnaround in discretionary demand for IT services as the major factor behind the caution.

Nomura also predicts the current slowdown to span across the entire FY24 rather than just the first half, with the possibility of its impact even extending to FY25 discretionary spends as macro uncertainties continue to linger.

""While cost pressure and changing customer preferences continue to increase tech intensity in enterprises’ businesses and could result in increased offshoring work for India’s IT services in the medium term, IT budgets are likely to be prioritised in areas of automation and cost efficiencies in the near term, in our view,"" Nomura said.

In particular, the brokerage house is watchful of the deal flows in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) and CMT (communications, media and technology) verticals.

ICICI Securities research report on Tech Mahindra

We believe, EBIT margin improvement is a low hanging fruit for TechM’s new CEO Mr. Mohit Joshi; however, top line revival may take some time. That said, Mr Joshi’s opening gambit (appointment of COO Mr. Atul Soneja and an internal reshuffle) bolsters our conviction for a successful turnaround. On balance, we also take cognizance that this is contingent on improving capabilities and filling white spaces in non-communication verticals, which should start reflecting in deal wins and market share gains. TechM’s valuation looks stretched on consensus’ estimates. But, Mr Joshi’s initiatives playing out could form a strong premise for the stock to re-rate structurally. Given the backdrop, we increase our target multiple to 20x (earlier: 14x) and upgrade TechM to ‘BUY’.

Outlook

TechM’s valuation at 19x/17x looks stretched on consensus’ FY25/26 EPS estimates. But should the above steps find implementation under the new management, then the stock carries the potential for a structural re-rating. We are ahead of Street by 7%/16% on FY25/26EPS estimates. We value TechM on 20x one-year-forward EPS (Q5-Q8 EPS) of INR 78 to arrive at TP of INR 1,552 (prior: INR 910), implying ~20% potential upside. With this, we upgrade TechM to ‘BUY’ (prior: ‘SELL’)

After flirting with 20,000 level once in July, the Nifty 50 finally managed to scale past the psychological mark on September 11. The benchmark Nifty 50 hit a record high of 20,008.15 with largecaps finally joining the broader markets party.

The upward momentum in markets started after March 2023, with the dawn of the new financial year. After falling to a low of 16,950-level, the Nifty 50 began its upmove, gaining close to 18 percent since then.

Of the 50 stocks, 49 have participated in this rally with Adani Enterprises, Tata Motors, Adani Ports, NTPC and Cipla taking the top five spots. Along with Mahindra & Mahindra, these six stocks have gained over 40 percent in the rally since March.

26 stocks, led by IndusInd Bank, HDFC Life Insurance, Hero MotoCorp, Larsen & Toubro and Coal India, gained between 18-40 percent, thus also outperforming the benchmark.

The remaining 18 stocks underperformed the Nifty 50, with UPL being the only one in the red. The agrochemical stock has lost over 13 percent in this financial year.

A closer look at the data shows that automobile stocks have led the rally, with passenger vehicle as well as two-wheeler stocks outperforming the benchmark. In fact, the Nifty Auto index has also managed to outperform the Nifty 50 by 33 percentage points in FY23.

""Improving demand and margin trajectory, along with good product cycle for several companies, is driving a fresh upturn in autos resulting in Nifty Auto index outperforming Nifty-50,"" as per foreign broking firm Jefferies.

Some IT stocks, despite suffering from analyst downgrades and weak demand outlook, have also managed to outperform the benchmark. Investors have taken the ""buy on dips"" approach in names like HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Wipro and LTIMindtree. Artificial intelligence is the next big trigger for the IT stocks, believes the Street.

On the other hand, analysts' darling banks — HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and State Bank of India — have underperformed the Nifty 50, albeit the stocks are in the green.

As deposits have started getting repriced, banks are expected to face margin pressures going ahead. According to Fitch Ratings, the Indian banking sector's average NIM (net interest margin) to slightly contract by about 10 basis points (bps) in FY24 to 3.45 percent, following a 15-bps increase in FY23.

The only stock in red

UPL is the only Nifty 50 stock that has declined in this rally from March lows. Analysts as well as investors have turned wary of the agrochemical stock largely because of the lack of clarity on the company's debt reduction targets. Its net debt stands at Rs 262 billion (Rs 26,200 crore) as of June.

The company has also lowered its revenue growth guidance for the current fiscal to 1-5 percent from 4-8 percent, indicating a prolonged pressure on its revenue. On the other hand, FY24 margin growth guidance was also cut to 3-7 percent from the earlier projection of 6-10 percent.

Gati Limited, a logistics company within the Allcargo Group, announced a collaboration with Tech Mahindra to create Gati Enterprise Management System (GEMS) 2.0.

GEMS 2.0 will serve as Gati's fundamental operational software system and is designed to provide an improved customer experience through a contemporary, technology-driven interface while enhancing efficiency and reducing expenses.

Tech Mahindra Ltd has suffered a spate of downgrades with the number of 'buy' calls for the stock down from 22 to 15 over the last one month. There are 13 hold calls and 15 sell calls at present as against 13 holds and nine sells a month back.

The abrupt downgrades are attributed to recent weak earnings with the management highlighting this quarter as one of the most challenging in the past five years. The lacklustre performance is attributed to factors such as project closures, a single customer declaring bankruptcy, reduced 5G expenditures from enterprises, and seasonal variations impacting Comviva's business.

The management anticipates a gradual recovery, driven by improved operational efficiencies, enhancements in the Pyramid mix, and ongoing discussions with customers regarding new transformative projects.

This decline coincides with a challenging business landscape for IT companies as major firms are revising down their growth projections.

Tech Mahindra saw a sequential revenue drop of 4 percent, amounting to $1600.7 million. In constant currency terms, revenue fell by 4.2 percent, marking the sharpest decline among its peers. Similar revenue declines were observed for Wipro and HCL Tech during this quarter. Net profit reported a 38 percent on-year decrease, totaling to Rs 692.5 crore.

As the new CEO, Mohit Joshi, steps in, analysts turn more optimistic while acknowledging the substantial challenge of reinvigorating the company's growth and margins. The strategies he deploys will require time to translate into earnings, which might lead to the company's stock lagging behind its peers.

Joshi is likely to address medium-term growth and margin concerns, currently undergoing a transition with outgoing predecessor CP Gurnani. His approach is expected to encompass a cost-efficient operational structure, increased revenue from the BFSI sector, and lucrative high-margin deals. Detailed plans are slated for unveiling within the next two quarters.",330,-0.5176843702793121

Customers of top IT services firms are seeking pre-inflationary rates and pricing concessions for both new agreements and contract renewals, amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment and cuts in discretionary technology budgets.

Even as firms such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCLTech have denied that customers were seeking any significant pricing discounts in deal negotiations during their April-June quarter earnings conferences, industry observers said it is one of the key factors for the ongoing uncertainties in demand and delays in deal closures, making it a double whammy for the IT companies.

According to market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, there was a price increase of at least 20-30 percent on transformation deals during the pandemic, a hike that clients are seeking to pare to some extent, due to uncertainty about their growth prospects.

UnearthInsight estimates that discount asks have climbed to 50 percent of new deals but companies are agreeing in 30 percent of the instances, citing cost pressures.

Phil Fersht, founder and CEO of HFS Research told Moneycontrol, “Many renewals are being delayed with clients demanding pre-inflationary prices and some even discounts. Providers have to decide if they can afford to drop their prices to keep fully utilised or stand firm and grind out the current slump.”

At the same time, Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of Everest Group, a research and management consulting firm said that despite the increasing pushback from the customers, IT services firms aren't willing to budge.

“There is an increasing pushback against the post-pandemic price increases, this can cause protracted negotiations and along with the economic uncertainty contribute to the slowdown in pipeline closing and the increase of deal delays,” he said.

“At this time we have not seen a significant rollback of the price increases pushed through in the last two years but there is a growing push to claw back some of these increases and no appetite to allow further increases,” he added.

Impact on margins

While it is hard to determine if this has started impacting margins, a look at the first-quarter earnings across the top five Indian IT firms shows a decline in operating margins except for Wipro, whose margin expanded by 112 basis points (bps) quarter on quarter (QoQ). In terms of margins and the usual commentary, Q1 is seasonally a weak quarter for IT firms, as they roll out wage hikes during this period.

Additionally, this time companies saw weakness in several key sectors including BFSI, communications, media and entertainment (CME) and telecom. Tech Mahindra, which gets nearly 40 percent of its revenue from the CME vertical, saw its margins drop by 440 bps QoQ.

UnearthInsight's founder Gaurav Vasu said discounting demands are more pronounced in new deals and with newer clients compared to existing ones.

“In 2020, when the pandemic hit, the services companies already had to do discounting. So the same discounted price continued for some time, then suddenly when the war for talent happened, the services companies went back to the clients asking for some increase in pricing. Now that the inflation pressure too is coming down, this kind of price discounting is happening in three out of 10 deals, especially with new clients,"" Vasu told Moneycontrol.

But company managements denied seeing any significant ask for pricing discounts so far, analysts said.

“In terms of pricing reductions, there have been some sporadic requirements from different clients but largely the pricing environment remained stable,” C Vijayakumar, CEO and MD, HCLTech, said during the company's recent earnings conference with the media.

TCS CFO Samir Seksaria maintained that the overall pricing environment remained stable for the country’s largest IT services firm, instead, there was a “year-on-year increase in realisation,” wherein prices increased to some extent.

Overall, all the companies guided for slower revenue growth and delays in deal pipeline conversion in the upcoming quarters.

Delays in deal renewals

According to UnearthInsight’s estimates, in FY24, the top five Indian IT companies including TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra will cumulatively bag between $70 billion and $85 billion worth of order book/total contract value wins. Of this, renewals will account for around 30-35 percent of the total deals.

The ongoing delays in deal closures are happening across sectors and deal sizes with the exception of artificial intelligence, which continues to remain a bright spot given the Generative AI hype, analysts said. But they also expect revival to happen soon as Fed rate hikes and inflation starts to cool down over the next two quarters.

“Deals are pushed out by 45 to 60 days right now. This is due to two factors – a lot of folks decided to take summer vacation in North America which is a rare thing and the markets had not been sure of a recession in North America. Now, they know that the recession is more than unlikely to happen,” said Ray Wang, Principal Analyst and CEO, Constellation Research.

Vasu said $100 million-plus deals have slowed down, and he expects revival to come in largely from public sector and government deals across countries. Hi-Tech and SaaS should also bounce back from Q3 FY24. Manufacturing, BFSI and healthcare are taking comparatively longer to make decisions and even deals which are won have projects getting paused/taking longer to materialise. This trend will continue for the next 4 to 5 months in FY24.

“Long-term tech transformation deals which have a 3-to-5-year execution cycle and completely new-age technologies like Metaverse or experimental tech investment from clients are either on hold or taking 5 to 8 months to close,” Vasu said.

There are a number of complications this year with deal renewals, said Bendor-Samuel. One of them is vendor consolidation, which is underway with large accounts. Vendor consolidation deals in the initial stages are usually resource-demanding and do not really leave good margins; revenue starts rolling in only after certain maturity. Thus, they are complicated to execute, taking more time, and creating a lag in revenue recognition as workloads take time to transition.

Another factor is the increased focus on cost savings which results in more Request for Proposals (RFPs) but longer procurement cycles.

“For the first half of the year, there has been a lot of indecision as firms increasingly prepared themselves for a recession. This made decision-making more difficult and more drawn out resulting in a significant slowing in pipeline closing,” he explained.

Finally and potentially most importantly new deal signings are paired with a significant reduction in discretionary spending often pre-committed in existing contracts, Bendor-Samuel said, adding, “Hence, book-to-bill ratios which are strong stand in stark contrast to revenue recognition which has slowed significantly.”

The book-to-bill ratio for IT companies is a metric used to explain the value of orders received to the value of orders completed.

Tempering inflation

Analysts have started seeing green shoots in most major geographies like North America, expecting the recovery to kick in the next few quarters.

HFS Research has predicted that with the news on inflation running at only 3 percent in the US, a recovery for IT spends could be in Q4 2023.

However, US banks still seem to be weathering a crisis, following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the Signature Bank earlier this year. Global credit rating firm Moody’s on August 7 downgraded ratings of 10 small to mid-sized US banks, adding that it may further downgrade some of the US’ biggest lenders, as the sector reported pressure in profitability in its recent company earnings. BFSI is one of the largest sectors to give business to IT services companies. TCS generates nearly 35-40 percent of its revenue from this sector.

Ashutosh Sharma, head of research at Forrester Research India, highlighted that the equity markets in North America and India have started to pick up.

“Equity markets have started to pick up in India and North America. Experts are seeing some green shoots appearing, expecting economies to recover and inflation to slow down. It might get delayed by a quarter or two, but there will be a recovery. For the time being, deals are getting pushed out and clients are not opening their purses easily,” he said.

Wang concurred, “Given the recent tech rallies and stock market growth, there is confidence that economic conditions are improving.”",1399,-0.37609240721011983

Paycheques of CEOs in India’s largest information technology (IT) companies have continued to remain high amid a challenging demand landscape for the sector, as it weathers macro headwinds in key markets such as North America.

Among the top six IT companies in India by revenue — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, and LTIMindtree—Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte draws the highest pay by far, all things considered. However, his income saw a 5 percent decline year-on-year in dollar terms.

Delaporte earned Rs 82.4 crore ($10 million) in FY22-23, a minor reduction from $10.5 million the year prior.

Of the Rs 82.4 crore, Rs 9.6 crore was his base salary, Rs 3.57 crore was by way of allowances, Rs 10.7 crore was variable pay, Rs 34.3 crore was retirals, and Rs 24.2 crore was ‘other annual compensation,’ per Wipro’s annual report. The compensation includes Delaporte’s restricted stock units (RSU).

The steepest fall in compensation among the six may be that of HCLTech CEO C Vijayakumar, who also took home the least among the top five.

He earned Rs 28.4 crore in FY22-FY23, down 79 percent from the preceding year. This includes Rs 16.44 crore as base salary, Rs 11.8 crore as performance-linked bonus, and Rs 24 lakh in benefits, perquisites, and allowances.

Vijayakumar's salary, however, may rebound the next year as HCLTech pays out the long-term incentive (LTI) at the end of two years. He will receive the LTI for FY21-22 and FY22-23 at the end of FY23-24.

How the others fared

CEO of Infosys, India’s second-largest IT company, Salil Parekh earned Rs 56.44 crore ($6.8 million) in FY22-23. Parekh earned Rs 6.67 crore in base pay, Rs 45 lakh in retiral benefits, Rs 18.73 crore in variable pay or bonus, and Rs 30.6 crore by exercising his RSUs. His pay fell 21 percent, primarily on account of exercising fewer RSUs.

At India’s largest IT company Tata Consultancy Services, former CEO Rajesh Gopinathan earned Rs 29.16 crore ($3.5 million) — of which Rs 1.73 crore was the salary, Rs 2.43 crore was by way of benefits, perquisites and allowances, and Rs 25 crore were commissions.

LTIMindtree CEO Debashis Chatterjee, who was appointed to the post in November 2022 post the merger of L&T and Mindtree, drew Rs 17.5 crore ($2.1 million) in salary in FY22-23, a decline of 0.36 percent. Of this, Rs 8.5 crore was the fixed component, Rs 8.8 crore was variable pay, and Rs 16 lakh was by way of perquisites.

Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani, who used to be among the highest paid CEOs in the industry, saw his pay halve in FY22-23 due to the fewer stock options exercised. Gurnani earned Rs 32 crore during this year. Of this, Rs 25 crore on account of ESOPs, Rs 2.7 crore as salary, and Rs 1.8 crore in commissions.

Median remuneration

There is also a yawning gap when it comes to CEO pay compared to the median remuneration at these companies.

Delaporte makes 916.12 times the median remuneration at his firm, Parekh 627 times, Gurnani 466.99 times, and Gopinathan 427.1 times. Vijayakumar makes 253.35 times the median remuneration at HCLTech, and Chatterjee 139.92 times.

IT CEO pay v/s median employee remuneration

Apart from median remuneration, the gap has also been widening when it comes to the pay of CEOs and freshers. In FY22, Moneycontrol reported that while the median annual pay of CEOs jumped 835 percent from Rs 3.37 crore in FY12 to Rs 31.5 crore in FY22, the median fresher package grew just 45 percent, from Rs 2.45 lakh to Rs 3.55 lakh, in the same time period.

The new guard in Indian IT

However, it’s been a year of change, with three new CEOs taking charge in 2023. Krithi Krithivasan took charge at TCS in June, and Mohit Joshi, Managing Director and CEO designate of Tech Mahindra, will take charge in December.

Krithivasan will be paid a basic salary of Rs 10 lakh per month, which can go up to a maximum of Rs 16 lakh per month, per the company’s annual report. However, his commission, which will make up a bigger chunk of his remuneration, is subject to company performance.

Joshi will receive an annual fixed compensation of Rs 6.5 crore (GBP 622,600), and an equal amount in annual variable pay. His variable pay in the first year is guaranteed. Additionally, he can get an annual overperformance bonus of up to 70 percent of his variable compensation.

He is also entitled to a joining bonus of $848,951 (Rs 6.96 crore). In addition, he will get one-time stock options worth $2.5 million (Rs 20.6 crore), 60 percent of which will vest once he finishes a year with the company, and the remaining when he finishes two years.

Further, he has stock options worth $3.5 million (Rs 28.8 crore) vesting in equal instalments over three consecutive years of employment, the first instalment vesting after the first year.

Cumulatively, Joshi stands to make a little over Rs 46 crore in his first year as CEO.

How this stacks up globally

Among the other leadership changes this year is the appointment of Ravi Kumar as Cognizant CEO in January. Cognizant was once the barometer of growth for the industry, and the gap in performance between Kumar’s former employer Infosys and Cognizant has been closing.

According to an exchange filing, Ravi Kumar will make an annual base salary of $1 million, annual cash incentive of $2 million, $4.6 million in RSUs vesting over a three-year period, and $6.9 million in performance-based stock units.

Apart from this, he received a sign-on bonus of $7,50,000, RSUs of a total of $5 million vesting in quarterly instalments from when he started, as well as performance units of up to $7.5 million measured over a four-year performance cycle.

In his first year, Kumar stands to make roughly $7 million (~Rs 57 crore) at the least from his annual base salary, RSUs as part of the new role, and his sign-on bonus.

The highest-paid executive is Accenture’s Julie Sweet, who took home $33 million in FY21-22, according to the company’s filings in December 2022 (Accenture’s fiscal year runs from September 1 to August 31). Of this, $25 million was in stock awards. With a cost of living adjustment for median remuneration, Sweet made 653 times the median income of an Accenture employee. Without the adjustment, it stands at 1,506.

IBM’s Arvind Krishna earned $16.58 million in 2022 — $1.5 million in base salary, $8.9 million in stock options, $8.93 million in RSUs and PSUs and $2.03 million in option awards. His annual incentives grew by more than $5,00,000 to $3.48 million. Krishna made 271 times the median remuneration at IBM.

Outlook

Tech Mahindra is currently trading at a valuation with a P/E multiple of 17.7x/13.0x on FY24E/FY25E earnings. The story is premised on pipeline commentary, improved services portfolio (design, engineering and consulting) & acquisition synergies, and 5G-related spending and reduction in the attrition rate and hence we are assigning a P/E multiple of 14x to the FY25E estimated EPS of INR 86.2 to arrive at a target price of INR 1,207, with an upside of around 7.7%. Accordingly, we kept our rating to a “Accumulate” for the stock.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TECHM) delivered a weak 1QFY24 performance, with revenue declining 4.2% QoQ in CC to USD1.6b, missing our estimate of a 2.5% decline. The weakness was primarily due to a slowdown in CME (down 9.5% QoQ), while Enterprise saw a marginal dip vs. 4QFY23. 1Q EBIT margin (adjusted for client-specific write-off) was down 240bp QoQ at 8.8% (est. 10.6%). TECHM delivered weak TCV for the second straight quarter at USD359m, down 39% QoQ after a 25% QoQ decline in Q4. Given the slowdown in Communications business across IT services peers in the last few weeks, there was a concern about a weak revenue performance from TECHM. But we were still surprised by the sharp drop in CME vertical (38% of revenues in 1Q) even after adjusting for the Comviva seasonality. While we expect the segment to return to growth in 2Q, we remain concerned about near-term demand in the space, given the adverse readthrough from the global ecosystem, including telecom hardware makers. We factor in USD revenue decline of 7.1% YoY in the vertical in FY24.

Outlook

We remain on the sidelines as we feel the current valuation fairly factors in the uncertainties around growth and margin. We cut our FY24/FY25 EPS estimates by 8-10% on weak margin and muted outlook. We remain Neutral on the stock with a TP of INR1,080 (17x FY25E EPS).

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

Constant currency revenue declined 4.1% q-o-q, missing our estimates of 1.9% decline q-o-q, due to weak revenues from CME and BFSI verticals, down 9.4%/3.2% q-o-q. EBIT margin contracted sharply by ~440 bps q-o-q to 6.8 %, below our estimates of 10.8% due to revenue drop impacting margin, one-time provisioning and seasonality.

The number of active clients declined by 42 to 1255.Net headcount declined by 4,103 taking the total headcount to 1,48,297.



Outlook

Tech Mahindra reported the weakest performance among Tier 1 IT service companies with declining trajectory of Net new deal wins which places its earnings outlook at risk. Hence, we downgrade Tech Mahindra to Reduce with revised PT of Rs 1050. At CMP, the stock trades at 21.2/15.5x FY24E/FY25E EPS.

HDFC Securities' research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra’s (TECHM) disappointing Q1 performance has elements that could take longer to recover. While the dismal levels of margin are the bottom, its recovery trajectory can be protracted. The slip in Q1 revenue of -4% QoQ was largely led by the CME vertical (38% of revenue) which dropped 9.5% QoQ, while the Enterprise segment delivered in line with peers (flat sequentially). The decline in the CME vertical was a combination of impact on network services, lower discretionary spend, and transition-delay between project completion and project/phase starts. The margin was impacted by certain oneoffs pertaining to provision towards client-specific situations (-200bps impact).



Outlook

We downgrade TECHM to Reduce (ADD earlier) with a TP at INR 1,020 (14x Jun-25E EPS) as recovery in growth/margin may be protracted on sub-par bookings and near-term challenges in CME vertical may persist for longer (recent instances of deals from large customers going to competition as well as business challenges for telcos).

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Tech Mahindra

TechM’s revenue slumped 4% QoQ (4.2% CC) to USD1.6bn, missing our estimates. EBITM declined by 440bps QoQ to 6.8%, well below our estimate even after adjusting for one-offs. The sharp decline in CME (-9.4% QoQ), owing to cut in discretionary spending and closure of network services projects, largely explains the revenue miss. Deal wins remain weak, and stand at USD359mn (TTM deal-intake down ~25% YoY). Mgmt attributed the weak performance to cut in discretionary spend/delay in decision making amid macro uncertainties. It expects performance to recover in H2. We cut FY24E EPS by ~17%, factoring-in a weak Q1 and near-term uncertainty, while lowering FY25- 26E EPS by <2%, in anticipation of demand improvement/better execution. TechM has failed to capitalize on its strength in the areas of communications, ER&D, BPO, XDS, etc, and deliver consistent performance in the past.

Outlook

We believe leadership change gives more credence to turnaround efforts, entailing better execution, sustainable margin expansion and scaling of BFSI & other verticals (ex-CME). We retain BUY; TP: Rs1,200, at 16x Jun-25E EPS.

Tech Mahindra has delayed wage hikes for a certain senior employee base to the following quarter amid nose-diving profits and EBIT margins reported by the company during its recent earnings conference.

The company's Chief Financial Officer, Rohit Anand, added that wage increments were given out to the majority of the employee base in the first quarter that ended June 30 itself, causing a 1.3 percent decline in the company's EBIT margins this quarter. The EBIT margins fell to 6.8 percent from 11.2 percent in the previous quarter.

""Majority of the wage inflation is already done in Q1. Only for a certain senior proportion of the employee base, it will happen in the following quarter,"" Anand said during its Q1 results analyst conference.

He further added, ""From an increment impact perspective for the quarter, as I mentioned, we did increment for most of the population. The impact was closer to 1.3% in terms of margin, and there is a certain size of the population for whom the increment will happen in Q2. So that's a smaller impact.""

Margin improvement levers for FY24

Tech Mahindra reported a washout Q1 performance, missing analyst estimates on all counts. Net profit was down by over 38 percent both YoY and QoQ. Revenue fell by around 4.1 percent QoQ.

Around 200 bps of the 440 bps fall QoQ in EBIT margin was accounted to the bankruptcy filed by a certain customer of the company, while revenue took a hit amid a seasonally slow quarter for the company as Comviva business took a hit.

According to Anand, margin recovery for the upcoming quarters will be driven by subcontracting substitution, improving scale and other productivity benefits.

“If you look at the last three quarters, while growth has been stagnant or down, we've been able to drive a reduction in the subcontracting costs dramatically,” he said.

“Similarly, the other areas also, which I mentioned maybe except a little bit of view on juniorization, which probably needs to be supplemented with growth and the recovery in the second half. The rest can be worked on as purely productivity measures that can help us as we think about margin expansion,” Anand said.

The company had also reported a decline of 4,103 employees in net addition for Q1 on a QoQ basis. On a YoY basis, the total headcount was down by over 9,000 employees.

Not just Tech Mahindra, its peers Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech too have been either delaying or skipping wage hike cycles in FY24 due to tough business environments and macroeconomic growth headwinds.

Infosys has deferred pay hikes for senior management and employees across all levels without communicating the same to them. Senior management usually receives pay hikes in July while employees across levels get it by April.

Wipro is delaying its wage hike cycle to the December quarter. Last fiscal year, hikes were rolled out in the September quarter. Meanwhile, the company will be paying out only 80 percent of the variable pay to the junior employees in Q1, which is linked to the company’s overall performance.

HCLTech entirely skipped its compensation hike review of the senior management level employees, while deferring reviews of the junior and mid-level employees by a quarter.

Among all of these companies, the country’s largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) became an outlier, having kick-started its promotion cycle, offering 12-15 percent hikes to its exceptional performers effective from April 1.

Shares of Tech Mahindra fell over 4 per cent in early trade on July 27 on BSE a day after the company reported its Q1FY24 earnings. It hit a low of Rs 1097.25 a share. The stock fell for five straight sessions and was down 12.4 percent.

Most of the brokerages downgraded Tech Mahindra Ltd and cut its target price post its weak June quarter earnings.

Kotak Institutional Equities have downgraded the stock to reduce from add and lowered target price to Rs 1,100 a share from Rs 1,143 a share. Nuvama Research has downgraded the stock to reduce and cut target price to Rs 1,000 a share from Rs 1,140.

The IT firm reported a weak quarter. Tech Mahindra saw its revenue fall by 4 percent sequentially to $1600.7 million. Revenue has fallen 4.2 percent in constant currency terms, making this the steepest fall among its peers. Wipro and HCLTech also saw a decline in revenue this quarter. It reported a 38 percent year-on-year decline in net profit which stood at Rs 692.5 crore.

Brokerage firm Kotak has cut FY2024-26 EPS estimates by 6-18% with the maximum reserved for FY2024. It forecast revenue decline of 2.2% in FY202. "" The full impact of the interventions of Mohit Joshi will be visible by FY2025E. We forecast c/c revenue growth of 8.3 percent and EBIT margin expansion by 300 bps in FY2025E. However, TM stock has already run up in the past three months despite facing the highest EPS cuts. The stock is fully valued at 17X FY2025E"", Kotak report added.

Tech Mahindra's CEO and MD CP Gurnani said that this was one of the toughest quarters for the company in the last five years. This comes at a time when the business environment is getting challenging for the IT companies with several major firms cutting down on growth guidance.

This quarter, Tech Mahindra's incoming CEO and MD Mohit Joshi also joined as a senior board member from June 19. Gurnani is set to retire on December 19.

Although analysts hold an optimistic view of the new CEO, Mohit Joshi, they also acknowledge the significant challenge he faces in revitalizing the company's performance in terms of growth and margins. Any strategies he devises and implements will require time to show results in the earnings, which could lead to a period where the company's stock may underperform compared to its peers.

EBIT margins came in at 6.8 percent, a fall of 440 bps from last quarter's 11.2 percent. The company's total contract value (TCV) or deal wins stood at $359 mn, down from $592 mn (-39.36 percent) in the last quarter, and $802 mn (-55.24 percent) in the same quarter last year.

""TechM’s weak Q1 performance in conjunction with FY23’s low exit rate, coupled with paltry deal flow and shaky macros, will likely keep the company’s revenue growth flat in FY24 – significantly below peers"", said Nuvama in its latest report.

Meanwhile, Nomura has maintained its buy rating and increased its target price by 15 percent to Rs 1316 a share amid inexpensive valuations and considering 4.5 percent of higher dividend yield.

With a challenging macroeconomic landscape and Tech Mahindra’s washout earnings in the June quarter, CEO and MD designate Mohit Joshi is in for an uphill task as he preps to take over. He remains confident that despite the Q1 numbers, the IT services firm will do well in the medium to long term.

Joshi is set to take up the top job after present CEO and MD CP Gurnani retires on December 19. As of now, Joshi has joined as a senior board member of the company and along with Gurnani, has been meeting clients and employees across Tech Mahindra’s centres in India and abroad in the past 4-6 weeks.

Speaking at his first earnings conference, and during a quarter which Gurnani called as Tech Mahindra’s ‘toughest quarter in the last five years’, Joshi said: “We have had a challenging set of results, but going forward, in the time I have spent with the company I am confident about our medium and long-term growth. This will be based on the really strong and robust platform that we will work to build on as CP and I work over the transition over the next few months.”

“With the opportunity I had to meet our clients around the world and get an early sense of our service lines, I am enthused by the depth of the client connect – in many cases these are relationships that span multiple decades. There’s a deep sense of business value that Tech Mahindra has given to these clients. Several clients have spoken about that we have been an integral part of their transformation journey and will continue to be so in the future,” he added.

In Q1FY24, Tech Mahindra’s performance was largely hit due to the slowdown and decline in its single-biggest vertical, communications, entertainment and media (CME), which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the company’s revenue, due to its Comviva business facing seasonality. Though most other verticals also remained tepid to negative, CME was the worst performing.

Gurnani said that under Joshi’s leadership, the company will also attempt to reduce revenue weightage on CME to win more deals in the BFSI, healthcare and other non-CME verticals, which is Joshi’s area of expertise.

But that doesn’t mean the company would do away with its emerging technology segments it has been known for. Joshi said, “I am also struck by the investments we have made in creating and incubating our service lines, working closely with our ecosystem partners on technologies like AI, data analytics etc. the service lines are truly cutting edge. I am confident that as we move forward, this will continue.”

Joshi is an Infosys veteran with over 22 years of experience with expertise in banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) and healthcare verticals. In his previous role, he was involved in executing Infosys’ overall transformation as part of its leadership team over the past few years.

According to industry analysts, this will help with diversifying Tech Mahindra’s deal win strategy and help them win large deals -- deals that usually go to the top two or three companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys.

Tech Mahindra announced its Q1FY24 results on July 26. Net profit declined 38 percent YoY, which stood at Rs 692.5 crore in Q1, as compared to the same quarter in the last fiscal year. Sequentially too, net profit was down by over 38 percent.

Consolidated revenue for Q1FY24 stood at Rs 13,159 crore, growing 3.5 percent YoY, but it was down by 4.1 percent on a QoQ basis.

Tech Mahindra's Q1 order book declined over 39 percent QoQ to $359 million from $592 million in the previous quarter. It plunged around 55 percent YoY.

EBIT margin too was a major miss at 6.8 percent as compared to analyst estimates. It was down from 11.2 percent last quarter. Net headcount addition for the quarter was down by 4,103.",667,-0.01105438470840454

After reporting a disappointing performance in the quarter ended June 30, Tech Mahindra's CEO and MD CP Gurnani said that this was one of the toughest quarters for the company in the last five years. This comes at a time when the business environment is getting challenging for IT companies with several major firms cutting down on growth guidance.

This quarter, Tech Mahindra's incoming CEO and MD Mohit Joshi also joined as a senior board member from June 19. Gurnani is set to retire on December 19.

Tech Mahindra's results were marred by decline on all fronts including revenue, profitability and EBIT margins -- it missed all the industry estimates. The Communications, Media & Entertainment (CME) vertical, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the company's revenue, was the worst-performing segment.

""Revenue was down by over 4 percent QoQ, majorly due to a decline in the CME segment. While some of the drop could have been anticipated, some of the macro environment challenges and stretchy deal conversion cycles especially in CME have impacted the balance between the supply chain and the actual performance,"" Gurnani said while addressing the media.

He added, ""Some of these challenges are temporary. We will bounce back in the next few quarters. This quarter was one of the toughest quarters I have seen in the last five years. But we believe we will be able to bring back growth trajectory over the next few years. We have great service offerings, a great team and a close customer association of over 1,300 customers.""

Gurnani also mentioned that with the appointment of Joshi as the new CEO, the company is looking to reduce revenue contribution weightage from the CME vertical to win more deals in the BFSI, healthcare and other non-CME segments.

Joshi, an Infosys veteran with over 22 years of experience and expertise in the BFSI and healthcare sector, added that the company will recover from the challenges in the medium to long term.

Gurnani added, ""These are uncertain times. With the impact of war on Europe, supply chain disruptions etc., the reality is there is a speed breaker right now which is influencing the industry.""

Decline in deal wins

Tech Mahindra reported an order book of $359 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2023, a decrease of over 39 percent QoQ from $592 million in the previous quarter, due to weakness of the CME segment.

Order book saw over 55 percent drop on a YoY basis. In Q1FY23, the company had reported $802 million in deal wins.

This comes at a time when Tech Mahindra's peers such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro and LTIMindtree reported strong deal total contract value (TCV) in Q1, even though future deal conversion timelines remain uncertain.

Sector-wise, growth was largely driven by manufacturing which grew at 1.8 percent QoQ and the technology segment which grew 0.1 percent QoQ.

Other major verticals reported negative growth including the CME, which declines 9.4 percent QoQ, and BFSI was down by 3.2 percent QoQ. Retail, transport and logistics segments too remained negative.

The company, meanwhile, is also focussing more on building its generative AI capabilities having set up a studio in Q1. It has also upskilled around 8,000 associates of the company in generative AI skills.

Gurnani said that the company has invested a lot in AI platforms, and doubled down on investments in cloud, data and the 5G solutions. It is doing ""reasonably"" well with metaverse, blockchain and Web 3.0 technologies.

""We will continue to focus on the leading technologies. We are seeing a little bit of a slowdown in this quarter, but our investments will help us become better,"" he said.

Networks, generative AI, cloud and cyber security will continue to define the way Tech Mahindra is built, Gurnani pointed out.

A washout quarter

Tech Mahindra announced its Q1FY24 earnings on July 26. The company's net profit declined 38 percent YoY, which stood at Rs 692.5 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, as compared to the same quarter in the last fiscal year. Sequentially too, net profit was down by over 38 percent.

Consolidated revenue for Q1FY24 stood at Rs 13,159 crore, growing 3.5 percent YoY as against Rs 12,708 crore reported in the year-ago period. Revenue was down by 4.1 percent on a QoQ basis, as against Rs 13,718 crore reported in the year-ago period.

EBIT margin too was a major miss at 6.8 percent as compared to analyst estimates. It was down from 11.2 percent last quarter.

IT services firm Tech Mahindra's net employee addition for the quarter ended June 30 declined by 4,103 employees on a sequential-quarter basis. This is in line with the industry-wide trend of slowdown in hiring amid macroeconomic challenges, demand uncertainties and delay in deal closures.

The total headcount for Q1 stood at 148,297. On a YoY basis, it was down by 9,738.

The attrition rate dropped to 13 percent from 15 percent in Q4. The firm has been seeing a drop in attrition rate since the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.

Tech Mahindra's Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director CP Gurnani said the company is focusing on building generative AI talent and has upskilled around 8,000 associates in Q1.

In January this year, speaking with Moneycontrol at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gurnani, observed that hiring will be higher when attrition is higher, and net hiring will be low when attrition starts declining.

“Hiring cannot always be linear. The reality is that AI, data, and automation are part of our lives. If it is not linear, revenue goes up. If you don't hire, please do take into account that we are becoming more efficient with automation,” he had said.

Among its peers, barring Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which added about 523 employees in Q1, all the other top companies including Infosys, Wipro and LTIMindtree cumulatively lost more than 20,000 employees in Q1.

Tech Mahindra announced its Q1FY24 earnings on July 26. The company's net profit declined 38 percent YoY, which stood at Rs 692.5 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, as compared to the same quarter in the last fiscal year. Sequentially too, net profit was down by over 38 percent.

Consolidated revenue for Q1FY24 stood at Rs 13,159 crore, growing 3.5 percent YoY as against Rs 12,708 crore reported in the year-ago period. Revenue was down by 4.1 percent on a QoQ basis, as against Rs 13,718 crore reported in the year-ago period.

EBIT margin too was a major miss at 6.8 percent as compared to analyst estimates, down from 11.2 percent last quarter.",366,-0.772782826423645

IT services company Tech Mahindra saw its revenue fall by 4 percent sequentially to $1600.7 mn (Rs 13,159 crore) missing analyst estimates, in a quarter that has been a washout among all the large IT companies. However, Tech Mahindra's revenue has fallen 4.2 percent in constant currency terms, making this the steepest fall among its peers. Wipro and HCLTech also saw a decline in revenue this quarter.

This was evidenced by Chief Executive Officer CP Gurnani's statement that this is one of the toughest quarters he has seen in the last five years.

Tech Mahindra reported a 38 percent year-on-year decline in net profit which stood at Rs 692.5 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, as compared to the same quarter in the last fiscal year, when it stood at Rs 1,147.5 crore. Sequentially, the decline was 38 percent, as compared to the net profit of Rs 1,125 crore reported in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year.

The company's margins were a big miss, and fell way more than what was estimated. EBIT margins came in at 6.8 percent, a fall of 440 bps from last quarter's 11.2 percent, making this also the weakest among its peers. Defending its margins is something that Tech Mahindra has continued to struggle with as it has remained the lowest among its peers.

Of the 440 bps impact, CFO Rohit Anand said that 200bps was due to drop in service revenue (primarily in communications), around half a percent due to seasonality in Comviva (subsidiary servicing telecom clients), and a one-time impact of 200bps due to a ""certain customer situation going into bankruptcy proceedings"" for which the company had to make a provision.

The company's total contract value (TCV) or deal wins stood at $359 mn, down from $592 mn (-39.36 percent) in the last quarter, and $802 mn (-55.24 percent) in the same quarter last year.

The troubled times that Tech Mahindra finds itself are also seen in its net addition numbers, with its headcount having shrunk sequentially by 4,103. This is the third consecutive decline for Tech Mahindra, during which it has seen its headcount reduce by over 15,000 employees on a net basis.

This comes even as the company's attrition has fallen to 13 percent, the lowest among its peers, and its utilisation is at 87 percent.

CEO and MD CP Gurnani said in a statement that the company's numbers this quarter ""reflects the uncertainty in the global economy and the IT sector.""

""We are confident that we have the right strategy and the right team to overcome this temporary setback and deliver longterm value for our customers and shareholders,"" he said.

Chief Financial Officer Rohit Anand said this quarter was a challenging one. ""This quarter was a challenging one for us as revenue growth faced strong headwinds and that had an impact on profitability. We have taken swift and decisive actions to address these issues and improve our execution.

Among its verticals, the steepest fall was seen in the Communications, Media and Entertainment vertical, the largest for Tech Mahindra, as revenue from the industry declined by 9.4 percent sequentially. Banking, Financial Services and Industry fell by 3.2 per cent, and Retail by 0.3 percent, while Manufacturing grew by 1.8 percent and Technology was flat at 0.1 percent.

By geographies, Europe saw revenue decline of 6.7 percent, Americas by 0.5 percent and Rest of World by 8.2 percent.

Incoming Chief Executive Officer Mohit Joshi, an Infosys veteran who takes over the reins in December from Gurnani, faces a tough task. Analysts have said that the company needs to fix execution, as it hasn't been able to deliver industry-leading revenue growth rates, and also hasn't been able to shore up its profit margins.",626,-0.8569143755095345

IT services firm Tech Mahindra is expected to report a marginal decline in net profit for the first quarter of this fiscal amid flat-to-negative revenue growth due to lower tech spends triggered by the economic slowdown in the West, analysts said.

The Mahindra Group firm is likely to report a net profit of Rs 1,107 crore, representing a decline of 2.12 percent YoY, as per the average of a poll of estimates of four brokerages.

Tech Mahindra had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,131 crore in the first quarter of the preceding fiscal FY23.

When compared sequentially, the company’s net profit is seen contracting by 0.90 percent compared to Rs 1,117 crore in Q4 FY23.

Revenue is estimated to grow 6.23 percent to Rs 13,499 crore from Rs 12,707 crore in Q1 FY23. However sequentially, it is expected to decline from the consolidated revenue of Rs 13,718 crore clocked in the preceding quarter Q4 FY23.

“We expect TechM to report -2.3 percent QoQ decline in constant currency and -2 percent in USD -- driven by overall weak macro, lower tech spend and Q1 seasonality,” analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities said in a note to clients.

It also expects margins to decline by 110 bps QoQ -- mainly due to wage hike, Q1 seasonality and decline in revenue.

The company’s EBITDA margin stood at 11.2 percent in the preceding quarter and 11 percent in Q1 FY23.

“Deal wins are expected to be modest, and so is the overall outlook,” it added.

Choppy Waters

Foreign brokerage Jefferies expects Tech Mahindra's 1Q revenues to decline by 1.5 percent QoQ (in constant currency terms), impacted by weakness in the communication vertical, seasonal weakness at its subsidiary Comviva and overall macro weakness.

“EBIT margin to decline by 150 bps QoQ due to revenue decline and wage hikes. Deal wins likely to be soft similar to last quarter,” it added.

Tech Mahindra had posted a 26 percent decline in consolidated net profit for the March quarter of 2022-23, while revenue from operations stayed flat on a sequential basis and up 13 percent on-year.

In a note, Kotak Institutional Equities said Tech Mahindra is likely to post a sharp 3 percent QoQ decline in revenues in the communications vertical and flattish revenues in enterprise segment.

“Revenue decline in communications vertical is due to seasonal weakness in Comviva and ramp down by a large telecom client. Of particular focus will be weak top five client billing,” it noted.

Revenue decline will likely feed into margins.

“We build in EBIT margin decline of 40 bps on a sequential basis due to decline in Comviva margin. Lack of leverage from growth is the key headwind. Utilization levels are maxed out and will provide limited tailwinds,” the domestic brokerage added.

Dismal growth, guidance downgrades, declining headcount: How Indian IT majors fared in Q1

Analysts said the overall weak global macro and slow decision-making will likely feed into muted deal wins.

In such a scenario, the focus will shift entirely to turnaround initiatives and margin expansion strategies of CEO- Designate, Mohit Joshi, Kotak said.

The brokerage added that other key factors to watch will be the near-term growth outlook given by the firm, timing of divestments of low-margin businesses, health of deal pipeline and outlook for revenue growth in top telecom clients.

Most IT firms have posted lacklustre numbers for the June quarter, impacted by the recessionary headwinds in Europe and US – the bread-and-butter markets for the domestic IT players.

“We expect macro-related uncertainty, likely slowdown in tech spends and supply-side pressure to impede growth in the near-term at least in 2 more quarters,” brokerage Ashika said in a recent report.

The top five Indian IT companies (by market capitalisation) have seen their sequential revenue growth on a constant currency basis at anywhere between -2.8 percent and 1 percent, a far cry from the high single-digit and double-digit growth seen last year. The biggest shocker, however, was Infosys’ sharp guidance cut for the year from 4-7 percent to 1-3.5 percent.

Bulls kept their reign over Dalal Street for the third straight week, lifting the market to fresh historic highs on July 14. The Nifty50 closed above the 19,500 mark for the first time, especially after breaking the eight-day consolidation range of 19,300-19,500 points.

The index jumped 1.2 percent to 19,565 and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts, with making higher highs formation for 16th consecutive week.

Further, the index has seen a breakout of upward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of December last year and previous week, with the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) showing bullish crossover on all timeframes.

Technically, the Nifty seems to be looking strong now. Hence, 19,600-19,700 is expected to be key resistance area initially for the Nifty50, followed by 19,800-19,900 levels, with immediate support at 19,500, and then at 19,400-19,300 levels, experts said.

""The bulls are being resilient to let loose their grip even in the overbought parameters which showcase their dominance. But at the same time, one should not become complacent and overrule the possibility of a breather post the steep rally,"" Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst for Technical and Derivative Research at Angel One, said.

As far as levels are concerned, he feels 19,400-19,300 is likely to cushion any short-term blip, while the sacrosanct support lies around the bullish gap of 19,200 in the comparable period.

On the flip side, as the index entered uncharted territory there is no relevant hurdle; however, the next pitstop could be seen around 19,650-19,700 on an immediate basis, he said.

He expects strong moves in the broader markets amid the quarterly earnings, so one needs to have a stock-centric approach for better trading opportunities and also stay abreast with global and domestic developments.

Option data clearly indicated that 20,000 can be a possibility for the Nifty in coming weeks, but in near term, 19,600-19,700 can act as a resistance area, while the 19,500-19,300 is expected to be support area.

Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities feels the bulls are likely to remain in control. ""There is room for further upside, and we anticipate the Nifty to reach fresh all-time highs around the 20,000 mark in the near term,"" he said.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra’s (TECHM) FY23 annual report highlights that the inflationary environment has led to a massive shift in tech spending by enterprises. The spending is now finding its way through conserving resources and optimizing costs. Enterprises continue to accelerate the adoption of new-age technologies to drive innovation and enable a new operating model for making it consumer centric and agile. For 5G technology, which is still emerging and relatively new, TECHM has established a leadership team in the space, and its 5G-related revenue crossed USD1b in FY23. In FY23, TECHM reported new deal TCV of USD2.9b (book-to-bill of 0.4x), with a major proportion of digital transformation projects. Given a delay in decision making amid adverse macros, the conversion remains a challenge in the near to-medium term.

Outlook

Considering the near-term weakness, we await greater comfort on sustainable and profitable growth. We value the stock at 16x FY25E EPS. We maintain our Neutral rating.

Tech Mahindra's annual report points out that the inflationary environment has led to a massive transformation in tech spending strategies employed by enterprises.

In response to rising costs, businesses are now focusing on conserving resources and optimising expenditures. This shift reflects a strategic approach to adapt to the challenging economic landscape.

Tech Mahindra's adjusted operating margin in FY23 came in at 11.3 percent, down 320 basis points year-on-year. The margin contraction was mainly due to robust hiring, intense compensation revision and elevated subcontracting as percentage of topline at 15 percent.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

The market, despite Friday's correction, ended the last week on a positive note and continued upward rally for second consecutive week on July 7. The Nifty50 hit a fresh record high before getting into correction on Friday and settled tad above 19,300, down 0.85 percent, whereas for the week, it rallied 0.74 percent.

The index has formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the weekly charts, indicating selling pressure or failure to sustain at record high levels, but the higher highs formation continued for 15th consecutive week, which is a positive sign.

After the breakout of horizontal as well as upward sloping resistance trendlines in previous week ending June 30, the index sustained uptrend in following week, which is a positive sign. Overall, the index is likely to continue its march upwards amid consolidation with hurdle at 19,500-19,600 levels, whereas the near term support is expected to be 19,300-19,200 levels, followed by crucial support at 19,000, experts said.

""We believe the bull run is likely to continue, marking the start of a major upward movement. However, the momentum on the upside may not match the intensity of the past couple of weeks. Considering the overbought conditions, we may witness a period of consolidation in the coming week, during which dips could be seen as buying opportunities,"" Sameet Chavan, head research, technical and derivatives at Angel One said.

On the other hand, he advised to take secure profits at higher levels and avoid complacency until the indicators exit the overbought territory.

In terms of support levels, the immediate support lies around 19,200, where a bullish gap was left last week, while the major breakout levels around 19,000-18,900 serve as a strong foundation for the market, Sameet said.

As the prices are currently in uncharted territory, it is challenging to identify resistance zones, however, the range of 19,500-19,600 appears to be an immediate hurdle for the anticipated consolidation, he believes.

Ajit Mishra, SVP - Technical Research at Religare Broking also sees consolidation, saying after the recent vertical up move in Nifty from 18,600 to 19,500 in no time, it is prudent for the index to spend some time around the current levels before marching further northwards.

He expects Nifty to respect the 18,700-19,000 zone in case of any dip, while the 19,500-19,700 zone may act as a hurdle.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the July 7 closing prices:

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities

Granules India: Buy | LTP: Rs 311.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 289 | Targets: Rs 340-375 | Return: 20 percent

The attached weekly timeframe chart of Granules India indicates sustainable upside bounce in the last couple of weeks. The stock price is currently in an attempt of upside breakout of the hurdle at Rs 310 levels, which is neckline of double bottom formation. Hence, a sustainable upmove from here could bring sharp upside momentum for the stock price.

We observe larger degree of higher bottom formation and the anticipated upmove could open renewed buying towards new higher top formation. Volume has started to expand during an attempt of upside breakout and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication. The overall chart pattern of Granules indicates long trading opportunity.

Buying can be initiated in Granules at CMP (Rs 311.9), add more on dips down to Rs 300, wait for the upside target of Rs 340 and next Rs 375 in 1 month, with a stop-loss of Rs 289.

UPL: Sell | LTP: Rs 663 | Stop-Loss: Rs 702 | Target: Rs 615 | Return: 7 percent

After showing narrow range movement in the last two months, the stock price has slipped into weakness from the highs and closed at the lower range of Rs 660 levels as per weekly chart.

Weekly negative chart pattern like lower tops and bottoms is intact and the stock price is currently placed at the edge of downside breakout of the crucial support like ascending trend line at Rs 660 levels. Volume has started to expand on Friday during weakness in the stock price and the weekly 14 period RSI shows negative indication.

One may look to sell UPL Ltd at CMP (Rs 663), add more on rise up to Rs 685 and wait for the downside target of Rs 615 in the next 1 month. Place a stop-loss of Rs 702.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research (retail) at Kotak Securities

LIC Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 390 | Stop-Loss: Rs 369 | Targets: Rs 430-450 | Return: 15 percent

After a strong rally, currently the stock is witnessing rangebound activity. However, the medium term texture of the stock is still in to the positive side. Technically, on weekly charts, the stock has formed higher bottom formation and comfortably trading above 200 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average) which is largely positive.

Unless it is trading below Rs 369, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 430-450. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 390 and Rs 380 levels, with a stop-loss below Rs 369.

Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 111.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 106 | Targets: Rs 125-130 | Return: 16.5 percent

After a quick short-term correction, the stock took the support near 200-day SMA and reversed. Post reversal, the stock is comfortably trading above 200-day SMA that is largely positive. In addition, on weekly charts the stock has formed promising reversal formation and the texture of the chart suggesting strong possibility of fresh uptrend rally from the current levels.

Triveni Continental Kings won the grand finale of the inaugural edition of Tech Mahindra Global Chess League, which took place at the Le Meridien Hotel in Dubai on July 2. In a nail-biting event, the winner was decided through three stages of tie-breakers.

The champion was decided between with Triveni Continental Kings and upGrad Mumba Masters in rapid, blitz and even sudden-death matches. Jonas Bjerre, a Danish 19-year-old grandmaster brought victory for Triveni Continental Kings after defeating Javokhit Sindarov, a 17-year-old prodigy from Uzbekistan.

Bjerre is otherwise one of the most inexperienced players in the tournament who, despite losing most of his games, emerged victorious when it was time. He suffered four losses to Sindarov in a draw-even endgame, but Bjerre got the upper hand.

“The last game was incredibly tense. It was really exciting. I’m still shivering”, said Bjerre after his victory. “Levon (team captain) told me - just fight; if you win this game, you will win the event,” he further added.

The finals consisted of two rapid matches wherein the finalists had to take both of them. Triveni Continental Kings won the first match, winning by 9:7. In the second round, upGrad made a comeback by defeating Triveni by a score of 12:3.

With both sides in a tie-up, the finale had to head for the two-round blitz tiebreak wherein both the players had three minutes each with a two-second increment per move. Triveni finally seized the title by turning 13:7 against Mumbai.

With this victory, Bjerre not only won the title for his team but also received a prize of $5,00,000. The overall fund for the tournament was $1 million.",294,0.22176172335942587

In a LinkedIn post last week, Joshi said he was excited to join Tech Mahindra and build on its strong foundation by opening up new avenues of growth.

Here is what we know about Mohit Joshi, who is going to become the new CEO of Tech Mahindra:

Mohit Joshi, 47, has over two decades of experience in the technology and software sector. He spent nearly 23 years with Infosys, where he started his career as a Senior Business Development Manager in 2000.

Over the years, he was promoted to Global Head of Sales & Marketing - Banking & Capital Markets, VP & Head of Financial Services in Europe and Executive Vice President – Global Head Financial Services.

For the last seven years, he had served as President of Infosys – a role for which he was based in London, UK. He lives in London with his wife and two daughters.

According to a Times of India report, Joshi’s resignation from Infosys left a leadership vacuum at the top, coming as it did only five months after the company’s only other president, Ravi Kumar, quit to lead Cognizant. Infosys reportedly tried to convince Joshi to stay, but his appointment as Tech Mahindra CEO designate was announced in March 2023.

According to an Infosys filing, Joshi was the highest-paid employee in his last year, drawing Rs 57.32 crore as compensation.

Joshi is an alumnus of Delhi Public School – RK Puram. He studied history at DU’s St Stephen’s College and completed his MBA from the Faculty of Management Sciences in 1996.

He was chosen as a Young Global leader in March 2014 by the World Economic Forum, in which capacity he attended the Global Leadership and Public Policy for the 21st Century programme at Harvard Kennedy School.

Joshi started his career at ANZ Grindlays Bank in 1996. Over the decades, he has worked across Latin America, Europe, Asia and America.",524,0.9999415079752604

Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities has downgraded Tech Mahindra Ltd to add from buy rating at a target price of Rs 1175 a share.

The downgrade comes after the stock rallied 10 percent since the start of May till date. The rally is attributed to the appointment of the former president of Infosys, Mohit Joshi as company's new Managing Director and Chief Executive. Meanwhile, its peers in the same period were trading mixed. Infosys rose 2.7 percent, TCS lost 0.5 percent and Wipro declined 0.4 percent.

Kotak believes that the CEO-designate has the potential to make significant improvements to the overall well-being of the business. However, they acknowledge that there are numerous challenges ahead, as the turnaround needs to be executed without any room for additional investments and requires the elimination of low-quality, low-margin business portfolios.

""We value Tech Mahindra at 16X June 2025E EPS (from March 2025E EPS earlier). We cut FY2024 and FY2025 revenue estimates by 1% as we bake in a weaker demand environment. Our EPS remains unchanged as we bake in moderate Rupee depreciation in our estimates"", said Kotak in its latest report.

Kotak predicts a modest 0.8% growth in US dollar revenue for FY2024. This forecast takes into account various factors, including the repercussions of the program and IT restructuring initiated by a major telecom client, the streamlining of unprofitable businesses, unexpected challenges arising from acquired businesses, and the discretionary nature of acquisitions in spending areas.

Additionally, a slowdown in the industry and the leadership transition will contribute to subdued growth. Kotak expects a currency-adjusted (c/c) revenue growth of 0.5% for FY2024, which is comparatively weaker than its peers. The struggle to maintain margins is expected to persist.

""We expect an uptick in growth in FY2025E as the demand environment improves and a few company-specific factors fade. We do not assume any meaningful rationalization of unprofitable businesses. As a result, the margin may not hit the desired goal,"" Kotak said in its report.

""At a broader level, we do note that TM has a reasonable set of competencies and vertical presence— these include leadership in telecom, strength in manufacturing (especially autos) and improving presence in financial services. Further, it has a good presence in some of the service lines, especially experience design services and network services. The full impact of the interventions of Mohit Joshi will also be visible by FY2025E.

India’s fifth-largest IT services company Tech Mahindra’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) CP Gurnani saw his pay fall by 51 percent in FY23 to Rs 32 crore, primarily on account of the stock options exercised, according to the company’s annual report for FY23 released on June 26. Gurnani’s pay fell from Rs 63.4 crore the preceding year.

Of the Rs 32 crore, Rs 25 crore was on account of ESOPs exercised by Gurnani. He made Rs 2.7 crore as part of this salary and Rs 1.8 crore in commissions. Gurnani made 466.99 times the median remuneration of employees at the company, which stood at Rs 6,62,076.

Overall, the annual report said that employees were given an increase of 6 percent in their pay package (including those overseas). In the same time period, the remuneration of managerial Personnel have decreased by 41 percent. But again, if the stock options exercised part is removed, then the managerial pay has not decreased.

Like Gurnani, some of his peers have also seen a reduction in pay. However, he still earned more than former Tata Consultancy Services CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, who earned Rs 29.16 crore in FY23, an increase of 13 percent year-on-year. Infosys CEO Salil Parekh's earnings fell 21 percent to Rs 56.44 crore, while Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte’s pay outstripped the others as he made Rs 82.4 crore — a fall of 5 percent in dollar terms.

Gurnani has been at Tech Mahindra’s helm since 2012 and will retire on December 19 as he turns 65. Mohit Joshi, who was a former president at Infosys and joined Tech Mahindra as an Additional Director on June 20, will take over as CEO and MD on December 20.

Mohit Joshi’s pay

Pending shareholder approval, Tech Mahindra’s annual report states that Joshi will receive annual fixed compensation of GBP 622,600 (Rs 6.5 crore), and annual variable compensation also of Rs 6.5 crore. His variable pay in the first year in the first year is guaranteed.

Additionally, he can get an annual overperformance bonus of up to 70 percent of his variable compensation. He is also entitled to a joining bonus of $848,951 (Rs 6.96 crore).

As part of his stock-based compensation, he gets a one-time stock option grant of $2.5 million, 60 percent of which will vest once he finishes a year with the company, and the remaining once he finishes two years. Additionally, he has an annual stock option grant equivalent to $3.5 million vesting in equal instalments over 3 consecutive years of employment, the first instalment vesting after the first year.

Joshi, an Infosys veteran, was the highest-paid employee at the company in FY23, where he earned Rs 57.32 crore. Of this, he earned Rs 38.95 crore from restricted stock units and ESOPs.",465,0.09074679017066956

Accenture Results

Accenture reported a revenue of $16.56 billion, up over 5 percent on-year in constant currency terms. Despite good growth in Q3, the IT major has lowered the upper end of its FY23 revenue growth guidance band to 8-9 percent YoY in constant currency terms from 8-10 percent earlier.

The company has guided for a 2-6 percent YoY growth for Q4 in constant currency terms, implying a sequential decline of 4.9 percent to 1.3 percent.

At the lower end of the guidance, the company expects further deterioration in small-sized deal sales, CMT as well as North America. This, according to analysts, is negative as there was an expectation that there would be some stabilisation in stressed verticals from June.

The management highlighted the impact on the demand environment from adverse macro fundamentals, delays in small and discretionary deals, and a dip in deal pricing in few segments, all of which hint at a drag on near-term growth for the sector.

Deal booking remained soft at $17.3 billion, up 4 percent YoY in constant currency terms and 1 percent YoY in US dollar terms.

What analysts are reading?

Analysts expect a negative near-term impact for the Indian IT players.

Nomura said guidance revision indicates a moderation in demand. It has retained its cautious stance on the sector. “We remain concerned on the demand outlook for the Indian IT services and expect approximately 480 basis points slower revenue growth (at 6.1 percent YoY) in FY24 vs FY23 for large-caps,” it said.

A soft first half is anticipated for the Indian IT players, said JM Financial Institutional Services. Given that Accenture’s outlook is only till August, it offers little incremental read-through for the Indian IT. However, a potential deterioration in smaller discretionary projects, CMT vertical and North America suggest that demand has not bottomed, the brokerage firm cautioned.

JM Financial Institutional Services highlighted that weakness in discretionary - CMT and North America - has a negative implication for players with higher exposure to these segments, especially LTIMindtree, Persistent Systems and Tech Mahindra. Plus, higher exposure to discretionary also puts Infosys at risk.

Morgan Stanley noted that Accenture's Q3 earnings showed lower order intake. The brokerage firm has maintained its cautious stance for the Indian technology players in the first half of FY24. It added that a commentary around dampening in small projects has brought to the fore concerns about slowdown in the sector.

Jefferies also noted that discretionary IT spends were still under pressure and that Q1 is softer than expected. It pointed out that the recent channel checks and interactions with companies point to a worsening demand outlook.

Rising risks to demand recovery in the second half of FY24 could lead to further de-rating, Jefferies said while cutting its growth estimates for FY24 by 50-150 basis points.

JPMorgan said Accenture cutting guidance for FY23 and Q4 hinted at a tough macro environment. The foreign brokerage firm added that the guidance implies no growth recovery by the year-end, leading to a weak Q2 for the Indian IT.

JPMorgan said weakness in the US is a negative for all Indian technology companies. While it has remained negative on the entire sector, a weakness in CMT is negative for Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree and Persistent Systems.

Bucking the larger view

Nuvama Institutional Equities said Accenture’s Q3FY23 results bode well for the Indian IT services companies, given strong growth and bookings in the outsourcing business.

The domestic brokerage firm has maintained its positive stance on the sector, and expects a sustainable strong demand environment to drive strong earnings growth over the next three years.

How ICICI Securities read the trimming of guidance was that since September 2022 when the IT major issued FY23 guidance, the mid-point of guidance has been lowered by only 50 basis points over the last 10 months, despite deteriorating macros such as persistent high inflation, banking crisis in March 2023 among others, which means technology demand remains resilient.

Large deal momentum continues to be strong with 26 large deal wins for the company in April 2023 quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Accenture has won 85 large deals, 11 more than last year, the brokerage firm pointed out.

Amid a slew of reports observing a muted quarter for IT stocks, Morgan Stanley on Thursday took a cautious stance on Tier-1 and Tier-2 Indian tech majors. The US-based broking firm has downgraded Cyient to equal-weight and also warned of Tech Mahindra, TCS and Mphasis being exposed to greater risks.

The share price of Cyient Ltd, which rallied over 80 percent on the NSE in the past six months, is capped at Rs 1,500 by the broking firm.

It is important to note that JP Morgan too in its recent report on the IT Services industry had placed TCS and Mphasis on the negative catalyst watchlist. However, while JP Morgan expects every IT firm to disappoint the Street in the 2HY24, Morgan Stanley has given mixed signals by stating that it continues to maintain preference for large-cap IT companies such as Infosys, HCLTech and LTIMindtree.

Read: Cyient DLM sets price band at Rs 250-265 for IPO lined up for June 27

The broking firm, in support of its selective stance, while assessing risk vulnerability of the large cap ITs, has cited ‘relative valuation support’ or a strong order book, which is supposed to make up for the moderated growth forecast.

For instance, according to SBI Securities, the numbers for HCL Tech in FY23 were ahead of the Street estimates as it reported a 9 percent on-year rise in its operational revenue. On the other hand, Tech Mahindra, which the broking firm sees exposed to greater risk, had reported a 7 percent decline in the operational revenue along with a reduced PAT of Rs 1,125 crore in FY23 against Rs 1,545 crore reported in FY22.

Morgan Stanley sees a potential for a cyclical pick-up in the IT sector only in the second half of either FY24 or FY25.

Joshi takes over the CEO’s position on December 20, after current CEO CP Gurnani retires on December 19.

It was announced that Infosys veteran Joshi would be Tech Mahindra’s next CEO on March 11, post which he was on garden leave. His last day at Infosys was on June 9, after spending 22 years at the company. In his final year at Infosys, Joshi was the highest-paid employee, drawing Rs 57.32 crore.

At the time of Joshi’s appointment, the company had said that he would be joining well before the date of his appointment to allow sufficient time for a transition.

At an investor presentation prior to the announcement of the new CEO, outgoing CEO Gurnani had said there would be a reasonable transition between him and the new leader, terming it to be a running train.

Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani is all for an AI push. He believes it is not artificial intelligence, but ""augmented intelligence"" that will help the company “push the frontiers of technology for nation building”.

Gurnani, on June 13, took to Twitter to reiterate that he is up for the challenge to build a ChatGPT-like AI tool. He wrote: “To all those who are asking, yes, the challenge is on. The purpose of this challenge is not one-upmanship or competition or headline hunting. It is a challenge to ourselves -- to push the frontiers of technology for nation building. I’ve always believed that AI is not “artificial” intelligence –- it is augmented intelligence.”

“Tech Mahindra’s AI think tank is in action already. We will work with academia and government to figure out how we can ‘apply’ human and machine intelligence to boost innovation and transform India, one industry at a time,” he added.

The tweet followed his response to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s comments indicating that India is not ready to try and build an AI tool like ChatGPT. During his recent visit to India, while undertaking a six-nation tour, Sam Altman said that it is “hopeless” for Indian firms to try competing with them. He made this statement in response to a question posed by former Google India boss Rajan Anandan, who wanted to understand how Indian startups could work towards creating models such as OpenAI.

The statement made headlines and shortly after, Gurnani accepted the “challenge” to build India’s own AI tool. The Tech Mahindra chief wrote on Twitter, “Dear Sam, from one CEO to another… CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.”

Earlier this year, he had said that the company’s investment into futuristic technology and timely upskilling of employees will make it “future ready” and added that he expects a resurgence of the IT services sector soon.",310,0.00973820686340332

The aggregate revenue per employee for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Wipro, and HCLTech, with the exception of Infosys and Tech Mahindra, experienced a decline of 3.8-11 percent on a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis in FY23. This decline was driven by the increase in hiring across these companies in response to the Covid pandemic-driven demand, surpassing net revenue growth, which remained relatively slow paced due to lower margins in digital deals.

Revenue per employee is a metric that is used to roughly calculate the revenue generated by each employee in a firm, in a given time frame. Aggregate revenue per employee is calculated based on the total headcount of a company, while billable revenue per employee only includes the people who are billable on a project. This means that billable revenue per employee does not consider adjacent function staff, such as HR, finance, or sales.

HCLTech experienced the biggest dip in CAGR, with a decline of 11 percent. However, its aggregate revenue per employee, at $55,704, is the highest among its top 5 peers (Infosys and Tech Mahindra are the other two in that list). The significant decline can be attributed to a mismatch between its headcount growth and revenue growth, as evident in data from market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, accessed by Moneycontrol.

Over the last five years, HCLTech's headcount grew at a CAGR of 63.8 percent, while its revenue grew at the rate of 45.8 percent. Similarly, Wipro saw 40.5 percent CAGR in headcount for a 35.2 percent CAGR in revenue for the same period.

An HCLTech spokesperson told Moneycontrol, ""Over the past several years, HCLTech has consistently delivered industry-leading organic revenue growth. In recent years, the proportion of work delivered by our India-based and nearshore employees has gone up, which yields lower revenue per employee compared to high-cost locations.""

""Further larger induction of freshers with longer training cycles has contributed to the change in revenue per employee,” the spokesperson added.

Infosys was the only company in the services segment with revenue exceeding $10 billion to achieve a positive 2.6 percent CAGR in aggregate revenue per employee over the past five years. On the other hand, Tech Mahindra experienced approximately 5.6 percent growth in aggregate revenue per employee during the same period, driven by improved billing (both Tech/BPM) and operational efficiency, including reductions in non-billable and support headcount.

The overall billable revenue per employee for the remaining IT/tech services industry combined was $48,195 in FY23, in contrast to $53,550 for the top five players.

Low margins, slower revenue growth

According to Gaurav Vasu, founder and CEO of UnearthInsight, this trend in the revenue per employee metric was due to technology billing rates becoming a lot more commoditised, coupled with a sudden increase in overall headcount.

However, he added, “Linearity between revenue growth and headcount addition still exists in the sub-services and BPO services segments. There are some pockets of services and offerings that have started seeing a non-linear trend.”

Unlike the popular belief that a significant uptick in larger digital deals along with talent hiring will lead to higher revenue per employee, the margins for such deals have been lower. Today, most of the deals bagged by IT companies are digital transformation deals.

“Over the last few years, IT companies have been under tremendous cost pressures from clients and competition alike — margins have come down significantly. As a result, the revenue for the same number of people is much lower. That’s a secular trend across companies,” Ashutosh Sharma, head of research, Forrester Research India, said.

Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at technology research firm ISG, concurred. “Digital deals may not always be high-value deals. Initially revenue grew across IT companies and then they started hiring a lot more than they needed. Now, they have started cutting down the workforce. FY19 and FY23 are very different stories,” he said.

Emailed queries sent to TCS, Infosys, Wipro and Tech Mahindra didn't elicit any response at the time of publishing.

Headcount addition trends

This slowdown in aggregate revenue per employee for some companies on a five-year CAGR basis is also because the IT companies weren’t hiring much for three years pre-pandemic, according to HDFC Securities’ deputy vice-president Amit Chandra.

“A lot of capacity building happened during the post-Covid demand surge. The hiring trend between FY16-19 was negligible. That was the era when it was thought that automation will reduce human effort and legacy hiring will fall very sharply. But it did not happen, there was a sudden IT talent scarcity with the post-covid demand surge. Especially last year, there was pyramid broadening,” he said.

While most IT companies thought that automation and the shift to getting more digital deals will decrease higher employee dependency, creating a non-linear relation between revenue growth and headcount increase unlike in earlier times, that wasn’t the case for all.

Sharma said that it also depends on the organisation’s ability to move away from headcount-based revenue models. Infosys, for instance, has done a marginally better job than its peers in bringing platform-based solutions and services into deals, which delinks revenue from the headcount.

“TCS, HCLTech and Wipro could do better in this area. TCS has a big success in BaNCS, but they struggle replicating that in other verticals. HCLTech and Wipro have some capabilities in DRYiCE and Holmes respectively but not much to show beyond these,” he added.

The IT sector reported record hiring numbers in FY22, both in lateral hiring and fresher additions. The top five firms collectively added around 273,377 employees by the end of the fiscal year. This increase in hiring was driven by the growing demand for digital transformation deals and the shortage of tech talent in the market.

However, this trend reversed in FY23 due to various macroeconomic challenges, including the Russia-Ukraine war, an impending recession in key markets like the US, inflation, interest rate hikes, and most recently, a global banking crisis.

As a result, there was a significant year-on-year drop of over 69 percent in hiring across the top five firms in FY23. Together, these firms only added 83,906 employees as the focus shifted towards improving utilisation rates.

How TCS and Infosys fared

TCS, the largest IT services company in the country, witnessed the second-lowest aggregate revenue per employee, with a decline of 7.8 percent in a five-year CAGR. According to Vasu, a part of the reason for this was TCS having a significant chunk of its revenue from the domestic market as compared to its peers, which means the billing rates will be lower.

“TCS’ revenue per employee growth is also low because a significant chunk of their revenue comes from the domestic India market. It gets almost $2 billion or more of its revenue from India, and has the highest presence among its peers,” Vasu said.

Rightly so, in FY23, TCS reported the highest revenue contribution from India, at 5 percent, while Infosys earned 3.2 percent, and Wipro reported 4 percent, respectively. The IT sector, overall, earns less than 5 percent of its total revenue from India, as the US and Europe remain the key markets.

Meanwhile, Infosys, the second-largest IT services company in India, witnessed 2.6 percent growth in aggregate revenue per employee due to its ability to sustain billing rates. Additionally, the company successfully managed to add a lower headcount for the revenue it generated, according to Vasu.

Furthermore, Infosys continues to maintain lean project management structures as well as leaner internal IT, HR, and sales teams, Vasu added. He expects the revenue per employee metric for these IT companies to start improving in the coming fiscal years.

“The revenue per employee will start improving in FY24 and FY25 because the biggest dip came in FY21 when the companies expected higher growth and they hired a lot. Right now hiring is seeing a downtrend, so we expect a lot more focus on improving productivity and a lot of caution-based hiring to happen,” Vasu said.

“Aggregate revenue per employee at an industry level will start going down by 2-5 percent over the next 12-18 months,” he added.",1343,0.059799847395523735
2023-05-24 13:26:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-waiting-game-it-freshers-suffer-agony-and-desperation-as-top-firms-delay-onboarding-for-a-year-10651721.html,"e facing financial strain, mental health issues and dashed career aspirations due to prolonged delays in onboarding.

Dhwani, a final-year engineering graduate, was euphoric when she got a selection mail from Infosys in March 2022. However, the joy of landing a dream job with a big IT firm soon turned into panic when she had to mail the company every day for updates about when she can start her job.

“Once I got a call from them stating that I will be onboarded within a month and they asked me to stop sending emails. I did. It's been over nine months since that call. I’ve got no response since,” she says.

The endless wait has taken a toll on Dhwani as not being able to help her family financially for reasons out of her control is bogging her down further.

She’s far from alone. Desperation, scrambling, feeling stuck in limbo, and even thoughts of suicide — these are some of the things that are on the minds of freshers who graduated a year ago but continue to wait for onboarding by IT companies. Their fears have only compounded as from the time they were made an offer to when they graduated, the industry took a turn for the worse.

Fresher onboarding has been delayed by several companies such as Wipro, LTIMindtree, Mphasis, and others, albeit the first may be the most well-documented. And despite the passage of a year, some freshers continue to hope that the onboarding call may come, even if it may be for lack of any other option.

A slim chance

Ritesh, another fresher awaiting the call from Tech Mahindra for a year-and-a-half, says more than anything, it's the radio silence that’s unacceptable. He was part of the batch whose graduation was delayed due to the pandemic, putting him at a further disadvantage. Technically from the batch of 2021 and not 2022 — it's a matter of getting closure for Ritesh now. “Being such a big MNC, such behaviour from Tech Mahindra is unacceptable. There should at least be an update that the drive has been cancelled. There should be an official update so we don’t cling to hope anymore,” he says.

With onboarding delayed across several companies, freshers had banded together and formed Telegram groups — to coordinate, ask the company for information, get updates from each other and in general, foster a sense of community. Conversations on these groups initially used to be passionate with anger directed at the companies— sometimes by commenting en masse on LinkedIn posts of executives of the companies in question. Updates would come thick and fast, with every news report and every bit of hearsay being shared. However, after a year, the conversation in these groups has muted, and now there are largely requests for help with technical questions, and sometimes, referrals for other jobs.

Ravi, another fresher waiting for Wipro’s onboarding, grows increasingly agitated during the conversation and doesn’t have much hope that the call from Wipro will come. He has been making ends meet by working as a daily-wage labourer. Ravi even went through Wipro’s ‘Velocity’ upskilling program but even that hasn’t bettered his chances. He is now moving back to his village to work on his family’s land.

Loans and expectations start bearing down

Even as they wait, there is pressure from family as well as looming loan repayments. “I am getting calls from my bank every other day for loan repayment,” says Ravi.

“I have paid Rs 85,000 per year, for my engineering course. I took a loan for it, now I am getting calls from the bank asking me to start repaying the loan. There are 4 members in my family, my father is the only earning member. It is difficult to make ends meet with just one person earning,” he says.

Kumar, another graduate awaiting Wipro’s call, had taken a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh, which he hoped to pre-close. Instead, his repayments start in September, and he says the job has to come through by then, in order to start making the payments. Apart from the loans, those waiting for the onboarding call also have to deal with taunts from family as well as pressure from them for not having started their job yet.

“My college touted these top 5 companies to be the best. Instead, people hired by mid-sized companies have jobs. My family sees them and thinks it's because I don't have skills,” he says.

Dhwani, on the other hand, is also under pressure because of a large education loan. “Of course, I’m under pressure. I'm from a middle-class family. My parents had huge expectations of me but I failed to meet them. I have an education loan of nearly Rs 8 lakh. My family needs my support in these tough conditions. Instead of helping them financially, I have become a burden on them,” she says.

Paras, a counselling psychologist and co-founder of The Alternative Story, says that graduating and getting your first job is one of the big milestones that people of this generation look to achieve. “Graduating and getting the first job are markers of having come of age, and there’s a lot of hope riding on somebody's first job, especially if they come from the lower strata of society,” he says.

He adds that youngsters put in work and get an offer but when things don’t work out, it’s not just their confidence that’s impacted but it also takes away a sense of control. “You grew up believing that if you put in the work and follow the process, there would be results. When the results don't come, you question why you did any of this in the first place. It’s a loss of identity, it’s a major setback,” he adds.

The dream of a technical job

Kumar, Ravi, Ritesh, and Dhwani all say the same thing — non-technical roles are available but technical roles are what they want.

Ravi rues that no one is hiring freshers, even when they look out — whether it be startups or established companies. “I am not interested in non-technical roles. In tech roles, I am ready to work for any company even if they give a small salary. But there is no hiring whatsoever,” says Ravi.

Ritesh, in fact, took up a job at a BPO to help pay the bills after he drained his savings. At this stage, the BPO job pays more than what Tech Mahindra offered but for him, it's a question of the big picture career prospects. “I’ve done graduation with a technical degree I should get a job for a technical degree. I joined this company because I can’t sit idle. I need money for my expenses alone if nothing else,” he says. He also rues that the four years he spent studying engineering would be a waste.

“My course cost Rs 12 lakh. We've invested this amount so we can have a better future. All savings are gone,” he says.

Kumar, too, says that non-technical roles are available, even if it's at slightly lesser pay but he’s not taking them up as he wants a technical role.

But what about using such jobs as a stop-gap? He says Wipro is supposed to give a two-month heads-up prior to onboarding, but they are only informed a week in advance. “If I join another company now, I have a one-month notice period. I can't even get out quickly. I cannot quit that quickly and join officially.”

“I’m a phase 1 hire in Wipro. If I do say something and leave that previous company, I can get rejected at the background verification stage. It'll be a waste to have waited for this year when I could have taken a non-technical job. I’m too afraid to pick up anything else as it may lead to some cancellation when Wipro eventually comes through. If they actually give us a two-month heads up, I'd take a non-technical job, make some money, resign properly, and come and join,” Kumar says.

Upskill scramble

All four of them have been doing courses online to upskill — free or otherwise. Kumar took a machine learning course from Coursera, and even wrote to them and availed financial aid to be able to afford it. But it’s not enough.

When freshers go to job fairs, they are asked tech stack-oriented questions. “If I sit for the interviews of 5 companies, one wants Java, another wants Python. When everyone is asking for different things it's very confusing to decide which one to study for. Every time there is an interview, I learn whatever I can for that interview because it'll take 2-2.5 months to learn it fully. It’s very shallow learning,” Kumar says.

“My career has had a break and I'm juggling substitute measures. I get asked why I have such a long break, so side-by-side I am doing some projects and I'm claiming that I was doing this instead to show that my time has been useful,” he adds.

Fear of being terminated

In most IT companies in question, freshers have to undergo training and assessment before they are deployed on billable projects. Given the gap between their graduation and the call for onboarding, any termination of employment for failing the assessment is a double blow in cases where candidates have remained unemployed for over 8 months. It’s a sword hanging over the heads of these graduates — especially as they see it happen to their peers and friends.

Wipro recently got flak for this practice, after it was revealed that the employment of 452 freshers had been terminated. In an interview with Moneycontrol last month, Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil said that assessments have been happening for years as people are away from actual work from the time they graduate till the time they are onboarded. “It is to help them get trained and again make an investment in them. I don't know why it's becoming an issue,” he said.

However, Kumar claims that these assessments have become harder, with fewer chances to clear them.

He’s now in a no-win situation — waiting for his chance to be onboarded and putting off other things but also terrified of losing the job even when he does get the opportunity.

This combination of unpredictable situations has a mental health impact that can’t be understated, says Paras, especially given there is no support system in this case where the onboarding is random.

“When a situation is both isolating as well as unpredictable, those are the kinds of situations that have the worst kind of mental health impacts. In times of uncertainty, when you don’t have even a modicum of control and the unpredictability is also there in full force, that is the worst kind of effect,” he says.

In some cases, it has led to depression and even thoughts of suicide. “I do have thoughts of attempting suicide at night when I go to sleep. Every night I wonder why I’m living this life if I’m even allowed to trouble my parents like this. What if I attempt suicide instead?” Dhwani says.

Queries sent to Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro were unanswered.

What should companies do?

The delay in onboarding, lack of clarity on when it may be, as well as the assessments have caused a lot of angst among fresh graduates — whether it be Wipro, LTIMindtree, or any other IT major. Companies across the board have maintained that all offers they have made will be honoured, but no timelines have been offered.

This isn’t the first time it’s happened— HR experts say this scenario played out in 2009 (due to the financial crisis) and around the time of the dotcom bust in 2001 as well. In the case of the former too, onboarding was delayed by nearly a year, and assessments were put in place. However, the delay tends to have a cascading effect, where the next batch is also affected as hiring is down.

It happened to foundit (formerly Monster) CEO Sekhar Garisa too. “I had to wait for nine months for my onboarding but looking back now, it really hasn't changed my career trajectory at all,"" he says. ""A small setback for a few months or a year won't change your career as long as you remain positive and focus on advancing your knowledge and skills. Use this time intentionally to develop your knowledge, skills, personality, and fitness. Once you're caught up in the career treadmill, you won't have this opportunity to upskill again,” he says.

Former Infosys HR head Nandita Gurjar says the impact on the individual remains the same, no matter how many are impacted.

She stresses that large IT companies must make a commitment, and can afford to do so.

“Large companies should really communicate when onboarding will happen. Large companies cannot say that I can't make a commitment, they can afford to have them unutilised on the bench. People's careers are on hold. The uncertainty of when it is going to happen is even more torturous than having the information that it will be delayed,” she says.

Talent solutions firm Diamondpick co-founder Sriram Rajagopal says the pressure is also more due to the placement schedule of colleges, which leads companies to hire a year in advance. The recruiting cycle must shift by six months, he adds.

The solution for this would potentially be to create a fungible entry-level common pool of talent at an industry level where companies can use them depending on the need, he says, rather than hiring and not being able to honour the commitments.

Advice for graduates

Gurjar and Rajagopal, as well as people in the education industry, stress only one thing: students need to upskill.

“Graduates of the 2022 batch can make good of the waiting period through upskilling certifications as entry-level job opportunities in emerging areas are still available. Recruiters who are delaying onboarding may also offer free certification programs to them and facilitate alternate job prospects. Students are advised to also be on the lookout for pooled recruitment drives and other direct recruitment happening on a real-time basis,” says S Vaidhyasubramaniam Vice-Chancellor, SASTRA University.

Gurjar also stresses that they should start reskilling, know at least two or three of the languages and learn newer skills.

“Spending time on learning, instead of believing that it's now the organisation's job to make sure that they give them work — I think is an attitude of the old. We have to start changing their attitude and saying that it’s my job to get myself utilised and not sit on the bench,” she says.

Rajagopal adds they have to work toward making their profile distinct and unique, so they can grab eyeballs.

“Upskill in relevant skills, make your profile unique and be competitive. Especially in the world of generative AI, the need for thousands of programmers is going to go away very soon. You’re going to have generative AI as an assistant to your programmer. IT services are going through a change. People have to be aware, pick up skills that are relevant, and be current,” he advises.",2521,-0.7454445958137512
2023-05-02 16:15:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/after-a-dismal-q4-amid-macro-challenges-what-is-in-store-for-it-firms-in-fy24-10513291.html,"The year is set to be a challenging one for IT companies as pressure piles up on margins and clients demand pre-inflationary pricing.

Indian Information Technology (IT) companies experienced a dismal last quarter in the financial year ended March 2023 as they coped with challenges ranging from recession fears and high inflation to ripples from a banking crisis in the West.

The top five IT companies did report double-digit revenue growth in constant currency terms for the full fiscal year 2023.

Even so, it’s anyone’s guess how long the impact of a recession in the US and Europe and the banking crisis that has laid low Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse will continue to take its toll on an IT services industry that depends on banking and financial services for a major chunk of sales.

If we were to look at hiring as an indicator of demand, it doesn’t look too promising. After the pandemic-fuelled demand of the previous year, India’s top five companies reported a 65 percent slump in net additions to their workforce in FY23.

According to HFS Research Chief Executive Officer Phil Fersht, 2023, too, will be challenging although the industry is holding up well. Times will get tougher, he says, because of pressure on margins and clients demanding pre-inflationary pricing.

“The winners will be those that can win deals with performance pricing baked in and less focus on people costs,” he says.

How they fared in FY23

FY23 had started on a positive note and everyone in the IT industry was preparing for high growth and digital deals. At the time, the only concerns were the supply-side challenges and the Russia-Ukraine war, according to Pareekh Jain, founder and CEO of EIIRTrend. These supply-side challenges too eased.

“But in H2FY23 the challenges started coming in, first with tech company layoffs and then in the latest quarter, tech and BFSI sectors got hit,” Jain said. BFSI stands for Banking, Financial Services and Insurance.

“Suddenly, there was oversupply in the market. All plans of hiring had to be stalled as more people were on the bench. And demand too started to subdue because of these banking and tech crises,” Jain said.

The fond hope had been that the fourth quarter of FY23 would be spared and the effects of the negatives would be visible only in FY24, but that wasn’t the case. At a time most segments of IT business were impacted, pockets such as engineering services did see growth, Jain said.

Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research, told Moneycontrol that despite the slowdown, IT services firms that can move the quickest will do the best.

Highlighting company-specific concerns, Wang said Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported its slowest revenue growth in 11 quarters, with a number of projects deferred to the new quarter.

Infosys reported weaker-than-expected Q4 numbers that missed analyst estimates and HCL Technologies, Wang said, showed “some sales finesse in winning 13 large deals.”

Wipro, Wang said, was “doing better with large deals and the horizontal realignment strategy to service cloud, data and analytics, bio, product engineering, infrastructure services and consulting.”

Tech Mahindra, which reported a drop from 12 percent in Q3 to 9.6 percent in Q4 margins, is in the midst of a crisis, Wang said.

“They have had a tough time retaining talent and keeping clients. The company really needs the big deal expertise of [CEO designate] Mohit [Joshi] as well as his diplomatic skill in working with clients and inspiring the staff,” he said.

In a tough spot

Leadership teams at all IT companies have sounded a note of caution, some more than others, as the stress becomes evident. Deal ramp downs have been seen across the board as well as delays in decision-making by clients.

Fersht told Moneycontrol: “We’re seeing customers aiming to slim down their providers massively. Some of these large deals (on vendor consolidation) are very resource-demanding, especially in the first couple of years. They can be very complex, and it’s hard to envisage exactly what’s needed during the RFP [request for proposal] process,” he said

.

Wang said that the macro conditions were part of a temporary three-to-six-month slowdown to pause general IT spending.

“However, projects that are related to optimisation, regulatory compliance and modernisation are still being prioritized. Pressure on Europe and APAC (Asia-Pacific) continues to hamper growth. Middle East remains a highlight along with the ANZA (Australia and New Zealand) and the Indian market. North America is slowing down, but continues to be a growth market,” Wang said.

Guidance for year ahead

Guidance by companies such as Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech hasn’t been promising. For FY24, Infosys has guided for revenue growth of 4-7 percent in constant currency. And HCLTech has guided for revenue growth of 6-8 percent in constant currency terms, down from 12-14 percent in FY23.

Wipro, on the other hand, which guides for the following quarter, has guided for a -3 to -1 percent decline in revenue in constant currency terms.

CEO Thierry Delaporte told the press that the macro environment remains challenging looking ahead. “Our clients, our industry, and many sectors are impacted by the prolonged uncertainty in the economic environment. These headwinds are impacting our business and projections as well,” he said.

CFO Jatin Dalal, on the other hand, had told analysts hopes are that growth picks up in the second half, but the environment is still uncertain.

Experts have differed on a likely pick-up in demand in the second half of the year.

Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said its view is that “the worst on the macro front is ahead of us and not behind us, and hence we think a 2HFY24 recovery in growth seems quite unlikely.”

Digital journey

Kotak Institutional Equities took a different approach. While macro uncertainties and the banking crisis in the US have impacted client sentiment on tech spending, leading to limited visibility on near-term demand, digital transformation is an ongoing journey “with most enterprises still in early stages,” it said.

According to Kotak, depending on the client-specific situation and the outlook of the industry segment they operate in, client priorities on spending would differ.

“Clients in the impacted verticals and those focusing on survival would prioritize lowering their cost base. On the other hand, the set of clients focused on strengthening their competitive positioning vis-à-vis peers would look to continue spending on transformation programs,” it said.

“In addition, given the current uncertain macro scenario, enterprises might also favour to bundle upfront cost-takeout mandates, followed by transformation into larger engagement while also consolidating the set of vendors they work with,” Kotak added in a note.

According to HFS’ Fersht, increased focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation will take centre stage in FY24 and believes some ambitious mid-sized providers can fare well because they can be nimble.

“The Tier 1s have to be wary of large vendor consolidation deals that could prove unprofitable and resource-draining,” he said. According to him, these mega deals created “huge resource headaches for service providers in many ways.”

Wang concurs on the AI front and says automation and AI were working hand-in-hand.

Reducing human interaction

“Every customer is finding ways to automate and reduce human interaction and also find exponential opportunities with AI,” he said. The focus is on contract negotiations, cloud optimization, code refactoring, and in some cases a move back to on-premises workloads.

“Customers are asking vendors to renegotiate deals with software vendors and services firms. A focus is on consolidating software vendors and optimizing overall IT service spend,” he said.

On the way forward, Wang says we can expect the slowdown to continue for the first two quarters, before picking up in late Q3. “Companies have many projects in cloud, analytics, automation, AI, and cybersecurity that must be completed in order to achieve operational efficiency and exponential growth,” he said.

UnearthInsight founder Gaurav Vasu says that in FY24, deal wins in areas such as cloud transformation, digital transformation and AI and verticals such as pharma, healthcare and life sciences will continue.

“We will still continue to see a few large deals. In FY24, a lot of deal renewals are coming up. These renewals will be a big push for the industry. You will see selective large companies offering end-to-end solutions will continue to win large deals. But overall, in FY24 and Q1FY25, deals will mostly be small. Weakness in BFSI will continue for some time. Growth overall in FY24 will be slower,” Vasu said.

Supply-side

The dwindling net headcount addition numbers have already given an indication of the times to come. Analysts expect hiring to be under pressure.

Vasu says that both gross hiring and net headcount additions are expected to return to their pre-pandemic levels.

He anticipates that companies will go back to pre-pandemic behaviour of internally rotating and fulfilling roles.

“New tech-skills-based roles will require backfilling and new hiring. For some of the companies, given the huge hikes being paid out to new employees and large scale hiring, employee cost was about 65-70 percent of the wage bills of some of the IT companies; that’s getting normalised,” he said.

In FY24, he added, IT services companies will look to normalise the big cost element and look to quality hiring.

“We estimate the IT services industry will hire close to 8,00,000-9,00,000 on a gross basis and the entire industry will hire between 2,00,000-2,12,000 people in FY24,” he said.

According to Unearthinsight, in FY23, the gross hiring that also included people jumping from one company to another was around 7,50,000 to 9,00,000.",1584,-0.4682135664754444

KR Choksey's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra Ltd (TECHM) has received a net new deal win of USD 592 million and has a free cash flow for the quarter of USD 142 million. The revenue from operations has increased to INR 1,37,182 million in Q4FY23 from INR 1,21,163 million in Q4FY22, an increase of 13.22% YoY basis, and on QoQ basis it remained flat. The EBIT came at INR 13,178 million in Q4FY23 from INR 16,459 million in Q3FY23 showing a decline of 19.94% QoQ and a 13.42% decline on a YoY basis which was effected by higher SG&A expense. EBIT margins stood at 9.60%, declined by 238 bps QoQ/364 YoY. EPS for Q4FY23 stood at INR 12.62 versus INR 14.64 and INR 16.94 in Q3FY23 and Q4FY22 respectively. The concentration from the top 5 clients has declined to 17% in Q4FY23 from 22% in Q4FY22. The employee Attrition rate has significantly declined to 15% in Q4FY23 from 24% in Q4FY22 and 17% in Q3FY23. Utilization rate excluding trainees stood at 86% in Q4FY23 a marginal improvement from 84% in Q4FY22.

Outlook

Tech Mahindra is currently trading at a valuation with a P/E multiple of 15.8x/11.9x on FY24E/FY25E earnings. The story is premised on pipeline commentary, improved services portfolio (design, engineering and consulting) & acquisition synergies, and 5G-related spending and reduction in the attrition rate and hence we are assigning a P/E multiple of 14.0x to the FY25E estimated EPS of INR 86.2 to arrive at a target price of INR 1,207 (earlier the target price was INR 1189), with an upside of around 17.9%. Accordingly, we kept our rating to a “BUY” for the stock.

2023-05-02 13:35:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/it-and-chatgpt-generative-ai-gains-ground-among-indias-top-it-firms-10505091.html,"According to Xpheno, there are over 2,000 active job openings across different functions in this sector globally

While the IT industry disappointed with its weak earnings and an uncertain outlook, there is one sunny patch in the sector. All IT firms are betting big on generative artificial intelligence (AI). Top companies, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, and Tech Mahindra have been actively sharing their plans and outlook on the big AI opportunity.

In simple terms, AI is the ability of machines to perform certain tasks like translating languages, analysing data (text, audio, video, code, etc), etc., somewhat like human beings but at a larger scale. Generative AI, specifically, refers to producing new content, code, synthetic data, etc., either automatically (based on a programme, e.g.) or based on a prompt (text or image, e.g.) given by the user.

Unlike the unrealised potential of the metaverse, senior industry executives told Moneycontrol that AI has gone beyond the exploratory stages . In fact, in a challenging macro-environment where the focus is shifting to cost efficiency, companies like Tech Mahindra are helping clients save millions by integrating existing AI tools in their operations, as well as building new solutions.

NG Subramaniam, Chief Operating Officer, TCS, mentioned during the company’s earnings call that generative AI was already a revenue-generating vertical. He said, ""In my interactions with clients over the last quarter, the conversation starts and stops with ChatGPT and what it's going to do.”

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said that his company has active projects that use generative AI platforms to address specific areas of the client’s business.

“We have trained open-source generative AI platforms on our internal software development libraries. We expect generative AI to provide more opportunities to work with our clients, and also to help us improve our own productivity,” he said.

As for Accenture, its plan to expand AI and data capabilities included acquiring Bengaluru-based industrial AI company Flutura in March.

“We are acquiring Flutura to strengthen our industrial AI services, and to improve the performance of plants, refineries, and supply chains of our clients in the energy, chemicals, metals, mining, and pharmaceutical industries. It will also enable our clients to achieve their net zero goals faster,” Pranav Arora, MD and Lead – Applied Intelligence, Accenture India, told Moneycontrol.

“By ushering in a new era of enterprise intelligence, generative AI has the potential to transform business tasks and functions, from customer service and knowledge management, to creative production and scientific research, across virtually every industry,” Arora added.

These IT companies are already partnering with Google, Microsoft, and Microsoft-backed OpenAI (which developed ChatGPT), as the battle to gain market share for deploying generative AI solutions globally intensifies.

Many of the abovementioned IT firms are engaged in building and customising enterprise level solutions using the tools offered by these tech giants.

What’s in the offing?

TCS is currently working on both the solutions and the consulting front. The solutions include AI-powered financial advisory and wealth management solutions for the BFSI sector, a virtual fashion designer for the retail industry, computer vision for heavy industries, and AI-driven streaming data analytics for anomaly detection, among others.

Nidhi Srivastava, Vice President and Global Head of Google Business Unit, TCS, which is working on developing AI solutions on top of Google’s tools, said, “We are also exploring cross-industry solutions to enhance productivity through automated code generation, content creation, copywriting, and marketing.”

On the services side, TCS is building service offerings and delivery capabilities that can accelerate the implementation of AI-based solutions for clients. “We have also created an `AI Factory‘ to expand AI adoption in enterprises,” Srivastava said.

For Wipro, it’s been over two years since it established the Generative AI Centre of Excellence (CoE) to work with technology partners and academic institutions driving research in advanced areas of AI.

Mukund Kalmanker, VP & Global Head, AI Solutions, Wipro, told Moneycontrol, “Wipro is engaged in many client conversations ranging from AI-assisted decision making to designing new-age digital experiences, to transforming processes across business functions and modernising IT systems and infrastructure.”

He added that customers from sectors like banking, insurance, energy, retail, consumer goods, life sciences, healthcare, telecom, etc., are interested in leveraging AI.

Tech Mahindra too is working on many projects and developing solutions in the AI and Intelligent Automation (IA) space. It is assisting enterprises in meeting demand and improving efficiency.

Kunal Purohit, Chief Digital Services Officer, Tech Mahindra, said, “We help enterprises save millions with computer vision-based asset inspection solutions, crowdsourcing (data, etc.), conversational AI, anomaly detection, Document AI or low-code/no-code solutions like Vision AI Workbench, Forecasting Workbench, etc.”

For instance, using their Smart Assistant solution that classifies all incoming email, Tech Mahindra improved data accuracy by 90 percent and reduced human effort by 60 percent for an insurance claims company, delivering a 6X increase in the ROI on support cost, Purohit said.

How top IT firms are leveraging generative AI

Need for AI talent

AI is becoming an essential part of digital transformation strategies for businesses across industries, and it will continue to evolve and become more accessible, according to Purohit. To capture this opportunity, IT companies will need reliable and skilled talent to develop solutions.

Wipro’s Kalmanker said the company has a robust enterprise-wide AI talent management plan in place, which includes both hiring talent as well as a well-developed AI curriculum to train employees at the Wipro AI Academy.

“Our approach also includes scholarships for Ph. Ds at globally renowned academic institutions. These are for research programmes that attempt to solve complex business problems through innovations in generative AI,” he added.

According to Srivastava, there will be a big demand for AI talent across levels including strategists, solution architects, implementation specialists, model developers, model trainers, training data preparers, and end-to-end ML (machine learning) lifecycle specialists, to name a few.

“While hiring will be a channel for talent acquisition, there will be equal, if not more focus on talent up-skilling and cross-skilling. This will help retain contextual organisational knowledge while ensuring viable labour economics,” Srivastava said, speaking of TCS’ plans.

Concerns on privacy and cyber security

Companies like TCS are also exploring the use of generative AI to assist their own employees, though cyber security risks remain a concern.

In an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol, TCS CHRO Milind Lakkad had said, “We are looking into what generative AI means in the context of an enterprise, not just from the standpoint of what the operating model will be, but also what will be the role of an employee versus the role of an AI co-worker.”

He had added that with generative AI being used, there are also discussions underway about safeguarding intellectual property (IP), security, etc. With AI bots like ChatGPT, there are concerns about the code (the IP) getting leaked when auto-generating code, or malicious code getting created.

“With new tools come new concerns and security risks. High on the list of concerns for cybersecurity practitioners is the possibility that ChatGPT could be used to generate malicious code. This means many more people could create malware, potentially leading to many more attacks and breaches,” Infosys said in a blog post.

While there is demand for generative AI-based solutions, companies are also worried about its implications. This has already led some firms to regulate its use, or ban the technology entirely.

Firms like Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo have banned ChatGPT across their offices globally.",1243,0.20020100673039753

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TECHM)’s 4QFY23 revenue of USD1.67b rose 0.3% QoQ in CC, a tad ahead of our estimates of 0.7% decline. Retail (-10% QoQ) dragged 4QFY23 growth. EBIT margin was down 80bp QoQ to 11.2% (v/s estimate of 11.9%). The company delivered weak TCV of USD593m, down 25% QoQ. Weak macro environment, delayed decision making and cuts in discretionary spends hit 4QFY23 growth. Management indicated that the situation is likely to remain so in 1HFY24 before picking up in 2HFY24E. We see muted growth (4.7% CC) for FY24E given the low deal wins, poor exit to FY23 and likely weakness in 1HFY24. With macro stabilizing over 2HFY24E and pick up in 5G spends, we are factoring in FY25E USD CC growth of 10.1%. Overall, we expect TECHM to deliver 7.8% USD CAGR over FY23-25.

Outlook

We remain on the sidelines as we feel the current valuation fairly factors in the uncertainties around growth and margin. We cut our FY24/FY25 EPS estimates on weaker margin and muted outlook. We remain Neutral on the stock with a TP of INR1,080. Our TP implies 15x FY25E EPS.

2023-04-28 15:17:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/net-addition-by-indias-top-5-it-companies-falls-69-in-fy23-10495081.html,"Net additions and hiring are indicators of demand

India's top five IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra — added 83,906 employees in FY23, a 69 percent decline from the previous year's addition of 2,73,377 employees. Among the five companies, only HCLTech added new employees in each quarter of the fiscal year. The earnings season was lackluster, with mixed or muted results and cautious outlooks for the next quarter, given the prevailing macroeconomic conditions.

Net additions and hiring are indicators of demand. However, companies say that their utilisation is low and attrition is falling, which suggests that they have room to grow and do not need to hire as aggressively.

TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra have all experienced net headcount reductions during one of the quarters. Wipro and Tech Mahindra have both seen a reduction in headcount for two consecutive quarters – in Q3 and Q4.

According to company executives, the talent market is cooling down and returning to where they were prior to the pandemic years. FY22, in particular, has been termed as an aberration when it comes to net addition, and experts say companies will move closer to their net addition levels pre-pandemic. This is already starting to show up, as FY23's net addition figure is closer to that of FY21's net addition of 86,685 employees.

Hiring was on a tear as a result of pandemic-induced demand, with a large number of freshers hired as well. Now, those numbers are being staggered for onboarding, but due to declining utilisation, some companies haven't committed to hiring numbers for Q4.

Tech Mahindra saw the steepest drop in headcount addition for the year, adding only 1,227 employees on a net basis, compared to 30,119 net additions last year. The company added 6,862 employees in Q1, 5,877 in Q2, went into the red by 6,844 employees in Q3, and saw another consecutive decline of 4,688 employees in Q4.

At the same time, the company has the lowest attrition rate among its peers, at 15 percent.

Harshvendra Soin, the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer, told analysts after the results on April 27 that the company’s internal fulfillment rates have increased substantially.

“Our focus is on upskilling, giving opportunities from within, and it has really worked out. Add to this the fact that our attrition is also the lowest among our peer set gives us a lot of confidence tha the strategy is working and folks are getting more opportunities internally so we don’t have to go out every single time,” he said.

Wipro is the other company that has seen a negative headcount reduction for two consecutive quarters. Speaking to the press on April 27, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Delaporte attributed the headcount decline in Q3 and Q4 to the large addition the company made in the first quarter of the fiscal — 15,446 employees on a net basis. (This fell to 605 in Q2, saw a decline of 435 in Q3 and another decline of 1,832 employees in Q4).

Delaporte said that high addition in Q1, lowering utilisation and impacting margins, was done knowing that the company would need them in later quarters. These people, he said, are being trained, onboarded and deployed.

“If you look at the evolution of the headcount, in a given quarter, you might not necessarily see this impact. The reality is that we will continue to hire, there is demand, we are growing in some areas, on some specific skills, where there's very high demand, and we need to continue to hire. At the same time, attrition is going down, so we need to take into that account. Finally, the fact that with our level of utilisation — which has improved over last few quarter — we see also that there's some room for improvement,” he said.

Wipro added 22,000 freshers during the year, which it said was the highest it has done so far.

Infosys, Wipro’s cross-town rival, saw a headcount decline of 3,611 during the last quarter of FY23. Its headcount addition for the year also fell along with attrition. It added 29,219 employees on a net basis in FY23, down from FY22’s 54,396. The company hired 51,000 freshers during the year. While it usually gives a target number for hiring for the year ahead, it did not do so this time.

During the company’s earnings press conference, Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy said that the softness in demand is what led to utilisation falling to 80 percent, and it expects this to increase gradually in coming quarters.

“We will calibrate the hiring for FY24 based on the available pool of employees, growth expectations and attrition trends.” He added that they have a lot of people on the bench as well. “I think our model in terms of hiring has got enough flexibility to take care of new volumes. In any case, we have a rich bench, 80 percent utilisation is what we have, and usually, we have operated well above that,” he said.

Kotak Institutional Equities had said in its note that the headcount addition for FY24 could be tepid due to “limited demand visibility, significant headroom on utilisation, moderating lateral attrition and trainees becoming billable”.

HCLTech's net headcount dropped from 39,900 to 17,067 over the year, but it did manage to add employees each quarter, including over 25,000 freshers. “While we are scaling fresher intake, we still have an opportunity here. We will have sustained focus on this over the next two to three years to improve this further,” Chief Executive Officer C Vijayakumar said.

In FY24, the company targets to add 15,000 freshers which will be higher than the gross addition.

Lastly, TCS, which kicked off the earnings season, saw a marginal increase of 821 employees in Q4, following a reduction in headcount in Q3. Attrition has moderated to 20.1 percent as of Q4FY23, and it has been declining from peak levels. During FY23, the company added 44,000 freshers as well as their “highest ever number of experienced professionals during the year,” according to CHRO Milind Lakkad.

Apart from HCLTech, TCS is the only company that has stated how many freshers it plans to hire in FY24, having rolled out 46,000 offers.",1037,0.07620202553899665

Tech Mahindra chief executive and MD CP Gurnani said the company’s investment into futuristic technology and timely upskilling of employees will make it “future ready” as he expects a resurgence of the IT services sector soon, after the company reported a disappointing set of numbers for Q4FY23 on April 27.

This comes at a time when almost all the top five IT services firms including its peers Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, and Wipro reported moderate to negative QoQ revenue growth in constant currency terms.

Gurnani highlighted that the IT services’ firm’s key vertical Communications, Media and Entertainment (CME), which accounts for over 40 percent of its revenue, continued to grow over the past 12 quarters.

“We saw 12 quarters of QoQ growth in CME. Network services standalone as a horizontal is now about a billion dollar business per year. If I had to talk of only 5G for enterprise and telcos, even that has become a billion dollar business,” he said while addressing the media.

He added that the company would continue to focus on customers, employees and newer technology bets including metaverse, blockchain, web 3.0 and customer experience management --- where he said Tech Mahindra had invested much earlier than the market.

“We have successfully delivered a great quarter. By that, I don’t mean the results are anything spectacular, but I call it a great quarter because we continue to invest on the development of new skills, upskilling and being ready for the market,” he said.

According to Gurnani, despite the slowdown the IT services sector is currently facing, there will be a resurgence soon, though it may happen earlier or be two quarters away.

“That resurgence of IT services means that we as a company, our investments will be ready when it happens,” he said.

He is also bullish on the opportunity of artificial intelligence, and said that it has already partnered with OpenAI and Google, among other players.

Gurnani said the outlook for large deals remains positive for FY24. Though the delay in decision making given the macro economic challenges continue, another senior company executive said.

Slowdown in deal wins

Tech Mahindra reported an order book for $592 million for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of 25.5 percent QoQ from $795 million; and 41.44 percent drop on a YoY basis. In Q4FY22, the company had reported $1 billion in deal wins.

Overall deal wins for full year FY23 stood at $2.9 billion, a decrease from $3.28 billion in FY22.

Sector-wise, growth was largely driven by manufacturing which grew at 1.5 percent QoQ, followed by Communications Media & Entertainment (CME) with 0.7 percent QoQ growth, and BFSI which grew 0.3 percent QoQ. Retail, transport and logistics segments together were down by 10.4 percent QoQ while growth in technology remained flat.

Europe showed 3.5 percent growth QoQ, meanwhile in Americas and Rest of the world growth declined 0.3 percent and 2.9 percent QoQ, respectively.

Gurnani said that healthcare took a bit of a dip and so did the Europe market.

Macroeconomic challenge

During its Investor Day in March this year, Gurnani had said that the company’s clients have not refused a price increase for their projects despite facing macroeconomic challenges. He added that by working as 'partners' the company has been able to come up with strategies to overcome financial constraints their clients may have.

“Nobody has denied price increase to us on the account of inflation; because it’s a partnership. We may close down on a few projects due to budgetary targets but those are different clients,” he had said.

The company had also unveiled its new focus areas to diversify and grow in terms of business. Gurnani had emphasised the company's next big bets for driving revenue will be focused on product and platform (P&P) and co-creation with customers. He expects the P&P business will reach a revenue of $1 billion within three years.

He had added that the company’s new strategy will remain unchanged with new CEO coming in as the plan is customer-focused. Gurnani is set to retire on December 19, 2023, post which Mohit Joshi, former Infosys president, will take over as the new CEO and MD.

Last week, JP Morgan downgraded Tech Mahindra citing high exposure to troubled sectors such as hitech, Telecom, manufacturing etc. The brokerage firm has reduced the IT services firm’s revenue estimates for FY24 and FY25 by 3-5 percent.

At present, about 41 percent of Tech Mahindra’s business is from telecom and balance 60 percent from enterprise business.

In January this year, speaking with Moneycontrol at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gurnani had said that based on his client conversations and 50-odd meetings that he attended, he didn’t particularly expect the way forward to be negative though he’ll remain cautious.

“In terms of how positive it would be, a lot depends on the way US Fed would react. There is always more than one layer that you need to unpeel because ultimately corporates do depend on some indications from the US. Otherwise, the mood looks moderately positive,” he said.

Gurnani had then also added that the company expects double-digit growth to continue even as brokerage firms like JP Morgan had estimated a slower 8-10 percent industry-wide growth.

IT services firm Tech Mahindra's net employee addition for the full fiscal year of FY23 was significantly down by 95.93 percent with an addition of 1,227 employees, as compared to 30,119 in FY22. This was in line with the industry-wide trend of slowdown in hiring after a year-long rally of record employee addition in the previous fiscal.

Total headcount for FY23 stood at 152,400. Overall headcount after fourth quarter ended March 31, 2023 declined by 4,688 QoQ.

In Q3FY23 too, the net new employee addition had declined by 6,844. In Q4 last year, Tech Mahindra had added 6,106.

Attrition rate dropped to 15 percent from 17 percent in Q3. The firm has been seeing a drop in attrition rate since the first quarter of FY23 after a steady increase in the five quarters before that.

Harshvendra Soin, Global Chief People Officer and Head of Marketing at Tech Mahindra said, ""Our attrition continues to drop and remain the lowest in the industry.""

Commenting on the slowdown in hiring, Soin added, ""In FY23, our main focus was on upskilling. While our focus continues on upskilling and providing opportunities to our internal folks, we will increase our fresher hiring significantly this year and put them through our upskilling engine.""

Though Soin declined to share fresher hiring target for FY24, he said that the company evaluates the same on a quarterly basis. He expects to increase fresher hiring by about 2-3X in the current fiscal year, without disclosing the full-year fresher addition of FY23.

In January this, speaking with Moneycontrol at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Chief Executive Officer and MD, C P Gurnani, had said that hiring will be higher when attrition is higher, and net hiring will be low when attrition starts declining.

“Hiring cannot always be linear. The reality is that AI, data, and automation are part of our lives. If it is not linear, revenue goes up. If you don't hire, please do take into account that we are becoming more efficient with automation,” he said.

IT services major Tech Mahindra is likely to post an 11 percent on-year decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,336 crore, a 3 percent on-quarter rise, when it reports the fourth-quarter earnings on April 27, according to a poll of brokerages.

Consolidated revenue may increase 14 percent YoY to Rs 13,809 crore while remaining flat on a quarterly basis. On a constant-currency (CC) basis, analysts largely expect revenue to decline.

“Extended furloughs, broad-based softness and persistent headwinds in the telecom client will result in a 0.7% CC revenue decline in 4QFY23,” says brokerage firm Motilal Oswal, which expects deal wins for the quarter to be in the range of $500-700 million and believes hiring will remain muted.

“Due to deal closures slowing, we expect its order book to be in the range of $500 million-700 million versus the $795 million reported in Q3FY23. On account of weak digital capability, loss of wallet share among its top clients and generally weak execution, we expect TechM to report one of the weakest growth (within our coverage) at 3.4 percent in CC terms in FY24E,” according to ICICI Securities. The brokerage pegs QoQ CC revenue growth at negative 0.5 percent.

EBIT growth

Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) may see a 4 percent rise YoY to Rs 1,670 crore, increasing 1.4 percent quarterly. Margins are projected to see a slight decline YoY while remaining flat sequentially.

Despite having the margin levers such as low attrition, lower sub-con costs and currency tailwinds, the company expects the margins to remain flat in Q4FY23 (majorly owing to low revenue growth), says B&K Securities.

Management change hopes

Last month, the company appointed Mohit Joshi as MD & CEO with effect from December 20, 2023 to December 18, 2028.

“The Street has high expectations from the top management changes at TechM but we believe it would be difficult to change the DNA of an organisation by just the top management change. Having said that, we would be closely observing the new strategy to be rolled out by the new CEO in the coming quarters. If we see a perceptible change in the company’s digital capability and execution, we may take a re-look at our rating and target price,” said ICICI Securities, which has a ‘Reduce’ rating on the company.

Other things to watch out for include large deal wins, commentary on demand across all verticals especially on enterprise business, 5G trends and outlook on communication and margins, macro conditions in Europe, M&A, capital allocation and an update on future growth objectives.

The International Chess Federation (FIDE) and Tech Mahindra on April 26 announced the launch dates and format of the Global Chess League (GCL).

The 12-day league will begin on June 21 and end on July 2, the organisations announced through a regulatory filing. GCL will be played in 10 round-robin matches, with six teams competing (six players in each team), followed by a final match between the top two teams.

During the course of the league, a variety of events such as chess tournaments and logo announcement would be hosted globally.

""GCL is a unique opportunity to promote this remarkable game of strategy, intellect, and rigor which we feel is strongly intertwined with business. GCL, fuelled by technology and opportunities, will bring together the best players from around the world in order to popularise the game and provide players with a formidable platform to hone their skills,"" said Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy officer and head for growth at Tech Mahindra.

The GCL has chess players participating in a unique joint team format, making it the first and biggest official franchise league of its sort in the world. GCL will have both male and female chess champions competing on the same team. Having the rare distinction of being the only co-ed squad in a professional sports league, the league's male-female teams will compete together, according to the press filing.

By utilising cutting-edge technologies like 5G, artificial intelligence and virtual reality, FIDE and Tech Mahindra will explore creative methods to promote the game through interactive technology-enabled platforms.

""The league will help increase chess's popularity while expanding commercial opportunities. As a part of FIDE’s commitment to growing women’s chess, this league will also witness the joint male and female team format, a first-of-its-kind in a professional sport. We invite team owners and sponsors to join in the effort to bring chess closer to its fans around the world. We are looking forward to meeting the teams and new talent in June 2023,"" FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich said.

GCL will aim to bring sports fans together to witness chess in a never-seen-before image. The winning team will get crowned with the title of World Champion Franchise Team.",365,0.8320143222808838

“A vast majority of employees and their family members across India have been vaccinated and only vaccinated staff are allowed entry to our offices,” said an IBM spokesperson responding to Moneycontrol’s queries.

IBM isn’t alone. From mandating vaccinations, sponsoring booster shots, arranging for oxygen cylinders, and deploying emergency response teams, companies are gearing up for any potential escalation of the situation.

India has 62,293 active cases as of April 25, based on data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Maharashtra has 5,549 active cases, Karnataka has 1,895, and Delhi has 4,995.

Daily new cases over the last week

Companies move fast

According to Harshvendra Soin, global chief people officer and head of marketing at Tech Mahindra, the company has emergency backup plans in place.

“We are ensuring that all our employees are safe across locations. We have strict Covid-19 protocols and guidelines for checking air quality, water quality, and regular sanitisation at offices. We are fully geared up with emergency backup plans,” he said.

Soin added that the company has arranged for oxygen cylinders and concentrators for emergencies and partnered with hospitals. The company has also deployed emergency response teams at office sites, he said.

“Nearly 90 percent of our associates have gone through booster doses as well,” Soin told Moneycontrol.

Some employers are taking measures to encourage their staff to get their booster shots if they haven’t yet.

For instance, the Sequoia Capital-backed Growth School is sponsoring the same for all employees who are willing to get the booster shot.

“We do not force anyone, the facility is available for anyone who is open for it,” said Vaibhav Sisinty, founder of the edtech startup which is based out of Bengaluru.

The rise in cases became prominent towards the end of March when daily new infections crossed 1,000. On April 13, the number of new cases in 24 hours crossed the 10,000 mark and has since been hovering around it. This recent spike has been attributed to the Omicron XBB.1.16 variant, a highly infectious version of the coronavirus.

Holding off on mandates

Currently, the edtech firm is focusing on taking measures like deep sanitisation efforts every week and when an employee falls sick. “We are taking care of the basics; encouraging use of masks if unwell, leaves if you notice symptoms,” he said.

The startup has also not mandated vaccinations.

Companies believe employees can only be advised on matters like wearing masks, vaccination, and booster doses as these are matters of ‘personal choice’.

“To be honest, wearing a mask is now passé and since our employees are vaccinated, it may not be wise to force them into something which is a personal choice in the new normal ever since the pandemic,” Saurabh Deep Singla, chief human resource officer of upGrad, told Moneycontrol.

Human resource experts said most companies are exercising caution and dealing with the situation in an individual capacity than issuing company-wide mandates.

“Managers, suo moto, have been advising employees that if you're not feeling well don't come to the office or work from home, or you use a mask, things like that. It is more in an individual capacity that managers have been advising than HRs coming forward and issuing a circular,” said Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO, CIEL.

Chandra Sekhar Garisa, CEO of Monster India, a staffing and employment website that recently rebranded itself into Foundit, agrees. “Companies have started asking employees to stay at home at the slightest symptom but it's only been managed at a very localised, employee level.”

Garisa added that while companies in the Delhi NCR region seem to exercise a bit more caution, most big and small firms across the country are taking a “wait-and-watch” approach as the situation is currently manageable and under control.

However, it must be noted that people also do take rapid tests at home and isolate, and do not necessarily take RT-PCR tests, leading to the possibility that the numbers are higher than what is reported.

Measures by companies to control spread of covid

Remote work still on the table?

According to experts, the measures mentioned above represent the limit of what companies are taking, and they do not appear to be making any changes to their work arrangements at this time.

“Everybody's been discussing but I don't think anyone's taken any concrete measures in terms of altering the working arrangement,” added Garissa.

upGrad’s Singla said, “We haven't seen a significant rise in cases at work and as a practice, we have always encouraged our colleagues to take time off or work from home as needed, with the slightest of discomfort on health or if there are any symptoms of cold or fever.”

He said the company is taking measures to ensure sanitisation in over 25 of its locations, which gives them the confidence to operate smoothly in an offline mode.

Sisinty concurred. “We continue to work completely from the office. We have to start living with it now,” he said.

However, in the event that the situation worsens, companies appear to be open to reconsidering remote work.

“This may mean reverting to ‘work from home’ if government guidance changes or if local clinical and population health data indicate community cases are accelerating significantly again,” IBM added in its statement. The technology firm had started calling its employees back to the office gradually in April last year and its staff currently continues to work on-site.

Growth School’s Sisinty also added that the company plans to reassess its stance on remote work if the situation worsens. “We have done that before too,” he said.

Emergency response startup Red Health (formerly StanPlus), told Moneycontrol that with the rising cases, it has launched preventive measures like Covid testing and quarantine programs, and also enhanced its hospital network.

It partners with companies such as Amazon, Flipkart, Microsoft, and Capgemini, among others.

“Red.Health is taking note of the increasing Covid cases and pulmo-cardiac issues in top metro cities, particularly Delhi-NCR. As emergency medical care experts, we have deployed a network of trained paramedics and experts to combat these issues and reduce casualties,” Prabhdeep Singh, the CEO, said.",1055,-0.08755603006907872

Representative Image

The March quarter earnings season has been a mixed bag for the information technology sector. Industry leaders Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys reported weaker-than-expected numbers but smaller rivals HCL Technologies, Mastek and Cyient surprised the Street positively.

After TCS and Infosys missed the Street's estimates on all fronts and faced the brunt of a sharp sell-off, HCL Tech topped expectations on the profit front.

Nonetheless, the weakness in the IT space amid concerns over a global slowdown and in the aftermath of the collapse of some banks in US, has begun to tell on the entire sector.

Taking note of the trend, global research and broking firm JP Morgan said in a report that the FY23 fourth quarter results of TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech highlight the weakness in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and telecom verticals.

These troubled verticals, which form a sizable chunk of the business, put Q4 as well as FY24 earnings for IT majors at a risk. ""We see Tech Mahindra and Mphasis get impacted, given their high exposure to both of these verticals,"" the broking firm wrote in its research note.

Also read: What makes the Q4 flop show a bigger pain for Infosys than for TCS?

It has reduced Tech Mahindra's revenue estimates for FY24/25 by 3 percent/5 percent and margin estimates by 40/60 basis points (bps), driving a reduction of 7 percent/8 percent in earnings-per-stock estimates.

Similarly, Mphasis’ revenue estimates for FY24/25 have been cut by 6 percent/8 percent and the margin by 40/30 bps, resulting in an 8 percent/9 percent reduction in earnings-per-stock estimates for the same period.

Tech Mahindra Ltd was more than 7 percent down in the morning trade on April 17 as global brokerage firm Citi downgraded the stock to “sell” from “neutral” and reduced the target price to Rs 955 from Rs 1,100.

The brokerage said Tech Mahindra was downgraded for the following reasons: increased risks to growth in the communications vertical, which accounts for approximately 40 percent of the company’s revenue. Recent data points and commentary have raised concerns, prompting caution from Citi.

There are near-term challenges and a negative catalyst watch is already in place, which may be exacerbated by macroeconomic factors, the brokerage said in its latest report. Operating deleverage may lead to lower margins than what consensus expectations are. Lastly, while there are positives associated with leadership change, they may take some time to materialise.

""In that context, valuations are at 16x 1-yr forward cons EPS – risk-reward looks unfavorable, in our view. We lowered our target multiple to 15x (17x earlier) to factor these risks – new TP of Rs955 (Rs1100 earlier). Our FY24E/FY25E EPS are 7-14 percent below consensus,” Citi said.

It has been a disappointing March quarter for IT firms, so far.

Both Infosys and TCS reported a decline in revenues in the telecom vertical in 4Q, with -8 percent constant currency (CC) quarter on quarter (QoQ) and -2 percent cc QoQ, respectively. Management comments across companies have reflected caution with regard to the telecom sector but the headwinds seem to be stronger than expected.

In its third quarter call, Tech Mahindra had said revenues from top 5 clients had declined due to restructuring in some clients. Though management expected it to stabilise by 4Q, the challenges could persist given macroeconomic uncertainty.

Tech Mahindra is expected to report its March quarter earnings on April 27.

Challenges across multiple verticals such as discretionary cuts and deferrals, vendor consolidation, and pricing pressure could further negatively impact growth, Citi said.

Tech Mahindra has outlined several margin levers, including reducing sub-contracting costs, adjusting the offshoring mix, spinning off or shutting down non-strategic businesses, implementing automation and delivery excellence measures, and leveraging synergies with portfolio companies. The pace of margin improvement in the near term could be slower than expected due to growth challenges and the likelihood of discretionary costs returning, Citi said.

LTIMindtree sent a clarification on April 10 to Training and Placement Officers (TPOs) at various colleges regarding their latest training initiative called IGNITE.

The move was in response to criticism faced by the company from freshers who have experienced significant delays of over 14 months in their onboarding process. The letter aimed to provide more context and clarity on the purpose of the training program.

A copy of this email was accessed and seen by Moneycontrol.

In an attempt to clear the air with colleges, LTIMindtree referring to the offers rolled out by erstwhile Mindtree, said, “With the purpose of better utilizing the waiting time for onboarding, we are pleased to bring LTIMindtree's Learning and Training Program - ""IGNITE"" to left-shift the overall training curriculum.”

“The IGNITE program facilitates a unique opportunity to sharpen and acquire the skills required for transitioning into the corporate world of technology solutions. Attached is the list of candidates, who expressed their interest to join LTIMindtree,” the company said in the email, adding that a detailed email with the required guidelines and enrolment procedure has been sent to the said students.

Around 600-700 campus hires who had received offer letters in January 2022 and await on boarding are expected to join this programme, multiple sources told Moneycontrol.

On April 9, these freshers through IT-employee union Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), called out the training and assessment programme. They alleged that the new training is a pretext to get rid of them as their offer letters automatically stand cancelled if they don’t participate in the programme.

Moreover, even if they qualify in this programme, it won’t guarantee them immediate joining dates. They will only be ""considered for onboarding in batches based on business demand,"" a previous email sent to the campus hires by LTIMindtree said.

LTIMindtree declined to comment on Moneycontrol's queries, citing their ""Silent Period"" ahead of their earnings announcement.

Harpreet Singh Saluja, president, NITES said in a statement, ""We strongly condemn the latest justification provided by LTIMindtree company regarding their new training program IGNITE. We believe that the company's attempt to cover up their unethical practices is unacceptable, and we stand in solidarity with the freshers in their criticism of the program.""

What is IGNITE?

The IGNITE programme will grade these freshers after completing a training programme involving 80 percent self-paced learning and 20 percent instructor-led training. In the assignments, about 40 percent weightage will be given to multiple choice questions (MCQ) and 60 percent to coding assignments. Freshers will get two attempts at each assignment and will be deemed eligible only if they score 60 percent or more.

LTIMindtree is not the first IT services company to take such measures. Peers including Wipro and Tech Mahindra too reported having delayed on-boarding of campus hires in 2022, amidst a challenging business environment and global headwinds.

Wipro, recently, asked candidates to whom it had offered Rs 6.5 lakh per annum (LPA), if they would join at Rs 3.5 LPA.

Campus hires of LTIMindtree who received offer letters in January 2022 are still waiting to be on-boarded, and the IT services firm has asked them to go through a new training programme to prove their eligibility, said the IT-employee union Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES).

Freshers called the training progamme a pretext to get rid of them as their offer letters automatically stand cancelled if they don’t participate in the programme. This is coming at a time when the IT services sector is facing a challenging business environment due to global macro headwinds leading to industry-wide layoffs, hiring slowdowns, and on-boarding delays.

Details regarding the training programme, called IGNITE, were emailed to freshers two days ago. Moneycontrol has seen a copy of this. Freshers have been asked to confirm their participation in the training programme by 6 pm on April 12.

According to multiple sources, about 600-700 freshers awaiting their joining dates will have to go through this new training and screening programme.

“Instead of providing them with an onboarding date, the company has introduced a 6-7 week long learning and training programme. The freshers have been given two options: to undergo this assessment-based training or have their earlier offer automatically cancelled,” Harpreet Singh Saluja, President, NITES, said in a statement.

Saluja told Moneycontrol that these freshers were selected in November 2021 from their campus and received offer letters in January 2022.

The IGNITE programme will grade these freshers following a training programme with 80 percent self-paced learning and 20 percent instructor-led training. In the assignments, about 40 percent weightage will be given to multiple choice questions (MCQ) and 60 percent to coding assignments. Freshers will get two attempts at each assignment and will be deemed eligible only if they score 60 percent or more.

But being eligible alone won't confirm these freshers an immediate joining date. They will be ""considered for onboarding in batches based on business demand,"" the email said.

“I was hired by Mindtree as a software engineer in January 2022. They said they would absorb us once the merger with LTI was completed. Now they are saying we have to go through another assessment programme. This is unfair. I had rejected offers from other companies to join Mindtree knowing their good training and work culture,” one of the freshers told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.

The fresher added that the campus hires were offered a 9-11 week internship which was “said to be not mandatory’’ in the middle of their final semester last year. A few of those who took up the internship were absorbed.

The person also said that the freshers who are facing this delay were mainly those who were hired by Mindtree, while those who were hired by LTI have already been absorbed. LTI and Mindtree started operating as a merged entity in November 2022.

Moneycontrol is awaiting a response to detailed queries sent to LTIMindtree. This article will be updated with the company’s response, if any.

Saluja said, “This behaviour is completely unacceptable and goes against ethical business practices. It may also set a dangerous precedent for future recruitment practices. It is clear that the company is putting these freshers in a state of uncertainty and using this new program as a way to delay their onboarding.

“We urge LTIMindtree to reconsider their decision… We call upon LTI Mindtree to immediately halt this programme and provide these freshers with a clear onboarding date,” he added.

The January-March quarter was a period of intense action in India’s IT companies — several top-level exits and appointments, the banking crisis in the US and Europe, a worsening macroeconomic climate and uncertainty about budgets for the new fiscal — all plagued companies. Now, as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) kicks off the earnings season next week, here’s a primer on what will be watched for in the IT sector.

The Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sector will be a key talking point this quarter following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank of the US, followed by Switzerland’s Credit Suisse. Though the Indian IT sector has limited exposure to these banks, the overall global sentiments and pressures on the sector will have an impact on the demand outlook.

Here are a few key factors to watch out for during the upcoming Q4 earning season:

Leadership changes

TCS, Infosys, HCLTech, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, all reported top-level appointments and exits this quarter. The biggest shocker was the sudden resignation of TCS CEO and MD Rajesh Gopinathan. K Krithivasan, who was the global head for BFSI, contributing around 38 percent of TCS revenue, was appointed the new CEO.

Amidst the banking crisis, Infosys lost former president Mohit Joshi to Tech Mahindra, where he will be joining as the CEO and MD from December. Joshi was responsible for financial services and insurance segments, among other areas, and led many large deals for the company. This was the second major exit for Infosys in H2FY23, following the exit of president Ravi Kumar S who became the CEO of Cognizant.

“We await to see what happens to the positions vacated by Ravi Kumar (who has become Cognizant CEO) and Mohit Joshi (CEO designate of Tech Mahindra). Would wait to see if the responsibilities are filled internally,” Girish Pai, Head of Research, Nirmal Bang, said in his note.

Similarly, HCL Tech’s Corporate Vice President Sukamal Banerjee who led the $1-billion revenue vertical Engineering and R&D Services (ERS), besides global strategy and investments around emerging technology transformations, too resigned. Rajan Kohli, President of Wipro's Integrated Digital, Engineering and Applications Services Business lines quit as well.

How the commentary around these exits and appointments would shape up and any changes in the business strategies related to these appointments would be important to note.

Impact of banking crisis

“IT companies have mentioned increased cautiousness among clients around decision-making due to heightened uncertainty arising from the recent banking crisis. Deal pipelines have not shrunk, but conversion to new deal wins is taking longer time,” analysts at ICICI Securities said in a note.

Analysts expect near-term demand visibility to be weak, given the macro uncertainties and banking crisis. Among Tier-I IT companies, TCS has the highest exposure to the sector and will be closely watched for its commentary.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said, “The banking crisis in US regional banks and European banks can induce greater caution and impact overall tech spends by banking clients.”

The collateral damages to the economies due to the banking crisis and the impact on customer health are yet to be seen, Nirmal Bang said in a note.

Hiring trends

Hiring across companies is expected to be muted, as all of the top five companies have continued to slow down on hiring significantly in each quarter of the year. While Q4 hiring is usually in anticipation of the demand in the new financial year, there were no green shoots this quarter.

In fact, pressure on an already subdued quarter was only exacerbated by the banking crisis, with experts now stating that companies will focus on increasing their utilisation and only backfilling attrition in critical roles.

Companies have maintained that the slowdown in hiring is not a factor of demand, but the increased hiring they did in the preceding year. However, another metric to watch out for will be the number of freshers that companies aim to hire in FY24.

Analysts at Emkay Global expect moderation in hiring, with a focus on improving utilisation, deploying freshers post-training and demand moderation. “Better talent availability with significant fresher intake over the past few quarters and lower backfilling costs with reduced churn rate should aid in margin recovery,” the note read.

Onboarding of freshers hired in the previous year has still not been completed in some companies, and companies did go to top colleges they recruit from in the first round of placements. However, the second rung of colleges saw subdued demand from IT companies, which are some of the largest hirers of fresh talent.

“The full impact of the extraordinary hiring of fiscal 2022 was felt in fiscal 2023, because of which employee cost is estimated to rise by over 20 percent. Companies are now focussing on utilisation than advance hiring, supported by lower attrition. This should lead to marginal improvement in operating profitability in fiscal 2024,” said Aditya Jhaver, Director at CRISIL Ratings.

Revenue and PAT estimates

According to Crisil Ratings’ Anuj Sethi, headwinds in the BFSI segment of key markets, such as the US and Europe, will affect revenue growth this quarter.

“While BFSI segment revenue growth is expected to halve to mid-single digit, it would be marginally offset by 12-14 percent growth in the manufacturing segment and 9-11 percent growth in other segments. Net-net, there would be moderation in overall revenue growth,” he said.

Nirmal Bang too, expects revenue growth to be modest, attributing it to decent Total Contract Value (TCV) that companies clocked in the previous quarters.

Motilal Oswal expects most tier-1 companies’ revenues to grow, barring Tech Mahindra at negative 0.7 percent. It expects LTIMindtree to clock revenue growth of 1.6 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in constant currency terms, followed by TCS at 0.9 percent, Infosys and HCLTech at 0.6 percent, and Wipro at 0.5 percent.

Kotak has forecast a modest revenue growth guidance for FY24, which it says “may not be considered conservative due to elevated risks to growth and likely back-ended growth trajectory”.

On profitability for the quarter, Motilal Oswal expects profit after tax (PAT) to grow at 2.9 percent sequentially and 11.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) for tier-1 players. For tier-2, the note estimates a sequential PAT growth of 5.3 percent and 13 percent from the same period last year.

For fiscal 2023, Crisil expects operating profitability to moderate 150-175 basis points (bps) to a decadal low of 22-22.5 percent, due to higher employee costs. “Crisil Ratings expects these costs to moderate next fiscal, with companies taking a cautious approach to fresh hiring as they attempt to normalise headcount after the hiring peaks of fiscal 2022, which saw the employee count for Tier-I firms surge 22 percent,” it said.

For FY24, Crisil expects the sector to see a decline of 700-900 bps in revenue growth.

Demand outlook and tech trends

Impacted customer sectors will look to optimise existing cloud consumption spends. Vendor consolidation deals will also continue to increase.

Apart from the BFSI sector, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said, “the demand outlook of segments such as mortgages, hi-tech, and certain segments of retail and telecom is weak,” as enterprises in impacted segments will prioritise cost efficiencies.

Nirmal Bang’s Pai expects delays in decision-making, focus on cost optmisation and vendor consolidation to be the common themes across company commentaries for 4QFY23. “Seasonally, we think the October-March timeframe tends to be the peak in terms of order inflow for most companies and we expect that to repeat,” he said.

“The management (of IT firms) indicated that the secular demand is still intact in certain verticals and service lines, but suggested near-term caution among clients and some delays in decision-making, which might lead to project deferrals and pause in execution,” said a note from Motilal Oswal.

Moreover, for the customer sectors still open to discretionary tech spending, finding use cases around new technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and 5G, will take centre-stage.

After a subdued performance in February, the domestic equity market went into standstill mode in March. The sudden collapse of three US banks along with the crisis at the storied Credit Suisse triggered alarm among investors over the health of the global banking system, pushing them away from risky asset classes like equities.

On top of that, relentless selling by foreign institutional investors kept the market in a narrow range through the month. Lack of positive domestic cues only added to the negative sentiment. The quantum of contrarian calls also remained muted for March due to an absence of stock-specific cues. A contrarian call is when an analyst recommends buying a stock although its price is falling, or the other way round.

Tech Mahindra, Asian Paints and Tata Steel were among the few stocks that saw some divergence between price action and analyst action through March even amid high volatility.

Shares of Tech Mahindra slipped 2.39 percent over the month as investors chose to book profits in a period of high uncertainty. However, a rejig of the company's management garnered favour from analysts. As per Moneycontrol's Analysts' Call Tracker, ""buy"" calls for the information technology company rose to 25 from the earlier 21 as one ""hold"" and three ""sell"" calls were reduced.

Tech Mahindra recently declared that Mohit Joshi will take over as managing director and chief executive officer-designate, succeeding CP Gurnani, who is scheduled to retire in December 2023. Joshi comes with a strong pedigree as he previously served as president for BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) and healthcare at Infosys.

""Mohit Joshi, the incoming CEO-designate at Tech Mahindra, ticks most of the boxes to lead another turnaround, in our view. His deep client relationships in the BFSI space will help shore up Tech Mahindra's relatively sub-scale BFSI practice, especially in the developed markets. His large deal credentials could help improve the IT company's large deal win-rates,"" analysts at JM Financial Services wrote in a note. The broking firm also upgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""sell"" on that account, along with an increase of 21.8 percent in its target price to Rs 1,170.

Emkay Global Financial Services also backed the view and feels Joshi's selection gives more credence to the company's overall turnaround efforts and the stock may potentially see a rerating. The brokerage firm has a ""buy"" recommendation for Tech Mahindra, with a target price of Rs 1,270.

Yet, even with the optimism seen for the stock over March, it is also important to note that Tech Mahindra is among the few names that saw contrarian downgrades over the quarter. During that period, ""buy"" calls for the company went down to 25 from the earlier 26 while ""hold"" ratings rose to 14 from 12.

Such a divergence between monthly and quarterly contrarian calls is on two accounts. The stock has risen around 8 percent over the quarter, but fell 2.39 percent in March. In addition to that, some analysts are yet to gain confidence that the management will actually turn things around for the IT giant.

""Tech Mahindra has underperformed its peers over the last 6-12 months both in terms of topline as well as earnings growth and stock performance. While its performance has been sub-par over this period, the matter of most speculation has been the appointment of the succeeding CEO—which has now been put to rest. Hereafter, the stock price movement would be determined by earnings growth trajectory, which would take time to resurrect, in our view, given structural changes the business requires to be able to compete with peers,"" Nuvama Institutional Equities wrote in its note.

However, the broking firm does not anticipate a steep downside for Tech Mahindra either as it believes its inexpensive valuation and high dividend yield limit its downside potential.

Among contrarian downgrades over the past month, no significant divergence in price and analyst action was seen in the past month. Even though two banking bellwethers, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, saw ""buy"" recommendations reduce by one and two, respectively, it was because the number brokerages covering the stocks had reduced. Fundamentally, no major developments were announced by the banks and their growth stories remain intact. A total of 50 brokerages out of the 52 covering ICICI Bank have a ""buy"" call for the lender. As for HDFC Bank, 40 of the total 43 maintain a ""buy"" rating.

Quarter-on-quarter changes

On a quarterly basis, HCL Technologies and Dr Reddy's Laboratories were two major players that witnessed contrasting price and analyst action. HCL Technologies saw its ""buy"" calls reduce to 26 from 30, while the stock gained 4.69 percent.

JPMorgan has cited high near-term risks for HCL Technologies and anticipates its earnings for the fourth quarter to disappoint analyst expectations. The global research and broking firm also has a cautious stance on the overall IT sector and foresees potential downside risks to earnings and multiples due to weak fourth-quarter prints and FY24 guidance.

ICICI Securities, which has a ""hold"" rating for HCL Tech, predicts that the company's results will be the weakest in their coverage universe in terms of constant currency sequential growth, at a decline of 1.9 percent, due to weak seasonality in the product and platform business.

As for Dr Reddy's Laboratories, pessimism for the stock stems from concerns of price trends in the US market. Global research and broking firm Jefferies also sees lower-than-expected growth in the US market and lower sales of the generic version of multiple myeloma drug Revlimid as the major downside risks for the stock.

According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, which has given the stock a ""hold"" rating, the acquisition of Mayne Pharma's US retail generics portfolio by the drugmaker for $90 million is a low-risk move, but it will not significantly benefit the company.

Nuvama also pointed out that Dr Reddy's growth in the US, excluding generic-Revlimid, will face challenges in terms of implementation due to price erosion and competition in the market for existing molecules.

Dr Reddy's Laboratories witnessed a similar trend in the yearly period as well, with downgrades for the stock rising along with positive price action.

In terms of contrarian upgrades over the quarter, Bajaj Finserv emerged as the clear winner as ""buy"" ratings rose to six from five and ""sell"" calls reduced by one alongside an 18.5 percent correction in stock price. It is the non-banking financial company's strong growth outlook that is driving analysts' optimism for the stock.

ShareKhan by BNP Paribas is of the view that the company's digital initiatives will help Bajaj Finserv achieve the next growth stage, emphasising continuous innovation. ""We believe strong growth in the lending business and an improving outlook for both the insurance businesses will likely act as a positive trigger for strong consolidated earnings going forward,"" the broking firm highlighted in its note.

Year-on-year changes

Apart from Dr Reddy's, another stock that saw its ""buy"" calls reduce over the year despite positive price action was Coal India. Investors poured money into the stock on the back of its robust earnings, which reaped the benefits of increased e-auction premiums.

Emkay Global Financial Services sees Coal India as a value trap. ""Coal India utilizes a large part of its operating cash flows as capex, yet both volume and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) growths are low. Just for maintaining production at current level, Coal India needs to make continual heavy investments for land acquisition, rehabilitation, equipment and machinery,"" the firm said in its note.

Analysts at Emkay Global also believe that even though Coal India appears to be a value-pick based on traditional valuation metrics, its 'cheap' valuation is an illusion in their view as these conventional valuation metrics are not applicable to a company that needs to invest sizeable amounts of operating cash flow every year just for maintaining its level of production. ""We, thus, believe that Coal India is a value trap,"" the firm noted. Emkay Global makes up one of the total five ""sell"" calls for the scrip.

As far as contrarian upgrades over the year are concerned, index heavyweight Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) showed a remarkable contrast in price and analyst action. ""Buy"" recommendations jumped to 32 from the earlier 23 while both ""sell"" and ""hold"" calls reduced by two and eight, respectively.

Brokerages see a favourable risk-reward emerging out of RIL, especially on the back of its 11.34 percent slide over the past year on the back of concerns over high capital expenditure and, consequently, rising debt.

""Though high capex is a near-term worry, we reiterate our high-conviction ‘Buy’ rating on RIL with a target price of Rs 2,000 per share, given its industry leading capabilities across businesses, which is likely to drive robust 13-15 percent EPS CAGR (Compounded annual growth rate) over the next three-five years,"" wrote analysts at broking firm JM Financial Services.

Jefferies also took note of the favourable risk reward and raised its target price for RIL to Rs 2,872, in order to reflect an upside potential of over 23 percent from Monday's closing price.",1535,0.03352980039737843

Information Technology (IT) services firm Accenture, which follows a September-August financial year, on Thursday reported that revenue grew 9 percent in local or Constant Currency terms to $15.8 billion in the second quarter of FY 23.

Accenture’s revenue was better than the $15.2-15.75 billion it had guided for.

Industry-wise, the highest growth was posted by the resources segment, which grew 16 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to $2.2 billion followed by health and public services which expanded 15 percent to $3.0 billion.

Financial services and products segments increased by 10 and 9 percent on a yearly basis to $3.0 billion and $4.7 billion respectively. Communications, Media and Tech segments remained flat at $2.9 billion.

Geographically, North America grew 5 percent YoY to $7.4 billion, Europe 12 percent YoY to $5.3 billion, and growth markets the highest at 13 percent YoY to $3.1 billion.

Positives outnumber negatives

The slowdown in North America, and the hi-tech and communications verticals were a negative, but the results had more positives than negatives for Indian IT vendors, said investment manager Morgan Stanley.

Morgan Stanley says the company’s results could generate positive sentiment. Any weakness around its Q4 results and FY 24 guidance should be used as a buying opportunity, it added. The firm prefers LTIMindtree, Infosys and HCL Technologies among large-cap IT firms.

Accenture also reported record new bookings at $22.1 billion, a rise of 17 percent YoY, driven by managed services, which stood at $11.4 billion, while consulting bookings stood at $10.7 billion for the quarter.

“Managed Services bookings held up well and grew by 37% YoY cc (constant currency), while consulting bookings were up 2% YoY cc, reflecting continued emphasis on cost optimization projects vs. growth projects. Management remained positive around technology spends and indicated a strong deal pipeline for 3QFY23, especially in managed services,” financial services firm Jefferies said.

Caution among clients

Management has highlighted caution among clients with delays in decision-making, particularly on consulting, and a slowdown in smaller deals, it added.

CLSA believes strength in the company’s order bookings should give comfort to investors and healthy managed services revenues/bookings was a positive read-through. Comfort should come, given supportive valuations after the recent correction, it added. It remains cautious on the IT sector and only rates Infosys a ‘buy.’

Given the worsening global macroeconomic outlook, Accenture has lowered its annual revenue and profit projections and now expects annual revenue growth to be around 8-10 percent (with -4.5 percent forex impact) YoY in local currency or constant currency, compared with 8-11 percent (with -5.0 percent forex impact) expected previously.

“The guidance implies a belief in the soft landing narrative with pain largely behind us while we believe that pain from the rapid rate tightening that has happened in the Developed Markets (DM) as well as the recent banking turmoil in US/Europe is only ahead of us,” according to Nirmal Bang Securities.

Nirmal Bang is not sure whether the new guidance is pointing to a sustained recovery beyond FY 23 and whether that would be smooth. The firm has an ‘underweight’ stance on the IT Sector and believes consensus is underestimating growth and margin risks in FY 24/FY 25.

Key takeaways

The company also announced 19,000 layoffs globally, of which 7,000 employees are based in India.

“We have three key takeaways for Indian IT firms from Accenture's 2Q results: 1) Rising caution among clients with focus on cost optimization suggests a moderation in growth in FY 24. This is evident from Accenture's implied 2HFY23 revenue growth guidance of 4-8% YoY cc. 2) Increasing client focus on larger deals and slowdown in smaller deals position larger IT firms more favorably than mid/small sized firms; 3) A cooling off of the job market, lower attrition and more prudent hiring are likely to support margins,” Jefferies commented.

Demand continues to shift towards cost optimisation, says Nomura, retaining its cautious stance on the sector and cutting the top end of its FY 23 revenue estimates and Constant Currency growth guidance. It expects operating performance to vary significantly across companies in FY 24. It prefers large-cap over mid-cap IT companies, with its top Picks being Infosys and Tech Mahindra in the former and Coforge and Persistent in the latter.

At 10.31 a.m., the Nifty IT index was up 0.8 percent at 28,224.25 points with LTIM and TCS trading the highest, up 1.7 percent and 1.2 percent, at Rs 4,680.00 and Rs 3,163.50 respectively.

Joshi resigned a little over four months after Ravi Kumar S, the company's former President, left the company. Kumar took over as the CEO of Cognizant in January. Both Joshi and Kumar were potential candidates for the position of Infosys' CEO in the future, but Salil Parekh, the current CEO, had his contract renewed for five more years in July 2022.

A note by Kotak Institutional Equities said that the roles handled by both were wide-ranging, but Infosys has a strong leadership bench to compensate for it. The portfolios of leaders who left Infosys to join competitors in the past have largely been handled well by their successors, it said.

“The opportunities [for Joshi and Kumar] granted larger roles in well-reputed organizations with good CEO compensation policies. Leadership talent at Infosys is well-recognized by the industry and has contributed to many CEOs for the IT services industry,” the note added.

Cognizant was also known as a CEO factory, having produced several executives who now lead other companies such as LTI Mindtree CEO Debashis Chatterjee, Firstsource's Vipul Khanna, among others.

Kumar and Joshi are the latest in a line of former Infosys talent who have gone on to head companies.

Anshuman Das, the CEO of executive search and talent advisory firm Longhouse Consulting, told Moneycontrol that Infosys has been one of the progressive companies in this regard.

""They have produced a good number of CEOs because they're a reasonably well-managed, well-governed company. That kind of system always produces good leaders, which can provide governance and scale,” he said.

However, he added that it doesn’t provide for a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities in such companies, which he said is the trait of more chaotic environments.

“Any great institution like Infosys is always a great factory for CEOs essentially, and Infosys definitely leads as far as IT success is concerned. Between Infosys and Cognizant most of the CEOs have come out. Wipro has been very good as far as the entrepreneurial-talent-producing capability is concerned,” he said.

He added every one of the five big IT services companies is unique in its own sense.

“We as a country are blessed to have a combination of these companies, which are entrepreneurial, producing great CEOs, and taking the whole industry to the next level. That's how I see the ecosystem — that everyone has its own great utility,” he said.",461,0.9985237022240957

The series of events in the banking sector in the US and Europe in the last few days can impact the Indian IT services companies as clients are spooked currently, experts said. At roughly 40 percent, the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) vertical makes up a significant portion of the revenue of Indian IT companies, according to NASSCOM’s 2023 Strategic Review report. The current crisis is an additional cause for concern for companies, which are already under stress in a harsh demand environment and macroeconomic climate.

There will be a slowdown in deals and decision-making delays in the near term, at least for the next six months, experts said. But they remain cautious as the situation continues to develop.

According to Phil Fersht, CEO and founder of HFS Research, there is a situation of panic among many clients. “The volatility and uncertainty are going to slow down decisions on deals as banks observe how the current crisis period shapes out. This may lead to short-term engagements in critical areas that cannot be put away, such as cybersecurity compliance and finalising app modernisation projects,” he told Moneycontrol.

Banks in the news recently such as Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate, Credit Suisse, and UBS are all clients of various IT companies.

Fersht said that he expects spending to stay relatively strong with the large banks, particularly in the present situation as HSBC takes over SVB UK and UBS takes over Credit Suisse. “There will be a lot more consolidation which will lead to a lot of IT services needs. The mid-tier will be soft as many banks struggle with high interest rates and trust issues with customers,” he said.

Limited exposure to problem banks

Mukul Garg, an IT analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said the Indian IT sector doesn’t have high exposure to Credit Suisse. “There might be some exposure to large-cap ones like Infosys, HCLTech but I don’t think it is large enough for them,” he says.

The current situation, he said, is likely to cause near-term pressure on spending by US and European banks if it exacerbates.

“We are still viewing how this scenario is developing, it is very recent. The impact will mostly be limited till March for IT services companies. There will be some impact on their revenue in Q4, but beyond that, we don’t have a lot of visibility in terms of whether the impact will persist. There is some concern but it will not structurally impact IT companies unless contagion spreads further,” he told Moneycontrol.

As per a recent note by JP Morgan, US regional bank exposure is the most at TCS and Infosys at less than 2-3 percent of revenue. It also estimated that the exposure to Silicon Valley Bank is 10-20 bps for TCS, Infosys, and LTIMindtree.

A LTIMindtree spokesperson told Moneycontrol that company's exposure to the impacted banks is immaterial. The company overall gets 37.4 percent of its revenue from the BFSI vertical.

“We wish to share that despite the volatility in the global financial markets following the banking crisis, LTIMindtree’s exposure to impacted institutions is immaterial. We do not foresee any impact on our financials. We continue to work closely with our clients and monitor the developments on the ground,” the spokesperson said.

Softening of tech spends

According to the JPMorgan note, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and concerns about liquidity across the US and the European Union can soften tech spends by banks in the short term. According to the note, it can lead to delays in ramp-ups, which can impact revenue conversion in the next 1-2 quarters and delays in deal closures that will impact revenues over the next 3-4 quarters. “We have already heard about slowing revenue conversion in 4Q and slowing deal signing before the events that kicked off SVB’s collapse,” the note said.

Fersht said that several Indian companies have “deep business footprints in BFS”.

“For example, TCS and Infosys are exposed to US regional banks. Wipro’s acquisition of Capco, a BFS specialist, could cause some issues. Other Indian-heritage providers such as HCL, Mphasis, UST, Hexaware, and Virtusa are heavily dependent on the BFS sector and will be watching closely. Cognizant’s dependence on BFS has lessened in recent years, which may be a blessing in disguise,” he said.

Nomura said in a note last week that SVB is a small customer of TCS, and the company works with most of the large regional and central banks. Softening of spending and decision-making in US BFSI was already there, even before SVB’s problems surfaced, it said. Infosys, on the other hand, said it works with 8 of the 10 largest US banks, has “no meaningful exposure to US regional banks”, and expects client spends for CY23 to be impacted. Wipro, according to the note, “thinks the larger impact from the recent volatility in the global BFSI sector would emerge only with a lag.""

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, caution among BFS firms in developed markets, following Silvergate, SVB, Signature Bank and the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS is expected to lead to further curtailing of discretionary tech spends in the near term. Kotak said that there can be a pause in the pace of digital or cloud programs due to a cut in discretionary spending in the near term.

Slowdown?

Fersht said that the next six months are going to be tough, with many decisions put off.

“However, once trust in the financial systems is restored, 2024 should see strong growth as many BFS firms cannot afford to keep delaying IT projects. Many BFS firms have no choice but to modernise their legacy cores to survive in the digital environment,” he said.

Kotak expects a growth slowdown in FY24, with sequential growth expected to be impacted by 1-2 percent in Q1.

Kotak noted that post the global financial crisis in 2008, Indian IT players benefited from captive takeover deals and that similar opportunities might come up in the second half of FY24. This could benefit service providers with strong capabilities across services and mandates.

The note added that on a pro forma basis, UBS and Credit Suisse spend roughly $7 billion on technology, and would look for “upfront cost saves by eliminating redundancies in tech stack as part of their plan to rationalise the over CHF 8 billion annual cost run-rate by CY2027.”

The company indicated that cost savings of CHF 2 billion would be from the integration of IT systems. “M&A of such scale provides significant opportunities for service providers to sign deals with long-term annuity revenue streams, while also consolidating out the long tail of vendors,” Kotak said.

Wait and watch

A note by Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said that it is unclear how things will play out, and going by the actions of the DM central banks, it looks like the damage has been contained for now. “If US regional bank problems are not sorted out quickly there is going to be a spillover effect on the US economy that would then have a direct impact on the IT spend by large US corporations,” the note said, adding that the BFSI sector will likely be an area of stress in FY24.

Gaurav Vasu, founder and CEO of IT market intelligence firm UnearthInsight, told Moneycontrol that the challenge for IT services companies is primarily about the current situation spreading to other banks.

“In the short run, there will be delays in banking contracts, a lot of the short-term and mid-term automation, cloud optimisation and modernisation kind of contracts, cybersecurity projects etc will see a slowdown. In the short run, till Q2, there will be a 20-30 bps decline in revenue of the BFSI sector overall,” he said.

He added that the impact in Q4 will be seen in companies directly related to Credit Suisse and SVB.

Queries sent to TCS, Infosys, LTIMindtree and Tech Mahindra were unanswered at the time of publishing.

“Macroeconomic developments are visible across the US and Europe and we are closely monitoring the situation. The majority of our exposure is to large banks, which are well capitalised,” Wipro told Moneycontrol in a statement.

Where will the spending be?

According to Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at ISG, spending in the BFSI space was geared more towards business process outsourcing than in IT. He added that spending is likely to be higher in the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) space.

Rai added that the annual contract value (ACV) for IT was trending downwards in the BFSI space. “Spending is more on the strategic side of it and when clients — not just in BFSI — analyse how technology will help them sustain in the business and how it can help strategically improve, they do spend on technologies on the business side. You may not see the regular IT service providers, somebody managing only say cloud or networks or data centre kind of deals, those deals will reduce but work that involves core banking services or GRC, payment processing, etc., in those kinds of things, spending is likely to be more.”",1531,-0.6982442736625671

The Indian equity market remained under pressure for the second consecutive week ended March 17, dampened by a nervousness that gripped markets around the world, especially after a banking crisis rattled the US.

The Nifty50 slumped below its five-month low of 16,850 in later part of the week, followed by a late-hour recovery to 17,100. The index, however, ended down 1.8 percent for the week.

It formed long bearish candlestick pattern on the weekly timeframe with long lower wicks indicating some buying interest at lower levels. The index has made a lower-high-lower-low formation.

If we look at the daily charts, the Nifty50 has formed Long Legged Doji kind of a pattern with above-average volumes for the second consecutive day, indicating the possibility of a rebound in the coming sessions. The index gained about 250 points in the last two days from over a five-month low, but still far away from its 200-day SMA (simple moving average - 17,451).

Hence the index needs to hit and sustain above 17,451 for further uptrend, with a crucial support at 16,850, experts said.

""We are not entirely out of the woods and the broader trajectory remains tentative, but we may expect some bounce in the near term,"" Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical and Derivative Research at Angel One, said.

As far as levels are concerned, he feels the recent swing low of 16,900-16,850 is likely to act as the sheet anchor, and it is highly anticipated that the dip would augur well for the bulls.

On the flip side, the 17,200-17,250 is the immediate hurdle, followed by the sturdy wall of 200 SMA placed around the 17,400-17,450 odd zone, he said.

Rohan Patil, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, also feels a positive divergence is also spotted which indicates the probability of bounce back at current levels, but the rebound can be short-lived as prices may face strong resistance at higher levels.

Technically, the structure has turned bearish and Nifty stands at the strong polarity support of 16,800 – 16,750 levels, failing to hold which the index is likely to see a further correction towards 16,450 – 16,400 zones, he said.

Hence, Osho advised traders to avoid aggressive bets and look for stock-specific action, while investors could now seize this opportunity by initiating accumulation in good blue-chip companies in a staggered manner.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the March 17 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Trent: Buy | LTP: 1,356 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,270 | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 11 percent

The stock is forming a bullish continuation after rallying to Rs 1,380 from Rs 1,150 levels. The rally was significant and unexpected. Technically, such formations suggest that the stock may move to the upside.

It is mandatory for the stock to cross Rs 1,380 level to validate the formation. However, the strategy should be to buy 50 percent more at current levels and on further declines till Rs 1,300.

For the same, keep a stop-loss at Rs 1,270. On the upside, it is likely to move towards Rs 1,440 and Rs 1,500 levels.

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,127 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,040 | Target: Rs 1,250 | Return: 11 percent

The stock has formed a base building formation between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,000 levels. It has spent more than 9 months. It has broken the upward trading range with a positive outcome, which may lift the stock higher to partially pull back the previous losses.

In December 2021, it was at Rs 1,838 level and currently, it is at Rs 1,130. We can expect a partial retracement till Rs 1,400 with minor resistance near Rs 1,250.

The strategy should be to buy between Rs 1,130 and Rs 1,080. Keep a stop-loss at Rs 1,040.

Eicher Motors: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,974 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,105 | Target: Rs 2,800 | Return: 6 percent

After declining from Rs 3,890 high, it is taking multiple supports between Rs 3,050 and Rs 3,100. The Rs 3,050 level was especially important as it is a 50 percent retracement ratio for the entire rally that the stock has displayed during 2022.

However, on Friday the stock gave up the support which was at Rs 3,050 and closed below the same which would trigger further weakness. In the near future, below Rs 3,050 level, the next major support lies at Rs 2,800 level. It is recommended to create short positions at Rs 3,020 and Rs 3,050, with a stop-loss at Rs 3,105.

While attrition at lower level has made headlines in the past, this time around it is the senior leadership churn in companies such as TCS and Infosys that is in the spotlight.

Infosys has seen two president-level exits in a matter of months, with Ravi Kumar and Mohit Joshi leaving the company to join top tier IT firms Cognizant and Tech Mahindra, respectively.

Last week, Tech Mahindra announced the appointment of Joshi as MD and CEO-designate, who will take over the charge from CP Gurnani after his retirement on December 19 this year.

On Thursday, the country's largest software services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in a sudden announcement said Rajesh Gopinathan, its CEO for more than six years with over four years left to his second five-year term, has decided to move on from September 15.

The USD 25-billion software giant announced that K Krithivasan, president of its BFSI vertical which contributes 31.5 per cent of its top-line, will head the company as the CEO-designate with immediate effect.

""Overall, the churn in many companies is a culmination of a lot of factors coming together at one time. It is a good thing for the industry to have a change of guard at periodic intervals as it brings in fresh blood and new thinking,"" industry veteran and former Infosys director TV Mohandas Pai told PTI. Many factors are at play here, he pointed out.

""One common thread, barring one or two exceptions like Cognizant, is that all people have seen stresses of pandemic. Some may be feeling tired and wanting to change.

Secondly, many of them after pandemic are re-examining their career path and don't want to wait to be CEOs of the companies where they are, so they leave whenever they get a chance to be a CEO (elsewhere). And then post-pandemic some people want to retire, and that is causing vacancy. I guess it is a culmination of many things that are happening, which is causing the churn,"" Pai said.

The shocking resignation of TCS' Gopinathan has taken market watchers by surprise. The unexpected CEO exit is not likely to hurt business delivery though, according to Motilal Oswal's recent report on TCS.

""Gopinathan's departure from TCS is surprising, as he has led the company for only six years and was expected to continue for the long term given his age (52 years). Moreover, while the company's growth has trailed peers like Infosys recently, it has handled external pressures, including a transition to Digital delivery and the Covid impact relatively well despite its size,"" Motilal Oswal said in a note on March 17.

Gopinathan, 52, said this is his first resignation and he has not written a resume since the campus days as he joined Tata Industries 27 years ago from the campus and TCS 22 years ago. He did not reveal his plans after September 15.

""We are in the most stable times given what we have gone through in recent years. Of course, there are some ups and downs. It was important for me to announce the decision before the start of the new fiscal year,"" Gopinathan said on the timing of his resignation.

On his priority now, he said, ""my immediate priority is that Krithi steps in smoothly and I will be available 100 per cent for him"". Gopinathan was reappointed for five more years till February 2027, after his first five-year term as TCS CEO came to an end last year. Krithivasan doesn't intend to make any dramatic changes to the organisation's existing strategy.

""It's a continuum, we don't change strategically when a new CEO comes in. But we will change according to what our customers want and how the market changes. We will not make any short changes but will continue to drive on our core focus of being with the customers,"" Krithivasan said.

Just days before this, Mohit Joshi resigned from Infosys after putting in more than 20 years in the company, and was named the MD and CEO designate of Tech Mahindra.

Joshi will take over the reins from C P Gurnani (the present MD and CEO) after his retirement on December 19 this year. Gurnani has been one of the longest serving chief executive officers of the Indian IT sector, and is among of the most recognised faces of the industry. Gurnani had joined Tech Mahindra in 2004 and later spearheaded the takeover of scam-ridden Satyam Computers and its merger with Tech Mahindra.

He has been MD and CEO of Tech Mahindra since June 2009. Meanwhile, Joshi's exit after the recent move by former president and COO Ravi Kumar marks the second loss of a senior executive at the Bengaluru-headquartered Infosys to a top competitor, market watchers pointed out.

Nasdaq-listed Cognizant in January named Ravi Kumar S as its new chief executive officer (CEO); Kumar succeeded Brian Humphries. ""The big picture is that large companies now run with processes momentum and references, not people at the top. If the leadership bench strength is adequate there is little or no impact of leadership transitions,"" industry expert and chairman of 5F World (a platform for digital startups, skills and social ventures) Ganesh Natarajan said.",891,-0.652351995309194

The IT services sector, which has already been suffering in the past year due to the uncertain global environment, is still not out of the woods as the macro environment continues to be turbulent, with analysts remaining cautious about the sector.

The benchmark Nifty IT index has declined 20 percent in the last year, compared to the broader Nifty50 index, which is up around 0.21 percent.

What do brokerages say

According to foreign brokerage Nomura, the demand uncertainty is rising and margins have bottomed out, with concerns around uncertain macro conditions, falling attrition and disciplined mergers and acquisitions.

The brokerage has a ""buy"" rating on Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems and Coforge. However, it recommends ""reduce"" on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), LTIMindtree (LTIM) and L&T Technologies.

Morgan Stanley (MS), on the other hand, is bullish on LTIM and prefers Infosys and HCL Technologies. It has an 'underweight' rating on Wipro, L&T Tech and Tata Elxsi.

According to MS, macro concerns could lead to correction of stocks in near term.

The macro environment remains in a flux, clouding near-term revenue outlook and it believes that growth should normalise on a two-year basis. The brokerage cautions on FY24 outlook, with the expected stock volatility in the near term. “Would use that as an opportunity to accumulate,” it added.

Early last week, Jefferies said, “Among companies, consensus revenue growth estimates for CY24 have been lowered for top clients of all IT firms, barring Wipro, with the highest cuts of 80-180bps for HCLT & TechM. Additionally, profitability pressures are visible in CY24 as well, with aggregate margin/PAT estimates for top clients being revised downwards by 30bps/3 percent. Downward revisions in CY24 estimates suggests that concerns are now shifting towards CY24.”

The brokerage sees Coforge, Wipro and LTIM at high risk and believes Infosys, TCS, and HCL are better placed. “With sector valuations at 23x, we remain selective, with Infosys our only top pick,” it said.

On Wipro and LTIM, the brokerage said that while consensus expects limited deceleration in their revenue growth, a larger deceleration in the growth of their top clients is expected. For Coforge, the consensus revenue growth in FY24 is lower than the growth expected for its top clients.

“Infosys/TCS appear better placed on this front and the outlook of their clients seems to be improving as well. HCLT also looks well positioned as consensus expects HCLT's clients to see growth acceleration in FY24. TechM's expectations of growth moderation seem to be in sync with those of its clients, suggesting limited risk to FY24 growth,” the brokerage added.

“In our view, the sector’s outlook remains “fluid”, specifically with increased macro “noise” during the past two weeks as well as SVB’s failure, likely causing enterprise clients to procrastinate on IT spending decisions, further delaying CY23’s actual budget cycle, and resulting in longer sale cycles, while also impacting sector’s near-term visibility,” Research and Advisory firm Wedbush said in an industry note.

The advisory has made revenue growth adjustments for Accenture, Infosys, and Cognizant and believes the EPS impact will be marginal, given the supply-side tailwinds such as moderating wage inflation, subcontractor use decline and widening pyramid structure.

“Accordingly, we are not making any rating changes at this point,” it added.",581,-0.32939520478248596

Domestic mutual funds sold shares of ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India and Bajaj Finance to the tune of Rs 4360 crore in the month of February. Meanwhile, they were hot on tech stocks including new-age companies like Paytm and Delhivery, according to data by Nuvama Research.

Among IT names, shares of Tech Mahindra, Coforge, LTIMindtree and HCL Technologies were the top buys, cumulatively amounting to Rs 3420 crore. The buying in Coforge shares was part of the block deal in which Baring PE sold 10 percent stake.

The ‘Buy IT, sell banks’ trend is indicative of the trend reversal seen in Nifty Bank and Nifty IT indices in this calendar year. Reversing last year’s outperformance, Nifty Bank index is down 6 percent in this year so far on margin compression concerns. Meanwhile, Nifty IT index is up 4.4 percent after taking a beating in 2022.

Mutual funds also lapped up shares worth Rs 230 crore of One97 Communications and worth Rs 130 crore of Delhivery after both the new-age tech companies narrowed their losses in Q3. In fact, Paytm achieved operating profitability in Q3, three quarters ahead of the guidance for the September quarter. Paytm shares rallied post Q3 results announcement from Rs 524 to Rs 705. It has cooled off significantly since then and is currently trading near Rs 570 level.

Adani stocks

During the month, mutual funds offloaded stakes in Adani Ports, Adani Enterprises and Ambuja Cements. Meanwhile, they bought ACC shares worth Rs 110 crore. The big fund houses that trimmed their positions in Adani Ports were Aditya Birla Sun Life MF, IDFC MF, Edelweiss MF, SBI MF and Quant MF, as per the data collated by Nuvama Research.

Adani group stocks have been on a rollercoaster ride ever since the publication of the Hindenburg Research report on January 24. On some days, the stocks are buoyed by promoters’ prepayment of margin-backed loans only to crash in the following session. Rs 10.28 lakh crore has been wiped off from the group’s combined market capitalization since January 24.

Zee

Another stock that was in focus last month was Zee Entertainment Enterprises. The company was dragged to the National Company Law Tribunal for insolvency proceedings, jeopardising its merger with Culver Max Entertainment (Sony). But, mutual funds were not too bothered by this. They sold only 35 lakh shares worth Rs 70 crore.

About 26.7 percent of the company’s total share capital is currently held by mutual funds. In fact, MFs have been steadily increasing their stake in the company. In September 2022, they held 22.62 percent which inched up to 27.42 percent by end of January.

NCLAT has stayed the insolvency proceedings for now and the next hearing is scheduled for March 27.

MSCI stocks

The bank rout in global markets continues. A silver lining from behind the dark clouds perhaps could be the Fed pressing the pause button on rate hikes, or at least the possibility of a 50-basis-point increase going off the table. Not many in the market are hopeful, though. Goldman Sachs' seems to be the only voice betting on a rate pause. Some short covering is expected in Indian shares, but the near to medium term outlook is bearish.

Inflation

Consumer inflation for February at 6.44 percent was slightly higher than what economists were expecting.

What next?

“Uncertain FX in case of global financial stress contagion and the possibility of sticky services inflation could keep the inflation trajectory far from a secular fall in the coming months. The RBI will continue to remain non-committal on the future rates path, as the fluid global situation demands frequent macro re-assessments,” wrote Emkay lead economist Madhavi Vora in a note to clients.

Stock moves

IndusInd shares plunged over 7 percent on Monday after the RBI extended CEO Suman Kathpalia’s term by two years instead of the three as proposed by the bank.

Why?

“Ever since the Yes Bank fiasco, investors are jittery whenever the RBI disagrees with a bank’s proposal on extension of CEO’s tenure,” says Moneycontrol Banking Editor Dinesh Unnikrishnan. “The fears may not always be justified. For instance, Federal Bank CEO Shyam Srinivasan’s tenure was extended by just a year despite the bank asking for three. Initially, the market was worried, but the stock later did fine.”

Tech Mahindra shares held ground in Monday’s bearish session. The announcement of Infosys veteran Mohit Joshi as CEO designate was cited by brokers as one of the triggers. Tech M’s margins have plenty of scope for improvement, and that does make it a potential re-rating candidate among top tier IT stocks. But it is not going to be an easy ship to turn, analysts caution, more so as Joshi will be taking control of the wheel as the weather is getting rough. Those wanting to take a bet on Tech M should be prepared for the long haul.

Blue Star is among the handful of stocks hitting 52-week highs in this market. The company’s MD B Thiagarajan told CNBCTV18 that the peak summer demand earlier seen in May was now getting advanced. He is targeting a 30 percent volume growth between March and June.

Bank stocks clobbered

With bank stocks in US and Europe under fire, the banking story in India too has soured though not for reasons of systemic risk. PSU bank stocks were among the worst performers on Monday, and some feel the drubbing may be justified.

""The narrative that bank stocks should do well because credit demand is strong is a bit too simplistic,” Motilal Oswal’s Hemang Jani tells Short Call.

“The thing with banking is that it is easy to lend, but you will know only a year down the line if that money is coming back . We are seeing signs of some slowdown in the economy... Hard to say if it will be short lived or prolonged.,"" he adds. Already, bank stocks have been sliding for the last few weeks as rising deposit rates are expected into bite in its net interest margins.

NSE share trades

There is still no clarity on when the National Stock Exchange’s initial public offer (IPO) will get the Sebi green light. But that is not stopping domestic investors from piling on to the stock in the private market. Share transfer data for February showed multiple block deals, and in one such deal a domestic investor picked up 7 lakh shares offered by a non-resident Indian for Rs 2,725. In another large deal, a foreign investor bought 8.56 lakh shares from an NRI at Rs 2,750.

Despite the flurry of activity, most transactions have taken place in the Rs 2700-2800 range, compared to the Rs 3000-3200 range a couple of months back.

BSE SME chief

Ajay Thakur, Head BSE SME, is learnt to have put in his papers. Thakur, who has been with the bouse for nearly two-and-a-half decades, is credited with having built the BSE’s SME division into a formidable force. Thakur was not available for comment.

Will the Fed cut rates?

It is not a given, writes James Mackintosh in Wall Street Journal.

“In 2007 the Fed was willing to cut rates in spite of an oil-driven acceleration in inflation because the financial system meltdown was obvious. In 1998, inflation had collapsed below 2%, while around the time of the 1994 peso crisis inflation was fairly stable. This time inflation remains far above target, the jobs market is still tight and, until last week’s bank collapses, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was talking up the need for higher rates for longer.”

Collateral damage

SoftBank, similarly central to the global VC arena, has lost around 7 percent or $5 billion of its value since news of SVB’s difficulties emerged, reports Bloomberg.

While the US Treasury Department and Federal Reserve stepped in to assure depositors of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) that their funds are safe, the lender’s stockholders and unsecured creditors were offered no such reprieve.

Not to mention its vast roster of startup clients. Or SVB’s senior management, who, it seems, were the only people in the financial world who were unaware that interest rates were heading northward. (Or that things like interest rate hedging exist).

With Dalal Street bathed in a sea of red, there were only two entities which held their own on a brutal day – Tech Mahindra, and its knight in shining armour (going by the market reaction) – Mohit Joshi.

Joshi, an Infosys veteran with over two decades of experience across enterprise technology software and consulting domains, was named the next MD and CEO of Tech Mahindra on Sunday. He will succeed CP Gurnani, who retires in December this year.

The news turbocharged the Tech Mahindra stock from the moment markets opened on Monday, despite analysts urging shareholders to temper their enthusiasm.

“Great CEO choice, but a turnaround is not easy and will take time. Tech Mahindra faces structural challenges in matching leading peers in organic growth and margin,” said analysts at JPMorgan.

They believe the stock can re-rate marginally in the near term but a structural re-rating can happen only over the medium term. They have a ‘neutral’ rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1,100 per share.

Citi echoed the views.

“The real test of performance will start next calendar year once Mohit Joshi assumes the CEO role. The market will again focus on the pace of turnaround, which can potentially take time,” it said.

The brokerage has a 'neutral' rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1,120 per share.

But as the market repeatedly shows, excitement trumps analysis, at least in the short run.

The Tech Mahindra counter was on a tear since the opening session and closed with stellar gains of 6.83 percent at Rs 1,133.60 on the BSE. It was the sole stock to finish in the green in the Sensex pack.

In a cruel twist of fate, Infosys tumbled over 2 percent as analysts hauled up the firm for its poor showing in retaining senior executives.

JPMorgan noted that Joshi’s departure highlights the depth of Infosys' leadership and the inability to provide adequate career mobility to senior talent. In just six months, this is Infosys’ second loss of a senior leader to a tier-1 rival. (In October 2022, Infosys President Ravi Kumar resigned to take charge as the top boss of Cognizant).

CLSA has also noted that Infosys will need to find a quick replacement to ensure minimal business disruptions.

Speaking of disruptions, it is a race against time in the US as the government scrambles to find a suitor for SVB. Across the Atlantic, HSBC announced the acquisition of SVB’s UK subsidiary for an eye-watering price of £1.

Will some similarly deep-pocketed benefactor swoop in at the last moment to rescue SVB, or will the venture capitalists and tech bros get a sobering lesson on how capitalism can also be a two-way street?

Putting all speculation to rest, Tech Mahindra has selected Mohit Joshi of Infosys as its managing director and chief executive officer from December. In an uncertain macro environment, foreign brokerages see this as a neutral move at best.

“Great CEO choice, but a turnaround is not easy and will take time. Tech Mahindra faces structural challenges in matching leading peers in organic growth and margin,” said analysts at JPMorgan.

Citi, too, has similar views. “The real test of performance will start next calendar year once Mohit Joshi assumes the CEO role. The market will again focus on the pace of turnaround, which can potentially take time,” it said. The brokerage has a 'neutral' rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1,120 per share.

Analysts at Nomura also do not expect any immediate strategy change after the new CEO joins.

Investors, however, cheered the selection for the corner office and Tech Mahindra shares zoomed in early trade on March 13. The shares traded at Rs 1152 on the NSE, higher by 8 percent, at 9:30am. This marked the stock's best day in nearly 7 years.

On the flipside, Joshi's departure from Infosys is seen as a negative in the near-term. At Infosys, he is the head of the Global Financial Services & Healthcare and the software businesses, which include Finacle (the banking platform) and the AI/automation portfolio.

JPMorgan believes that his departure highlights the depth of Infosys' leadership and the inability to provide adequate career mobility to senior talent. In just six months, this is Infosys’ second loss of a senior leader to a tier-1 rival. CLSA has also noted that Infosys will need to find a quick replacement to ensure minimal business disruptions.

As someone who’s closely worked with Infosys CEO Salil Parekh and has expertise in the BFSI and healthcare space, Joshi is expected to re-energise the business, industry experts said.

According to analysts, Joshi’s experience of over 22 years with the IT services behemoth and his involvement in executing Infosys’ transformation as part of its leadership team over the past few years, will help him think strategically on winning large deals for Tech Mahindra, deals that usually go to the top two or three companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys.

Joshi resigned from Infosys on March 11, and will be taking over the reins of Tech Mahindra from current CEO and MD CP Gurnani on December 20.

The Mahindra group leadership was keen to bring in some fresh thinking from outside, said Phil Fersht, Founder and Chief Analyst of HFS Research.

“Mohit Joshi has been coveted as a potential CEO in the services industry, and Tech Mahindra is a superb opportunity, especially as Salil Parekh has over four years remaining on his Infosys contract,” he told Moneycontrol.

Ray Wang, founder and principal analyst, Constellation Research concurred, ""Joshi is one of the large deal architects at Infosys. Like Ravi Kumar S, these are the folks that have help make Infosys successful.""

""While Salil Parekh has a deep bench, these two were always considered next in line for CEO so when Salil’s contract was renewed, competitors have been looking for good leaders that understood big deals,"" Wang told Moneycontrol.

Fersht added that Joshi has a proven track record of growing business units and is well respected both within Infosys and by its banking and financial services customers as a strategic thinker and strong delivery leader.

“He brings vital industry experience to Tech M outside of its traditional telecoms mainstay, and will bring fresh energy and ideas to the firm,” Fersht said.

According to Pareekh Jain, Founder and CEO, EIIRTrend, Joshi will be bringing his experience as part of Infosys’ transformation leadership team, both under former CEO Vishal Sikka and now Parekh. ``They transformed Infosys in the last four-five years,’’ he said.

As President at Infosys, Joshi is responsible for the Financial Services, Insurance, Healthcare, and Life Sciences businesses. Additionally, he is the Chairman of Edgeverve Systems, wherein he leads the company’s software business which includes Finacle, Infosys’ global banking platform. He also led sales operations and effectiveness for Infosys and has executive responsibility for large deals across the firm.

Tech Mahindra needs a strategy refresh

Analysts are batting for Joshi as they think Tech Mahindra needs a strategy refresh and needs to expand beyond its stronghold of telecom and CME (Communications, Media and Entertainment) verticals. Joshi fits in beautifully as he comes from the BFSI and healthcare domains.

“Tech Mahindra needs a strategy refresh. They have the lowest margins among Tier-I IT companies. Their growth is not in the top quartile and they are not winning large deals. From that perspective, bringing someone who has performed in a Tier-I firm is a good choice,’’ Jain said.

He added, “Apart from that, he was heading BFSI, healthcare, and the Europe market --- all segments Tech Mahindra is not strong in compared to other Tier-I firms. He was also a part of the overall sales transformation at Infosys. That experience will be very helpful while going for a strategy refresh; especially given that Nasscom has said that overall growth this year will be similar to last year or lower.”

Tech Mahindra will need to capture large cost takeout deals in the current environment to grow, Jain added.

Tech Mahindra has a lot of opportunities to build up its analytics, automation, and AI practices -- areas at the core of where digital is headed, said Wang.

""The shift to more focused industry plays need to match the ability to build offerings that are more high margin. This isn’t an easy play to make, but you can do it with a large deal mentality,"" he added.

During the company’s Investor Day on March 3, Gurnani said that while Tech Mahindra is predominantly known for its telecom vertical, the company is also trying to diversify and change the portfolio mix of segments, given the changing regulatory environment and other challenges in different geographies globally in the telecom space.

Currently, around 41 percent of Tech Mahindra’s revenues are from telecom, and 60 percent is from its enterprise business.

The company is also betting big on its product and platform business, which Gurnani estimated will become a $1 billion revenue vertical in the next three years.

According to Forrester Research India’s Head of Research, Ashutosh Sharma, Joshi will need to re-energise Tech Mahindra, which has a lot of latent potential and capabilities in the manufacturing domain courtesy its parent, the Mahindra group, especially in the automotive space.

“Tech Mahindra has not capitalised on that as much as TCS has. Joshi will have a lot of work to do,” he told Moneycontrol.

Sharma added that Tech Mahindra has been strong in Telecom and manufacturing, but there are areas where it’s not among the leaders.

“They have grown, but not at the fastest pace. Joshi will have to focus a lot on navigating through the current environment, which presages tough times ahead for the industry. Though IT services companies benefit from downturns as well,” he added, referring to the current global uncertainties caused by inflation, impending recession in the US, the Russia-Ukraine war, etc.",930,0.5888720949490865

Here’s all you need to know about the heir apparent of Tech Mahindra:

Education : Joshi completed his schooling from Delhi Public School R.K. Puram in New Delhi. He is an alumnus of St. Stephen’s College of Delhi University where he graduated with a B.A. degree in History in 1994. Joshi got his MBA from Delhi University in 1996.

Had a banking background: Prior to joining Infosys, Joshi had worked in the corporate banking teams as a manager of a couple of banks including ANZ Grindlays Bank and ABN Amro Bank.

He started his career at ANZ Grindlays in 1996 where he worked till 1999 followed by a tenure of around a year at ABN Amro Bank till 2000.

At Infosys: In his last role at Infosys as President before his resignation on March 11, he was responsible for the Financial Services & Healthcare/Life Sciences businesses.

Joshi's appointment comes after he resigned from Infosys on March 11 after 22 years with the company.

As the new CEO, Joshi will need to address issues with execution, particularly in achieving a good balance of industry-matching revenue growth and respectable EBIT margin. Although the company has been making efforts to shift from a Telecom-heavy business to a more enterprise-oriented one, this transition has not been entirely smooth, per analysts.

Joshi will be appointed as Managing Director and CEO with effect from December 20, Tech Mahindra said in a stock exchange filing.

“Appointment of Mr. Mohit Joshi, (DIN: 08339247) as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Key Managerial Personnel under the Companies Act, 2013, for a period of 5 (five) years with effect from 20th December, 2023 to 19th December, 2028 (both days inclusive),” the company said.

Current CEO CP Gurnani’s term ends on December 19.

In a statement, Tech Mahindra said Joshi will join ""well before the date"" of his appointment as CEO and MD to allow for sufficient transition time.

During the recent investor meet, Gurnani said that there will be a reasonable transition period between his moving on and the new CEO taking over and that he will guide — along with the rest of the leadership — during the transition.

“This is a running train. There will be a reasonable transition period between me and the new leader. Clearly, the assumption is that the leadership team is here to stay and I will be a part of the team which will make sure the transition happens,” he had said.

Joshi's tenure at Infosys will come to an end in June and till then he will be on leave. This marks the second big exit for the company in recent months, after Ravi Kumar S, also a former Infosys President, who exited the company and took over the role of Cognizant CEO in January.

Tech Mahindra NRC Chairperson TN Manoharan said in a statement, “Mohit’s appointment is the successful culmination of a rigorous selection process during which the NRC evaluated a number of internal and external candidates. Mohit’s experience with digital transformation, new technologies and large deals will complement Tech Mahindra’s strategies and continue to build on the strong growth momentum demonstrated by the company.""

Analysts have said that the company needs to fix execution, at a time it hasn't been able to deliver industry-leading revenue growth rates, and hasn't been able to shore up its profit margins.

In a note after the recent investor meet, Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said that the new CEO needs to fix execution, but there's little that they disagree with on the company's strategies.

""The key challenge has been to deliver a good balance of industry-matching revenue growth and respectable EBIT margin, something TML has struggled with....But, with net new TCV in a higher band over the last many quarters, getting clients to move to execution and extraction of higher margins will be key tasks for the new CEO,"" the note read.",527,-0.5995065927505493

TechM gave further insights into its NXT.NOW growth strategy, focusing on connectivity, experience, cloud, engineering, and sustainability through differentiated offerings. The company also highlighted the progress made on large deals, client mining, and alliances to accelerate revenue growth while driving delivery excellence to steer margin expansion. The company expects the leadership transition to be smooth as it is a planned succession and executed diligently with a reasonable time period to transition to the new leader and the growth strategy laid out is unlikely to change. While management anticipates nearterm weakness in revenue growth, it is optimistic about its medium-term growth outlook, driven by 5G, cloud, engineering, sustainability, and Industry 4.0. Management unveiled its plan to focus on building a products and platform business and scaling up the co-creating business. The products and platform business is currently at ~USD450mn run rate and has the potential to scale to USD1bn in the next three years.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

We attended TechM’s Investor Day 2023; the key focus of the meet was upcoming leadership transition and operational profitability. Management commentary was encouraging, with stable spending environment and deal flow in both communication and enterprise businesses. TechM continues to focus on improving its profitability and expects FY24 margins to improve, led by lower subcon expenses, improving offshore, and divestment of non-accretive businesses. With the upcoming change in leadership, due to the retirement of Mr. Gurnani (CEO), long-term strategic direction will continue to remain in focus.

Outlook

Near-term growth remains weak and we await greater comfort on margins. We value the stock at 15x FY24E EPS. We maintain our Neutral rating.

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra stated that although it was seeing some pause in decision-making by clients due to the ongoing near-term global macroeconomic challenges, demand for business transformation projects among enterprise customers is expected to continue. The company expects EBIT margins to improve in FY24 (hit in FY23 by M&A, large deals and wage hikes) driven by operational efficiency, large deals and business & geo-mix changes. However, the company expects to reach FY22 EBIT margin levels only by FY26. The company identified Products & Platforms and Co-creation with customers as new business streams that would witness higher investments and expects 2x revenues in the next 2-3 years. The management reflected a stable to healthy outlook on all verticals particularly with greater optimism on Hi-tech vertical.



Outlook

The outlook for FY24 is likely to be uncertain as highlighted by the company due to concerns of delays in decision making on account of global headwinds with possibility of a slow gradual recovery. However, we maintain Buy on the stock with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs. 1,220 given the industry leading growth in BPS business, stable to healthy outlook on its verticals and scope for margin improvement. We advise investors to adopt a staggered approach to invest from a long-term perspective.

Tech Mahindra's new announcements for its products and platforms business has not impressed analysts. Most of the foreign brokerages have not upgraded their rating or target price on the stock. Neither have they cut target prices.

With a commitment of investing Rs 700 crore in the products and platforms business, the management of Tech Mahindra expects the segment to grow to about $1 billion in less than three years.

“We are creating two new streams of business: products and platforms (P&P) and co-creation with customers. These will be a big growth opportunity for us,” MD & CEO CP Gurnani said on March 5 at the company’s investor day.

Nomura has maintained its Buy rating with a target of Rs 1,260 per share. “The management aims to create value through mergers and acquisitions, synergies from portfolio companies, and joint ventures,” Nomura said in its report.

Morgan Stanley has maintained its Overweight rating with a target of Rs 1,120 per share. The management has a constructive medium-term outlook on demand, barring near-term uncertainty, the foreign brokerage noted.

“They are building capabilities around P&P and expect margin recovery to take 2-3 years,” it added.

CLSA has given Tech Mahindra an Underperform rating with a target of Rs 1,100 per share. While the focus on P&P business is in line with margin management, Tech Mahindra expects weaker Q4FY23 compared to peers. This is what is keeping CLSA analysts at bay.

“However, the company highlighted a 4 percent dividend yield and an inexpensive valuation of 16x for FY24 limits the downside in the stock,” it noted.

JPMorgan has a Neutral rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1,100 per share. According to JPMorgan analysts, the wait for a new CEO and peak utilization level are some key risks.

Meanwhile, domestic brokerage firm ICICI Securities has downgraded the stock from Hold to Reduce, with target price of Rs 1086 apiece. It does not expect earnings fundamentals to materially change for the company over next three years, despite potential leadership change. Current CEO CP Gurnani's tenure ends in December 2023.

In Q3 FY23, Tech Mahindra reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,297 crore, down 5.3 percent year-on-year. Revenue from operations came in at Rs 13,735 crore, rising 19.9 percent from Rs 11,450 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

Operating margins stood at 16 percent, compared to 18 percent in the year-ago period and 20 percent in pre-COVID era.

Though the stock has gained over 7 percent in 2023 so far, the outlook on IT services companies remains bearish due to recession fears in the US and Europe. In Moneycontrol’s Analyst Tracker, Tech Mahindra is in the ‘Maximum Pessimism’ list with 21 Buy calls, 15 Hold and 8 Sell calls.

Tech Mahindra’s CEO and MD CP Gurnani, who is set to retire in December, said that the company’s current business strategy is customer-centric and will not get impacted with the incoming of a new leader.

The company's management team unveiled new strategies and discussed key focus areas for future growth during its Investor Day.

Gurnani emphasized that the company's next big bets for driving revenue and growth will be focused on product and platform (P&P) and co-creation with customers. He expects that the P&P business will reach a revenue of $1 billion within three years.

Further, he assured that there will be a reasonable transition period between him moving on and the new CEO taking over, though he will continue to guide along with the rest of the leadership during transition. Grunani’s tenure as the CEO ends on December 19, 2023.

He said, “This is a running train. There will be a reasonable transition period between me and the new leader. Clearly, the assumption is that the leadership team is here to stay and I will be a part of the team which will make sure the transition happens.”

“The strategy is built around the customer and not the individual. The strategy is drawn with inputs from some of our key customers. Manish (Vyas) had four sessions (with customers) before he reached to MWC,” he added responding to analyst queries.

While there are external candidates being evaluated, according to media reports, internally the top contenders are Manish Vyas, Jagdish Mitra, Lakshmanan Chidambaram and Harshvendra Soin.

Vyas is the president for communications, media & entertainment (CME), and CEO of network services; Mitra is the chief strategy officer and head of growth; Chidambaram is the president of Tech Mahindra Americas; and Harshvendra Soin is the global chief people officer and head of marketing.

Vyas will also be responsible for the P&P business and its expansion, which involves multiple platform products across industries, line of businesses and use cases. All of this is being consolidated under Comviva 2.0 which will be launched in April. Currently an approximately $450 million revenue company, it is expected to grow 2X in the next three years.

Gurnani, in the last 12-14 months, had additionally tasked Vyas with the responsibility to supervise various tech verticals that the company has and banks on.

Speaking to investors Vyas said, “CP entrusted in me the responsibility to assist, supervise and help our lines of services, BPS with Biren (Birendra Sen), BORN XDS with Dilip (Dilip Keshu), Comviva and Product Services with Mao (Mao Mohapatra), network services with Manish Mangal.”

Vyas added he instead learned from these “stalwart” heads. These businesses were innovating every single day in unique ways to add value to the customers through Tech Mahindra’s own intellectual property (IP), he said. This IP will be put to use with the Comviva 2.0 plan.",481,0.9309134085973104

An incriminating report by a short-seller, withdrawal of a massive follow-on public offering, followed by Rs 10-lakh-crore market capitalisation wipeout—none of this has been able shake analysts’ confidence in Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.

It has 21 buy calls and zero sell or hold calls, indicating 100 percent optimism on Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for February.

For Q3, Adani Ports reported a 16.04 percent fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 1315.54 crore, but it was in line with analysts’ estimates. Goldman Sachs maintained its buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 840. Since the publication of the Hindenburg Research report, the stock’s valuation has also tumbled from a trailing twelve months (TTM) price-to-earnings ratio of 33.9 times to 29.5 times.

“Its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) guidance of Rs 14,500 crore for FY24 suggests healthy low-teens/high-teens organic/overall YoY (year-on-year) growth and a healthy quantum of deleveraging to 2.5X net debt to EBITDA,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report.

Next in the Maximum Optimism list is Hindalco. Both Hindalco and its subsidiary Novelis reported a weak set of numbers for Q3, with net profit declining 63 percent and 95 percent, respectively. Yet all 24 analysts covering Hindalco have buy calls on the stock. The bullishness is largely on the back of China reopening and inexpensive valuations.

According to foreign broking firm CLSA, “New pricing clauses and softening costs should lead to a gradual recovery. We see profitability returning to steady state guidance only in the second half of FY24. Strong free cash flow generation and phased capex augur well for leverage.”

On the flipside, JSW Steel has topped the Maximum Pessimism list with 19 sell calls, 7 hold and only 6 buy calls. Analysts have tagged the stock as an ‘expensive’ buy with high net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times.

Still bullish on financials

Financial names like State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank continued to remain in the Maximum Optimism list with 49 buy calls, 51 buy calls and 48 buy calls, respectively. They were among the top names in January too, as well as in the entire calendar year 2022.

While banks struggle to find deposits to keep up with the pace of loan growth, analysts are not too perturbed by the risk of net interest margin contraction.

“Banking stocks trade well below their decade's peaks and even below their 10-year average PBx (price to book ratio) for some. The subdued valuations, despite strong operating metrics in Q3, make the risk-reward picture for Indian banks rather compelling,” noted research firm Bernstein.

Still bearish on IT

The Nifty IT index, which was among the worst sectoral performers in 2022, is up around 5 percent for the year, while the benchmark Nifty 50 is down over 2 percent. Last year, fears of a looming recession in the US and Europe that would eventually result in a clampdown of IT spending caused analysts to downgrade the stocks.

The narrative has not seen any drastic change this year, despite a decent Q3 show by the sector, but some optimism is slowly creeping back in. Demand has moderated for IT services companies but remains reasonable, believe analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities.

“The possibility of outlasting the inflationary environment with just a slowdown/mild recession and continuous prioritization of tech spending has led to an optimistic outlook on tech spending by some clients even in the current weak macro,” they said in a recent report.

Tata Consultancy Services has 22 buy, 15 hold and 11 sell calls. Tech Mahindra has 21 buy, 15 hold and 8 sell calls. HCL Tech has 27 buy, 16 hold and 3 sell calls.

What’s up with NTPC?

The PSU firm is loved by analysts and currently boasts of 25 buy calls, 1 hold and zero sell calls. Its optimism score is 96.

This is largely on the back of monetisation of renewable assets in the near term, new thermal orders, and commissioning of pipeline plants. Foreign brokerage firm Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 198 per share.

Another key trigger is India’s increasing power demand. According to Sharekhan, India’s power demand grew strongly by 10 percent year-on-year in the first nine months of FY23, with a peak demand of 206 GW in December 2022.

“The outlook remains strong and bodes well for higher PLF (plant load factor) for thermal power plants and would benefit NTPC,” said the brokerage.

Tech Mahindra left no stone unturned to let its investors know that the IT services firm is going big on its product and platform business opportunity, estimating a 2X or more growth in the next three years, expecting to leverage the intellectual property (IP) it created while working with customers, to clock in revenue.

CEO & MD CP Gurnani said that the product and platform business has already touched approximately $450 million in revenue and the company expects it to grow to about $1 billion in less than three years.

The IT services firm’s management was speaking at its Investor Day in Pune on March 3.

Gurnani said, “We are creating two new streams of business: products and platforms and co-creation with customers. These will be a big growth opportunity for us.”

Further, Manish Vyas, CEO of network services at Tech Mahindra laid down the company’s strategic roadmap to build on the product and platform business.

He said, “Platform going forward will be an essential element of how we will differentiate as a company across industries and lines of businesses. It is driven by the success we saw in the last 12 months. We expect the business to grow 2X or more in the next 3 years.”

“After a few years of R&D and experiments, we figured out how to build a world-class platform and what problems we want to solve,” he added.

Next month, the company will be launching Comviva 2.0 platform to bring most of its capabilities under one roof including engineering capabilities.

According to Vyas, this gives the company a huge differentiator to continue innovating on its IP that was built and gathered over 30 years of working with its customers. He said it will not only bring advantage and revenue to the company but also provide value to the same customers.

Products built so far

Tech Mahindra already has a bunch of products and platforms across levels and use cases, some of which have started seeing traction. netOps.ai, SaaS-based BSS platform BlueMarble, cognitive platform for transforming field operations Yantra.ai, integrated cloud platform Cloud BlazeTech, aftermarket platform manufacturing offering Afteaze, customer value management platform MobiLytix, cloud lending and saving platform YABX and digital payment gateway Mobiquity to name a few.",386,0.9999178051948547

IT services company Tech Mahindra on Friday said it will invest up to Rs 700 crore in the newly carved out division of products and platforms in the next two years.

The Mahindra group company is already present in the products and platforms business with its acquisition of the telecom sector-focused Comviva and other offerings which are delivering an annual revenue run rate of USD 450 million, company's chief executive and managing director C P Gurnani said.

""In the next two-three years, we are aiming to take the revenue from products and platforms to USD 1 billion,"" he told PTI in a virtual interaction in Pune after making the announcement about the new division at 'investor day'.

The investment in the new division, to be led by Gurugram-headquartered Comviva's team, will be Rs 500-700 crore over the next two-and-half years, Gurnani said.

The Comviva team, which also has presence in Bhubaneswar and Bengaluru, has been tasked with leading the entire products and platforms play, he said.

Apart from telecom, Tech M's products and platforms also extends to the banking, financial services and insurance vertical and other sectors in the enterprise business at present, he said, adding that Comviva's standalone contribution to the USD 450 million pie will be about USD 200 million.

Company's president for corporate development Vivek Agarwal said the company will be leveraging on existing customers who will form the first of the clients for the products and platforms offerings, and also the embedded domain knowledge it has earned by working for customers.

He also said the products and platforms play will help expand the margins for the company, which has been aspiring to improve on profitability for some time now.

Gurnani said the investments are not very significant and will be made using its existing balance sheet strength, and added that the investments will be in technology, which will involve research and development tools and creation of labs.

It will be getting people internally, and also hiring specialized talent with domain expertise from outside for the new division, he added.

The new division will also be working with other companies in the diversified Mahindra group, which can yield sector-specific solutions, Gurnani said.

Apart from the new products and platforms division, Gurnani also said the company is aiming to increase the overall revenue contribution from partnerships to the industry average of 40 per cent in a year's time from the present 30 per cent.

It has created a road map for the same in coordination with its technology partners SAP, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, Gurnani said.

Tech Mahindra will also focus on co-creation with customers, he said, pointing out that it has agreed to create solutions with a Japanese customer which can help the broader auto industry worldwide as well.

It will also be working with other companies in the group on this aspect of co-creation, he added.

Speaking to investors earlier in the day, its chief financial officer Rohit Anand said the company will be focusing on organic growth, margin expansion and driving portfolio synergies in the future.

Its business head for Business Process Services Birendra Sen said generative artificial intelligence platforms like ChatGPT will not have a major impact on the business.

Tech Mahindra CEO and MD CP Gurnani said that the IT services firm's clients have not refused a price increase for their projects despite facing macroeconomic challenges. Gurnani further said that by working as 'partners' the company has been able to come up with strategies to overcome financial constraints their clients may have.

He was speaking to journalists on the sidelines of the company's Investor Day in Pune on March 3.

“We think of ourselves as partners to our clients and not vendors. We went to about 100 clients last year saying things are becoming tougher. Decisions may have been delayed by a few months, but every client has respected that our costs have gone up. We sat across and said if we can only spending Rs 100, let’s try to find a way out to manage in that budget,” Gurnani said to the media on the sidelines of the company's Investor Day in Pune.

“Nobody has denied price increase to us on the account of inflation; because it’s a partnership. We may close down on a few projects due to budgetary targets but those are different clients,” he added.

Gurnani also said that he is not worried about a large portion of vendor consolidation deals going to certain larger IT services peers because Tech Mahindra has a strong grip on deals coming from the niche technologies in which it specialises. This comes at a time when other Indian IT service providers are increasingly talking about vendor consolidation and cost-takeout deals as clients tighten their tech budgets.

“Certain cases for us are much more stronger than many other players in the industry. Where our chances to win are stronger, obviously we like to play making our clients more successful. Hence I don’t think we are impacted by not getting vendor consolidation deals,” he said addressing queries on vendor consolidation deal wins.

During the company's investor presentation, Gurnani also said that digital innovation and business transformation remain a ""big conversation"" and area of interest among its clients.

Two of the largest luxury brands in the world, two of the largest retailers and two large telcos have signed with Tech Mahindra lately, the company said.

On telecom business

Tech Mahindra has been going big on 5G technology and related services. Gurnani highlighted that while 5G is still a work in progress, the company has been able to deliver $1 billion in revenue in 5G per year.

Known predominantly for its telecom vertical, the company is also trying to diversify and change the portfolio mix of segments over time given the changing regulatory environment and other challenges coming in different geographies globally in the telecom space.

At present, about 41 percent of Tech Mahindra’s business is from telecom and balance 60 percent from enterprise business.

“We are number 3rd on growth metrics (as per top quartile growth since FY2020). We are going strong, but we have hit a few speed breakers. Tech Mahindra was primarily into telecom. We have reached 90 countries and work with the top 2-3 telecom players in each of these markets. It came with its own set of challenges. Over a period of time we have worked to change the portfolio mix,” Gurnani said.

“Resilience for us come from the fact that when our telecom clients want to expand globally, we are already present in 90 countries,” he added.

Will generative AI be a speed breaker?

Business Process Services (BPS) has been one of the company’s strongest growth engines for the company over the last two and half years, Gurnani said.

BPS year-to-date has added $700 million in TCV, which has been the highest ever, said Birendra Sen, Business Head, Business Process Services at Tech Mahindra. Within BPS, there are three verticals with over $100 million runrate mark.

Speaking on business getting disrupted by ChatGPT and generative AI, Sen said, “Consider generative AI is like a six-year-old, it has a lot to learn. It will learn from humans. By the time it comes to defining work, future of work there’s time to go. In the near term we don’t see any impact on business, particularly on BPS side. In fact, there’s an upside. Most generative AI bots right now needs human in the loop to train, monitor, correct and disciplined.”

Tech Mahindra is already seeing traction on the hi-tech side, and are engaging with large clients.

Growth in engineering and metaverse

About 85 percent of 5G devices in the US are assured by Tech Mahindra. The company also helped a leading OEM in Europe to report 250 percent growth through seven major programmes engineered end-to-end by Tech Mahindra.

In the past few months, the company expanded its global delivery channels. Tech Mahindra also won the first metaverse development engineering programme recently.

It currently has 70-80 active metaverse deals, Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy officer and head of growth at Tech Mahindra had said to Moneycontrol in February.

Tech Mahindra is also in the process of engineering the first cognitive city in the world.

IT company Tech Mahindra expects to soon hit USD 7 billion revenue run rate for current fiscal year, out of which the telecom vertical is estimated to contribute USD 3 billion, a top official of the company said on Monday.

Tech Mahindra Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer CP Gurnani told PTI that the company has hit a run rate of USD 1 billion (about Rs 8,300 crore), from 5G solutions that it provides to telecom companies.

""We are at an annual revenue run rate of USD 6.6 billion. We expect to reach USD 7 billion run rate for this fiscal. Telecom vertical is expected to contribute USD 3 billion in this. We have already touched a revenue run rate of USD 1 billion from 5G services,"" Gurnani said at Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2023.

Tech Mahindra posted a 5 per cent decline in consolidated profit after tax at Rs 1,297 crore for December quarter. Revenue from operations, however, increased 20 per cent to Rs 13,734.6 crore from Rs 11,451 crore a year ago.

Tech Mahindra President, Communications, Media and Entertainment Business, and CEO, Network Services, Manish Vyas said 50 per cent of the company's business comes from the America region, 30 per cent from Europe and 20 per cent from rest of the world.

""We believe this trend will continue because we have invested in these geographies. All the sectors within telcos, be it growth of fiber, fixed wireless, new product build and all the transformation on the digital side, have continued to provide us growth,"" he said.

Talking about the impact of the global macroeconomic situation on the company, Vyas said uncertainty still remains across the globe and there will be an intense pressure on cost of services.

""The overall macroeconomic situation still remains uncertain. People will need to conserve as we go forward. It is an important opportunity for us to continue to drive cost optimization through simplification. The broad macroeconomic situation also will evolve as we come out of this uncertain time. People will need to continue to innovate more. Particularly with the whole focus on generative AI as well as the way metaverse will be used by enterprises,"" he said.

Vyas said that globally the company has acquired 42 new logos this year to whom it is providing network transformation including solutions for private 5G networks.

""It is essentially a network on cloud, software defined network and private network. The growth driver has been a requirement of enterprises to simplify their operations and modernise tracking of their business data,"" he said.

Gurnani said several companies are engaging with Tech Mahindra to simplify, modernise and monetise their networks, and rollout of 5G network across the globe will continue to drive business of the company.

""We are very keen to look at how the rollout of 5G and deployments will happen. It is a big year from a deployment standpoint. It is a big year for modernisation of the digital stack. I think telcos will look to find adjacencies with fintech, learning, manufacturing, IoT etc for growth. We are very excited about 2023. There are a lot of case studies that will emerge in all these areas,"" Vyas said.",544,0.06483763456344604

Earlier this week, Moneycontrol had reported that the big three cloud-service providers -- Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platforms (GCP) – together reported a single-digit YoY growth in deal wins by annual contract value (ACV) in Q4CY2022.

This has been a fall from a 57 percent YoY growth in ACV in Q1. Revenue growth, too, has been steadily declining consequently.

This, however, won’t have much of an impact on IT services companies, despite them working closely with these cloud-service providers, industry experts told Moneycontrol.

The current slowdown, following the past couple of years of aggressive pandemic-driven cloud and digital transformation spending, will get compensated with the phase two transformation projects involving implementation and cost optimisation, they said, amidst clients rethinking technology budgets due to inflation and increasing macro-economic challenges globally.

According to Sanjay Jalona, an industry veteran and former CEO and Managing Director of L&T Infotech (LTI), there is a lot of work to be done, now that client companies have made quite some investments in hyperscalers.

Jalona, currently the operating partner at ChrysCapital, said: “I believe there is a lot of work to be done for all the investments clients have already made with hyperscalers. Though the growth rate would probably be a bit soft, I think the growth rate on cloud would continue for IT companies.”

Pareekh Jain, founder and CEO, EIIRTrend, said that, in the last fiscal year, every digital deal involved cloud migration as a part of it. And currently, almost 40-50 percent of the active deals for IT service providers are digital.

Lots of existing cloud-migration clients still there

So, even if new cloud migration deals are not happening, there are still plenty of customers who have already migrated to cloud and want to move to the next level.

“Adding new customers for migration will be on a pause. But existing customers who have already migrated to cloud will continue to extend deals with service providers to implement and optimise for them,” Jain said.

There will still be some impact on budgets for IT services but the impact would be lesser, he said.

“We are seeing a decline in growth rate, YoY, but hyperscalers are still growing. This will impact our IT service providers too. Clients were spending a lot on cloud earlier and then service deals were coming to service providers. As clients relook at cloud spend, they will relook at the services spend also, but to a lesser extent,” he told Moneycontrol.

Speaking about the nature of deals being observed, Mrinal Rai, Principal analyst at ISG, said IT companies are helping clients design their strategies and consulting on how to move those workloads.

“This is the time when those enterprise clients are actually implementing these strategies. So there is enough work around cost optimization, retransformation and refactoring, which will require a lot of expertise,” he said.

Many of these would fall under the core managed services practice of outsourcing the responsibility for maintaining, and anticipating the need for a range of processes and functions, among other facilities, provided by IT services companies.

All of this does echo the words of the IT industry too. Last month, in an interview with Moneycontrol, Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO and MD of TCS, highlighted that there has been mindless spending on cloud lately, and that this will lead to specific project-led cloud spending by companies to bring down cloud costs. IT companies, especially TCS, will benefit from this trend too, he said.

""Once you have done the architecture, it actually unleashes a second round of transformation, which is the right reason to go to cloud. You can open up your architecture for much more composable functionality so that as your business model shifts, you will be able to move faster with it, or your upgrade cycles will be faster,” Gopinathan had said.

During its earnings meeting last month, Infosys’ CEO and MD Salil Parekh, too, said that the company’s large deal pipeline is seeing increased traction for automation and cost-efficiency programmes.

According to Forrester Research India’s Head of Research Ashutosh Sharma, IT services firms have a very good portfolio of projects across dimensions and they specialise in cost reduction.

“Any company trying to cut down their on-site costs, cost of IT in other geographies, and offshoring will come to IT companies. They compute and analyse data as well. IT companies have always benefited from these downtrends,” he said.

“But this will depend on the extent of downtrend that will occur and how much the clients will cut down from discretionary spending,” he added.

Queries sent to Infosys and HCLTech did not elicit any response. TCS, Wipro, TechMahindra, Cognizant and LTIMindtree declined to comment.

Not all gloom

It’s not all gloom ultimately for cloud-service providers either, said Amit Chandra, Deputy Vice President, HDFC Securities. Despite the slowdown in YoY growth percentage, the base of comparison has increased as the combined size of the three hyperscalers have grown $100 billion to $200 billion, according to Chandra.

Several companies, including IT companies like HCLTech, TCS and LTIMindtree, remain bullish on the opportunities expected from cloud in 2024. Chandra added that managed services growth rates too have not come down significantly.

“AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, combined, is a business of about $200 billion in size. The growth rate of over 35-40 percent has come down to 25-26 percent. One needs to see what incremental revenue they are adding,” he said.

“Earlier, when they were growing at 40-50 percent, the size of the top three players together was sub-$100 billion. They were adding $30-40 billion, incrementally. Now at a size of $200 billion, if they are growing at 25 percent, they are still adding $40-50 billion, and the incremental revenue still remains the same,” he explained.",1003,0.3996569335460663

The Nifty IT index has been soaring over the past three trading sessions. It gained 1 percent on February 14, about 1.13 percent on February 15 and 1.71 percent on February 16, with all stocks fuelling the benchmark index higher.

The S&P BSE IT Index has also rallied in tandem, gaining over 3 percent in the past three sessions.

Tech Mahindra and Tata Consultancy Services have been the top gainers among the large-caps, while stock-specific developments propelled the share prices of smaller companies Nucleus Software and Tanla Platforms higher.

A set of in-line quarterly results, moderate deal wins, and ‘buy on dips’ seem to be aiding the sector, analysts said. The Nifty IT index, which was among the worst sectoral performers in 2022, is up over 7 percent for the year, while the benchmark Nifty 50 is down 1 percent.

“A recession view for the developed markets, which was a consensus a few months ago, still holds but with reduced intensity,” Kotak Securities said in a recent report.

Majority of IT companies' revenue is derived from the Americas, and retail sector is the largest business segment for these players followed by financial services. ""The US retail sales data print this week showed a stark recovery which has supported the IT stocks, and additionally, interest rates seem to be nearing their peak with most of the hikes behind us,"" Sreeram Ramdas, vice president at Green Portfolio, said.

Billion dollar deals

Though fears of recession in the US and Europe and reduced client spending continue linger, several large-cap IT companies signed billion-dollar deals in Q3.

According to Bernstein Research, “There is now a divergence of execution between large-caps and mid-caps as large deals intensity has started picking up with clients focusing on vendor consolidation.”

Vendor consolidation means reducing the number of external suppliers to a handful of trusted partners.

In Q3, Wipro signed 11 large deals with a total contract value of over $1 billion. Infosys signed 32 large deals worth $3.3 billion last quarter, the highest in eight quarters. The total contract value for TCS was steady at $7.8 billion.

The Tata group IT firm recently announced a £600-million contract with the UK-based Phoenix Group, which was the largest for TCS in this financial year and its largest in the UK after three years.

Margin recovery

Most IT companies reported sequential improvement in margins in Q3.

According to Moody’s, improving employee utilisation from hiring in prior years and steadily declining attrition will likely arrest further margin pressure.

For stocks under Jefferies’ coverage, aggregate margins recovered by 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 20.6 percent. Midsized firms fared worse, with their aggregate margins down 130 basis points QoQ against a 70 basis point expansion by large-sized IT firms.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Large-caps remain favourites

The Street anticipates the slowdown in global IT spending at about 3-4 percent against 6 percent and 8 percent in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In this backdrop, large-cap IT companies will emerge as winners as there is an “extraordinarily high barrier to sign large deals,” Bernstein said.

“Only six-eight players can compete and win. The ability to structure large billion-dollar deals requires deep understanding of the new technology stack, strengths in integrated service lines, which only large IT services players can provide,” the firm said.

Infosys remains the top pick for analysts and brokerage houses, given its superior revenue growth. Moody’s expects 13 percent revenue growth for Infosys compared to 8 percent revenue growth for TCS in FY23. Moreover, Infosys surprised investors by raising its revenue growth guidance during the Q3 results announcement.

For Jefferies, Infosys is the only pick in the sector. Bernstein analysts have ‘outperform’ ratings on TCS and Tech Mahindra too. They like TCS for its billion-dollar deal playbook and Tech Mahindra for its reasonable valuation. They have ‘market-perform’ ratings for Wipro and HCL Technologies.

Word of caution

The Nifty IT is trading at an above-average premium of 25 percent to the Nifty and valuations remain rich, Jefferies said. It has a cautious stance on the sector.

Kotak Securities said a deep recession is not fully priced in.

“The stocks are at an interesting juncture—moderate upside if it is just a slowdown in developed economies, moderate downside in case of a recession,” it said in a recent report.

Tech Mahindra shares rallied almost 6 percent on February 15 amid directionless trade in the benchmark Nifty 50.

The stock traded near the high of the previous month. On the technical daily charts, it formed a robust bullish candlestick pattern after several months, on big volumes. The stock made a higher high and higher low formation for the second consecutive session.

Further, it has broken out nicely from a long downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining the highs of September 12, 2022, and January 24, 2023, while taking support at the upward sloping support trendline adjoining lows at multiple touchpoints since January 6, 2023.

The stock rallied 5.86 percent to close at Rs 1,071.4 on the NSE, the biggest single-day gain since July 30, 2021.

The rally took the stock into the momentum zone of the Bollinger band with expansion on both sides. Experts said if the stock crosses the 200-day EMA (exponential moving average) of Rs 1,094, it could rally further.

Currently, Tech Mahindra shares are trading above key moving averages (5, 9, 21, 50 and 100-day EMA as well as 200 DMA), which is also a positive indication, outperforming even the Nifty IT index that was up 1 percent.

“Tech Mahindra has been a laggard in the Nifty IT pack and has undergone a nine-month time correction. The rally in the stock today is aided by volumes and the stock is trading around its previous month's high,” said Viraj Vyas of Ashika Stock Broking.

Vyas said if the stock sustains above Rs 1,075, it will stage a breakout and if assisted by volumes, it can target Rs 1,100-1,120 first, after which it can head towards the Rs 1,200 mark.

Vidnyan Sawant, AVP technical research at GEPL Capital, said the stock has immediate resistance at the Rs 1,080 level and if it sustains above that level then the stock will move towards Rs 1,125-1,165 in the short to medium term.

Earnings front

The IT services provider reported earnings on January 30 that were better than analyst expectations, with consolidated profit growing 0.9 percent sequentially to Rs 1,296.6 crore and revenue increasing by 4.6 percent to Rs 13,734.6 crore for the quarter ended December.

Revenue growth in dollar terms was 1.8 percent and in constant currency terms 0.2 percent on a sequential basis.

The company’s operating performance was strong. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation climbed 8 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 2,144 crore, with a margin expansion of 50 bps over the previous quarter.

“The numbers reflect resilience as we continue to work on the expansion of operating margin,” said Rohit Anand, chief financial officer at Tech Mahindra.

Tech Mahindra is building a robust pipeline of metaverse deals, betting big on its uses in the 5G era, a top executive said, even as clients increasingly rethink and reduce spending on futuristic technologies that are at the exploratory stages because of macroeconomic challenges.

The company currently has 70-80 active metaverse deals, Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy officer and head of growth at Tech Mahindra, told Moneycontrol.

“We launched very big on metaverse in Barcelona last year. And our opportunity today is extremely strong. One of the most robust pipelines for us is being built around the metaverse. Then again, even metaverse without a 5G network doesn't work. So we're investing across the board on all 5G and 5G-related end-use cases and applications,” Mitra said.

Tech Mahindra’s active metaverse deals have brought in order bookings worth “triple-digit millions,” Mitra said, without divulging the exact figures.

In October, Tech Mahindra said it was on track to achieve about $1 billion in revenue by the end of FY23 from 5G projects alone, which includes metaverse deals.

There is demand for metaverse and other futuristic projects from across sectors including banking, financial services, manufacturing, telecom, media, entertainment, healthcare and life sciences. The metaverse is a virtual, immersive environment that facilitates digital interactions.

Client priorities

Addressing the issue of hesitancy among companies to spend on exploratory metaverse and Web3 projects amid fears of a global recession, Mitra said that it will depend on what the client is using it for. The technology in itself is not what is being shut off, but the kind of applications it is needed for.

“Things like metaverse, AI, things like the work that we're doing around AR/VR and quantum will get us deals depending on what the (client) priorities are. The priorities now are more towards cost transformation and a little focus around customer experience and moving towards the cloud,” he said.

On the 5G side, Tech Mahindra wants to steer the narrative towards connectivity, engineering, cloud and sustainability – the key pillars on which the company builds its solutions.

Cloud adoption

In December, Tech Mahindra launched Cloud Blazetech platform that Mitra said will help the company tap the next phase of cloud opportunities.

“The first phase was about migrating things. Now the movement has become about applications,” he said. “The basics have been done, the cloud has been established, enterprise business applications have improved. Now, industrial applications are getting developed. That's how we are positioning our play.”

Mitra expects cloud applications in areas such as customer connect, production, manufacturing, banking, and healthcare-related solutions.

Automation over hiring

Tech Mahindra reported the highest headcount reduction among IT companies in the third quarter of FY23, down by 6,844 from the previous quarter.

Mitra said this did not reflect a softening of demand but an increase in automation, which required fewer employees. He added that demand continues to remain strong so far.

“We definitely feel that more and more automation, more and more technology, more and more process automation type of work will take precedence over the work that we're doing, and that's going to be the future. So that's more the reason for the headcount to have rationalised, rather than slowing demand. It's more technology and customer demand in terms of areas of work that we are delivering,” Mitra said.",560,0.6728420768465314

India’s IT companies did not have major demands from the 2023 union budget, with asks primarily focused on the ease of doing business. Barring a few niggles, the National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) — the industry body — was satisfied with what the budget delivered.

Companies in the sector cheered the budget, and termed it positive from a technology sector perspective.

As part of her speech for this sector, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman focussed on skilling, 5G, as well as artificial intelligence (AI).

The announcements

The FM said that 100 labs will be set up in engineering institutions to develop applications using 5G services to realise new opportunities, business models, as well as employment opportunities. “The labs will cover, among others, applications such as smart classrooms, precision farming, intelligent transport systems, and health care applications,” she said.

She added that three centres of excellence (CoE) for AI will be set up in top educational institutions. “Leading industry players will partner in conducting interdisciplinary research, and develop cutting-edge applications and scalable solutions in the areas of agriculture, health, and sustainable cities,” she added.

The government also plans to set up a scheme — the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.0 — to skill youth in the next three years.

“On-job training, industry partnership, and alignment of courses with industry needs will be emphasised. The scheme will also cover new-age courses for Industry 4.0, like coding, AI, robotics, mechatronics, IOT (internet of things), 3D printing, drones, and soft skills. To skill youth for international opportunities, 30 Skill India International Centres will be set up across different states,” the Finance Minister stated.

What NASSCOM thinks

In a statement, NASSCOM said that the budget focused on three key transformational trends that will help India build its competitive advantage — digital transformation, energy transformation, and supply chain resilience. “The budget outlines India’s plan to become an engine for global growth and deploy digital technology to lead India’s development,” it said.

It added that the budget called out the role of technology in almost all major announcements, and that the creation of 5G labs “will further help in opening newer avenues and opportunities, scaling up new business models and employment prospects.

“The government’s focus on not just building COEs to drive AI development in India, but also on making AI and data work for India will be critical in building the core design principles of AI innovation for a diverse nation like India,” NASSCOM said.

In a discussion with NASSCOM President Debjani Ghosh, the industry body’s Public Policy head, Ashish Aggarwal, pointed out one concern that could impact IT companies.

Since a lot of IT companies work out of Special Economic Zones (SEZ), a change proposed in the Finance Bill, 2023, is that foreign exchange earnings have to be brought back into the country within six months. This, Aggarwal said, is something that needs to be discussed and analysed from an industry point of view as it could be a challenge.

Among NASSCOM’s asks was a timeline for the conclusion of advance pricing agreements, which are used to resolve transfer pricing issues before a transaction takes place. Aggarwal said that on that front, the budget’s focus on addressing the backlog of appeals is going to be very useful.

“We had asked them to put a binding timeline, but they're putting their efforts into building capacity to handle these cases. I think that's very good,’’ he said.

Company reactions

Tata Consultancy Services CEO Rajesh Gopinathan said that the budget builds on the government’s focus on enhancing digital infrastructure.

“The provisions for research in AI and 5G implementation, and the government's vision of Make AI in India and Make AI Work for India are commendable. Bringing in the National Data Governance policy is also a welcome step. Overall, it's a forward-looking budget that will fortify the digital spine of the country,” he said.

Accenture India Chairperson Rekha Menon said that there was a strong focus on the knowledge economy with technology as the bedrock for boosting socio-economic growth and green development.

“While agriculture, healthcare, and sustainable cities are the current focus of the CoEs, India has multidimensional potential – AI can add an estimated $450-$500 billion to India’s GDP by 2025, more than 60 percent of which will be from four key sectors – financial services, consumer packaged goods & retail, healthcare, and industrials & automotive. India will need to continue to invest in these CoEs to keep pace with the evolving asks across all sectors,” she said.

Jagdish Mitra, Chief Strategy Officer, Tech Mahindra, called it a positive budget from a technology sector perspective, and added that it sends the right message about 5G labs, AI CoEs, and the focus around skilling. This, he said, “is absolutely the key need for the country as we live through the Prime Minister’s vision of technology being the core enabler.”

He also said it was commendable that steps were taken around the ease of doing business.

SAP Labs India SVP and MD Sindhu Gangadharan said that the budget underlines the imperative of job creation and youth upliftment through the PM Kaushal Vikas Yojana 4.

“In line with this, the establishment of 30 Skill India International Centres across states will be critical to developing and nurturing the digital talent pool in the country. Additionally, the launch of the National Data Governance Policy and three CoEs for AI are initiatives that will help further cement India’s position as the global innovation hub. In fact, the launch of 5G labs will create new avenues of opportunities through the network’s rapid and efficient expansion,” she said.

WNS Group CEO Keshav Murugesh also said that the establishment of three CoEs for AI, and the National Data Governance policy “will strengthen India’s position as a global innovation hub.” He added that the launch of 5G labs will act as a catalyst to drive faster and better expansion of the network, creating more avenues for innovation.

L&T Tech Services CEO Amit Chadha said that the budget has focussed on boosting digital infra and adoption, which he termed a positive sign for the tech industry.

“As a pure-play ER&D services provider, our belief is that such mass enablement of digital transformation and innovation will unlock the full potential of the Indian engineering and technology sector, helping the country maintain its position as a globally preferred destination for engineering services,” he said.

LTIMindtree CEO Debashis Chatterjee said that the budget underscores the growing significance of cloud, data, AI, and other new-age technologies in governance, “while also taking a big step forward in simplifying processes and improving the ease of doing business.”

“The budget’s emphasis on digitisation and trust-based governance will open new opportunities for the IT sector to leverage its globally-acknowledged technology strengths to make a difference here,” he said.

He added that industry players partnering with educational institutions for interdisciplinary research and AI and 5G applications will create “a win-win proposition for both.”

“Building upon the earlier vision with a more structured development of Tier 2 and 3 cities, the budget will further enhance our ability to capitalise on an expanded talent pool, which is vital to the long-term sustainability and scalability of the IT services industry in India. Overall, the budget underscores India’s potential of becoming a global benchmark in technology-led transformation,” he said.",1247,0.7783386613193312

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

TECHM reported revenue of USD1.67b in 3QFY23, up 0.2% QoQ in CC terms (in line). Reported growth was 1.8% QoQ, led by Retail (+6.0 QoQ) and Technology (+3.3% QoQ). BFSI (-0.5% QoQ) and Manufacturing (flat QoQ) were soft. EBIT margin rose 60bp QoQ to 12% (vs our estimate of 11.6%). Q3 revenue softness was anticipated due to extended furloughs and the ongoing account pruning exercise to weed out low-margin and non-strategic accounts. Management indicated a total annualized impact of USD100-120m in FY23 from the exercise, which is now half completed. Additionally, top-5 accounts also remained soft due to internal restructuring at a key client, leading to slow ramp-ups and slow deal closure activities in Q3.

Outlook

We remain on the sidelines on TECHM as we feel the current valuations fairly factor in uncertainties around growth and margin. We marginally tweak our FY23/FY24/FY25 estimates. Our TP implies 15x FY24E EPS. We remain Neutral on the stock with TP of INR 1,020.

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

For Q3FY23, Tech Mahindra reported revenues at $1668 million up 1.8% q-o-q/8.8% y-o-y. However, revenue growth in CC terms stood at 0.2% q-o-q, missed our cc growth estimates of 0.7% q-o-q. EBIT margin at 12% for Q3FY23 was up by ~60 bps q-o-q owing to currency tailwinds, lower employee benefit expenses and lower subcontracting costs which was partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Deal wins picked up with net new deal TCVs at $795 million versus $716 million in Q2FY23. The company’s utilisation rate improved by 100 bps sequentially to 85% while LTM attrition moderated by 300 bps to 17% in Q3FY23 from 20% in Q2FY2023. The management said that, while demand drivers are strong, they are anticipating a slowdown in H1CY23. The company cited that they are witnessing decision making being more spread out. However, they expect a lot more cost take out opportunities fructifying and while they are optimistic on retail and manufacturing, they are seeing tepidness in the Hi-tech vertical.



Outlook

We expect the outlook for FY24 to be uncertain on account of global headwinds and any recovery is most likely to be gradual. While the company has reflected some concerns of delays in decision making, the consistent deal wins and healthy deal pipeline provides decent revenue visibility. Hence, we maintain a Buy rating on Tech Mahindra with unchanged PT of Rs 1220. We advise investors to adopt a staggered approach to invest from long term perspective.

The number of employees in the top five Information Technology services companies — Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCLTech, Wipro, and Tech Mahindra — has declined since the last quarter, the first time since the first quarter of FY 21.

While the companies together added 34,713 employees in the second quarter of financial year 2023, in the third quarter, they lost 4,904. This is a 114 percent dip quarter-on-quarter for the five companies when it comes to net addition.

Headcount addition is considered an indicator of demand in the industry, and the current drop comes as firms go slow on hiring in an increasingly cautious macro environment.

As recession concerns loom in the US and Europe amid interest rate increases to tackle inflation and the war in Ukraine, Indian IT firms are under pressure as Western clients slow discretionary spending.

The companies attributed the lower or negative net headcount addition in the third quarter to talent investments they had made previously, as well as increasing workforce utilisation metrics.

Tech Mahindra, which reported its results on January 30, saw the steepest reduction in headcount among these five companies, ending the quarter with 6,844 fewer employees.

It joined ranks with Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro, which saw a reduction in headcount sequentially by 2,197 and 435 employees respectively.

Past trends

This was the first time in 10 quarters that the headcount at the end of a quarter for TCS and Wipro was lower than in the previous quarter. Tech Mahindra had last seen a decline in Q4 of FY21, which makes this reduction the first in seven quarters.

Infosys and HCLTech, on the other hand, reported a moderate increase in headcount sequentially.

While Infosys saw its headcount go up by 1,627 employees, HCLTech led the pack with an addition of 2,945 employees. This isn’t to say that headcount addition hasn’t slowed for these two companies either.

Since Q1 of FY21, when all companies reported a net reduction in their headcount, their hiring has increased significantly thanks to unprecedented pandemic-accelerated demand for digital transformation.

Tech Mahindra was the aberration, as it saw a reduction in headcount for three quarters in FY21.

Following the reduction in headcount in April-June 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, the net addition of the other four companies increased dramatically between Q2 of FY21 and Q4 of FY22.

IT growth climate

Tech Mahindra’s headcount addition in this fiscal year has been on a downward trajectory, as it added 6,862 employees in Q1FY23 and 5,877 employees in Q2FY23.

CFO Rohit Anand attributed this to the business process services segment and quarterly seasonal rampdown that happened based on the increase last year.

“The current IT growth environment is reflective of this headcount reduction as well as our endeavour to improve our utilisation,"" he said.

Anand told analysts that hiring going forward will be “very closely aligned and monitored with the demand environment that we see.”

The company’s leadership maintained that there may be room to increase utilisation as well, and would focus on getting its to its previous level of 88 percent.

He added that the demand scenario is not as robust as it was two quarters back, and with easing supply-side challenges and uncertainties in the market, Tech Mahindra was trying to hire just in time.

“The macro environment is relatively volatile. So we just want that maybe while we are actioning closer and linking ourselves to the macro environment, the linearity of correlation between headcount and growth is also diluting a little bit,” he said.

Hiring ahead of time

TCS Chief Human Resources Officer Milind Lakkad said the company had invested in talent ahead of time, and it was making them productive, adding that it doesn’t indicate anything on the demand front.

Wipro’s Chief Human Resources Officer Saurabh Govil said the company invested in talent ahead of time and had low utilisation and bench strength.

“We have headspace of four or five percentage points by utilisation. We are hiring and training them and keeping them ready to manage demand. From a supply-chain perspective, we don't see a challenge,” Govil said.

Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said the company wants to ensure that all the talent it has hired is trained and ready to be deployed.

Ramachandran Sundararajan, Chief People Officer at HCL Tech, which saw the highest net addition this quarter, said the hiring was a function of attrition and campus hiring in the previous quarter, when the company took in a higher number of freshers.

Sundararajan added that gross hiring will be moderated when there is a significant drop in attrition, and looking at a one-quarter decline and extrapolating it to future demand may not give the true picture.

No green shoots yet

While company leadership say the environment isn't sombre, data for January 2023 paints a different picture.

According to data from Xpheno’s jobs outlook report for January, the IT services sector saw a 7 percent drop in demand in comparison to December 2022. It had slid for seven months before going up in November.

Xpheno said the IT Services sector registered the second lowest active demand over a 24-month period, with 65,000 active job openings at the end of the month.

The lowest was in October 2022, at 60,000. On a year-on-year basis as well, the sector had its second sharpest drop as available jobs in January 2023 were 49.5 percent fewer than in January 2022.

With the drop in volume, Xpheno said the IT services sector’s contribution to overall job openings continues to be below the 30 percent mark for the fourth month.

“With just 23 percent contribution to Active Jobs, IT Services sector continues to lose its dominating spot in the Industry wise contribution mix,” Xpheno said.

Anil Ethanur, the co-founder of Xpheno, said the local hiring patterns of the tech sector has been sensitive to the layoff trends over the last quarter.

“The gradual drop in hiring demand in Indian Tech Sector has been largely correctional, but currently entering a phase of negative impact if further sustained. On the talent acquisition front, the tech sector cannot afford to be in an uncontrolled downslope for long,” he said.

Ethanur added that while the tech sector braces for more impact of global economic movements, there is also light at the end of the tunnel as “downturns overseas tend to drive more jobs to Indian shores.”

“The current quarter will be a critical wait-and-watch quarter not just for tech but all sectors and the talent in them,” he said.",1086,-0.5748047977685928

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post December quarter earnings:

Nomura

The broking house has kept the 'buy' rating on the stock with a target at Rs 1,260 per share as the revenue was largely in-line, while modest beat on margin front.

The demand moderation and flattish TTM deal wins to weigh on growth in FY24, with TTM TCV of deal wins flat YoY, while H1CY23 likely to be challenging.

The margin has expanded in Q3 and there are enough levers to continue expansion, reported CNBC-TV18.

Morgan Stanley

The research firm has maintained the 'overweight' rating on the stock with a target at Rs 1,120 per share as the Q3 revenue is weaker than expectations and other peers as well.

Despite a sharp decline in attrition rates, margin improvement was soft on QoQ basis. The management commentary on demand was muted, reported CNBC-TV18.

Motilal Oswal

Maintain 'neutral' rating on the stock

Although its current performance remains muted, company's high exposure to the Communications vertical offers a potential opportunity, as a broader 5G rollout can result in a new spending cycle in this space

Near-term growth remains weak and we await greater comfort on margins, said brokerage firm.

Nirmal Bang

Maintains ‘sell’ rating on the stock, target Rs 875

3QFY23 revenue performance was the weakest among the Tier 1 peer set

Post 3QFY23, broking house tweaked its FY24-FY26 EPS estimates modestly

IT services firm Tech Mahindra's Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer CP Gurnani urged his management team to meet every month instead of quarterly basis to respond to the market trends, amidst macro-economic uncertainties. While the executive remains on bullish on the overall demand environment, decision making by clients is taking time, he said while reporting the company's Q3 earnings numbers.

During its Q3FY23 earnings announcement on January 30, Gurnani said: ""Given the current environment, I expect Tech Mahindra to be an agile organisation. By an agile organisation I mean, budgeting, hiring and overall management of operational metrics will be discussed every month. I expect the management to meet every month and respond to the market trends, instead of every quarter.""

The IT services firm reported net new deal wins worth $795 million for the third quarter ended December 31, 2022, up by 13 percent YoY. This was driven by deal wins in the cloud engineering, healthcare and telecom segments.

Net new deal wins stood at $704 million in the same quarter last fiscal year. Sequentially, deal wins were up by 11.03 percent from $716 million in the last quarter.

In Q3FY23, Tech Mahindra for the first time reported $1 billion in quarterly revenue from its Enterprise vertical. Known predominantly for its Communications, Media and Entertainment (CME) vertical, the company called this a milestone for the quarter. CME, meanwhile, clocked $665 million in quarterly revenue.

Gurnani said, “CME has grown 1.9 percent QoQ, and enterprise has grown 1.8 percent QoQ. Our BPO business continues to be the largest and fastest growing business, having a growth of about 21 percent in Q3. The BPO sector has had a very strong quarterly performance.”

He added, “Considering that there was a soft macro environment, geopolitical winds are not settled and it is traditionally a slow quarter, I am happy with Tech Mahindra’s Q3 performance. I can attribute this to our focus in customer experience management, customer centricity and investments in 5G, and overall CME continuing to pivot the growth.”

Rohit Anand, CFO, Tech Mahindra added, ""Within the Enterprise vertical some of the sub-segments driving the growth are hi-tech; and verticals around retail, transport, logistics and manufacturing have come back to growth after few quarters of tepid performance.”

Gurnani believes while the demand remains strong, the decision making will be slow overall among clients, especially in the areas of discretionary spending.

In a separate statement, Gurnani had called out the moderation in growth in the quarter due to tough macro-economic environment.

Speaking with Moneycontrol earlier this month during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Gurnani had said that based on his client conversations and 50-odd meetings that he attended, he didn’t particularly expect the way forward to be negative thoug,h he’ll remain cautious.

“In terms of how positive it would be, a lot depends on the way US Fed would react. There is always more than one layer that you need to unpeel because ultimately corporates do depend on some indications from the US. Otherwise, the mood looks moderately positive,” he said.",536,0.3035271217425664

Operating numbers beat estimates. The IT services company has clocked a 0.9% sequential growth in consolidated profit at Rs 1,297 crore for quarter ended December FY23, with revenue rising 4.6% QoQ to Rs 13,735 crore, beating analysts' estimates. Revenue in dollar terms grew by 1.8% QoQ to $1,668 million with constant currency revenue growth at 0.2%. Operating numbers were ahead of expectations while deal wins at $795 million for the quarter.

IT services firm Tech Mahindra's employee headcount declined by 6,844 in the third quarter ended December 31, 2022, joining peers such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro, as software firms go slow on hiring in an increasingly cautious macro environment.

The total headcount for Q3 stood at 157,068, down 4.2 percent from 163,912 in the quarter ended September. A similar trend was noticed with peers TCS and Wipro too in Q3, whose headcount dropped by 2,197 and 435, respectively.

Tech Mahindra's attrition rate (last twelve month basis) plunged to 17 percent in Q3FY23, down from 20 percent in the September quarter. The rate was also down from 24 percent in the year-ago quarter.

The firm has been seeing a drop in attrition rate since the first quarter of FY23 after a steady increase in the five quarters before that.

The company added 5,877 new staff in Q2FY23 and 3,874 in Q3FY23.

Rohit Anand, CFO, Tech Mahindra said, ""For the last three quarters, we have reduced attrition rates based on our internal actions and market behaviour. We take this metric very seriously. We are now looking at having the the lowest attrition rate in the industry.""

""If you see, the headcount has gone down QoQ. Most of this was on the back of BPS (business process services) segment and quarterly seasonal ramp down that happened based on the increase that was there last year. The current IT growth environment is reflective of this headcount reduction as well as our endeavour to improve our utilisation,"" he added.

Vivek Agarwal, President – BFSI, HLS and Corporate Development, Tech Mahindra said, ""We can continue to be better performers of attrition rate in the industry and this is due to the steps we have taken in the last three-four quarters from retention perspective. But clearly the demand scenario is not as robust as it was two quarters back, hence we have already read about the hi-tech companies becoming more cautious on hiring, and that is easing supply side challenges to a large extent.""

""So given the uncertainties in the market, we are trying out just in time hiring,"" he added.

Speaking to Moneycontrol earlier this month at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, CEO and MD CP Gurnani said that when the attrition was higher, so was the hiring and vice versa in the current situation.

“Hiring cannot always be linear. The reality is that AI, data, and automation are part of our lives. If it is not linear, revenue goes up. If you don't hire, please do take into account that we are becoming more efficient with automation,” he had said.

Tech Mahindra over the past quarter has also been facing backlash along with peers like Wipro for delaying onboarding and absorbing freshers who have been waiting for nearly two years since graduation.",562,-0.2178191082044081

Tech Mahindra on January 30 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,297 crore for the December quarter of the financial year 2022-23, down 5.3 percent. Profit after tax (PAT) stood at Rs 1,368 crore in the year-ago period.

The revenue from operations came in at Rs 13,735 crore, rising 19.9 percent from Rs 11,450 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, the information technology services firm said in an exchange filing.

While revenue beat expectations, net profit was slightly below Street's forecast.

An average of estimates of five brokerages polled by Moneycontrol had expected PAT to rise 3.8 percent on a sequential basis but decline 0.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 1,359 crore. Consolidated revenue, in rupee terms, was seen increasing 18 percent YoY and 3.7 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 13,612 crore.

EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) for the quarter came in at Rs 2,144 crore, higher by 8.1 percent sequentially and 4.1 percent YoY.

“We are witnessing moderation in growth given the tough macroeconomic environment. We will continue to work with our customers to pre-empt their technological requirements and identify, new demand drivers, especially for digital services,"" CP Gurnani, managing director & chief executive officer, Tech Mahindra said.

Net new deal wins for the quarter came in at $795 million, higher than $704 million in the year-ago period. IT attrition moderated to 17 percent from 20 percent in Q2 FY23 and 24 percent in Q3 FY22.

IT services company Tech Mahindra is expected to report a muted revenue growth of 0.4 percent sequentially in constant currency terms, impacted by higher-than-expected furloughs, when it releases December quarter numbers on January 30.

According to an average of estimates of five brokerages polled by Moneycontrol, consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of India’s sixth largest IT company may jump 3.8 percent on a sequential basis but decline 0.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,359 crore.

Consolidated revenue, in rupee terms, is expected to increase 18 percent YoY and 3.7 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 13,612 crore. In dollar terms, it is seen at $1,639 million, up 6.9 percent from the year-ago period and 0.1 percent QoQ.

Also Read: Davos 2023 | Tech Mahindra's CP Gurnani: The way forward for IT services firms isn't negative

“Tech Mahindra’s revenue growth will be impacted by the general demand slowdown. We believe that will be due to higher-than-normal furloughs in BFSI/Hi-tech verticals countered by seasonal strength in Retail,” Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities analyst said.

BFSI is short for Banking, Financial Services and Insurance.

Like industry bellwether TCS, Tech Mahindra, too, will likely see demand challenges in Europe. “Weak Europe and macro will feed into muted quarter. Lack of growth will likely feed into margins,” Kotak Institutional Equities said.

The company’s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin is pegged at 11.7 percent, a 30 basis points (bps) improvement QoQ and 310 bps decline YoY. “Benefit of rupee depreciation will be offset by impact of furloughs and lack of leverage on growth,” Kotak analysts said.

One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.

Analysts expect the total contract value for the quarter to be at the lower end of the $700 million-$1,000 million bracket on slower decision-making by clients.

Key monitorables

The Street will closely watch the management commentary on attrition and employee addition. Net addition in India’s top four IT companies is down 93 percent sequentially. Lower net addition is being seen as an indicator of slowing growth but attrition, too, is coming down across companies.

The progress made on the selection of a new chief executive officer who will take over from CP Gurnani, who retires in December 2023, will also be keenly followed.

Measures to improve margins, telecom deal momentum, especially related to 5G networks, M&A strategy and updates on recent acquisitions will be on analysts' and investors' radar as well.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) currently in Davos saw IT services companies meet their clients, and while executives expected pessimism, they say that their view has since shifted to be more cautiously optimistic and Tech Mahindra’s Chief Executive Officer CP Gurnani also subscribes to the same view.

Speaking to Moneycontrol’s Chandra R Srikanth on the sidelines of the WEF, Gurnani said since his 50-odd meetings, he doesn’t believe the way forward will be negative.

“In terms of how positive it would be, a lot depends on the way US Fed would react. There is always more than one layer that you need to unpeel because ultimately corporates do depend on some indications from the US. Otherwise, the mood looks moderately positive,” Gurnani said.

This comes in a quarter when IT companies have added fewer employees — with net addition in India’s top four IT companies down 93 percent sequentially. Lower net addition continues to be seen as an indicator of slowing growth but additionally, attrition, too, is coming down across companies.

Gurnani said that hiring will be higher when attrition is higher, and net hiring will be low when attrition is declining.

“Hiring cannot always be linear. The reality is that AI, data, and automation are part of our lives. If it is not linear, revenue goes up. If you don't hire, please do take into account that we are becoming more efficient with automation,” he said.

Slowing growth is also leading to concerns of growth slowing to mid-to-high single digits, according to a recent report by JP Morgan. “Even if it is 8-10% and JP Morgan is right, we should celebrate it. Though from a Tech Mahindra perspective, I would like to believe it is likely to be two-digit growth,” he said.

Succession plan

It was announced in 2022 that CP Gurnani would step down in 2023, with his last day being December 19, as things currently stand.

When asked about the succession plan for Tech Mahindra - a company that Gurnani joined in 2004 and has been the CEO of since 2012 - Gurnani said that a committee has been appointed to find a successor.

“The board has appointed a committee, and the committee will meet again when we get together for a Board meeting…the Board has met a few people internally and they will take a decision. Post the board meeting, I'll have a better status for you,” he said.",410,-0.24832491874694823

Tech Mahindra chief CP Gurnani wants to transition from being a long serving captain in the IT industry to a ""coach"" after he retires from the company in December this year.

The nomination and remuneration committee has extended the tenure of Gurnani till December 19, 2023 as it looks to work on the succession plan of Gurnani.

While he did not divulge any further details on the succession plan, sources have indicated that internal candidates -- Jagdish Mitra, Manish Vyas, Lakshmanan Chidambaram are among top contenders for the post.

Jagdish Mitra is currently serving as Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Growth, who has been with the group for last 30 years; Vyas is serving as President, Communications, Media and Entertainment Business, and CEO, Network Services and been with the company for last 23 years and Chidambaram, currently serving as President for Tech Mahindra Americas and been with company since December 2012.

Gurnani said that the succession plan will be finalised by the committee as per the corporate governance norms of the company.

""I've done the same business for a very long time. I became a CXO at the age of 38 and am now stepping down at the age of 65. All I'm trying to say is that I've been a playing captain for a very long time. I will become a coach. I will no longer be a playing captain,"" Gurnani said.

One of the longest serving CEOs in the technology sector, Gurnani told PTI that would like to see the other side of the world and pursue things that are close to his heart.

""I have been one of the longest serving CEOs of the technology sector. I think it is fair that I get to see what the other side of the world looks like and I'm not talking about travel. I'm talking about a few things that I've always wanted to do in life. It is also good for the corporation that we get a new leader because a bit of rotation is like getting more oxygen into the system,"" Gurnani said.

While talking about business, Gurnani said Tech Mahindra will continue to deepen its presence in Japan and Europe and look at opening delivery centres closer to the home of its employees.

""I have always been a very big admirer of Japan, I will continue to create much deeper business interest in Japan. Frankly, I think Europe is a big opportunity now. Because overall Europe has felt the impact of the war.

""The war has been closest to them. Every individual in Europe has paid a price by inflation and higher energy bills. I believe that some of our cost transformation initiatives would be very helpful to European clients. So, my focus will be Japan and Europe,"" he said.

Gurnani said that the technology sector has matured and they have continued to serve their consumers, businesses, enterprises and corporates around the world by not taking a position.

""The only area where there has been some conversations is there organizations which are using cyber attacks as a weapon,"" Gurnani said but declined to reveal further details.

When asked about a broad strategic action plan that the company is planning to put in place this year, Gurani said that Tech Mahindra will look at distributing delivery centres across the country and near to the homes of its employees.

""We continue to make technological investments in the future of technology. Right now it is AI, cloud, metaverse and we have already started investing in quantum computing. We want to be ahead of the curve. There are some of our products which I think will be able to commercialize them a lot better,"" Gurnani said.",634,0.9993606408437093

Some wealth managers invested in stocks that would benefit from the crisis, while others banked on domestic economic recovery for investment ideas.

During the year, several companies saw massive upgrades and downgrades, largely reflecting investor sentiment. Let’s take a look at some of these companies:

Maximum upgrades and downgrades in last one year

HDFC Life Insurance Company saw the maximum upgrades over the past one year with 32 ‘buy’ calls from ‘28’ a year ago. Last year, there were 11 ‘hold’ calls on the insurance company’s stock, which have shrunk to two now.

What analysts like about the insurer is its ability to maintain its market share and leadership amongst its peers. HDFC Life Insurance Company’s well-balanced product and distribution mix have also been positives.

Eicher Motors, Grasim Industries and ITC have followed HDFC Life Insurance Company in terms of witnessing maximum upgrades over the past one year.

Meanwhile, JSW Steel faced the maximum downgrades. From 19 ‘buy’ recommendations a year ago, the stock slipped to just six buy calls, even as the ‘sell’ ratings soared to 16 from six a year ago.

Most analysts believe that the current valuation limits the upside potential in the stock, which is one of the primary reasons for the downgrades in JSW Steel.

“…we perceive high valuations and leverage (amidst lower steel prices) as key deterrents,” ICICI Securities said about JSW Steel.

Tech Mahindra was right behind JSW Steel with ‘buy’ calls falling to 27 from 42 last year, and ‘sell’ rating jumping to seven from one.

As per analysts, weak margin performance in the first half of FY23 and limited gains in technology stocks got the market jittery.

Following JSW Steel and Tech Mahindra, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Divi’s Laboratories and Tata Steel are the other names that saw extreme downgrades over the past one year.

Maximum upgrades and downgrades over past one quarter

Over the past one quarter, Britannia Industries, HCL Technologies and Axis Bank have seen the highest upgrades.

Britannia Industries is building up a strong adjacencies portfolio, which will help in driving strong growth in the long run, said Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

“On the other hand, in the core biscuit category, the company is consistently gaining market share (Q2 was the 38th consecutive quarter of share gain), which is aiding the company to achieve growth ahead of the industry’s growth. Thus, drivers are in place to achieve consistent double-digit earnings growth in the coming years,” the brokerage firm added.

Interestingly, among the top 10 companies that witnessed the maximum upgrades over a quarter, Axis Bank clocked the highest number of ‘buy’ ratings at 49, followed by UltraTech Cement at 42.

With asset quality issues behind, Axis Bank remains focused on building a stronger, consistent, and sustainable franchise which is why analysts have taken a liking to it.

On the contrary, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has the lowest number of ‘buy’ recommendations.

Meanwhile, Divi’s Laboratories, Bajaj Finserv and Tata Motors have been ranked high among companies that saw the highest number of downgrades over the past quarter.

‘Hold’ rating on the automaker’s stock increased to six this quarter from three a quarter ago.

The luxury carmaker’s JLR sales have already been under stress. The company had even lowered the financial guidance for the year after a disappointing Q2 performance resulting from the semiconductor shortage.

Telecom giant, Bharti Airtel, is also one of the companies that saw maximum downgrades. With revenue and margin under pressure, Bharti Airtel is expected to hike tariff by about 10 percent in Q4 of FY23, FY24, and FY25, Jefferies reportedly said.

Maximum upgrades and downgrades over past one month Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Unilever and Wipro have topped the list of maximum upgrades over the past one month.

“Over the last one month, the market positioning has shifted towards banks and domestic-cyclical stocks,” Axis Securities pointed out in a strategy note.

According to Prabhudas Lilladher, Hindustan Unilever’s twin acquisitions of OZiva and Wellbeing Nutrition have shown its intent to grow into emerging growth segments in Health, Wellness and Nutrition.

Meanwhile, Coal India saw maximum downgrades over the past one month. Some analysts have cited weakness in demand and international coal prices as concerns for the coal major.

The Nifty50 reversed some gains on last Friday after rallying in previous eight straight sessions. But the index recorded one percent gain for yet another week ended December 2, forming bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly frame and making higher highs formation for seventh week in a row, tracking favourable global cues.

In fact the index has ended at record closing high on a weekly basis, though it retraced from record highs on daily charts. The momentum is intact and Friday's correction is on expected lines given the consistent uptrend in the past. Hence, once the current consolidation ends, the Nifty50 is expected to resume upward journey once again towards 18,900-19,000 levels in coming days, with crucial supports at 18,500-18,300, experts said.

The momentum indicators RSI (relative strength index) also traded above 60 mark with upward bias on the weekly basis, and the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) on the weekly as well as monthly frames shows positive trend.

""The chart structure construes a positive development, with the indices being in a cycle of higher highs – higher lows. 18,500 is expected to act as the sacrosanct support for the index. While on the higher end, the swing high of 18,900 odd zone is expected to provide some intermediate resistance, followed by the psychological mark of 19,000 in the near term,"" Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One said.

He remains sanguine with the up trend and would advocate the traders to utilize the dips to add long position in the index.

Also, he expects strong moves outside the indices as the midcap space has witnessed a multi-month breakout and could unfold a new leg of rally in the comparable period.

Simultaneously, one should stay abreast of global and domestic developments on a regular basis and continue with a similar buy on decline strategy till the time important supports are held comfortably, the market expert advised.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the December 2 closing prices:

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

HEG: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,060 | Stop-Loss: Rs 995 | Target: Rs 1,155 | Return: 9 percent

The weekly timeframe chart of HEG indicates an upside bounce after a consolidation movement of last week. We observe a formation of higher bottom at Rs 956 in mid of November 2022, currently the stock price is moving up steadily thereby confirming bottom reversal pattern.

The overall weekly chart pattern indicates a completion of larger downtrend in the stock price and a resumption of renewed buying interest from the higher lows.

The stock price is now placed at the cluster hurdle of weekly 10 and 20 EMA (exponential moving average) and down sloping trend line around Rs 1,080-1,100 levels. Hence, a sustainable move above this area is expected to have a sharp positive impact ahead.

Buying can be initiated in HEG at CMP (Rs 1,060), add more on dips down to Rs 1,025, and wait for the upside target of Rs 1,155 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss of Rs 995.

MTAR Technologies: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,738 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,625 | Target: Rs 1,910 | Return: 10 percent

The weekly timeframe chart of the stock price, MTAR Technologies indicates a sustainable upside bounce in last week. The stock price was moving in a narrow range over the last few months and is currently showed upside breakout of the range at Rs 1,700 levels.

Hence, further sustainable move from here could be considered as a significant upside breakout and the stock price could move up sharply. After the formation of crucial bottom in June 2022, the stock price seems to have formed a higher bottom recently and started to move up. Volume has started to rise during upside breakout and weekly RSI shows positive indication.

One may look to buy MTAR Technologies at CMP (Rs 1,738), add more on dips down to Rs 1,670 and wait for the upside target of Rs 1,910 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,625.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,136 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,050 | Target: Rs 1,300 | Return: 14 percent

The stock has formed a double bottom formation on the daily chart. On Friday, the stock absorbed the selling pressure from the falling trend line at Rs 1,125.

It will face the next set of resistance at Rs 1,215 to validate the formation of a double bottom. It is a buy at current levels and more on a drop at Rs 1,080. One can keep a stop-loss at Rs 1,050, and hurdles will be at Rs 1,215 and Rs 1,300.

Bharat Dynamics: Buy | LTP: Rs 966 | Stop-Loss: Rs 890 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 14 percent

It is forming multiple continuation formations between the narrow range of Rs 900 and Rs 1,025. These types of formations eventually enter a trending wave. The Rs 940 and Rs 900 levels would be major support, however, Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,025 would be immediate resistance levels.

Based on the weekly formation, we are expecting a further upside in the stock. Buy at current levels with stop-loss at Rs 890. On higher levels, it has the potential to rally towards Rs 1,100 with a major hurdle at Rs 1,025.

Bharat Forge: Buy | LTP: Rs 855 | Stop-Loss: Rs 815 | Target: Rs 897 | Return: 5 percent

On Friday, the stock made a higher low at Rs 839 as compared to the previous low which was at Rs 816. After hitting an all-time high of Rs 897 in the previous month, it got into profit-taking mode.

However, after hitting the support of Rs 816, the stock has formed a solid base which will take the stock towards Rs 1,000 in the long run. In the medium term, the stock has the potential to move higher towards Rs 897 again. Buy at current levels and place stop-loss at Rs 815.

Expert: Vikas Jain, Senior Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,931 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,790 | Target: Rs 2,180 | Return: 13 percent

The stock has made higher bottoms on the weekly chart with an inside range and trending in a narrow range confirms a breakout.

Its weekly RSI has turned upwards from the lower part of the range and other key technical indicators on near-term timeframe chart are positively poised.

The stock has a strong support near its multi band of moving averages on the weekly time scale and the strong positive momentum in the sector reinforces our positive stance.

Therefore, we recommend directional long position for a target of Rs 2,180 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,790.

Trendline breakout in its daily RSI and bullish cross-over in its daily MACD signals that the stock is on the verge of a turnaround.

A stable move above its key band of weekly moving averages will support a strong up-move and could take the stock towards Rs 445 initially and Rs 470 subsequently.

Therefore, we recommend directional long position for a target of Rs 470 with a stop-loss of Rs 368.

Voltas: Buy | LTP: Rs 855 | Stop-Loss: Rs 810 | Target: Rs 950 | Return: 11 percent

On the lower side, the stock found support at around its 55-month EMA (exponential moving average) and crossed its 200-week average.

The stock bounced from its 52-week low of Rs 804 and gained 3 percent week-on-week basis.

Its weekly RSI reversed from its bottom level and poised for a turnaround and indicates a strong reversal in the stock from current juncture.

Therefore, we recommend directional long position for a target of Rs 950 with a stop-loss of Rs 810.

With the curtains coming down on India Inc’s Q2FY23 earnings season, analysts were busy in November making rating revisions and upgrading their outlook for stocks that managed to beat the consensus. Britannia saw the maximum upgrades after a solid earnings beat while Divi’s Labs was shunned by analysts after its Q2 net profit slumped 18 percent year-on-year.

While all fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies reported a margin decline in the September quarter due to the high cost of inventory, Britannia’s EBITDA margins expanded to 16.3 percent from 15.5 percent in the same quarter last fiscal. In its earnings press release, the company said it had added 28,000 rural preferred dealers, leading to consistent market share gains, now at a 15-year high.

From 20 ‘buy’, 16 ‘hold’ and 4 ‘sell’ calls in October, the stock was upgraded to 27 ‘buy’, 12 ‘hold’ and 3 ‘sell’ calls. It has managed to turn its fortunes around after spending several months in the ‘Maximum Pessimism’ stock list.

As commodity prices have now eased and the high cost inventory has been passed on, analysts believe FMCG margins are set to expand with volumes reviving on a bounceback in rural demand. Riding on this, HUL, Tata Consumer Products and ITC also saw slight upgrades in their ratings over the last month.

Meanwhile, Divi’s Labs and Cipla were among the top three stocks that witnessed the maximum downgrades over the last month. This was largely on the back of the pharma sector posting muted Q2FY23 numbers given the high base in the year-ago quarter, which was boosted by sales of COVID-19 linked treatment drugs.

Divi’s Labs’ net profit dropped 18.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 493.6 crore, and revenue was also 6.7 percent lower. ICICI Direct downgraded the stock from ‘Buy’ to ‘Hold’ stating, “We are keeping a tab on future custom synthesis ex-Covid opportunities and execution besides steady generics traction.”

Auto companies Tata Motors and Eicher Motors were next in line in the list of stocks with maximum downgrades over the past month. In Q2FY23, Tata Motors reported a higher-than-expected loss of Rs 944.61 crore and Jaguar Land Rover’s wholesale volume grew only 4 percent, which was lower than what the company had planned.

As losses continue, brokerages fear that the Tata group company’s zero net debt target could get pushed beyond FY25 from FY24. Adding to investors’ woes, JLR has announced a production cut in its UK factories in 2023 due to semiconductor issues, which indicates that chip shortage problems continue to haunt the carmarker. ‘Buy’ calls on the stock have come down to 23 from 26 in October.

Eicher Motors, too, saw its ‘Buy’ calls decrease from 35 to 32 over the last month. While the company posted 76 percent year-on-year growth in Q2, analysts are wary of increasing competition in the premium 250 cc and above category (like the launch of TVS Ronin). Nomura analysts expect Royal Enfield’s market share to reduce from 86 percent to 74 percent by FY30 as competition comes in.

Year-On-Year Changes

On the flipside, Eicher Motors also features in the list of maximum upgrades over the year ended November. The upgrades were largely on the back of expensive valuations correcting in March 2022, when the stock fell from the Rs 2,800-level to Rs 2,110. The company’s commercial vehicle business also remains in favour with analysts. Sharekhan expects the segment’s contribution to the company’s PBT to quadruple — from 3 percent last fiscal to 12 percent in the next.

Adani Enterprises, the newest entrant in the Nifty 50, now has one buy call compared to nil buy calls in November last year. Despite a trailing P/E valuation of 360x, analysts at Ventura Securities have a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 4,310 per share.

The brokerage firm believes that AEL will be exploring green energy opportunities across the globe and any announcement towards the same can lead to further rerating of the stock, beyond their estimates.

HDFC Life went from 28 ‘buy’ calls to 31 ‘buy’ calls over the last one year as the company’s acquisition of Exide Life inched towards the finish line. The merger will add 1.3 percent to HDFC Life’s market share, according to the management. While the expensive deal valuation ruffled some feathers, analysts are positive on the newer southern geographies and Tier-2, Tier-3 cities that HDFC Life will now have access to.

Aditya Birla Group’s flagship company Grasim was the next in line for maximum upgrades. Brokerages were particularly impressed by the company doubling its capex to Rs 10,000 crore by FY25 to set up the paints business and start production from the fourth quarter of 2023-24. Foreign brokerage firm Jefferies has called this the ‘Jio moment’ for the paints industry.

Meanwhile, steel major JSW Steel and oil PSU Bharat Petroleum continued to top the list of maximum downgrades in the past one year. JSW Steel saw its ‘buy’ calls go down from 19 to 6 on the back of falling metal prices and export duty imposition earlier in the year.

Despite the rollback of export duty in November, not many brokerages upgraded their rating on the stock. According to CLSA, a “broad-based policy stimulus in China — which is likely to drive steel prices higher — is the key determinant.” Tata Steel, too, saw its downgrades increase in the past twelve months.

BPCL’s ‘buy’ calls plunged down to 25 from 35 in November last year as brokerages removed the privatisation premium from the stock. Union Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has indicated there is “no proposal whatsoever” on his table regarding a BPCL divestment as of now.

Tech Mahindra and Wipro are the other big names that saw downgrades increase as a looming recession in the US and European Union could spoil their fortunes in these markets.

Quarter-On-Quarter Changes

On the flipside, their peers HCL Tech and Infosys managed to earn rating upgrades over the last quarter after surprising the Street with their Q2FY23 numbers. In fact, Infosys has been narrowing its revenue gap with Cognizant, noted Kotak Securities.

“Infosys’ quarterly revenue run-rate of $4.55 bn is just $300 mn away from Cognizant’s revenues. Infosys’ headcount at 345000 employees is just 4000 shy of Cognizant’s. We would not be surprised if Infosys reclaims revenue leadership in the coming quarters,” the brokerage firm noted.

The Street has also been enthused by the IT major’s open market share buyback programme amounting to Rs 9,300 crore, at a maximum price of Rs 1,850 per share.

For HCL Tech, analysts had expected 3 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated net profit in Q2. Beating expectations by a big margin, the company posted 7.05 percent growth in PAT and 19.5 percent growth in revenue from operations.

“Consistency in revenue growth in services and improving EBIT growth should drive re-rating. Valuation being at a steep discount to peers makes risk-reward favourable,” said Morgan Stanley about the stock.

Apart from Divi’s Labs, Tata Motors and BPCL, telecom operator Bharti Airtel saw its downgrades increase slightly over the last quarter. ‘Buy’ calls on the stock went down from 30 to 28. ‘Hold’ calls went up to 4 from 2. Analysts were anticipating a tariff hike by the company in the last quarter to improve ARPUs (average revenue per user).

Airtel started testing the waters by raising tariffs for entry-level plans in Haryana and Odisha, in the last week of November.

After taking a breather, the market regained momentum and scaled a record high in the week ended November 25 on the back of positive global cues. Buying binge by foreign investors and a fall in crude oil also aided the rally.

The Nifty50 closed above 18,500 for the first time in history, rising more than a percent during the week and formed bullish engulfing pattern on the daily charts, indicating positive mood at Dalal Street. The index is now around 100 points away from its record high of 18,604 seen on October 19 last year, while the BSE Sensex and Bank Nifty crossed their previous record high levels.

On the weekly charts, there was a breakout of downward sloping resistance trend line adjoining October 18, 2021 and November 14, 2022. Even on a monthly scale, the index has seen a breakout of downward sloping resistance trend line adjoining October 1, 2021, and September 1, 2022. Also the index has been trading well above all key exponential moving averages.

Hence, 18,450-18,500 is expected to be a crucial area for further upside. If the said zone sustains, then new highs are possible in the coming days, with support at 18,300, followed by 18,000 levels, experts said, adding on the option side, 19,000 strike has attracted a lot of open interest, indicating the crucial resistance point.

""I think 18,600 and 18,750 are the next levels to watch out for, above which the path towards next milestone of 19,000 unfolds. The ‘buy on decline’ strategy continues to pay rich dividend to market participants and hence, there is no harm on continuing the same,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

The immediate support zone is now visible in the vicinity of 18,400 – 18,300, whereas the actual base now shifts higher towards 18,100. As long as the Nifty manages to defend this territory, there is no reason to worry for, Sameet feels.

The market expert advised traders to continue with an optimistic approach. Now, with other sectors chipping in, he expects a good broad-based buying in the current week.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the November 25 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equities Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

GMR Infrastructure: Buy | LTP: Rs 40.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 38 | Target: Rs 48 | Return: 18 percent

The stock is forming a rounding bottom formation on the daily chart. It has formed a higher bottom on the weekly chart. Based on the comprehensive technical structure, it has more legs to move forward.

GAIL India: Buy | LTP: Rs 93.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 89 | Target: Rs 105 | Return: 13 percent

It is diverging positively and formed a falling wedge at the end of the recent downtrend. The above formation is bullish and will take the stock toward Rs 100 or Rs 105 in the near term.

Traders should become buyers at current levels for a target of Rs 100-105 and keep a stop-loss at Rs 89 for this.

BHEL: Buy | LTP: Rs 81.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 74 | Target: Rs 100 | Return: 22 percent

The stock has surpassed a swing high at Rs 80.50 and closed above the same on a weekly basis. On a quarterly basis, after the year 2007, the first time it has formed a series of the higher bottom, which is an indication of a major reversal pattern.

It has the potential to move Rs 100 or Rs 110 in the next few weeks. The strategy should be at buy between Rs 83 and Rs 82. One can keep a final stop-loss at Rs 74 for a trading long position. Hurdles will be at Rs 87, Rs 93 and at Rs 100.

Expert: Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative & Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities

MSTC: Buy | LTP: Rs 282 | Stop-Loss: Rs 265 | Target: Rs 302-320 | Return: 13 percent

The stock price has broken out from the downward sloping trendline on the weekly chart, adjoining the highs of week ending October 22, 2021 and April 22, 2022 with higher volumes.

Primary trend of the stock turned positive as stock price closed above its 100 and 200 days EMA (exponential moving average).

PSU stocks have been doing well and are looking good for the short to medium term. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 282-275.

Rallis India: Buy | LTP: Rs 239 | Stop-Loss: Rs 226 | Target: Rs 255-268 | Return: 12 percent

The stock price has broken out from the symmetrical triangle on the daily chart with higher volumes. Primary trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its 50, 100 and 200-day EMA.

Momentum Oscillators like RSI (relative strength index - 11) and MFI (money flow index - 10) are in rising mode and placed above 60, indicating strength in the current uptrend. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 239-234.

Den Networks: Buy | LTP: Rs 35.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 33 | Target: Rs 38-41 | Return: 16 percent

The stock price has broken out on the daily line chart with higher volumes to close at highest level since November 14. Short term trend of the stock turned positive as stock price has closed above its 5 and 20-day EMA.

Momentum oscillators like RSI (11) witnessed trendline breakout, indicating higher possibility of price to gain momentum from hereon. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 35.25-34.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

InterGlobe Aviation: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,907 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,790 | Target: Rs 2,080 | Return: 9 percent

After a trendline breakout, the stock respected that extended trendline and resumed its up-move. Its daily RSI gave strong buy signal after oscillating around its bull market support zone (40-33).

This could lead the stock towards Rs 2,020 initially and Rs 2,080 subsequently.

On the lower side, the stock will continue to find support around its extended trendline, while in case of high volatility, its cluster of moving averages will restrict the fall and it will support a reversal.

Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals: Buy | LTP: Rs 607.2 | Stop-Loss: Rs 534 | Target: Rs 720 | Return: 19 percent

The stock reversed after testing its prior point of polarity and breached its prior weekly falling trend. In the past, the stock witnessed a sharp up-move after testing that point.

We believe history will repeat itself, as the stock has engulfed loss of previous week and its key technical indicators are positively poised on short-term timeframe chart.

The stock has potential to move towards its highest level of October 2022. In case of any decline, the stock will respect that prior point of polarity.

Persistent Systems: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,970.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,590 | Target: Rs 4,950 | Return: 25 percent

In mid-October 2022, the stock surpassed its 20-week as well as 50-week EMAs (exponential moving average) and after a consolidation extended gain subsequently. Above these moving averages are on the verge of a bullish cross-over.

A follow-up move will confirm the bullish cross-over and strengthened the stock to move towards its life-time-high level.

On the lower side, the stock will find support around its 20-week and 50-week EMAs.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,080 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,030 | Target: Rs 1,160 | Return: 7 percent

The IT space has witnessed good momentum in last few weeks post the recent pullback move from the lows in Nasdaq. Amongst the index heavyweights, stocks such as Infosys, HCL Technologies and TCS have posted good returns in this phase and now Tech Mahindra is close to a breakout from its consolidation phase.

In the last few weeks, this stock has consolidated within a narrow range and has formed a 'Symmetrical Triangle' pattern. Prices are on the verge of the breakout which could lead to a good trended move on the upside in the near term.

Hence, we advise short term traders to buy Tech Mahindra around current market price of Rs 1,077 for potential targets around Rs 1,127 and Rs 1,160. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 1,030.

L&T Finance Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 86.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 82.50 | Target: Rs 94 | Return: 8 percent

The stock has seen consolidated within a broad range in last few months and prices have given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance in Friday's session. The volumes on breakout were higher as compared to its daily average which is a positive sign.

The RSI oscillator has given a positive crossover on the daily as well as the weekly charts and is thus indicating a positive momentum.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock around current market price of Rs 86.50 for potential targets around Rs 91 and Rs 94. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 82.50.

Bulls retained their might for the fourth straight week ended November 11, taking the Nifty50 to its peak for this year so far on the back of a rally in its global peers. The upbeat sentiment in the market was fuelled by the hope of a slowdown in rate hikes by the Federal Reserve after inflation in the US began cooling off.

The Nifty50 rallied more than 200 points or 1 percent to settle the week at 18,350, backed by technology, banking and financial services and metal stocks. The index has seen a bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly scale, with a higher-high-higher-low formation for the fourth consecutive week.

Momentum indicators MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) and RSI (relative strength index) also indicated the positive mood in the market. Hence, the chances look bright for the Nifty50 to move towards a record high of 18,604 in the coming days if the momentum sustains and global markets support, with crucial support at the psychological 18,000 mark, said experts. They advised to continue with the 'buy on dips' strategy.

""The price configuration looks promising, too, because the Nifty finally managed to surpass the time-tested trendline resistance above 18,200–18,000 with some authority,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

For the coming week, he feels 18,200–18,000 would now be seen as a sacrosanct support zone, whereas on the flipside, testing 18,450 and 18,600 is clearly on the cards. In fact, if the momentum persists, the Nifty will see a fresh record high in the coming week itself.

Till now, most of the other heavyweights have been driving the markets higher but with the IT space coming out of its long slumber, the rally is likely to be robust in nature, Chava said.

The broader markets were under pressure with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices falling 1 percent and half a percent respectively.

Hence, instead of anticipating reversals in the underperformers, traders should look to ride the trend with the heavyweights or sectors which are participating in this up-move, and look for buying opportunities from a short-term perspective, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com, advised.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the November 11 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Zomato: Buy | LTP: Rs 72.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 67 | Target: Rs 90 | Return: 24 percent

The stock completed a sideways corrective pattern on last Friday and closed above the upper band of the trading range, which was at Rs 70.

Based on that the stock should move towards Rs 90 level with minor resistance at Rs 80. It is a price and volume-based break out for the stock, which signals the start of an impulse-up move.

One can buy 50 percent quantity at Rs 73 and the remaining 50 percent at Rs 69 with a stop-loss at Rs 67.

United Spirits: Buy | LTP: Rs 885 | Stop-Loss: Rs 860 | Target: Rs 960 | Return: 8.5 percent

Since the stock has broken the resistance of the falling trend line, it is consolidating at the upper band of the rectangle formation, which is suggesting that the stock is ready to surpass the upward boundary, which is at Rs 905.

On the dismissal of Rs 905, the stock would move toward the levels of Rs 925 and Rs 960. It’s a buy at current levels as the risk to the reward is decent. One can buy at current levels and keep a stop-loss at Rs 860 for the same.

Mphasis: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,027 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,900 | Target: Rs 2,400 | Return: 18 percent

The stock is turning positive on the weekly chart. With a positive divergence, it is on track to complete a falling wedge (a bullish consolidation), which would pull the stock towards Rs 2,400 in the medium term.

It is advisable to buy at the current level with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,900. On the upside, resistance will be at Rs 2,150 and Rs 2,400.

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

Firstsource Solutions: Buy | LTP: Rs 109 | Stop-Loss: Rs 101 | Target: Rs 125 | Return: 15 percent

After showing a rangebound action in the last 5-6 weeks, the stock price has witnessed a sharp upside bounce last week and closed higher. The stock price is currently placed at the resistance of 20-week EMA (exponential moving average) around Rs 108.50 and further upside from here could bring another hurdle of down sloping trend line at Rs 112 in the near term.

Volume has expanded during upmove on last Friday and weekly RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price ahead.

Buying can be initiated in Firstsource at current market price (Rs 109), add more on dips down to Rs 104.50, wait for the upside targets of Rs Rs 117 and next Rs 125 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss of Rs 101.

ITI: Buy | LTP: Rs 111 | Stop-Loss: Rs 104 | Target: Rs 126 | Return: 13 percent

After witnessing a sharp upside breakout of down sloping trend line resistance on November 1 at Rs 108 levels, the stock price has shifted into a consolidation with minor downward correction in the next 5-6 sessions.

The recent minor downward correction seems to have completed and the stock price is now ready to show another round of sharp upside bounce from the higher lows. The recent weakness has not negated the upside breakout of the down trend line. The daily RSI shows positive indication and one may expect continuation of upside momentum in the near term.

Buying can be initiated in ITI at current market price (Rs 111), add more on dips down to Rs 107 and wait for the upside targets of Rs 120 and next Rs 126 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss of Rs 104.

Expert: Jatin Gohil - Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,059 | Stop-Loss: Rs 968 | Target: Rs 1,360 | Return: 28 percent

After a higher level of reversal, the stock tested its prior high's connecting rising trendline and respecting its long-term moving average (200-week SMA) oscillated upwards.

We believe the stock is poised for a breakout, which could take it towards Rs 1,330-1,360 zone.

In the past, reversal from its long-term moving average has supported a health up-move.

The key technical indicators are in favour of the bulls on short-term timeframe chart.

In case of any decline, the stock will respect its long-term moving average.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,899 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,740 | Target: Rs 2,180 | Return: 15 percent

The stock has made higher bottoms on the weekly chart with an inside range and trending in a narrow range confirms a breakout.

Its weekly RSI has turned upwards from the lower part of the range and other key technical indicators on near-term timeframe chart are positively poised.

The stock has a strong support near its multi band of moving averages on the weekly time scale and the strong positive momentum in the sector reinforces our positive stance.

Therefore, we recommend directional long position for a target of Rs 2,180 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,740.

Jubilant Foodworks Future: Sell | LTP: Rs 566 | Stop-Loss: Rs 617 | Target: 463 | Return: 18 percent

In second week of October 2022, the stock witnessed a breakdown from rising wedge pattern and after sluggish movement, it has extended loss with above average volume.

On the lower side, the stock may find support around Rs 547, as multiple lows formed at around that level.

The key technical indicators gave sell signal post bearish divergence on the short-term timeframe chart.

This could drag the stock below its near-term support of Rs 547 and could move it towards Rs 506-487-463.

On the higher side, the stock will face hurdle around its prior highs (Rs 652 and Rs 628) connecting intermediate falling trendline.

Thus, a short position can be initiated for the target of Rs 463 with a stop-loss of Rs 617.

Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers

Sharda Cropchem: Buy | LTP: Rs 391 | Stop-Loss: Rs 350 | Target: Rs 480 | Return: 23 percent

The free fall started from July 2022 till October 2022 which resulted in a 47 percent decline in price. On a daily scale, the counter has formed classic Doji near its historical support of Rs 375 along with drying volume which indicates that bears are losing grip.

In the previous trading session, the said counter witnessed nice buying interest supported by sufficient volume which is adding more confirmation for early reversal in the counter.

On the indicator front, the daily RSI (relative strength index) has formed a bullish divergence near the oversold zone (refer to the chart) which further confirms the upside in the counter.

One can buy in small tranches at current levels and buy another tranche at around Rs 370 levels (if tested). The upside is expected till Rs 480 and support is around Rs 350.

Alembic Pharmaceuticals: Buy | LTP: Rs 639 | Stop-Loss: Rs 570 | Target: Rs 750 | Return: 17 percent

On a monthly scale after hitting an all-time high of Rs 1,111, the counter nosedived to Rs 540 levels which accounted for a 51 percent depreciation in price.

Even on a daily scale, negative volume is drying up indicating possible upside momentum.

On the indicator front, the monthly RSI has formed an impulsive structure near the oversold zone which further confirms the upside in the counter. One can buy at current levels, the upside expected is Rs 750 and credible support is at Rs 570.

Petronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 212 | Stop-Loss: Rs 200 | Target: Rs 235 | Return: 11 percent

Petronet has witnessed a very sharp correction of 14 percent between July 2022 and September 2022. Since then the stock is consolidating between Rs 200-205 on the hourly scale and it has made a solid base near Rs 203 levels.

On October 3, 2022, it completed a bullish BAT pattern near said range along with the complex structure on daily RSI which hints towards a possible reversal in the counter.

One can hold (if already bought) and add (if considering fresh buy) in the range Rs 211-213. The upside is expected till Rs 235 with a stop-loss of Rs 200 on a closing basis.

2022-11-04 14:29:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/tech-mahindras-revenue-from-5g-solutions-may-touch-1-billion-in-fy23-9449581.html,"Manish Vyas, President, Communications, Media & Entertainment and CEO, Network Services, Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra is on track to touch almost $1 billion in revenue from 5G solutions alone in FY23 as India’s fifth-largest software exporter continues to see strong momentum, a top executive said.

Revenue from 5G solutions jumped almost fivefold to over $600 million in FY22 from $125 million in FY21 as the company benefited from the wider adoption of the faster mobile communications standard.

“5G continues to be a strong growth engine for us,” Manish Vyas, CEO of network services at Tech Mahindra, told Moneycontrol after the company’s second-quarter earnings. “I don't want to steal the thunder from the full year, but as of now, I think we are well on our way to be very close – if not exactly that number – close to a billion dollars.”

Earlier this year, the management said 5G would be a key deal enabler in FY23. Tech Mahindra’s performance for the second quarter was in line with analyst estimates for most aspects, including revenue and margins, though the total contract value of deals at $716 million was slightly muted on both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis.

The company reported a 4 percent year-on-year fall in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,285 crore for the quarter ended September. Revenue from operations rose 20.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 13,129.5 crore.

Overall, Vyas expects around 35-40 percent YoY growth this year from the segment.

Vyas said 5G is a more comprehensive transformation and innovation play.

Across verticals

“And we have taken 5G exactly like that. In fact, we don’t even spend any time where the most money gets spent, which is deploying the network. We’ve stayed away from that as much as possible because we need to balance our growth with our margins and our strengths,” he added.

Tech Mahindra has been working around network integration, network management, network automation, closed-loop automation, and digital platforms that will enable 5G and 5G engineering on devices. The company is also working on value-added services with enterprises on 5G.

Tech Mahindra’s 5G play is across industrial verticals and use-cases. They include enabling smart factories and equipment management on shop floors, post-sales services for manufacturing companies, and for oil and sector, it could be repair work, asset management, and solving oil rig issues to name a few.

In terms of deals for 5G solutions, Tech Mahindra is focussed on higher volumes of mid-sized contracts in the range of $25-50 million.

“Because of the kind of areas we want to focus on, it is more voluminous, but it is going to be mid-size deals in overall deal flow. I also think we will probably start seeing larger deals again coming back into the funnel because every time the economy tightens, there is a greater opportunity to do more costing,” Vyas said.

On metaverse projects

Last quarter, Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani said the company was working on about 60 metaverse projects. But given the inflation and recessionary pressures that followed, many client companies of IT firms are rethinking their technology budgets and reprioritising their spending. Futuristic technologies in exploratory stages such as the metaverse have borne the brunt of such cutbacks.

Vyas remains bullish on the deal pipeline and long-term prospects of the metaverse, a virtual shared space that is seen as the next level for interaction for companies and consumers.

“The speed at which we have seen actions on metaverse is amazing. It's better than anything in the past. We are very busy. What is emerging is the metaverse relevance to business versus consumers,” Vyas said. “I think we’d have to wait for a few more months, maybe a few quarters, before a little realisation happens. There will be a few people who will say maybe let’s focus on next year rather than the long-term future. In which case some of the metaverse discussions may – I'm not saying they will – they may probably take a little re-prioritisation, but overall, I think it will remain very strong.”",671,0.6336428631435741

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TechM) reported revenues for Q2FY23 at $1,638 million up 2.9% q-o-q in constant currency which was in line with our estimates led by strong performance by the Manufacturing, Technology and Retail verticals. EBIT margin at 11.4% for Q2FY23 was up 32 Bps q-o-q owing to lower SG&A expenses and lower subcontracting costs which was partially offset by higher employee benefits costs and higher depreciation. Deal momentum continued to be healthy with deal TCV at $716 million but has moderated from $802 million TCV seen in Q1FY23. Management expects to achieve 14% EBIT margin by Q4FY2023 and stated that margin benefits would flow in the next two quarters due to portfolio pruning especially on low margin business.



Outlook

We maintain a Buy on TechM with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,220, given healthy deal wins and reasonable valuation.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

TECHM reported a revenue of USD1.63b in 2QFY23, up 2.9% QoQ in CC terms v/s our estimate of 2% QoQ. Reported growth was muted at 0.3% QoQ in 2QFY23, led by BPS (up 3.6% QoQ), while IT Services were flat QoQ. EBIT margin rose 40bp QoQ to 11.4% (in line), despite wage hikes. Revenue growth in 2QFY23 was impacted by 100bp (annual run-rate of USD60m) due to TECHM’s account pruning program to exit low margin and non-strategic accounts. The management indicated a total annualized impact of USD100-120m in FY23, implying another 100bp hit over 2H. Moreover, higher furloughs in 3QFY23 may further impact revenue. We expect TECHM to deliver a USD revenue growth of 9.7% in FY23 (including ~400bp from the inorganic route), which is among the weakest in our Coverage Universe. It should see continued pressure in FY24 as its focus on margin may be at the cost of growth. We continue to expect positive commentary on 5G spends to play out over the medium term on account of growth and monetization uncertainty on the telco side. TECHM should deliver a USD revenue CAGR of 9% over FY22-24.

Outlook

We remain on the sidelines on TECHM as we feel the current valuations fairly factor in uncertainties around growth and margin. We marginally tweak our estimates to account for lower margin. Our TP implies 15x FY24E EPS. We remain Neutral on the stock.

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post June quarter earnings

Nomura

We have kept the ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target at Rs 1,160 per share as the Q2 was broadly in-line, while outlook is sketchy.

The revenue performance was strong, despite pruning initiatives in Q2, while deal wins remain robust, reported CNBC-TV18.

CLSA

We have maintained the 'underperform' tag on the stock with a target at Rs 1,070 per share.

The margin management remains a challenge but valuation lends support. The Q2 revenue and margin were in-line, while near-term outlook is steady, said CLSA.

Find few triggers in results/ commentary to attract investor interest, reported CNBC-TV18.

Sharekhan

At CMP, the stock is trading at a reasonable valuation of 18.1x/16.2x its FY2023E/FY2024E earnings estimates.

We continue to prefer Tech Mahindra, given healthy deal wins and reasonable valuation. We maintain a 'buy' rating with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs 1,220.

Rupee appreciation and/or adverse cross-currency movements and/or constraint in local talent supply in the US would affect earnings. Further, macro headwinds and possible recession in the US are likely to moderate the pace of technology spending.

Nirmal Bang

While valuations are cheap, the kind of recessionary demand conditions we are getting into, they are likely to get still cheaper.

After 2QFY23, we have kept our FY24-FY26 EPS estimates constant and have arrived at an unchanged Target Price (TP) of Rs 889 (12.9x Sept ‘24E EPS, multiple maintained, 35 percent discount to the multiple given to TCS). We have maintained our ‘sell’ rating on stock.

Tech Mahindra reported net new deal wins worth $716 million for its second quarter ended September 30, 2022, down by 4.5 percent on a YoY basis from $750 million in the same quarter last fiscal year.

Sequentially, deal wins were down by 10.72 percent from $802 million last quarter.

“CME, our largest vertical, continues to grow delivering 3.1 percent QoQ growth and our enterprise business delivered 2.8 percent QoQ. On a YoY basis, CME on constant currency (CC) terms grew 20 percent and enterprise grew by 14.4 percent,” CP Gurnani, CEO and MD of Tech Mahindra said.

“Our large deal pipeline is as robust as or better than ever before,” Gurnani said.

Currently, only 5 percent of the company’s order book is from India-based clients, though most of Tech Mahindra’s global clients have a major presence in India too. This, however, increases the impact of cross-currency headwinds and recessionary pressures on Tech Mahindra’s margins.

""We continue to focus on being resilient and agile to ensure long-term value for our people, customers, partners, and the society at large. While market conditions evolve and supply-side challenges continue, we will strengthen our differentiated offerings to help customers in their transformation journey through our integrated and new-age solutions,"" Rohit Anand, chief financial officer, Tech Mahindra said.

“Most of the focus during the last two three years has been on connectivity which is 5G and customer experience management. Large deal pipeline in terms of robustness and digital transformation is probably one of the best I have seen in the last five years. Americas lead the race and sectorially, CME has a fair amount of large deals. Gratifying part is customer experience management. When it is integrated with the call centres and business process as a service and also with digital CRM capabilities, it has become a unique differentiator,” Gurnani said.

Speaking of its Europe business, Gurnani said he is going to be cautious as its currency is not doing as well against US dollars. He mentioned several industries like consumer electronics and appliances and retail, which have started seeing cracks of slowdown as customers cut back on spending.

Vivek Agarwal, President – BFSI, HLS and Corporate Development, Tech Mahindra, said that the company has consciously invested in building a dedicated team to win large deals for the company.

“We've invested into building a large deal engine and machine very systematically over the last couple of years, and hence what you've seen. This is not only this quarter, we've been in that $700-800 million range each quarter now for I think the last six to eight quarters as compared to what we were before. So it's been a systemic effort on building a dedicated team for large deals, not only winning large deals, but pursuing large deals and creating large transformation opportunities,” he said.

Tech Mahindra announced its Q2FY23 earnings on November 1. Its consolidated net profit dropped by 4 percent YoY and stood at Rs 1,285 crore. This was a 13.6 percent increase on a QoQ basis.

Consolidated revenue from operations for the quarter came in at Rs 13,129.5 crore, growing by 3.3 percent sequentially and 20.6 percent year-on-year. Revenue stood at Rs 10,881.3 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.",543,0.08989247950640591

Tech Mahindra is all set to report its Q2FY23 numbers on November 1, two weeks after its peers, TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Tech, came out with their report cards.

According to an average of estimates of six brokerages polled by Moneycontrol, consolidated profit after tax (PAT) for Tech Mahindra may jump 8.10 percent on a sequential basis but decline 8.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,224 crore in the second quarter of FY23 (July-September). Consolidated revenue is expected to increase 20 percent YoY to Rs 13,110 crore.

Analysts expect constant currency growth of 2.4 percent on a sequential basis. The muted growth will be on the back of the company’s weak product business and subdued enterprise segment, Elara Securities noted. However, the communication segment - which forms 40 percent of the company’s revenue - might see robust growth momentum driven by 5G demand.

Analysts at Jefferies and Kotak Institutional Equities are factoring in a 40 basis points inorganic contribution from Thirdware acquisition. On March 12, Tech Mahindra had announced the acquisition of Mumbai-based Thirdware Solutions in an all-cash deal for a total consideration of up to $42 million.

Tech Mahindra’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins are seen improving marginally on a sequential basis by 13 basis points to 11.2 percent. “The company will likely absorb 90-100 bps impact of wage revision through operational tightening, aggressive cost-control measures, increase in utilization rates and rationalization of business,” noted Kotak Institutional Equities.

However, on a YoY basis, margins are set to decline 400 basis points.

Investors will be monitoring management commentary on deal wins and project pipeline. Analysts at KIE expect $700 million of net new deal wins with run rate consistent to achieve double-digit growth in FY23E.

Other key monitorables include impact on demand momentum in a slowing macro environment, hiring plans, pricing leverage, telecom deals and performance of acquired entities. Along with the results, its board of directors will also consider the proposal for payment of interim dividend for the financial year 2022-23, which investors will be keenly watching out for.

The stock ended 1.38 percent higher at Rs 1,063.45 on the National Stock Exchange on October 31. It has tumbled 40.42 percent in 2022 so far as the sentiment remains negative on IT stocks due to recessionary fears.

Policy rate likely to peak by January-March quarter as MPC shifts focus to growth, say economists

The widening divergence among members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) suggests that India may not be very far from reaching the end of the current rate hike cycle, at least six economists told Moneycontrol on October 18. Splits in the MPC’s thought process were visible in the minutes of the MPC’s September meeting. While the majority of the members stuck to their hawkish stance on rates to tame inflation expectations, external members Ashima Goyal and Jayanth Varma said that an aggressive rate hike cycle may do more harm than good. Varma also said that it is dangerous to push the policy rate well above the neutral rate in an environment where the growth outlook is very fragile. Once inflationary pressures recede, the rate-setting MPC will likely shift focus to address worries surrounding economic growth in FY24 and assess the impact of previous rate hikes, economists said.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the country's largest IT services company, will take the lead, announcing its results on October 10, followed by Wipro and HCLTech on October 12, and Infosys on October 13.

Most of them had a strong total contract value (TCV) and demand pipeline last quarter, but a lot is expected to be revealed this quarter. Especially, addressing several supply-side problems, such as not hiring new people who had been given offer letters, variable pay cuts and delays, client spending budgets going down, etc.

TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan stated last quarter that he expects the demand pipeline to remain strong in Q2, but that he will be wary of the macro-environment. Since then, a lot has changed.

We look at the top five things to keep an eye out for:

Revenue growth

Despite macroeconomic uncertainties in Europe and the United States, their key markets, and impending recessionary pressures, TCS is expected to post similar revenue growth to the previous quarter. Analysts expect revenue will increase by 1.2-1.7 percent in USD terms and 3.5-3.8 percent in constant currency terms, reaching an estimated Rs. 54,766 crore.

Cross currency headwinds

The depreciation and volatility of the rupee are one of the main worries in the industry right now. The value of the British pound and the Euro has dropped by nearly 10 percent since the end of the previous quarter, with the yen and the Australian dollar making matters worse. Volatility in currency can significantly impact Q2 performance as well as Q3FY23E.

“For tier-1 IT, we are building CC growth moderation to 13 percent for FY23E (~400bps negative cross currency impact) and 10 percent CC growth for FY24E (~1% negative cross currency impact) as compared to 18 percent growth registered in FY22,” analysts at HDFC Securities said in their report.

Demand remains resilient

Despite the macro challenges in Europe, TCS' contracting activity was strong, with some of the key deals including Marks & Spencer, Nokia, Boots, Zurich Insurance, and, according to media reports, a $2-billion BSNL deal.

However, Gopinathan's comments on client spending trends and demand expectations for the coming quarters will be worth noting. Especially since the retail industry and the BFSI sector - two of TCS's strongest segments - have been particularly hit and have experienced a slowdown in recent months.

Fresher hiring

The last quarter saw the IT sector's strong hiring narrative starting to crumble. TCS had already reported a slowdown in new hires in the first quarter of FY23, with around 14,000 compared to 24,000 in the same quarter last year and 35,209 in Q4FY22. The company then stated that it is now working to increase its utilisation rates.

However, despite offer letters being rolled out at major companies such as Wipro, Infosys, and Tech Mahindra, fresher onboarding has been delayed for months, and in some cases offers have been revoked, indicating an increasingly difficult business environment and an attempt to cut costs.

Meanwhile, variable pay was also either delayed or partially reduced for companies such as TCS, Wipro, and Infosys.

US visa crisis

Indians currently account for nearly 75 percent of all H-1B visas issued each year. The specialised non-immigrant visa allows employers to bring in technically skilled workers from other countries. Given the sheer volume of requests and the two years of uncertainty and travel restrictions caused by the pandemic, the visa approval timeline has now increased by over 400 days, and in some cases by 800 days.

This makes it difficult for IT companies to send employees to sites overseas. Analysts told Moneycontrol that this will keep subcontracting costs high in the near-term, at least until Q3.

Last quarter, TCS chief financial officer, Samir Seksaria, said, “Our subcontractor expenses currently are at 9.7% of our revenues, and have moved up from about 7% levels to where we are currently. And as Rajesh pointed out, we have proactively and strategically invested in creating a bench. Our current priorities are to stay focused on capturing the demand. And we have known how to balance on the subcontractor side. And as the need arises, we'll be able to realign it or balance it.”

Despite all the talks of slowdown in demand from the US and European countries, analysts expect IT companies to deliver a 'resilient' quarterly performance with 2-4 percent sequential growth in revenues.

“The IT sector is expected to post resilient Q2 performance in context of the current macro environment. Tier-1 IT companies are expected to deliver sequential growth in the range of 2.4 to 4 percent constant currency,” said analysts at HDFC Securities in a note.

The brokerage added that mid tier companies will continue their outperformance over larger peers with Tata Elxsi, Mindtree and Persistent Systems expected to lead at above mid single digit quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth.

Others brokerages also have similar expectations. Elara Capital outlines average 3.8 percent QoQ growth and Jefferies has predicted a 3.6 percent jump. Antique Stock Broking expects revenue growth in the range of 2-4 percent QoQ in organic constant currency terms for top 5 and 3-5 percent for mid-caps.

According to analysis of most of the brokerages, falling margins of IT firms may have bottomed now. IT sector margins have contracted 400 bps since post-Covid peak levels.

“We’re building margin at 100 bps lower than pre-covid for FY23 and some recovery in FY24 (to around pre-Covid levels) supported by medium term tailwinds of normalisation in attrition, utilisation and pricing,” said HDFC Securities. Jefferies also expects aggregate EBIT margins to recover slightly by 30 bps QoQ in Q2FY23 after falling by 165 bps in Q1FY23.

IT companies have taken many steps recently to arrest the fall in their margins, including holding back variables for employees. Nonetheless, analysts said wage impact and cross currency impact will impact margin in Q2, offset by absence of visa cost, INR depreciation, improved utilisation and efficiencies.

Slowdown impactThe growth rate for IT companies have slowed down following the boom in revenue during the pandemic. It is expected to go further down as western economies reel under the aftermath of war in Ukraine.

Though the management at top IT companies have maintained that the growth will note be impacted much due to recessionary pressure in Europe and the US, analysts have already started trimming down their expectations beyonds September quarter (Q2).

“Expect the disconnect between weak macro and tech leaders’ commentary to narrow down, with outlook turning soft hereon. We do not anticipate guidance upgrades from Infosys, HCLT and Coforge,” said Elara Capital.

Currency impact

The bygone quarter was marked by sharp depreciation in rupee against the US dollar, which is generally considered positive for export oriented IT companies. However, depreciating euro and pound have also become worries for the sector.

Jefferies said currency headwinds will impact US dollar revenue growth. “Given the 5-7 percent depreciation of GBP & EUR against USD, revenue growth in USD terms for our coverage universe will be impacted by 165 bps in Q2FY23, slightly lower than the 185 bps impact in the last quarter,” it said.

It is expected that companies with higher exposure to GBP and EUR like Coforge, Tech Mahindra and TCS are likely to be impacted more due to the forex rate change. L&T Infotech, Mindtree and Infosys seem better placed in this regard, with cross-currency impact on revenue growth being nearly half of the previously mentioned companies.

Things to watch

The most important factor right now is management commentary on the demand environment. Any negativity shown by them will be taken into account and may hurt share prices, which are already trading at 30-40 percent discount to their 52-week high prices.

Commentary around deal pipeline, sales cycle, nature of deals and deal tenure, pricing, and vendor consolidation will also be keenly watched. Analysts and investors will also focus on any cues on client budgets or reprioritization of client spends.

Supply-side and attrition trends, hedging policies in the midst of sharp currency depreciation will be other key things to monitor.

Ravi*, who graduated this year with a degree in engineering, was offered a job by Wipro. He received his offer letter in January and did a two-month unpaid internship as part of a Wipro programme called Velocity.

When Ravi wanted to know when he could join his job, Wipro replied that the information technology company was onboarding selected candidates in batches, depending on batches.

“I completed my B.Tech, and I now work as a daily-wage labourer at a construction site for Rs 300 per day. How is this fair,” says a despairing Ravi.

Ravi is one of hundreds of selected job candidates who face the pressure of paying off their education loans and lament the wasted months and job offers they let go of. They find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place.

A similar theme is playing out at Tech Mahindra, where candidates who graduated as long ago as two years are still awaiting to be absorbed in jobs.

The delays come amid concerns of a recession in the US and Europe, the biggest markets for Indian IT companies, where policymakers are trying to douse inflation by steeply raising interest rates.

“You’ll hear from us at least two months prior to your onboarding,” a mail sent by Wipro to candidates reads.

Ravi, who needs to pay off the education loans he took, is confronting an additional humiliation; his family doesn’t even believe now that a job offer existed in the first place.

“My family doesn’t trust me. I am the only son. When I told my family in January when I got the job, they were happy. Now they are questioning if the job ever existed,” he said.

“We will wait if they tell us when we will be onboarded. It doesn’t matter when it is, I just need a timeline. They don’t even tell us what month we will be onboarded,” he told Moneycontrol.

Nowhere to go

Like Ravi, Dhruv*, a 2022 graduate who received his offer letter in November 2021, was told that if he completed Wipro’s Velocity training programme, he could go from Wipro’s Elite program, which pays Rs 3.5 lakh a year, to Turbo, which promises Rs 5.5 lakh a year and a Rs 1 lakh bonus.

Dhruv says that he was supposed to receive a revised offer letter after he completed the certification, which he did in July. Three months on, he still hasn’t received it.

“I had two more offer letters, but because of the training and the increased package that I would receive, I dropped those. I went with the flow and the training was great, and I did everything I was required to do. Now, it’s very hard to explain to my parents why there is such a delay,” he said.

He got his first offer letter in November last year, and almost a year later, there’s still no sign of him being absorbed into the elusive job.

When he tries for other jobs, the training programme he did with Wipro doesn’t count because he needs a certification from the company that he can only get once he is onboarded.

“I am considered a fresher without any prior experience, and because of the slowdown it’s very hard to even get a callback from companies we apply to,” he says.

A desperate wait

Hundreds of desperate job aspirants stuck in a limbo have formed Telegram groups, looking for any shred of information for a sense of clarity.

“HR doesn’t receive our calls. Wipro just tells us it is going to happen soon. We don’t know if it’s going to be this year or in 2023. You shouldn’t have hired us if you didn’t need as many people,” said *Shyam.

Among these candidates is a sense of helplessness about losing out on the job experience they could have gained during the wasted months.

There’s also concern that the placement process for the next set of graduates is set to begin soon and that more people will be vying for the same jobs while they still await absorption.

“I want to support my family, but I can’t,” Shyam said.

There are also a few candidates whose job offers have been revoked either for alleged non-compliance during hiring processes or on grounds that they did not meet assessment guidelines.

The Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), a union representing IT workers, has written to the central Labour Minister over Wipro’s onboarding delays and sought intervention. “The livelihood of 1000s of students & employees is now jeopardized,” the letter read.

In response to queries from Moneycontrol, Wipro said: “Wipro can confirm that it will honour all offer letters that have been made to deserving candidates, in a phased manner.”

The future is a blur

At Tech Mahindra, candidates who graduated in 2020 and 2021 are awaiting onboarding.

Shrey*, who graduated in 2021, received confirmation at the end of May this year that he had cleared all rounds of the hiring process, but he has not received an offer letter.

“We have no idea if our candidature is on hold. There are several students who are awaiting information. It’s been a while since we completed BTech. My future is a blur to me,” he saids.

“This year that I have been waiting could have counted towards my IT experience but it’s become a complete waste,” he added.

Tech Mahindra had not replied to queries from Moneycontrol at the time this story was published. The article will be updated if the company responds.

IT companies have slashed variable pay amid pressure on their profit margins as demand for their services cools in their major markets. A significant portion of IT companies’ revenue is spent on wages, and impact their operating margins.

Indian IT companies, which hired in record numbers during the pandemic as demand soared and talent was in short supply, are now slowing down on hiring. These companies saw high levels of attrition, which is now beginning to stabilise and is expected to start coming down.

The net addition of employees at Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra in the first quarter of financial year 2023 was down to 59, 704 from 85,720 in the last quarter of FY22

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched 5G telephony in the country at the India Mobile Congress in New Delhi, with tech firms and telcos hailing it as a giant leap forward.

Tech Mahindra, one of the strongest players in the emerging technologies frontier, believes 5G will bring in a generational leap in network technology.

Manish Vyas, President, Communications, Media and Entertainment Business, and CEO, Network Services, Tech Mahindra said,“The 5G ecosystem will unlock immense opportunities for industries across sectors, allowing them to experiment with myriad ideas to innovate and fuel the next level of growth possibilities.”

5G is not just a generational leap in network technology but is a platform for innovation, he said.

“I often say that 5G is like the last piece of the Industry 4.0 jigsaw puzzle that will spearhead the next wave of digital disruption, taking us a step closer to realising our dream of Atmanirbhar Bharat and technological supremacy.

“We are extremely excited about 5G and would like to congratulate the government and the people of India on this momentous day that has made 5G a reality,” he added.

Sectors to benefit

As an enabler of the next wave of digitalisation, 5G will not only catalyse new opportunities for the telecom industry but also for enterprises across industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and mining among others, Saurabh Kumar Sahu, Managing Director and Lead–Communications, Media and Technology, Accenture in India, said.

“It has the potential to improve productivity, optimise service quality and reduce costs, leading to increased economic output and better consumer experiences,” he said.

Accenture is committed to helping telcos and enterprises navigate the 5G ecosystem by combining its deep industry expertise, breadth of technology capabilities and experience of enabling digital transformation at scale to meet their innovation and growth agenda, he said.

Metaverse enabler

Industry insiders are bullish on the 5G technology accelerating innovations and use of next-generation technologies such as metaverse.

Engineering services company L&T Technology Services (LTTS) counts 5G as one of its “6 big bets” and expects the evolution of more 5G-enabled test beds and cross industry use in the coming months.

“We expect the manufacturing sector and adjacent supply chains to benefit the most with multiple new use cases,” said Amit Chadha, CEO and Managing Director at L&T Technology Services (LTTS) told Moneycontrol.

The launch of 5G services in India is a milestone step and has the potential to further open up new avenues of digital engineering-enabled business proposition.

“Sectors such as transportation, media and entertainment, healthcare and telecom in particular may leapfrog into next generation technology advancements,”Chadha said. Moreover, with metaverse also creating the desired momentum, delivery of the same over a 5G network will provide an enriched experience to Indian end-users.”

5G, with its superior speed and throughput benefits combined with the latest technologies, has the potential to transform telcos into enablers of the metaverse.

Telcos enjoy the advantage of having a large subscriber base, giving them the ability to bring more people and innovative solutions to life— on the metaverse, Accenture’s Sahu said.

“To unlock the full spectrum of opportunities within the metaverse, telcos must act now by expanding beyond traditional connectivity services to new capabilities and operating models,” he said.

Metaverse generally refers to shared virtual world environments where people can interact via the internet.

Service providers like Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel made several announcements during the launch. Airtel will soon go live with the service in eight cities, including Delhi, Varanasi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. It plans to roll out 5G in several cities by March 2023 and pan India by March 2024.

Jio plans to roll out 5G services in every town, taluka and tehsil of the country by December of 2023.

So far in 2022, the Nifty IT has fallen 27 percent while the sectoral gauge is down 22 percent in six months.

IT stocks had taken a severe beating, factoring in the aggressive tone of United States Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming. After a rebound, they resumed their fall on September 14, reacting to the hotter-than-expected inflation data released in the US, which many said signals a more hawkish Fed. With that, the Nifty IT index tumbled 4 percent.

Surprisingly, JPMorgan has also recently downgraded its rating on all technology stocks in its portfolio citing continued margin pressure. Here’s what has been causing rout in IT stocks:

What was Powell’s speech about at Jackson Hole?

Powell said the US central bank would continue raising interest rates in a way that will cause “some pain” to the US economy.

Despite four consecutive hikes in interest rates totalling to 2.25 percentage points, Powell believes this is “no place to stop or pause” even if benchmark rates are near an area that is considered neither stimulative nor restrictive to growth.

The Fed chair explained that higher interest rates will bring down inflation but they will also cause some pain to households and businesses. “These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,” he said.

What was the inflation reading in the US and what does it imply?

The US Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on September 13 showed that August CPI increased at an annual pace of 8.3 percent, more than economists’ median estimate of 8.1 percent.

This hotter-than-expected reading led to a perception that there will be an even more aggressive monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve next week in its policy meeting, cementing bets of a large 75-basis-point interest rate hike.

How does Powell’s speech and higher inflation affect Indian IT companies?

Outlook for the US and Europe is important for Indian IT companies as the bulk of their revenues come from these markets.

The US and Europe together contributed around 86 percent to Indian IT firms’ revenues in FY22, ratings agency CRISIL recently highlighted.

Powell’s remarks and the higher-than-anticipated inflation print have stoked recession fears, which would mean a cutting back on IT spending by American and European corporates, which in turn would hit earnings growth of Indian IT companies.

According to analysts, North America contributes 61 percent to Infosys’ revenue and Europe 25 percent. North America and Latin America form 55 percent of revenues for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) while the UK and continental Europe constitute 30 percent. For Wipro, 60 percent of sales comes from the US and 28 percent from Europe.

How have IT stocks performed lately?

Shares of Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Wipro have slumped 16-42 percent in 2022 so far.

What is the outlook for the sector?

With the Indian IT sector already trading at 28 times its one-year forward P/E compared to its past 10-year P/E of 18 times, ICICI Securities believes much of the growth and earnings expectations over the next three years are factored into the share prices. Hence, the brokerage firm is cautiously optimistic after a three-year-long bullish stance on the sector.

JPMorgan on its part believes margins of IT companies will continue to take a hit in the medium term. It has turned more bearish on the sector.

CRISIL said resumption of travel and rising cost of hiring at a time of high attrition will moderate operating margins to the pre-pandemic level of about 23 percent this fiscal. Significant cost savings had driven margins to a peak of 26 percent in fiscal 2021, which then moderated to around 24 percent last fiscal.

Nomura has retained its cautious view on the sector. It sees more evidence of revenue slowdown ahead in the sector and added that slowing revenue and high inflation will likely dampen IT budgets.",669,-0.653562511006991

The market rebounded with the Nifty50 closing above the recent consolidation range rising 1.68 percent in the week ended September 9 following correction in the previous two weeks. The index is now more than 18 percent up from its June lows and is gradually gathering steam to reclaim the 18,000 mark with crucial support at 17,500, experts said.

The index rallied nearly 300 points to close above 17,800, while there was a bit of outperformance by the broader space as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 2 percent and 3.3 percent during the week.

Last week's rally was driven largely by IT, infrastructure, banks and metals, which gained 2-3.5 percent.

""Whenever financial counters contribute to the rally, it is construed as a healthy rally. Moreover, the most laggard heavyweight basket, IT, showed some encouraging signs towards the fag end of the week. This provided credence to the move and conviction to retest the recent psychological level of 18,000 in the week beginning September 12,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

He advised traders to continue with their recent ‘buy on declines’ strategy and use decline towards the support zone of 17,675 – 17,500 to add fresh longs.

Also, the broader end of the spectrum is clearly on a roll and hence, one should keep focusing on potential movers from the cash segment, which are likely to fetch higher returns, Sameet said.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 388-385 for potential short term targets of Rs 405 and Rs 427. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below the support of Rs 366.

Indian equities started the week gone by on a positive note despite SGX Nifty indicating a sluggish start. However, after surpassing the 17650 mark, the index slipped into a consolidation mode and for the remaining part of the session, we witnessed a slender range with undertone being strongly bullish. During the mid-week, markets had slightly turbulent moves, but we managed to weather them successfully.

In last couple of sessions, the oversold US market rebounded, which provided a much-needed trigger for Nifty to come out of the recent congestion phase. With some hint of profit booking on Friday, Nifty concluded the week convincingly above 17800 by adding 1.68 percent to the previous weekly close.

Domestic market has maintained its sturdy structure over the last couple of weeks amid a declining trend in the US. This clearly restricted our key indices to surpass the higher boundary of the consolidation range despite having an inherent strength. The moment global recovery took place, we witnessed a breakout from the sturdy wall of 17,700 – 17,800. Importantly, the banking space was the major charioteer in this rally with Nifty Bank clocking over 2.50 percent gains and closing at a 10-month high.

Whenever financial counters contribute, the rally should be construed as healthy. Moreover, IT heavyweights, which were top laggards, showed some encouraging signs towards the fag end of the week. This provided credence to the move and adds conviction to retest the recent psychological level of 18000 in the coming week itself. In fact, if global peers support, we will not be surprised to see it extending towards 18200 – 18350 levels.

We advise traders to continue with their recent ‘Buy on declines’ strategy and use decline towards the support zone of 17,675 – 17,500 to add fresh longs. Also, the broader end of the spectrum is clearly on a roll and hence, one should keep focusing on potential movers from the cash segment, which are likely to fetch higher returns.

Stock recommendations:

Carborundum Universal | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 952 | Upside: 8%

This stock has been gaining traction from the recent swing low of Rs 794 odd zones and gradually marched above all its major EMAs on the daily time frame. Simultaneously, in the last trading session, a strong volume-based breakout was witnessed that gauged momentum in the counter and is likely to carry the same in the comparable period.

Technically, the stock looks lucrative in the current zone and has the potential to surge upwards in the near future. Hence, we recommend buying for a near term target of Rs 952. Traders can participate by following strict stop loss at Rs 837.80.

Tech Mahindra | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1192 | Upside: 5%

The IT space finally showed early signs of revival on Friday and this Indian multi-national company was one of the few early entrants. Technically speaking, we can see stock prices recently oscillating within the boundaries of a ‘Horizontal Wedge’ pattern.

On Friday, the stock prices finally broke out from the upper trend line, thereby confirming a bullish breakout from this configuration. With this, we can also observe it traversing the 89-day EMA for the for the first time in last 5 months. Traders are advised to buy for a near term target of Rs 1192. The strict stop loss needs to be placed at Rs 1085.

2022-09-10 14:19:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/bengalurus-rain-related-infra-woes-reignites-wfh-debate-9156381.html,"As employers look to bring employees back to the office, the floods in Bengaluru’s IT corridor have reignited the work-from-home (WFH) debate.

Visuals of water-logged roads, citizens being rescued on boats and tractors, and employees stuck on a foot-over-bridge outside one of the city’s tech parks are feeding into this debate. Representatives of IT companies and industry bodies also met state IT minister Ashwath Narayan, who has promised to resolve issues by next year's monsoons.

For now, Wipro and TCS, among others, have given employees the option of working from home.

""All our associates at Bengaluru are safe. We are closely monitoring the situation and our delivery teams have been advised to exercise due caution,"" a TCS spokesperson said.

Experts say that come rain or shine, hybrid work — a mix of WFH and office — will continue.

Rituparna Chakraborty, founder, Teamlease Services, said the situation in Bengaluru is not likely to have any larger impact. A similar situation had happened in 2019 as well, she said.

Hybrid work the new reality

Harshvendra Soin, global chief people officer and head-marketing, Tech Mahindra, told Moneycontrol that employee well-being is a priority, and associates continue to have the flexibility to work from anywhere. “We expect this trend of hybrid working to ramp up,” he said.

Infosys HR head and EVP Richard Lobo told Moneycontrol the future of work is hybrid, and the company’s approach to return to work is balanced with “a focus on employee well-being and business continuity.”

“Through the use of technology, we would like to build on our experience over the past couple of years to offer our employees more freedom around when to work and where, as well as a wider choice of options around work facilities and teams,” he said, adding that the hybrid model being envisioned by Infosys enables wider access to talent.

“I believe a hybrid work environment — seamlessly working from home and office — will be the new reality, and Infosys is prepared for this, as well as ready to help our employees prepare for it. We recognise that it takes a bit of time to get used to the new way of doing things, but it’s the future,” he said.

Queries sent to L&T Infotech, HCL Technologies and Accenture didn't elicit responses at the time of publication.

Return to work will continue

One of the factors believed to hinder employees' willingness to return to work is shoddy infrastructure in larger cities such as Bengaluru, as it adds to the woes of the daily commute and other difficulties.

Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO, CIEL HR Services, says that incidents such as the recent floods in Bengaluru and other infrastructure-related problems can deter people from coming to work. They would rather remain in their hometowns and enjoy a better standard of living.

On the other hand, Teamlease's Chakraborty says the reasons for returning to work go beyond issues with commute.

“There is a huge case to be made in terms of why being in office, around your colleagues, your team, matters for your mental health, builds social capital, and improves the quality of engagement and ideation,” she said.

She added that people may have their own reasons for choosing to go back to the office. For instance, some people may not have the luxury of working from home.

Returning to office is a welcome change, but people want the flexibility of choosing when to go in. “There are some who want to permanently work from home, but more and more want to go to the office a few days of the week,” she said.

In fact, she explained that companies prefer senior leadership to be in office, because it is an important signal. “Most leaders also prefer to be in office,” she added.

CIEL's Mishra believes the future is going to be a mix of people who will be completely working remotely, some who will come to office some days of the week, and some who will be happy to come to office every day.

With employees preferring a hybrid work arrangement, the manager needs to have the skills required to manage a team remotely, Mishra said.

“The solution is to train your managers to manage a remote team. The solution is not to force everybody to come to the office and make them commute two hours. You will lose people if you do that,” he said.

Infrastructure woes

K. S. Viswanathan, VP, Industry Initiatives, National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM), who was among the people who met the IT minister to discuss the industry’s issues, told Moneycontrol that while only 30 percent of employees are returning to office, more would like to. The rains have had no impact on this, he said.

“Many people, especially youngsters, freshers joining the workforce, want to come to office,"" Vishwanathan said, adding that while the infrastructure has not been able to keep pace with the city’s exponential growth, the city was now augmenting the infrastructure, like the metro, roads, public transport, etc.

Despite the troubles India's Silicon Valley has faced recently due to the rains, Teamlease's Chakraborty says it is a blip, and that Bengaluru will continue to be the most attractive place in India for any job seeker or employer.",875,-0.08870323499043782
2022-09-08 13:56:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/it-companies-metaverse-ambitions-may-slow-as-clients-turn-cautious-9148131.html,"Representational image(Metaverse).

Since the beginning of 2022, Indian information technology companies have actively explored and expanded their metaverse offerings to help clients navigate this new and pathbreaking technology.

The metaverse is touted as the successor to the mobile internet. It is a virtual, immersive environment where one can be present in a digital avatar and interact with the avatars of other people.

Infosys started the Metaverse Foundry, where it developed over 100 use-cases. Tech Mahindra said during its Q1 earnings announcement that it had 60 active metaverse projects in the pipeline.

Now, amid global uncertainties and fears of a recession in the US, client spending on futuristic technologies like the metaverse is likely to slow down and IT companies will need to tread this path cautiously, analysts and senior executives said.

“Some industries are better-positioned to immediately benefit from the metaverse – gaming, media and entertainment, travel and retail – whereas for a few other industries, the use-cases and roadmaps might not be immediately clear, and generally for organisations here, metaverse-related initiatives are part of discretionary spends,” Nachiket Deshpande, chief operating officer of Larsen & Toubro Infotech, told Moneycontrol.

“We foresee some slowdown in these industries as they reallocate budgets to other technology projects that promise more immediate and tangible outcomes,” he added.

LTI’s clients in the metaverse space include global services companies, which are building advisory services or setting up retail metaverses for consumer companies.

Dynamic situation

Tech Mahindra, which has been strong with its emerging and futuristic technology segments, remains bullish on the opportunities in this segment but maintains that the macro situation remains dynamic.

“With appropriate measures in place like tackling inflationary pressure and managing hiring sprees, the Indian IT sector as a whole has managed to push against the fears of a recession here,” Rohit Anand, chief financial officer at Tech Mahindra said in response to Moneycontrol’s queries.

He said based on customer interactions, there hasn’t been any significant deviation from how the year started.

“But these are very dynamic scenarios. So, we have to continue to have those dialogue interventions… and continue to monitor it,” he said.

Any impact of an economic slowdown in the US will trickle down to India, but that will remain only for a short period, Anand said.

This comes as Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, which is a frontrunner in attempting to build a metaverse ecosystem, had to slow down its investment pace on such projects to overcome margin pressures.

What makes the metaverse big for IT service and consultancy companies is the interest and pace with which global giants Microsoft, Apple, and Google venture into this space and the rapid development of associated hardware and software products. Being in the exploratory phase, it is important for clients of IT companies to also be well-paced and benefit from first-mover advantages.

To cater to demand, IT companies had quickened hiring for metaverse-related skills like AR/VR, blockchain and AI over the past few quarters. According to a report from staffing firm Xpheno in March, there was an 8-10 percent increase in job openings in this space from January to March and hikes were as much as 80 percent.

Emails sent to Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies seeking comment on their metaverse plans didn’t elicit responses at the time of publication.

Reserved approach

According to Deshpande of LTI, most clients interested in the metaverse have either made their strategic investments and are moving forward with their planned implementation at full throttle or taking a more reserved approach.

“Their apprehensions are rooted in the fact that there are several unknowns and fewer points of reference at this time,” he said.

According to an LTI survey of 100 CXOs across North America, technology maturity and associated risks, user adoption, and the lack of skill sets were listed as the primary barriers. The survey also indicated that most CXOs seem to believe that mainstream adoption is three to five years away.

“It’s safe to say that we are in the early stages of metaverse technology and its implementation… However, with time, well-defined metrics around returns on investment, cost savings, and revenue growth will emerge and this will nudge more organisations to solidify their plans around the metaverse,” Deshpande said.

According to Ashutosh Sharma, head of research at Forrester Research India, the metaverse is still at an exploratory stage and clients are primarily enquiring about it and maybe carrying out a few pilot projects to figure out what works.

“At the same time, a lot of futuristic tech washing also happens, in the sense that they will claim that they’ve done this great thing using this new shiny tech, but you will discover it to be nothing but a tech-based solution dressed up as new,” he told Moneycontrol.

Sharma said large economies are a bit fragile at the moment due to soaring inflation and slowing growth and that’s a big risk in itself and will impact all service providers.

“But to cut the long story short, because of reduction in this discretionary spending, clients obviously would have cut down on some of these new trials and experimentation,” Sharma said.

No revenue impact

Sharma added that new as they are, futuristic technologies such as the metaverse and quantum computing contribute a very small fraction – less than even 1 percent – of revenue at IT companies. Even if spending goes down, immediate revenue flows won’t get impacted.

“This is something very new, very research-focussed at this moment. Companies try to use this tech as a new shiny object to attract clients. Reduced investments in them don't impact service providers and clients much,” he said.

Mrinal Rai, principal analyst at technology research firm ISG, said that not much client spending is actually happening on the metaverse and Web3 right now, though the technology has immense possibilities and opportunities in different industries.

“There are use-cases in banking and financial industry, travel, transportation, and, of course, entertainment, media and gaming. So there are different pockets of opportunities in this industry and everybody’s exploring. And when you call it the metaverse, it is not just one technology that’s getting implemented. There are building blocks in the metaverse, including non-fungible tokens and augmented reality,” he told Moneycontrol.

He said technologies that enable such an environment such as augmented reality and virtual reality have been around for some time. Although clients may not spend on the metaverse, they are working on implementing AR-VR-based technologies.

“And many of these Indian IT service providers already have clients that leverage AR-VR tech for industrial designing, digital engineering, or even in the workplace and collaboration phase,” Rai said.",1101,-0.044624046484629316

The issue of moonlighting by tech professionals has ignited a fresh debate, polarising opinions and raising thorny legal questions, though many believe that staff's gradual return to office floors will likely ease the concerns. Moonlighting refers to employees taking up side gigs to work on more than one job at a time.

With the vexed issue now in the spotlight, some industry watchers expect employers to consider extra safeguards to protect proprietary information and operating models, especially where employees are working remotely.

Companies, analysts say, could also turn tougher on exclusivity clauses in employment contracts. That said, employers may feel somewhat reassured as tech workers trickle back in, and the office cubicles start to get occupied more regularly. While the practice of moonlighting emerged as a big talking point after Wipro Chairman Rishad Premji flagged the issue, equating it to ""cheating"", the industry's take on it is rather divided.

Tech Mahindra CEO C P Gurnani tweeted recently that it is necessary to keep changing with the times and added, ""I welcome disruption in the ways we work."" IT industry veteran and former director of Infosys, Mohandas Pai told PTI that low entry-level salary in tech industry has contributed to moonlighting.

During the pandemic, Pai said, there was a surge in gig opportunities as ""everything went digital"".

""If you don't pay people well, they say I want to earn more money and here is the easy way of earning well because technology is available...I get paid in dollars very well, I can earn more... and so that is attractive,"" he observed.

Pai contends that salaries of freshers in the software industry have not seen much improvement in the last 10 years, and professionals are, in fact, ""underpaid"" in the first 3-4 years of their career.

""The gig economy has opened up, and there are lot of gig platforms globally where one can register and work for anybody around the world. And they will pay for pieces of work,"" he explained. Pai feels that while employees should not indulge in outside work during the time committed to their companies, nor leverage intellectual property, asset or resources of their employers for other purposes, individuals' free time is their own. ""Outside that time (work hours), what you do, is your problem,"" he asserted.

Pai estimates that 6-8 per cent of people indulge in moonlighting now, as against 1-2 per cent earlier. Tech workers agree moonlighting gained ground after the onset of COVID-19 triggered 'work from home'. The overnight shift to remote working did away with long commutes, bringing relatively more fluid work schedules.

It also yielded new opportunities for juggling smaller side projects in the free time for those keen enough to take them up. An employee working for a prominent tech company said that while the practice is not rampant, instances of moonlighting are not unheard of in IT circles. Work schedules, at the start of the pandemic, were not uniform and lean periods offered plenty of bandwidth.

Before COVID, physical presence at office also acted like a mental firewall, another IT professional said on conditions of anonymity, adding that when the pandemic struck, plenty of gigs from website development to app creation were up for grabs. Being short duration stints, these one-off projects were also seen by some as quick ways to supplement income. Since they did not involve full-time engagement, workers opting for such side jobs did not see it as a direct conflict of interest.

Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES), a Pune-based union, says extra freelance work done by an individual in their own time utilising their personal resources is ""justified"". ""If employment letter mentions working for 9-12 hours daily, and in case in that time slot the person is not working for the company or is giving that time to another organisation, that can be termed as a breach. However, after office hours what the individual does is their own prerogative,"" observed Harpreet Singh Saluja, president of NITES.

P V Ramana Murthy, Head of Employment and Labor Laws, Economic Laws Practice (ELP), believes clarity in the contracts and full transparency will reduce disputes and also bring down the cost of labour, enabling flexibility for both the employer and employees.

""As of now, there is no clarity in the employment contracts and no prohibition under the Indian employment law, (except under the Factories Act, where dual employment is prohibited for workmen). Moonlighting falls under the grey zone,"" according to Murthy. Vaibhav Bhardwaj, Partner at Induslaw, says as most of the organisations are returning to normalcy and requiring employees to work out of the office, it would be difficult for staff to moonlight.

Several employers are considering more protective safeguards with respect to proprietary information, policies and operating models, especially in cases of remote working, said Pooja Ramchandani, Partner, Employment Law, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas and Co.

""It's not just IT companies, across industries employment contracts have exclusivity clauses, clauses on conflict of interest and obligations to serve only one employer during the period of employment. Moonlighting falls foul of these provisions,"" Ramchandani added.",845,0.32086961136923897

Emkay Global Financial's report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra’s Q1FY23 revenue was broadly in line with our expectations, but EBITM missed our estimates. Revenue grew by 1.5% QoQ to USD1,632mn (3.5% CC), led by CME (3.9%) and Enterprise (3.2%). EBITM declined 220bps QoQ to 11%. Net new deal wins were robust with a TCV of USD802mn in Q1. The deal pipeline remains healthy across the CME and Enterprise segments, and the company expects steady deal closures and revenue conversion to continue. Management remains confident of sustaining revenue growth momentum on the back of broad-based demand, healthy deal intake and strong deal pipeline. It believes EBITM has bottomed out in Q1 and expects 100-150bps sequential margin improvement in every quarter for the next three quarters, leading to an exit quarter margin of ~14%.

Outlook

We cut our FY23/FY24/FY25 EPS estimates by 3.3%/1.8%/0.3%, factoring in the Q1 performance. Sustained revenue growth momentum, management guidance on margin recovery and 4%+ dividend yield make the risk-reward favorable, in our view. We maintain Buy with a TP of Rs1,240 (Rs1,260 earlier) at 17x Jun’24E EPS.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tech Mahindra

TechM reported revenue of USD 1632mn, 1.5% QoQ USD (Ple: 1.2%, Cons: 1.1%) and 3.5% QoQ CC (Ple: 2.7%, Cons: 2.8%). Growth is healthy in CC terms, for both Communications (3.9% QoQ CC) and Enterprise (3.2% QoQ CC). Net new TCV was muted at USD 802mn (-1.6% YoY, -21% QoQ). In Communication- demand is driven by automation, data integration on cloud and network modernization. Deal pipeline is healthy with no signs of sector wide slowdown in tech spends. However, management indicated that there may be reprioritization of spends for specific customers. EBIT margin declined further to 11%, -220bps QoQ, -411bps YoY. In Q2FY23, annual wage increment is expected to have 100bps impact on margins. Management expects margins to improve from Q2FY23 and targets to reach 14% margin by Q4FY23 led by tailwinds from utilization, offshore mix and operating efficiencies. Plus, seasonal and one-off costs in Q1 will not be there in Q2.

Outlook

Our EPS estimates decrease by 5%/2% for FY23/24, led by cut in margin estimates. We continue to value TechM on TM of 15x to arrive at TP of Rs.1042. TechM is currently trading at 17x/15x on FY23/24 EPS of INR 59/69 with Revenue/EPS CAGR of 10.4%/4.6% over FY22-24. Maintain Hold.

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra’s (TechM) Q1FY2023 revenue was ahead of estimates, but EBIT margin lagged our estimates; Q1 saw strong deal intake, healthy deal pipeline, and good client mining. However, top accounts growth and cash generation remained weak. TechM is well poised to deliver strong revenue growth in the medium term, given strong deal wins, healthy deal pipeline, rising spending on 5G by telecom operators, and higher demand for cloud, connectivity, engineering, and XDS practices. Though wage revision is expected to weigh on Q2FY2023 margin, it would be offset by pricing leverage, recovery in the mobility business, and absence of large deal transition expenses. Management expects 100-150 bps q-o-q margin expansion in each quarter in FY2023.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy recommendation on TechM with a revised PT of Rs. 1,220, given robust deal wins, rising 5G spends, and reasonable valuation. The stock trades at 14x its FY2024E EPS.

Google announced on July 27 that it is relaunching Street View on Google Maps in India, more than a decade after the service was suspended in the country for failing to secure the requisite security clearances from the government.

This time around, the internet giant is partnering with two local firms - 3D mapping content and geospatial solutions firm Genesys International and IT services firm Tech Mahindra - to offer the service to Indian consumers.

Street View's India rollout is the first time that Google has tied up with local partners to offer the service to consumers, a model it hopes to scale in other parts of the world as well.

Google said the service will initially be available in 10 cities including Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune, Nashik, Vadodara, Ahmednagar, and Amritsar with plans to expand it to more than 50 cities by the end of 2022.

Users will be able to access this feature by opening the Google Maps app, zooming into a road in any of these cities and tapping the area they want to see. The idea is to provide users with an experience as good as walking down the road on their desktop or mobile phone.

The company claims that it has licensed fresh imagery from its local partners spanning over 150,000 km across these ten cities. It also plans to offer Street View APIs to local developers to help them deliver richer mapping experiences in their services.

""We believe the launch of Street View in India will be instrumental in delivering a more helpful user experience, from virtually visiting locations to getting a better sense of local businesses and establishments,"" said Miriam Karthika Daniel, VP - Google Maps Experiences.

""We remain committed to collaborating with local organizations and the government as we work toward delivering even more useful features and information on Maps. We will continue to do this responsibly, enabling accurate, authentic, and trustworthy information,"" Daniel added.

To be sure, Google Maps has been offering 360-degree Street View imagery in the country, albeit in a limited fashion. It currently provides these imagery for several monuments such as Taj Mahal, Khajuraho, Qutub Minar, Red Fort, and Ajanta and Ellora Caves through a partnership with Archaeological Survey of India in 2013 as well as certain private properties such as Sula Vineyards. The service is currently available in more than 40 countries across the world.

Licensing route due to new policy

Google, which typically collects street-level imagery for the service by itself through cars and bikes fitted with cameras, had to take the licensing route in India due to the country's recent geospatial policy which requires that only local entities acquire, collect, store and own the imagery data.

Genesys International, which recently closed a Rs 250 crore funding round led by Malabar India Fund, was the first company in India to launch the street imagery immersive content for all major Indian cities.

""Our fleet is still swiftly photographing Indian cities, bringing to life our city's amazing tapestry of streets and landmarks and allowing us to comfortably visit our old neighbourhoods or plan our trips. We are delighted to be a part of the Google Street View programme, and we feel that our partnership will go a long way towards offering the most helpful and engaging mapping experience for people and customers across India,"" said Sajid Malik, Managing Director of Genesys International.

Birendra Sen, Business Head, Business Process Services at Tech Mahindra said that the GIS (Geographic Information Systems) industry has grown manifold with time, due to increased data availability and the development of smart cities all over the world and their partnership with Google is another step towards delivering high-quality and immersive mapping experiences to people in India.

Sen said they are mounting cameras onto the cars and e-rickshaws from Mahindra and Mahindra and driving them through the street to manually collect data and license it to Google.

The company aims to collect about 700,000 kilometers of mapping data over the next couple of years, he said.",714,0.6325597167015076

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra reported a steady decline in operating margins and deal wins both on a sequential basis and year-on-year basis in the three months ended June 30.

All five companies missed their profit estimates as well in the first quarter. Profitability was hit as margins came under pressure on the back of supply side pressure, as IT companies gave wage hikes in the three months ended June even as they spent more on sub-contracting.

Analysts believe the IT sector will confront softer demand and higher overhead costs going ahead although company executives maintain a positive outlook, expecting a turnaround on a steady demand pipeline even as they keep a close watch on macro headwinds.

""Results were lacklustre across top IT companies. Deal wins were down, margins took a hit. The deal wins seem to be slowing down and we could be in for pain in FY 24. We expect the demand to fall further by December, consequently the commentary on growth will also be softer,"" an analyst tracking the sector said on condition of anonymity.

Cost-saving and margin-protecting measures such as off-shoring and controls on travel and operating costs are in reverse mode, said Amit Chandra, Deputy Vice President, HDFC Securities.

“In a scenario when you are heavy with cost and demand seems to be softening, your margins take a hit and you will take a while to adjust to the new cost structure,” Chandra told Moneycontrol.

In the second half of the year, Chandra sees topline growth normalising and margins starting to expand, and believes margins will bottom out either in Q1 or Q2.

Cost savings will accrue from replacing lateral hires who are leaving with freshers, he said.

As people with 3 to 5 years of experience leave, their work is either being subcontracted or they are being replaced by costlier hires, exerting double impact on company margins.

Employee costs

Samir Sekaria, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) at TCS, said on an earnings call that salary increases that kicked in from April 1 had a 1.5 percent impact on the operating margin.

“Continued supply-side challenges entailed additional expenses, such as backfilling expenses and higher subcontractor usage. This and normalizing travel expenses negated various operational efficiencies, resulting in an operating margin of 23.1 percent, a sequential contraction of 1.9 percent,” Sekaria explained.

He added that the Q1 margin was subdued, and the company was looking at “clawing it back.” The company’s aim is for a margin in excess of 25 percent.

TCS Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Rajesh Gopinathan said the demand environment and workforce attrition was leading to increased operating costs.

“Attrition is not totally unanticipated but it is continuing and we think that probably it will take another few more months before it will start to come down. So, till then the margin pressures will continue but we hope to sequentially improve from where we are,” he added.

Attrition, salary hikes

Infosys CEO Nilanjan Roy said the industry doesn’t operate in a vacuum, and attrition trends were similar across the industry, and that the levels had started to come down. The company’s salary hikes for senior employees, which will happen in July, will impact margins a little, but not at the level in Q1, he said.

Demand dipped in Q1 because of seasonality factors, but supply-side pressures continued, resulting in cost of talent acquisition and transition, HCL Technologies CFO Prateek Aggarwal said.

Aggarwal said higher travel, visa and outsourcing costs, and employee retention and attrition costs had dented margins. HCL’s margin during Q1 was 17%, having declined over the last five quarters. The company maintained its margin guidance of 18-20%.

“Bill rate enhancements, successes in pockets are expected to pick up steam in the next few quarters and cost initiatives in terms of fresher billing and pyramid optimization as well as utilization improvement, offshoring of work, automation initiatives, and optimizing the outsource spend, subcontractor costs are the levers that we are banking on to get back into the guided range on margins,” Aggarwal said.

Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte said during an analyst call that he believes the operating margin had bottomed out, and blamed the lower Q1 margin on investments.

CFO Jatin Dalal said the company was using the pyramid model, which involves having more employees with less experience at the bottom, which will help keep costs low, and fewer employees higher up, to improve margins.

“That is the only lever which can reduce the cost pressure that we have seen in the last 18 months,” he said, adding that attrition moderating should help as the company had been paying new employees a premium to replace those with similar capabilities and experience.

Tech Mahindra CFO Rohit Anand said the Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) margin in the first quarter had fallen 220 basis points on a sequential basis to 11% because of factors including higher salaries, deal transition costs and seasonality.

Is deal pipeline drying up?

“Margins have bottomed out but growth numbers are still to moderate, I think the bigger risk is to the growth number,” said Chandra of HDFC Securities.

Girish Pai, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities, told Moneycontrol, “On deal wins, it seems to kind of be cooling off and seems to indicate probably that there is a demand issue developing. When you discuss issues regarding this with the management, they generally say that as of now, things are okay. HCL Tech made an interesting comment that the demand situation is looking better than what it did three months back.”

Pai said his team was the first to downgrade the IT sector even before the fourth quarter results in early April 2022. “We had said that FY23 margin is going to be a problem, and demand is going to be a problem in FY24,” he said.

Analysts noticed that the latest commentary by IT companies on demand had become muted to what they were saying three months back.

“The way I see this sector play out is there's a lot of time-wise correction. There's been one price correction and we keep reacting to the news flow coming from the US. So, my take is that the US news flow will incrementally deteriorate as we go towards the end of 2022. It'll probably weaken substantially in the first half of 2023,” Pai explained.​",1093,-0.3431481619675954

Hiring and attrition remained pain points for information technology (IT) companies in the first quarter of the 2023 financial year amid an ongoing battle for tech talent.

The top five IT companies — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra — cumulatively added a net 59,704 employees in the three months ended June, including freshers and lateral hires.

Net additions at TCS, HCL and Infosys declined sequentially but Wipro and Tech Mahindra reported an increase. On a sequential basis, overall net additions were significantly down across these five companies, which had hired 85, 720 new employees in the three months ended March.

On a year-on-year basis, the number was an improvement over the first quarter of the last financial year, when these companies had hired 41,471 people.

The attrition rate inched up at Infosys, TCS and HCL nd moderated at Wipro and Tech Mahindra.

Hiring has been muted at many IT companies in the quarter, but hiring plans for FY23 are broadly on track, said Piyush Pandey, Lead Analyst - Institutional Equities, YES Securities.

“Freshers also generally join from Q2 onwards so that also explains lower hiring for Q1. A few of these companies had slightly lower utilisation (due to big hiring in FY22) and have sufficient room to grow just by increasing utilisation,” Pandey said.

In FY23, TCS plans to hire 40,000 freshers, Infosys has guided for 50,000, Wipro 38,000, HCL 35,000 and Tech Mahindra around 10,000.

The difference in net additions this quarter at the top IT companies is a result of which of them reacted to the surge in demand cycle first when the pandemic broke out, and started hiring in large numbers consequentially, said Amit Chandra, Deputy Vice President, HDFC Securities.

Also read: TCS attrition rises to 19.7% in Q1FY23, 14,136 employees added during the quarter

“Some companies started hiring early, and the maximum bulk of hiring happened last year. Some started a bit late. So that's why the quarter-on-quarter variation you are seeing,” Chandra said.

“The general trend is that TCS started hiring a bit early, and Infosys, they're still hiring. You have to see this from the point of view of what happened pre-pandemic. For the last 3-4 years these companies didn't hire much,” Chandra told Moneycontrol.

Broadening of the pyramid

The hiring trends have been closely related to cost control and hence the operating margins of the IT companies. Over the past five-six quarters, these margins have been consistently declining, with many expecting them to bottom out in another quarter before starting to improve.

Wipro Chief Financial Officer Jatin Dalal said employee costs have had key impact on margins, calling “pyramid and fresher improvement” a key lever to improving margins.

The pyramid model involves having more employees with less experience at the bottom, which will help keep costs low, and fewer employees higher up the pyramid.

Dalal said Wipro intends to double fresher hiring from last year’s level adding that the company’s ability to “correct the pyramid through consistent improvement of the base and moving people up through the pyramid would be a big structural lever.”

Trainee bench

TCS Chief Executive Officer Rajesh Gopinathan shared a similar outlook, stating that Q1 was a lighter quarter comparatively for trainee absorption by the company, with Q2 and Q3 being the main periods for hiring.

“Last year, we had gone very aggressive and hired through the year to build up a more than 100,000 trainee bench. This year is more normal. We're progressing well on that 40,000 [fresher hiring] mark,” he said.

Also read: Wipro Q1 net additions buck industry trend

C Vijayakumar, CEO of HCL Technologies, attributed the decline in net hiring from 11,000 in Q4FY22 to 2,089 in Q1FY23 to additional capacity created by hiring of both freshers and laterals.

""We have not moderated any hiring based on any demand environment. It's really to increase our utilization and better deployment of freshers,” he said, adding that the company plans to take onboard 10,000 freshers in Q2.

Pre-pandemic, IT companies didn’t hire much and concentrated on adoption of automation, for which “the industry is paying the price” now, said HDFC Securities’ Chandra.

With the pandemic leading to a sudden increase in demand for tech services, attrition was extremely high, especially among employees who had over three years of experience or were in the five-eight-year experience bracket.

Companies are aware that bringing freshers into the billing cycle takes a period of six-eight months, Chandra said.

The IT services company on July 25 reported a 24.8 percent sequential decline in profit at 1,132 crore for the quarter ended June 2022 due to pressure in margin performance amid wage hikes and increase in travel and visa costs.

Its profit for the March-ended quarter stood at Rs 1,506 crore. The company’s profit dipped 16.4 percent on a year-on-year basis from Rs 1,353 crore achieved during the corresponding quarter of last financial year.

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company after the June quarter earnings:

Sharekhan

TechM’s strong capabilities in 5G areas will help it to win more 5G deals across telecom ecosystems. However, the company’s exposure towards discretionary spends in engineering, experience design services, and network modernisation would remain vulnerable during recessionary times.

We continue to prefer TechM, given improving 5G deals in the telecom space, continued growth in the BPS and XDS businesses, good deal wins, and scope for margin improvement. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a revised price target (PT) of Rs 1,220.

JPMorgan

Foreign broking firm JPMorgan has kept 'overweight' rating on the stock and cut the target price to Rs 1,100 from Rs 1,200 per share.

The company reported good growth but margin was disappointed. The undemanding valuations keep US overweight, said JP Morgan.

It has raised revenue estimate by 1 percent but cut margin by 50 bps, reported CNBC-TV18.

Nomura

Brokerage house Nomura has maintained the 'buy' rating on the stock and cut the target to Rs 1,270 per share.

The growth was marginally better, but margin disappoints. However, strong revenue performance led by the broad-based growth, said Nomura.

The deal wins set the stage for strong growth in FY23. The margin is likely bottomed in Q1, and likely to improve in remaining FY23.

Nomura lowered the FY23-24 EPS estimates by 6-9 percent, reported CNBC-TV18.

Jefferies

Broking firm Jefferies has maintained hold rating on the stock with a target at Rs 1,070 per share. The revenue growth was slightly ahead of estimates.

The deal wins at $802 million was healthy and the pipeline remains robust.

The margin delivery has been weak and commentary of 14 percent exit margin in FY23 and 14 percent+ margin in FY24 seems optimistic.

The valuations are appealing, but with risks of consensus earnings downgrades, reported CNBC-TV18.

At 9:17am, Tech Mahindra was quoting at Rs 1,028.60, up Rs 12.05, or 1.19 percent on the BSE.

Tech Mahindra on July 25 said it is currently working on 60 metaverse projects across 25 clients globally. The IT services company, which announced this during its Q1FY23 results, clocked in $802 million total contract value (TCV) of deal wins for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, in line with the management’s estimations.

In Q4FY22, TCV of deals stood at $1.01 billion while in the same quarter (Q1) last year, it was at $805 million.

“It (metaverse) is one of our fastest growing verticals, we announced this practice in February this year. We are already working on about 60 projects globally and for 25 customers. They are coming from Edtech, Retail, automotive deal management, repair and maintenance of cars--- we are seeing different kinds of customer base but it is clearly one of our fastest growing verticals,” CP Gurnani, CEO and MD, Tech Mahindra said while addressing the media.

In terms of overall deal wins, communications, media and entertainment (CME) grew 19.1 percent YoY, which contributes over 40 percent to Tech Mahindra’s revenue. Technology vertical grew by 30.3 percent YoY and BFSI grew about 20 percent YoY.

Profit plunged

Tech Mahindra’s profit took a hit in Q1, declining 24.8 percent on a sequential basis to Rs. 1,132 crore from Rs. 1, 506 crore last quarter, accounting for pressure in margin performance given the ongoing wage hikes and increase in travel costs.

On a YoY basis, profit was down by 16.4 percent.

“On profitability, considering the investments that we are making, and the fact that we are building new practices, was hit. Overall, we remain positive of our deal pipeline and more enthusiastic about our ability to harness from that deal pipeline. We are happy about the overall investments we made in 5G, IoT, cloud and now in metaverse, all coming together. There’s still a lot of work to be done,” said Gurnani.

He added, “We are confident that we will be presenting to you industry leading growth over the next few quarters, we are also confident that we will have an opportunity to work on the profitability levers. We have identified where we would focus and in the next few quarters we are determined to work on and deliver profitability.”

Remains ‘watchful’

Just like peers TCS and L&T Infotech (LTI), Tech Mahindra addressed a the performance with an air of caution due to the ongoing macro headwinds.

Gurnani highlighted, “In different parts of the world, there are signs of worry regarding the economic headwinds, related to inflation, energy crisis and how different sectors will respond if there’s a slowdown. Tech Mahindra has looked at all sectors and what-if scenarios, and all I can say is we as Tech Mahindra will continue to deliver stronger performance.”",498,-0.19269464612007142

Bucking the industry trend of the last five quarters, IT services company Tech Mahindra reported a decline in attrition rate (last-twelve-month basis) which stood at 22 percent for the first quarter ended June 30, 2022, as compared to 24 percent in Q4FY22.

Though the attrition rate is still higher than Q1FY22 which came in at 17 percent.

The company added 6,862 new hires in Q1, taking its total headcount to 158,035.

Tech Mahindra had added around 6,106 new hires in Q4FY22 and 5,209 in the same quarter last year.

In terms of freshers hiring, Tech Mahindra had added around 10,000 freshers in FY22 and targets to add a similar number in FY23.

He added, ""In general when an industry goes through a rapid surge, there is shock with attrition rate running at 23-24%, I think that shock stage is now coming down. Earlier we used to plan our business at 17-18% attrition, which I estimate it to be in the next two quarters.”

The company is also actively creating campuses and hiring talent from the Tier-II and Tier-III markets. In an earlier interview with Moneycontrol, Gurnani shared that he won’t be surprised if 20 percent of the company’s talent came from Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities in less than two years.

Software services company Tech Mahindra is likely to record a double-digit on-quarter decline in profit because of a shrinking operating margin for the quarter ended June 2022 and a high base in corresponding previous quarter due to tax-related benefits.

Revenue growth in constant currency terms, however, may be in the range of 2-3.6 percent for the quarter on a sequential basis. The numbers will be released on July 25.

Since the record high, the stock has corrected 44 percent and has been in a downtrend, though there was an intermittent bounce back. Even after hitting June lows, it was a rangebound trade in the stock but there was a significant breakout of the long downsloping trendline on July 18, followed by a further run-up.

The stock has not only broken out of a long downward sloping trendline from its record high between (1,838 on December 30, 2021) and July 8, but also another downward sloping trendline between March 25 and July 8 this year, indicating some kind of bullish trend.

It is a seasonally weak quarter for Tech Mahindra due to seasonal weakness in its telecom business Comviva, while the growth is likely to be driven by the enterprise segment.

Kotak Institutional Equities, ICICI Direct and Sharekhan expect profit to decline in the range of 18-30 percent sequentially dented by operating profit margin.

""Profit after tax is expected to decline 17.9 percent quarter-on-quarter due to weak operating performance and also due to tax-related one-time benefit in Q4FY22,"" ICICI Direct said.

On the top line front, the brokerages expect 3.2-3.6 percent sequential growth in revenue, and revenue growth in constant currency can be 2-2.6 percent QoQ.

""We forecast sequential revenue growth of 2.6 percent in constant currency driven by (1) 2.4 percent growth on an organic basis and (2) 20 bps contribution from Thirdware acquisition. Growth will be led by the enterprise vertical. Seasonal weakness in Comviva will lead to weaker growth in telecom,"" Kotak Institutional Equities.

The lower revenue growth, wage hike, an increase in travel expenses will be impacting the operating margin of the company during the quarter ended June 2022.

Kotak expects an EBIT margin decline of 210 bps QoQ and 400 bps YoY. ""Sequential decline can be attributed to—(1) 120 bps from wage revision, (2) 90-100 bps from an increase in visa costs and Comviva seasonality, and (3) 50 bps+ from an increase in travel and G&A costs.""

Also read - ICICI Bank posts 50% growth in Q1 profit at Rs 6,905 crore, provisions decline sharply

ICICI Direct also feels EBIT margin is expected to decline by 206 bps QoQ on a sequential basis owing to wage revision, retention expenses, and increasing travel expenses, which will be partially offset by currency tailwinds.

The deal wins for the quarter ended June 2022 could be in the range of $750-800 million, the brokerages said.

Key things to watch out for would be a commentary on-demand environment amid the recent series of macro events; deal pipeline and win rates; attrition rates, telecom deal momentum especially related to 5G networks; commentary on enterprise business, especially the BFSI, healthcare, and manufacturing verticals; margin trajectory and pricing environment in light of supply-side pressures and increasing travel expenses; and M&A strategy and payout plans.

Tech Mahindra and Mahindra University have signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a new 'Makers Lab' for research and development in quantum computing, explainable artificial intelligence and Metaverse. Tech Mahindra already has 10 Makers Lab across the world and the new unit at Mahindra University will be the 11th facility globally and second in Hyderabad.

Emphasising the need to focus on development of quantum computing, Tech Mahindra MD and CEO CP Gurnani told PTI, the industry is looking at data explosion with growth in cloud computing, data centres and 5G driving the change in the present computing system. ""I think the basics of quantum computing is quantum physics. Quantum physics clearly shows that there is always this inflection point and then after that, either the current hardware or the quant developers will be able to suddenly create magic. My only personal belief is that the pressure on the systems will come in because of the data explosion,"" he said.

Mahindra University Vice Chancellor Yajulu Medury said that one of the best things about the MoU is that it is an academia-industry collaboration. ""We have a lot of faculty in quantum physics, AI area, etc but this is actually work getting channelized into the forefront of industry-driven areas. Whether you talk about quantum computing, 5G, our faculty is now able to work with Tech Mahindra Makers Lab and other people and look at various ways of actually taking more industry-oriented work,"" Medury said.

As a part of the partnership, the students of Mahindra University will get an opportunity to work on intellectual properties made within the Makers Lab and get deployed in R&D projects on the campus. The students will also collaborate with coding groups like Engima within the university to get access to projects, internships, and employment opportunities.

Tech Mahindra Global Head for Makers Lab, Nikhil Malhotra said quantum computing is at a very nascent stage and there's a lot of noisy structure coming in. ""This partnership is all about what is the future of Quantum Technology. We are seeing two or three major things. One is in the drug design industry because we are essentially seeing that quantum can actually take over the space for molecule designs much better than the current AI systems. That's a huge huge market in terms of the drug design industry,"" he said.

Makers Lab will focus on the effect of quantum on image optimisation for satellites etc and explore work on explainable AI(artificial intelligence) in collaboration with Mahindra University, Malhotra said. Explainable AI helps in presenting data in a manner that can be understood by humans.",437,0.9999816417694092

HCL Technologies reported new deal wins worth a total contract value (TCV) of $2.05 billion in the first quarter of FY23 ended June 30, 2022, growing 23.4 percent YoY as compared to the same quarter last year.

The deal wins were driven by services and product and platform verticals. TCV from services stood at $ 1.95 billion after bagging seven net new large deals. The product and platform business, which had declined by 24 percent QoQ last quarter, has started recovering, helping HCL bag nine net new large product deal wins and $104 million in revenue.

However, the overall deal wins is slightly lower on a QoQ basis as compared to the TCV of $2.26 billion reported in Q4FY22.

HCL Tech had a strong booking this quarter with 16 deals across life sciences, healthcare, manufacturing, financial services and technology segments. It’s a mix of large and mid-sized deals.

C Vijayakumar, CEO & MD, HCL Technologies said, “FY23 started on a strong note. Revenue grew 2.7 percent sequentially and 15.6 percent YoY in constant currency. Our services business grew 19 percent YoY. Our growth momentum was led by ER&D services and digital applications services with cloud transformation being a central feat across all verticals and solutions.”

He added, “We also saw strong recovery in product and platform business which grew 5.1 percent sequentially and 1.4 percent YoY in constant currency. We posted an EBIT performance of 17 percent this quarter. Margins in services business are under pressure mainly due to an increase in talent costs and transition costs. We have undertaken appropriate actions to improve our profitability profile, the results of which will start reflecting in coming quarters.”

Margin improvement initiatives for the company include both revenue and cost levers led by innovative pricing, rate increases and optimisation of the operating costs, both people and non-people.

Segment-wise growth came from engineering and R&D (ER&D) services which led with a 3.7 percent QoQ growth, followed by ITBS with a 2 percent growth QoQ.

HCL Tech is also getting more large-sized end-to-end engineering services deals, signing two large ones in Q1, one with a European ISP (internet service provider) and one with a global ISP.

Starting this quarter, HCL will be reporting services and product businesses separately.

Geographically, growth was led by Europe (22.5 percent), Americas (17.5 percent) and ROW (18.2 percent).",399,0.7619184255599976

This was the first quarter ever since the organisational restructuring of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) came into being in April 2022. At its Q1FY23 results on July 8, TCS gave a glimpse of how this is playing out.

Through this restructuring, TCS had divided its clients into four distinctive business groups depending on the clients' journey with the IT major instead of verticals and geographies. These were acquisition group, relationship incubation group, enterprise group and finally business transformation group.

Speaking at the earnings meet, senior executives shared that the relationship incubation group grew over 5 percent this quarter in terms of revenue growth from the clients in that category while business transformation group reported 5.6 percent growth in revenue. Meanwhile, enterprise group grew over 17 percent but on a YoY basis.

N Ganapathy Subramaniam, COO, TCS said, “Overall the growth has been broad based across the three distinctive groups we have created. Moving forward we will give more details on how we are performing in each of these groups, but I am pleased to say that Business Transformation Group clocked 5.6 percent growth this quarter. Likewise, Relationship Incubation Group has also had above 5 percent growth and Enterprise Group also grew more than 17 percent YoY.”

“The organisation has come together very smoothly. Transitions are almost complete. In fact, front-end transitions are all complete. Some of the backend transitions are still ongoing. Overall, we are quite happy with the progress. This has injected fresh energy into the teams. The world approached to curated customer journeys, that has resonated with very strongly with our teams and customers,” said Rajesh Gopinathan, CEO & MD, TCS.

Gopinathan added, “All of this should give us good buoyancy but I don’t want to be drawn to be giving a specific number. The proof point of that will not be on the revenue side, but we are expecting a greater vibrancy on the bottom end of our client pyramid as they make the progression from lower revenue band to the upper revenue band. That is one metric that will give an idea of how good the structure is, but you need to give it time to really deliver on those strategic drivers.”

Earlier today, the IT services major announced its Q1 results, clocking in Rs 9,478 crore in net profit, a jump of 5.21 percent YoY against Rs 9,008 crore in the same quarter last year. On a QoQ basis though, it was down 4.51 percent.

The IT services major plans to hire 1,000 associates in FY22-23 for this 10,000 sq. ft. campus to tap local talent and provide flexibility to existing associates wanting to work from their hometowns.

Earlier in an interview with Moneycontrol, Tech Mahindra CEO and MD CP Gurnani said he won’t be surprised if more than 20 percent of the company’s talent supply comes from tier-2 or tier-3 cities in less than two years.

Information technology (IT) companies will kick off the first-quarter earnings season in July amid expectations they will post strong revenue growth, offset by pressure on profit margins exerted by higher. wage costs. IT companies including Infosys and HCL Technologies are unlikely to change their full-year guidance despite concerns of a recession in the US and Europe, analysts said.

Major IT companies typically announce their earnings for the three months ended June in the first fortnight of July, with Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services leading the pack.

The earnings season follows a tumultuous quarter marked by worries over the Russia-Ukraine war, accelerating inflation and tightening of interest rates by global central banks to cool it, supply-chain disruptions, and tumbling financial markets.

IT stocks have fallen the most among sectors, with the Nifty IT index correcting 29 percent from its high in January. Higher valuations and rising fears of an economic slowdown, even recession, in the US and Europe, the biggest markets for IT companies, weighed on the sector.

On a sequential basis, IT companies are expected to post diverging results because of sequential factors although they are expected to report strong year-on-year growth, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report.

Infosys will lead the way with revenue growth of 4.5 percent on a sequential basis, followed by TCS at 3.6 percent, the securities firm said. Seasonal weakness will dampen growth at Tech Mahindra, Wipro, and HCL Technologies, which may report 2.4-2.8 percent constant currency growth in revenue quarter-on-quarter, it said.

Among mid-tier companies, Mphasis is expected to report a weak quarter because of a likely decline in Business Process Outsourcing (BPO business linked to mortgage origination and refinancing. L&T Infotech may report modest 3.1 percent growth due to lower pass-through revenue while Mindtree will lead the way.

Before this year's correction in the Nifty IT index, the sector had had a healthy run-up since the outbreak of the pandemic, benefiting from the increasing adoption of digital media by students and salaried individuals cooped up indoors because of lockdowns.

""As the probability of a recession in the US has increased, there are renewed concerns in some cases around a slowdown in discretionary IT spends and this, coupled with lofty valuations, has resulted in a downward adjustment in stock prices,"" Siddharth Mehta, founder, and investment chief at Bay Capital said.

Dhananjay Sinha, Managing Director, Head Strategist, and Economist - Equity Research at JM Financial Institutional Securities said the valuation of IT companies is now closer to fair value after the recent correction in their stock prices. Feedback from companies suggests that their revenue outlook is intact so far.

""There may be some downside due to an eventual recession. But it may be temporary as we see structural tailwinds for IT spending by US companies over the longer horizon. A potential recession or an economic slowdown could ease the wage cost pressure for Indian IT companies over time,"" he said.

Margin pressure

Tech companies have already been grappling with pressure on their operating profit margins exerted by rising employee costs in the face of growing attrition. Kotak said the margin pressure seems to have bottomed out.

""Companies are incurring high talent retention costs (retention bonus, out-of-cycle wage revision etc.). The challenge exists in India as well as onsite. This pressure will seep into margins; we forecast 70-400 bps YoY decline in EBIT margin across the coverage universe,"" Kotak said. EBIT is short for earnings before interest and tax.

On a sequential basis, the securities firm sees headwinds in the form of wage revision for Infosys, TCS and Tech Mahindra, an increase in travel costs across all companies and visa costs for many and a decline in utilization as companies crank up hiring of fresh graduates.

Optically, Kotak feels the rupee's depreciation against US dollar may seem positive, but cross-currency headwinds have ensured only a marginal tailwind in the quarter.

The US dollar appreciated 5 percent, 6.6 percent and 1.7 percent against the euro, British pound and the Australian dollar, respectively, while the rupee depreciated 4 percent against the US dollar.

""Earnings before interest and tax has bottomed out in our view and will improve for most in the subsequent quarters as most pressure points are already absorbed, while efficiencies in the form of a pyramid, subcontracting cost rationalization and utilization will kick in later. The recent wave of rupee depreciation could also help,"" said Kotak. the June and September quarters would represent the peak of margin pressure.

Guidance

Kotak expects Infosys to maintain full-year revenue growth guidance at 12-14 percent in constant currency terms and the EBIT margin band at 21-23 percent.

HCL Technologies is also likely to retain revenue growth and margin guidance of 12-14 percent and 18-20 percent, respectively while Wipro could guide for 2.5-4.5 percent revenue growth on a sequential basis (1-3 percent organic), Kotak said.

Key things to watch out for

Investors will closely follow new deal wins, companies' commentary on demand, attrition, and pricing.

Kotak expects companies to report robust new deal wins. On attrition, the firm said it is likely to be more than 20 percent across companies as they deal with a talent crunch in a buoyant demand environment.

Tech Mahindra on June 8 informed the stock exchanges that it has acquired a 26 percent stake in Huoban Energy 6 Private Ltd, a recently incorporated renewable energy firm.

Tech Mahindra said it will pay a total sum of Rs 1.60 crore for the acquisition in an all-cash deal, adding that the transaction is estimated to be completed within 90 days.

The acquisition has been made under the ""group captive"" programme, which will allow Tech Mahindra to consume the renewable energy that will be generated by Huoban Energy.

Captive or group captive projects are projects set up by a developer with a minimum equity contribution of 26 percent from interested consumers, such as Tech Mahindra in this case, and the renewable energy generated from such projects is consumed by the stakeholder as per the government norms.

According to Tech Mahindra, ""the acquisition would enable the company to procure 5 MW solar energy for its captive consumption at its facilities located in Pune, Maharashtra"".

The market managed to settle the week ended May 27 with half-a-percent gains which witnessed a negative mood in the first three days, followed by a sharp recovery in the next two sessions of the week. The Nifty50 strongly defended the crucial 16,000 mark throughout last week and closed the near-critical hurdle of 16,400 levels.

Experts largely hope the index to remain in a broad range of 15,700-16,400 levels but if it decisively surpasses the upper band of the range, then there could be a possibility of the index moving towards 16,600-16,800 levels in the coming days. Further, if the market breadth turns stronger and global cues remain positive, then there could be further rally in the market, experts said.

The Nifty50 rallied 1.13 percent or 182 points to 16,352 on Friday and during the week, it gained half a percent, but the broader space underperformed frontliners as the Nifty Midcap 100 index fell 0.77 percent and Smallcap 100 index declined 3.4 percent during the week.

""In last three consecutive weeks, our markets made several attempts towards 15,900–15,700, but fortunately, despite unfavourable global environment, our market showed tremendous resilience at lower levels. In fact, with the last two days of smart recovery, our market seems to have weathered the storm, at least for the time being,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

Now, we are back to the higher end of the recent range i.e. 16,400 and it would be interesting to see whether the Nifty surpasses it or not. In our sense, it’s a matter of time and we would see the Nifty traversing this level to test 16,600–16,800 in current week, he said.

Despite all this, he feels we are still not completely out of the woods yet, because globally there is yet to stabilize things. Hence, he advises that traders not get complacent and should keep assessing situation on a regular basis.

As far as immediate supports are concerned, he said 16,200 followed by 16,000 should provide cushion on any intra-week weakness.

Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on the May 27 closing prices:

Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative & Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities

VIP Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 559.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 510 | Target: Rs 630 | Return: 13 percent

Primary trend of stock is positive as it is trading above its 100 and 200 weeks moving averages. During the recent correction, stock price has taken support at the upward sloping trendline on the weekly chart.

Stock price has formed Bullish Hammer candle stick pattern on the weekly chart. It has formed triple bottom around Rs 515 levels on the daily chart suggesting strong support around that levels.

Mastek: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,448 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,350 | Target: Rs 2,650 | Return: 8 percent

Stock price has formed double bottom on the daily line chart. Short term trend of the stock turned bullish as it closed above its 5 days EMA (exponential moving average). Primary trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its 100 and 200 weeks EMA.

It has corrected nearly 30 percent from the recent high and reached near support on the weekly chart. RSI (relative strength index) and MFI (money flow index) Oscillator has started sloping upwards, suggesting higher probability of bullish trend reversal in the stock price in the coming days.

DCB Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 82.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 78 | Target: Rs 92 | Return: 11 percent

Short term trend of the stock is bullish as it is trading above its 5 and 20 weeks EMA. Stock price is on the verge of breaking out from the symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart.

RSI oscillator has bounced back from the 30 odd levels and started rising, suggesting higher possibility of bullish trend reversal in stock price in the coming days.

Bank Nifty has broken out from the downward sloping trendline and we expect bullishness to spill over in the midcap banking stocks in the days to come.

Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,123.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,045 | Target: Rs 1,250 | Return: 11 percent

The IT space has witnessed a decent correction from their highs and Tech Mahindra, too, has corrected sharply along with its peers. However, prices have reached its important support where we can observe a harmonic pattern called AB=CD where two alternate moves are equal in length. This coincides around the support end of a Falling Channel and also the ‘RSI Smoothened oscillator has given a positive crossover from its oversold zone.

The upmove in last couple of sessions from its support indicates probability of a pullback move in the short term.

Hence, traders should look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 1,125-1,115 for potential targets of Rs 1,190 and Rs 1,250 in the near term. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below Rs 1,045.

Ambuja Cements: Buy | LTP: Rs 366.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 357 | Target: Rs 379 | Return: 3.5 percent

In the recent market corrective phase, this stock has shown a relative outperformance and has seen a time-wise correction rather than any price correction. From the lows of March 8, the recent upmove seems to be a five wave ‘Impulsive’ upmove in which prices are trading within ‘wave 4’.

The stock has formed a triangle in this consolidation and looking at the price volumes structure and the RSI oscillator, we expect a breakout in the stock soon which would be the fifth wave of this impulse.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 365-362 for potential targets of Rs 372 and Rs 379 in the near term. The stop-loss for long positions can be placed below Rs 357.

Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,096.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,020 | Target: Rs 1,200 | Return: 9.5 percent

The stock has formed a bullish reversal formation on a daily chart. It has formed a “Gravestone Doji” after hitting the important support level based on the Fibonacci retracement.

Also it’s a volume-based price reversal formation, which should favour bulls heavily in the near term. It's a buy at current levels and more on dips around Rs 1,060 with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,020. On the higher side, it would face major resistance at Rs 1,150 and at Rs 1,250.

BHEL: Buy | LTP: Rs 51.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 47 | Target: Rs 59 | Return: 15 percent

It has formed a double bottom in the critical support zone. The last several times, it has relied on Rs 44-45 and has bounced back in a hurry.

To validate the formation, the stock must definitely cross the level of Rs 59, which is far from the current level.

Over the past two days, the stock has been rapidly reversing back to Rs 47-48, indicating that the stock is poised to move towards Rs 59 in the near term. We should be buyers at the current level and fall further around Rs 48 with a final stop-loss at Rs 47.

TCS: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,261.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,100 | Target: Rs 3,600 | Return: 10.4 percent

The stock has completed a corrective pattern on Rs 3,154 levels, however, a sharp recovery is missing due to weakness in the entire sector. As the stock completed a major corrective pattern, investors should be buyers at current levels (Rs 3,265).

It is giving a decent risk-reward ratio for medium-term investors. On the upside, it has the biggest hurdles at Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,600. Keep stop-loss at Rs 3,100 on a closing basis.

Ajit Mishra, VP-Research at Religare Broking

Ambuja Cements: Buy | LTP: Rs 366.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 348 | Target: Rs 390 | Return: 6.5 percent

We’re seeing a mixed trend within the cement space and Ambuja Cements is currently seeing consolidation. It’s hovering in a tight range while holding firmly above the support zone of the major moving averages (100,200 EMA).

The chart pattern indicates a strong directional move soon. We thus recommend accumulating within Rs 362-366 levels.

Hero MotoCorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,719.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,600 | Target: Rs 2,900 | Return: 7 percent

The auto pack has been performing well within the sectoral pack and Hero MotoCorp is performing in line with the trend. It has witnessed a fresh breakout from a declining broadening formation on the daily chart and is likely to maintain the prevailing momentum.

We recommend initiating fresh longs within Rs 2,690-2,710 levels.

Havells India June Futures: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,182.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,220 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 7 percent

Havells has been trading with corrective bias since December 2021 and gradually drifting lower. After retesting the trend line hurdle, it was hovering in a narrow range around the major moving averages on the daily chart and witnessed a fresh breakdown of late.

We thus recommend creating shorts within Rs 1,185-1,195 zone.

Geojit's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra Ltd. is one of the top 5 IT companies in India which provides IT and ER&D services for telecommunication equipment manufacturers, telecom service providers, software vendors, and systems integrators. For Q4FY22, Tech Mahindra Limited reported 24.5% YoY increase in revenue to reach Rs. 12,116cr and 39.2% YoY increase in PAT to reach Rs. 1,505cr. EBITDA margin shrank 230bps YoY to 17.2% due to increased subcontractor costs, higher employee costs along with lower utilization. We remain positive on the company's business outlook in the mediumto-long-term, considering company’s capabilities in new techs and the strong deal pipeline.



Outlook

We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs. 1,372 based on 17x FY24E Adj. EPS.

The brokerage firm says the Indian IT growth was accelerating till the third quarter of 2022 and has begun to slow down from the fourth quarter, which is likely to worsen into FY23 from tougher comps, supply issues and eventually a worsening macro. With peak sector growth behind, growth deceleration should continue to weigh on sector multiples.

""Rising margin headwinds in the near term and revenue headwinds in the medium term from a potential macro slowdown will mean that the sector’s earnings upgrade cycle is behind,"" JP Morgan said in its report.

""We see peak revenue growth behind us and EBIT margins trending down from inflation, mean reversion. While the bottom-up outlook remains positive from most Services, Software and SaaS names YTD, and the tech spending cycle remains buoyant structurally, we feel there are more downside risks to current earnings assumptions,"" the brokerage firm said.

The Nifty IT Index have underperformed the NIFTY by 15 percent so far this year as the earnings outlook has worsened over the current earnings season.

The brokerage firm has downgraded Tata Consultancy Services, HCL Technology, Wipro and L&T Technology to underweight from neutral and cut its target price by 15-21 percent.

""Indian tech services are the most expensive services names globally at a premium to digital native peers and Accenture, and at par with enterprise software that appears unsustainable. Sector reverse DCFs suggest that the market is still baking in 6-13 percent growth for Tier 1s and 14-33% for midcaps over the next decade; that seems optimistic given this remains a late cyclical sector for most names,"" the JP Morgan report said.

JP Morgan has an 'overweight' call on Infosys thanks to growth, Tech Mahindra for 5G cycle and margin expansion, Mphasis and Persistent System due to more defensive industry exposure and stronger growth outlook.",324,-0.2542610689997673

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

Q4FY22 revenues were in-line, but EBIT margin lagged our estimates; Q4 saw strong deal intake, healthy deal pipeline, good client mining and logo additions. Net new order intake grew by 44% q-o-q to $1.01 billion. Company is well-placed to deliver strong revenue growth in the next few years given strong deal wins, active participation in the transformation activities within telecom ecosystem and strong demand for its both BPS and XDS practices. Strong revenue growth, pricing leverage, higher utilisation, increased offshoring and reduced subcontractor expenses would negate the margin headwinds in FY2023E. USD revenue/earnings would clock a CAGR of 13.7%/14.3%, respectively, over FY22-FY24E.



Outlook

We maintain a Buy on TechM with a revised PT of Rs. 1,650, given robust deal wins, picking up of 5G spends and reasonable valuation. The stock trades at 15x FY2024E EPS.

KR Choksey's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra Ltd (TECHM) Q4FY22 performance was marginally higher than with our estimate. Dollar Revenue was up 4.9% QoQ and in CC term grew by 5.4% QoQ to USD 1,608Mn (KRChoksey est. USD 1,604Mn). Rupee revenue grew by 5.2% QoQ to INR 1,21,163Mn (KRChoksey est. INR 1,20,635Mn), driven by growth in communication/enterprise at 4.8%/5.8% in constant currency term with ~2.5% contribution from M&A. TCV deal win grew by 43.6% QoQ to USD 1Bn in Q4, was driven by telecom (TCV of USD 645Mn after AT&T deal) and enterprise (TCV of USD 366Mn). Reported operating margin contracted by 159bps QoQ to 13.2% , due to impacted by lower utilization, higher salary & retention cost, and higher depreciation & amortization charge. Enterprise was led by inorganic contribution which showed up in BFSI (18.4%) and technology (15.1%) verticals. Reported Net profit grew by 10% QoQ to INR 15,056Mn with margin of 12.4%. Though management believes that there will be improvement in profitability due to better pricing but we expect that there is a limited scope for improvement due to seasonality and wage hike (July) impacts. Our target price of INR 1,459 is based on 18x Mar-24E EPS with EPS CAGR of 13.4% over FY22-24E.

Outlook

Tech Mahindra is currently trading at a valuation with a P/E multiple of 18.6x/15.6x on FY23E/FY24E earnings. We expect strong deal momentum across verticals, tailwind in 5G & digital product engineering and clients centric approach will aid growth over the medium to long term in future and hence we are assigning a P/E multiple of 19x to the FY24E estimated EPS of INR 76.2 to arrive at a target price of INR 1,447 (Earlier price of INR 1,770), with an upside of 21.6%. Accordingly, we maintain our rating to a “BUY” to the stock.

Having committed over USD 955 million (around Rs 7,353 crore) to acquire 10 companies in the immediate past, Tech Mahindra will be less acquisitive in the new fiscal year and focus on integrating them, a senior company official said.

The Mahindra Group company, with revenues of nearly USD 6 billion in FY22, will look at acquisitions in an opportunist way in the new year, its chief of strategy Jagdish Mitra told PTI.

The focus will be on putting in place the systems to capitalise on the synergies and look at how the acquired company can help create a larger portfolio, he said, adding that the acquisitions need to be engaged to drive the main business.

Over the last 18 months, the company has committed USD 955 million to acquire 10 companies in varied deal sizes across the world, majorly with an eye on getting a grip over technologies, people or revenue streams, to be one of the most active on the mergers and acquisitions front among peers.

Its chief financial officer-designate Rohit Anand said the acquisition-related charges shaved off 1 per cent from its operating profit margins as amortisation-related charges had to be accounted for.

In the new fiscal year, the company will focus on widening the operating profit margins, said Anand, who takes over the mantle from June 1, and added that the aspiration is to take the operating profit margin in the 14-15 per cent band from 13.2 per cent.

The company has levers which will be deployed to widen the profit margin and grow it on a sequential basis every quarter, Anand said, listing out the avenues.

He said the company will look at going for deals which will improve its pricing, derive benefits on the utilization front as more juniors hired in the recent past get deployed on projects, exit from businesses like the ones linked to governments where it faces cash flow issues and divest from investments made earlier including in companies or geographies in Africa performing at a sub-optimal level.

Mitra said the firm will also continue to look for newer centres in the Indian hinterland to act as delivery centres, adding to the 15 such facilities already opened in FY22 with an eye on reducing the high attrition amid a greater demand for talent.

The destination of choice will be based on talent availability and other aspects, Mitra said, adding that potential centres being considered right now are across all zones of the country.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

USD revenue growth at 5.4% QoQ CC (organic growth at 2.7% QoQ CC) in 4QFY22 was in line and driven by growth in Communications/Enterprise at 4.8%/5.8% CC. TCV of USD1b in 4QFY22 was driven by a large 5G deal in Communications. EBIT margin dipped 170bp QoQ to 14.8% in 4Q (100bp excluding a one-off gain in 3QFY22), 80bp bellow our estimate, on account of a lower gross margin (80bp) and higher D&A expense (80bp). This was partially compensated by lower than expected SG&A costs (12.1%, a multi-year low). We see TECHM’s weak margin performance in 4QFY22 as concerning as it has already missed its lowered expectations, despite aggressively pulling back on SG&A spends. While the management expects profitability to improve in coming quarters, due to better pricing, we expect the impact of seasonality in the first quarter and wage hikes in the second and third quarter to limit scope for an improvement.

Outlook

We continue to stay on the sidelines on TECHM as we feel the current valuations fairly factor in better business dynamics against moderating profitability. We marginally tweak our estimates to account for lower margin. Our TP implies 15x FY24E EPS. We remain Neutral on the stock.

Company is well-placed to deliver strong revenue growth in the next few years given strong deal wins, active participation in the transformation activities within telecom ecosystem and strong demand for its both BPS and XDS practices. Strong revenue growth, pricing leverage, higher utilisation, increased offshoring and reduced subcontractor expenses would negate the margin headwinds in FY2023E. USD revenue/earnings would clock a CAGR of 13.7%/14.3%, respectively, over FY22-FY24E.



Outlook

We maintain a Buy on TechM with a revised PT of Rs. 1,650, given robust deal wins, picking up of 5G spends and reasonable valuation. The stock trades at 15x FY2024E EPS.

India’s fifth largest software exporter Tech Mahindra posted fourth quarter earnings that came in line with analyst expectations but its margins fell short of estimates, due to higher employee expenses and lower utilisation.

It ended fiscal year 2021-22 with a double digit revenue growth of 17.3% and expects the momentum to continue going forward.

“We believe this is the best performance in terms of growth we have had in seven years. 17.3% YoY growth reflects our commitment to guidance, employees, and the value that we create for the customers,” said CP Gurnani, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Tech Mahindra said.

Its net new TCV (total contract value) for the quarter came in at $1.01 billion, up 44% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), signaling a strong pace of deal making.

It also made a couple of management related announcements. While Gurnani’s term has been extended till December 2023, Rohit Anand has been appointed CFO, taking over from Milind Kulkarni.

While software firms have seen robust growth in the last fiscal on the back of post-pandemic digitisation and migration to cloud, attrition is a niggling concern, as companies step up hiring of technology talent.

For Tech Mahindra, its attrition rate stood at 24 percent, unchanged from the previous quarter. The total headcount stood at 151,173, up 4.2% QoQ, with the company adding 6,106 net employees during the quarter.

The company had earlier said it was looking to make 15,000 campus hires in 2022-23, up from 10,000 in the last financial year, to keep pace with rising demand and attrition.

“We have invested heavily on people. We have also invested in tier two cities and opened 15 new centers. Our global delivery centers have also gone up to at least four new ones in Latin America and another four in Europe,” Gurnani said.

Communication, Media and Entertainment (CME), one of its strongest businesses, grew well thanks to the demand for 5G telecom services.

“We have seen large deal wins as clients have started to roll out 5G networks and commercialize them,” Anand said.

Tech Mahindra said it won a strategic deal for building & operating Europe’s first fully cloud-native end-to-end 5G network augmenting & operating network data centres, labs & the security infrastructure.

Secondly, within the media and entertainment vertical, the company has seen a strong uptake in the Metaverse offerings. “We're looking at that as a big growth opportunity,” Anand said.

The BFSI (Banking, financial services and insurance) too posted strong growth, with the vertical crossing a billion dollars in run rate for the first time.

“CME was always the Northstar, it is doing very well. But I’m happy that BFSI joined the billion-dollar club,” added Gurnani.

The company also indicated that the demand scenario remains robust across industries and markets despite a potential worry about inflation and the geopolitical situation.",482,0.6363642649217085

The market rebounded sharply after a day of steep correction, but wiped out gains in the last hour of trade to close on a flat note on May 5 despite positive trend in global counterparts.

The BSE Sensex lost 864 points from day's high to end with just 33 points gains at 55,702, while the Nifty50 fell from around 16,950 levels and ended the session at 16,683, up 5 points supported by technology and select banking & financial stocks.

The market breadth was largely in favour of bears as about 1,104 shares declined against 826 advancing shares on the NSE. Hence, the Nifty Smallcap 100 index fell 0.75 percent, while Nifty Midcap 100 index gained 0.1 percent.

Stocks that were in action include ABB India, Tech Mahindra and Dixon Technologies which were among the top five gainers in the futures & options segment, and also outperformed broader markets on Thursday.

ABB rallied 10 percent to close at Rs 2,221, Tech Mahindra jumped 4.2 percent to Rs 1,263, and Dixon Technologies rose 3.7 percent to Rs 3,950.

Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

ABB India

The stock has rallied over 10 percent on May 5, 2022. On Thursday, it opened with gap-up and quickly cleared 20 day simple moving average (SMA) level with strong volume activity.

Despite tepid market conditions, ABB maintained its strong momentum throughout the day. On the short term time frame, the stock has formed strong price volume breakout pattern.

The texture of the pattern suggests breakout action will continue in the near term if stock succeeds to trade above Rs 2,150 or 20 days SMA level.

For the swing traders, Rs 2,150 would be the sacrosanct level, trading above the same we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 2,350-2,450.

Tech Mahindra

After a long correction, the stock took support near Rs 1,200 and reversed. In this quarter, so far, Tech Mahindra corrected over 15 percent.

Technically, the medium term chart formation is still in to the weak side but due to temporary oversold situation sharp pullback rally from the current level is not ruled out.

In the near future, Rs 1,200 and Rs 1,220 would act as a key support zone. Above which it could rally up to Rs 1,300-1,325. On the flip side, below Rs 1,200 uptrend would be vulnerable.

Dixon Technologies

In this weak so far, the stock corrected over 10 percent. The stock is consistently facing selling pressure at higher level.

In addition, on daily and weekly charts, it has formed lower top formation and post breakdown it is comfortably trading below 50 and 20 days SMA which is largely negative.

As long as it is trading below Rs 4,100, the correction wave is likely to continue. Below the same, it could touch the level of Rs 3,800. Further downside also can continue which can drag the stock up to Rs 3,700-3,650.

IT firm Tech Mahindra on Friday said it plans to create new revenue streams and add 1,000 jobs in the UK.

The tech giant will collaborate with a leading academia and research institute in the UK to co-innovate at Tech Mahindra’s Makers Lab in Milton Keynes, it said in a statement.

As many as 1,000 jobs will be created by the company in the UK, the statement said.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is on a two-day visit to India, made an announcement regarding a new collaboration between the two countries on AI.

The initiative aims to grow innovation and prosperity in both the countries and harness the power of emerging technology to confront global challenges.

""Trade and investment between the UK and India is creating good jobs and sustaining livelihoods in both of our countries. I am very pleased that Tech Mahindra has decided to join the legions of Indian companies investing in the UK, boosting our technology sector and driving economic growth,” Johnson said in the statement.

Tech Mahindra Managing Director and CEO CP Gurnani said innovations and applications of Artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly transform productivity and create revenue streams for businesses in the UK.

""We are also committed to investing in the local communities we operate in, and initiatives like these help increase the employability of future technologists in the UK as well as globally,” he added.",236,0.9945623427629471

It’s rare to see a marketing chief leading the human resource department of a multinational company. Tech Mahindra’s global chief people officer and head of marketing, Harshvendra Soin is changing the dynamics of handling people and brand purpose, at the same time. In an exclusive chat with Storyboard18, Soin discusses what it takes to make a good employer brand, technology’s role in disrupting customer service, the metaverse, and more.

What is it like managing and leading two critical functions like HR and marketing in a technology company? What are the HR lessons that you apply in your marketing strategies?

HR and marketing do have interesting synergies. Let’s look at human experiences. It’s a top priority of both portfolios. It’s important how we talk and treat our customers, employees, their families, and communities at large. The insights we get from these sets of people matter the most.

You asked me what HR lessons I pick up to drive marketing at TechM. We believe while technology is an enabler, the moments of truth always remain human. Businesses with ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles built into their strategy, not only drive profitable growth but also attract talent. That’s at the core of the company. We are making our workforce future-ready, for which reskilling is imperative. Our upskilling programs are powered by an artificial intelligence-based platform that revolves around topics like 5G, blockchain, IoT, cybersecurity; all of which are also at the center of our marketing functionality.

What does it take to make a good employer brand?

I would like to quote Maya Angelou here. She once said, “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."" When people join TechM, it is about more than the job assigned to them. Our brand is more than our marketing message, it is more about how we do business. We not only take care of our employees’ well-being but also their families. If you want to be a good employer brand, you need to be there for your people beyond 9-5, if need be. When it comes to diversity, we think from lenses like gender, nationality, thought, and more. New-age brands need to adapt to these practices consistently to get better each day for their employees.

Marketers across categories are investing even more in ‘brand purpose’. What is TechM’s brand purpose and how is it evolving given the pace of change and disruption today?

‘Rise’ has been our brand purpose and the spirit of Rise is based on three brand pillars – accepting no limits, alternative thinking, and driving positive change. This unified one-brand voice has helped us bring our people together. This is also helping us to keep our customers loyal. We go far and beyond for both our internal and external customers.

Changing times and new technologies are changing the definition of how we work. As marketers, we need to rethink a few things to be with our customers all the time. We need to think about the impact rather than the reach of our strategies. We need to connect rather than just communicate. Marketers should not just be thought leaders but visionaries to co-create experiences for their customers. I also think it’s not just about creating content as a part of brand strategies but driving change through content.

In the last couple of years, experiences have been at the core of brands' marketing strategies. How is technology going to disrupt CX further?

We live in a time when what brand experiences that were done for customers yesterday become irrelevant today. The way to reach them will also keep evolving, as experiences are moving online, and the impact will be all in real-time. With brands going omnichannel, time and agility will be key. Run-of-the-mill marketing campaigns will not work when consumers move to the metaverse, AR, VR worlds. They will give brands feedback in real-time and will expect to get solutions in real-time too. Marketers will have to re-align their strategies accordingly.",681,0.47217918634414674

This comes days after Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) on March 25 announced its entry into the realm of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with its first-ever tranche of tokens to be based on Thar - the company's premium sports utility vehicle. The NFTs will be released in collaboration with Tech Mahindra, the IT arm of Mahindra Group.

The NFTs that were put up for sale via an auction starting March 29, on Tech Mahindra’s NFT marketplace christened “Mahindra Gallery”.

In February, Tech Mahindra had announced its foray into metaverse, adding that “TechMVerse” will work on developing fully interactive multiverses to deliver immersive experiences in the metaverse for its customers.

The metaverse is theoretically the future of the internet, a 3D virtual world where people will be able to interact using sensors, lenses and other gadgets.

Recently, Punjabi pop singer Daler Mehendi bought “Balle Balle Land” in the metaverse.

Earlier this year, a couple in Tamil Nadu created a huge buzz online for hosting their wedding reception in the metaverse. Dinesh SP and Janaganandhini Ramaswamy’s reception took place in the virtual headquarters of the Hogwarts castle.

Last year, a couple in the United States became the first to get married in the metaverse, as they held a virtual ceremony along with their physical wedding in New Hampshire.

After the brutal knock on February 24, the market recovered fair bit of ground and for first three sessions of the week gone by, the Nifty remained in a 300-point range with volatile swings.

All this while 16,500 provided some support but on March 4, the global worries once again spooked market participants and the Nifty not only opened below this level but even challenged 16,200 on an intraday basis. Though it ended the week tad above it, the Nifty confirmed the lowest close in the past seven months. The March 4 correction was no surprise as the consolidation in the previous three sessions was hinting towards a new round of selling.

The price action also shows moderate damage to key indices but individual stocks fell like a bottomless pit. Though markets were oversold for the last few days, there was no respite overall. This correction has a lot to do with the Russia- Ukraine war. The market is likely to sway to news flows until the situation stabilises. One should brace for volatility and surprises on either side.

Although such war scenarios are always tricky, we can clearly see a negative trend on the weekly time-frame charts.

In addition, the falling slope of “RSI-smoothened” oscillator is an indication of further weakness. So, though the Nifty has reached the initial target of 16,200, we do not want to pre-empt a near-term bottom here.

From an investors' point of view, this is certainly an excellent opportunity to bag quality stocks in a staggered manner but for traders, it will be difficult to say that worse is behind us.

We do not want to sound pessimistic but looking at the current scenario, we will not be surprised to see the Nifty enter sub-16,000 terrain but we do not expect the index to slip below 15,500–15,200, as of now.

Let's see how things pan out on the global front. In case of any positive surprise next week, we will be keeping a close eye on a few scenarios.

As far as levels are concerned, 16,000–15,900 is to be seen as immediate support. On the higher side, 16,450 followed by 16,600 will be strong resistances.

It will be pragmatic to follow a stock-specific approach— identifying an apt theme is the key—and avoid aggressive bets overnight for a while.

Here is one sell call and one buy recommendation for next week:

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,453.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,397 | Target: Rs 1,520 | Return: 4.6 percent

Recently, the entire IT space has undergone a rough patch but it seems as if the price correction is overdone around 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and we can see some respite in the coming days.

Tech Mahindra has already started its upwards bounce and on March 4, we witnessed the first sign of strength. The stock price managed to confirm a close above “20-day SMA” for the first time in the last two months.

In addition, the “RSI-smoothened” has moved upwards from the oversold zone. Considering the evidence, we recommend buying this stock for a trading target of Rs 1,520. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 1,397.

Bajaj Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 6,537.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,705 | Target: Rs 6,300 | Return: 3.6 percent

The financial space has been the weakest link throughout this week and a lot of marquee names are surrendering to the broader market destruction now. This NBFC stock has been hovering slightly below the “200-SMA” since three-four sessions. On March 4, the fresh round of selling began in the stock as we witnessed a breakdown from previous important swing lows.

A similar negative development is visible in the “RSI-Smoothened” oscillator on the weekly chart, which does not augur well for the bulls. Hence, traders can look to sell for a near-term target of Rs 6,300. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 6,705.

The significant fall in share prices over the past one-and-a-half-months when most sectors declined in double digits offers investors an opportunity to buy stocks of quality companies.

Margin pressures reflected in corporate earnings for the December quarter due to rising commodity prices, expectations of faster policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve, relentless selling by foreign investors, and the geopolitical tensions with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine weighed on market sentiment.

The benchmark BSE Sensex fell 11 percent during January 17-February 24 before a minor recovery, while the BSE Midcap index dropped 15 percent and the Smallcap index plunged 18.5 percent.

Among sectors, auto, capital goods, energy, healthcare, IT, consumer durables, oil & gas, and realty declined 10-20 percent, while banking, FMCG and power fell 7-9 percent.

Volatility hit the highest level since May 2020, with the India VIX going up to about 30, indicating instability in the market unless the geopolitical risk eases.

The Russia-Ukraine crisis, which continues for the time being despite sanctions imposed by western countries, poses a threat to earnings and economic growth, given the rise in commodity prices, experts said.

Brent crude oil futures, the international benchmark, hit $120 a barrel on March 3, the highest level since 2012 and a rise of 69 percent in more than two months.

Inflation, growth risks

“This would be a negative factor for global trade, posing a downside risk to the global economic growth,” Axis Securities said. “A scenario of oil sustaining above $100 a barrel for some more time will create notable challenges to the oil-importing countries, especially India, which may find it difficult to maintain the trade deficit and the foreign exchange reserves.”

The brokerage said the rise in crude oil prices could delay the cool-off in inflation in the domestic market, which was expected to moderate in the second half of 2022.

However, in the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, commodities would be the biggest gainers and as long as the geopolitical heat continues, it will be the dominating theme in the market, Axis Securities said.

Apart from the current geopolitical issue, upcoming events in March include the Federal Reserve meeting and assembly elections results from five states.

“The direction of the oil prices, bond yields, and dollar index along with the development of the current geopolitical events will further drive the market fundamentals,” the brokerage said, adding that once the dust over the Russia- Ukraine conflict settles, the market is expected to refocus on key events such as inflation and the number of rate hikes in the current calendar year.

Despite the current volatility, the brokerage maintained its Nifty target of 20,200 with a positive long-term view on the market supported by the emerging favourable structure as increasing capital expenditure enables banks to improve credit growth.

The Nifty closed at about 16,500 on March 3. To achieve the target of 20,200, it needs to add 3,700 points, or 22.4 percent, by March 2023. The index touched a record high of 18,604 in October 2021.

The brokerage said the overall boost in the Union Budget 2022-23 expenditure will help deliver broad-based growth in FY23.

Though the earnings momentum has been strong in the past few quarters and largely in line with expectations for the current quarter, they remain the critical factor for the market, said Axis Securities, which foresees FY22, FY23 and FY24 Nifty EPS at Rs 728, Rs 844 and Rs 918, respectively, with a 20 percent CAGR growth over FY21-24.

Based on these themes, the brokerage has recommended the following 16 stocks with a 10-50 percent potential upside.

The stock market snapped a seven-day losing streak on February 25, the first day of the March series, with a 2.5 percent gain. The benchmark indices as well as the broader market weakened after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, which lifted oil prices to over $100 a barrel and took other commodity prices to either record high levels or multi-month highs. Net sales by foreign institutional investors were Rs 19,843 crore during the week.

The Nifty 50 fell to about 16,200 during the week before bouncing back to close at 16,658, down 3.6 percent and still below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA 16,903), 50-day SMA (17,412) and 100-day SMA (17,577), the real technical cause of concern. The index must surpass 16,800-17,000 levels to gain strength, which is possible if geopolitical tensions ease. However, 16,400-16,200 will act as crucial support levels, experts said.

“We can clearly see Nifty breaking below the sacrosanct moving average of 200-SMA placed around 16,900. Since this has happened with a ‘breakaway gap,’ traders would continue to have challenging times till we reclaim 16,800-17,000 with some authority,” said Sameet Chavan, chief analyst-technical and derivatives, at Angel One.

He said reaching 16,800-17,000 levels is possible in the near term only if tensions ease with respect to Russia and Ukraine and until that happens, “we are not completely out of the woods.”

On the flip side, 16,400 followed by 16,200 are seen as immediate support levels but if things worsen from here, it won’t be surprising to see the Nifty sliding below 16,000 as well, according to Chavan.

Since volatility is likely to remain on the higher side, traders are advised not to get carried away by one-day bounce. It’s advisable to keep regular tabs on all developments and better to stay light on positions, Chavan said.

Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on February 25 closing prices.

Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research (retail) at Kotak Securities

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,389.7 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,320 | Target: Rs 1,575 | Return: 13 percent

The stock was at Rs 1,838 in December and from it fell to Rs 1,330 in February, without any meaningful bounce. However, it has spent a considerable amount of time between Rs 1,480 and Rs 1,390, which has generated a positive divergence on the daily chart.

The risk-reward ratio is quite favourable for buying the stock at current levels. Buy at current levels with targets of Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,575. Put the last stop-loss at Rs 1,320.

Trent: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,070.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 950 | Target: Rs 1,200 | Return: 12 percent

The stock has been consolidating within the range of Rs 975 and Rs 1,200 since September. Even when there was a huge drop in the market, the stock stayed at Rs 975, which suggests it is a real support level.

Since it settled at Rs 1,070/1,080, our strategy should be to buy the stock in two tranches – 50 percent at current levels and the remaining 50 percent at Rs 1,025. At higher levels, the stock may again move towards the Rs 1,200. Protect the long position with a final stop-loss at Rs 950 on a closing basis.

Canara Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 218.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 195 | Target: Rs 270 | Return: 24 percent

The stock has declined gradually from a high of Rs 272.80 to Rs 206. The primary trend of the stock is positive. It is in recovery from the oversold zone in the short term and on an intermediate basis, it has corrected to decent levels.

We prefer to buy and hold such shares from a positional point of view as the risk-reward ratio is quite comfortable for buying the stock. Buy at current levels and more on the downside near Rs 208. Place final stop-loss at Rs 195 for targets of Rs 260 and Rs 270.

Nandish Shah, senior technical & derivative analyst at HDFC Securities

Timken India: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,061.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,950 | Target: Rs 2,270 | Return: 10 percent

The Timken stock price has broken out from a symmetric triangle on the daily chart. The primary trend is positive as the stock is trading above all important moving averages. The stock is forming a bullish, higher-top, higher-bottom formation on the weekly chart.

The relative strength index (RSI) and money flow index (MFI) oscillators are placed above 60 levels and in rising upwards, indicating strength in the current uptrend. Also, the directional indicator (DI) is trading above -DI while the average directional index (ADX) line has started sloping upwards, indicating that the stock price is likely to gather momentum in the coming days.

Mahindra Holidays and Resorts: Buy | LTP: Rs 209.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 195 | Target Rs 235 | Return: 12 percent

Accumulation was seen during the past two months, when volumes were higher during the up days as compared to the down days. During the past week, the stock price showed relative strength, closing little changed compared to the 4 percent fall in the Nifty 500 index.

The stock is taking support at the upward sloping trendline. It is expected to outperform during the days to come.

Blue Star: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,057 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,000 | Target: Rs 1200 | Return: 14 percent

Accumulation was seen during the current month, when volumes were significantly higher than the average of the past few months. The primary trend is positive, with the stock trading above its important moving averages.

The stock has broken out on the weekly and monthly charts. After touching an all-time high in mid-February, the stock has corrected 5 percent, which we believe is a running correction in an overall uptrend.

Ruchit Jain, lead research at 5paisa.com

Havells India: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,168.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,180 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 6 percent

After a sharp correction in January, the price has consolidated within a range in the past few weeks. This correction and then consolidation have led to the formation of a ‘bearish pennant’ pattern on the daily chart.

Also, the entire recent consolidation has been below its short-term moving averages, while the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the daily chart has acted as a resistance.

The relative underperformance of the stock recently is not a good sign and if the prices break below the support of Rs 1,140, then it could result in a further correction in prices. Volumes in the recent correction were high and there’s no buying interest seen in the pullback.

Hence, short-term traders can look for shorting opportunities if the stock breaks the support of Rs 1,140 with a stop-loss placed above Rs 1,180 for potential targets of Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,070. (The given levels are of the cash segment, which can be used as a reference to trade in the futures segment.)

Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals: Buy | LTP: Rs 546.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 505 | Target: Rs 618 | Return: 13 percent

After the company’s recent quarterly results, the stock had seen buying interest and had broken out from its resistance with a gap up. The stock rallied higher on good volumes and has now pulled back as the broader markets corrected.

However, volumes on the pullback are low and the previous breakout level has now become a support. The stock has been forming a higher top higher bottom structure and as long as this is intact, we expect buying interest on declines.

Traders can buy the stock on dips in the range of Rs 535-530 for potential targets of Rs 565 and Rs 618 in the near term. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 505 on long positions.

Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities

Amara Raja Batteries: Buy | LTP: Rs 553.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 534 | Target: Rs 620 | Return: 12 percent

The stock has formed a bullish Harami candlestick pattern on the daily chart after a prolonged correction, which suggests exhaustion of selling pressure and the stock seems to be ready for a significant recovery.

Also, the stock price fell below the lower band of the falling wedge on the daily chart only to come back into the wedge immediately, which indicates a failed breakdown. Momentum indicator RSI has shown an early sign of reversal from the oversold zone.

Over the short term, the stock is likely to recover towards Rs 600 and Rs 620. On the lower end, Rs 534 is likely to act as a support, below which the stock may become weak again.

Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals: Buy | LTP: Rs 546.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 518 | Target: Rs 621 | Return: 14 percent

The stock has given a cup-and-handle pattern breakout on the daily chart. Also, the price has retested the breakout line before moving up again.

The price has moved higher after a few days of downward consolidation, which suggests the resumption of the uptrend after a pause. Besides, the stock is trading comfortably above the 50-day exponential moving average and 200-day simple moving average.

In the past six months, 32 lakh job searches for permanent and temporary remote jobs were made by Indian job seekers, of which about 57% were for permanent remote jobs.

After rolling out a special feature on the job board, the firm saw over 93,000 permanent and temporary remote jobs being listed on its site, of which permanent remote roles made up 22%.

For last two years, work space dynamics has changed due to the pandemic. Though things are opening up gradually, corporates largely believe that hybrid work is here to stay at least in the near to medium term.

“There is a foundational change in how recruiters are setting up organisational structures. While uncertainty prevails due to the pandemic, more and more recruiters are acknowledging the benefits of work from anywhere like access to talent and more inclusion and are now beginning to make permanent changes to the human resource and infrastructure requirements at a corporate level,” said Pawan Goyal, chief business officer of Naukri.

As uncertainty continues to lurk, companies are now choosing to go completely remote or hybrid, either permanently or temporarily.

“Moreover, companies have carefully considered the option of making some job profiles completely remote where the roles require a high individual contribution, especially popular in IT, software and BPO industries,” the job board said adding that the preferences of jobseekers have evolved and the hybrid model suits many job profiles that have low intervention on a day to day basis.

Both large and small companies have posted all three types of jobs -- regular jobs, temporary work-from-home and fully remote jobs.

Data shows that IT software, software services, ITeS and recruitment/staffing sectors are posting more permanent remote jobs. Some of the companies posting both temporary and permanent remote jobs are Amazon, Tech Mahindra, HCL, PWC, Trigent, Flipkart, Siemens, Deloitte, Oracle, Zensar, TCS, and Capgemini, according to Naukri.",332,

Some of the costs savings achieved during pandemic may sustain and coupled with high operating leverage may lead to higher than pre-covid margins from Q3FY22E. Stocks like Trent, V-Mart and Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail are the preferred picks backed by their strong and consistent track record of execution.

- Quarterly performance largely backed by improved realisations

- Medium-term triggers China plus and protectionist measures for tyre industry

In this week’s tactical pick, we have selected Tech Mahindra (CMP: Rs 1,454, Nifty level: 17,560) that has corrected over 16 percent in the past fortnight against a 9 percent fall in the IT index and a 4 percent decline in the Nifty.

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

Q3FY22 revenue was broadly in-line, while margins lagged estimates; Q3 saw healthy deal intake, strong deal pipeline, net hiring, good client mining and robust growth in BPS business. CME division reported strong growth of 6.2% q-o-q. With healthy deal wins, strong hiring and broad-based demand, we expect strong revenue growth in enterprise vertical in the medium-term. TechM is well-placed to capture opportunities in the 5G space given a strong client base and investments in building capabilities. Strong revenue growth, lower sub-contractor expenses, higher offshoring, benefits from tier-II cities and price hikes would negate margin headwinds in FY2023. USD revenue/earnings would clock a CAGR of 12%/16%, respectively, over FY22-FY24E.

Outlook

We maintain a Buy on TechM with a PT of Rs. 2,060, given healthy deal wins, a strong deal pipeline, higher 5G contribution and scope for margin improvement.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TechM)’s 3QFY22 USD revenue growth at 4.7% QoQ CC (organic growth at 4.0% QoQ CC) was 100bps above our estimates. It was driven by yet another quarter of strong performance from BPO (9.7% QoQ / 35.3% YoY), while IT Services was impacted by furloughs (up 2.0% QoQ, ex-acquisitions). Vertical growth was led by Comm. (+6.9% QoQ CC), while Enterprise (3.2% QoQ CC) was modest. New deal wins at USD704m (down 6% QoQ) have stayed in a narrow range in recent quarters. Although, the management continues to see sustained traction in the deal momentum. - Excluding one-off gains, the 3Q EBIT margin dipped 120bps QoQ to 14.0% v/s our expectation of 15.1% on higher subcontracting expenses (+12% QoQ), employee-related interventions, and lower utilization (-300bps QoQ to 86%). TechM added a modest 3.9k in 3Q after an all-time high net addition of 15k employees in 2Q.

Outlook

We continue to stay on the sidelines on TechM as we see stronger business performance as balanced by elevated operational risks in a supply-constrained environment. We reduce our EPS estimates by 3–4% for FY22E/FY23E post the 3Q miss. Our TP implies 19x FY24E EPS. We remain Neutral on the stock.

EBITM declined 40bps QoQ to 14.8%. Net new deal wins were robust, with a TCV of USD704mn, split across CME (USD226mn) and Enterprise (USD478mn).

Tech Mahindra share price fell over 3 percent in the early trade on February 2 - a day after the company reported its December quarter earnings.

Information technology major Tech Mahindra on February 1 reported a 2.2 percent quarter-on-quarter rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,368.5 crore. It posted a 5.2 percent sequential rise in consolidated revenues of Rs 11,451 crore.

In the US dollar terms, Tech Mahindra's revenues rose 4.1 percent sequentially, while in constant currency terms, the growth was 4.7 percent on-quarter.

On the operating front, the company's performance was strong as consolidated operating profit grew 3.3 percent sequentially to Rs 2,060 crore, which was sharply above Street's estimate of Rs 1,825 crore.

However, operating margins declined to 18 percent in the reported quarter from 18.3 percent in the previous quarter reflecting the impact of higher wages.

The company looks at 15,000 campus hires in 2022-23, up from 10,000 this financial year, as demand for digital technology services and attrition continue to increase.

The company added 3,874 people in the December quarter, taking the total headcount to 145,067. Attrition increased to 24 percent from 21 percent in the previous quarter.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company post December quarter earnings:

Nomura

The research firm has maintained the 'buy' rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,220 per share.

The revenue growth was better than expected, while near-term supply challenges weighed on the margin, it said.

The strong revenue growth was led by CME vertical and deal wins set the stage for strong growth in FY23.

UBS

The brokerage house has kept the 'sell' call on the stock with a target at Rs 1,260 as the Q3 revenue was in-line and margin misses, while slower hiring is likely to cause concern.

""It is committed to deliver broad-based profitable growth and barring a sector-wide rally, we expect a negative reaction,"" it said.

Morgan Stanley

Morgan Stanley has maintained the 'overweight' rating with a target price at Rs 2,100 on the back of in-line revenue and a slight miss on margin/EPS.

The net new deal wins strong at $704 million and growth is led by communication vertical.

Prabhudas Lilladher

""Our EPS estimates decrease by 3.2 percent/1.2 percent for FY22/23 led by cut in margin estimates and remain unchanged for FY24. We arrive at DCF based target price of Rs 1942 from earlier Rs 1945 (implying target multiple of 23x on FY24 EPS),"" it said.

The brokerage house maintained the 'buy' rating on the stock.

Sharekhan

Tech Mahindra is well-positioned to participate in the 5G opportunity across telecom service providers, ecosystem and enterprises given its sharp focus on digitisation, network integration with cloud and software architecture, investments in building capabilities along with people, partnerships and IP, besides a strong client base.

The company’s investments in building capabilities in enterprise segments through organic and inorganic routes would help it in gaining market share in BFSI, hi-tech, and healthcare verticals of the enterprise segment.

""We continue to prefer TechM, given improving execution, continued growth in the BPS business, strong pace of deal intake, scope for margin improvement and higher 5G activity among telecom players,"" it said.

Sharekhan maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs 2,060.

At 9:18am, Tech Mahindra was quoting at Rs 1,456.85, down Rs 50.20, or 3.33 percent on the BSE.

Tech Mahindra is likely to report a 2.3 percent sequential growth in consolidated net revenue to Rs 11,129 crore for the quarter ended December, aided by its recent acquisitions, an average of estimates from five brokerages polled by Moneycontrol showed.

The IT services major reports its December quarter earnings on February 1.

Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities expects recent acquisitions of Beris Consulting, Lodestone, and WMW to boost revenues by $11.8 million during the quarter.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects the information technology company to report a 3.7 percent sequential growth in topline in constant currency terms, driven by its communications and enterprise solutions verticals.

The Pune-based company is likely to report a 4.4 percent sequential growth in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,397.5 crore for the reporting quarter, the Moneycontrol poll found.

On the operating front, brokerages expect the strong topline growth to offset the impact of a higher wage growth in the quarter.

Besides the earnings, investors will wait for the management’s commentary on the 5G opportunity, attrition rate, deal momentum in the telecom vertical, and the ability to defend its 15 percent margin run-rate.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has become the second most valuable brand in the IT services sector globally, while Infosys and four other Indian tech majors have firmly established their position among the top 25 IT services brands tally, according to Brand Finance. Following TCS and Infosys (third spot), there are four more Indian brands now firmly established among the global elite – Wipro (7th), HCL (8th), Tech Mahindra (15th) and LTI (22nd), as per the Brand Finance IT Services 25 2022 report.

All six Indian brands feature among the top 10 fastest-growing IT Services brands over the course of 2020-2022, the brand valuation firm added. Accenture retained the title of world's most valuable and strongest IT services brand, boasting record brand value of $36.2 billion, as per the report.

Indian IT services brands made a leap with average growth from 2020 to 2022 at 51 per cent, compared to a seven per cent drop for brands from the US. A global turn to remote working for professional services and an accelerated digitalisation trend across the global economy have facilitated expansion of IT services hubs within India.

With strong IT services brands and a large population of people with digital skills, India will continue to play a major role in developing infrastructure for artificial intelligence, data analytics and Internet of Things (IoT), it added. The report said as IBM has gone down to fourth rank, TCS has risen up to second spot in ranking, following 12 per cent growth year-on-year and 24 per cent since 2020, to a brand value of $16.8 billion.

TCS – in a regulatory filing said – this growth is attributed to the company's investments in its brand and its employees, customer equity and strong financial performance. Strong revenue growth in 2021, saw TCS cross an important milestone, hitting $25 billion in revenue for the first time, with an industry-leading operating profit margin of over 25 per cent.

""TCS continues to rise up the IT services rankings to become the second most valuable brand in the sector for the first time. ""This great achievement is the result of strong financial growth, strong and continued investments in a new global brand positioning last year… I also see TCS' focused commitment to serving the needs of its employees, customers, and communities, which always in the long run drives brand performance,"" David Haigh, CEO and Chairman of Brand Finance, said.

TCS CMO Rajashree R said the ranking is a landmark milestone for the company and a validation of its increased market relevance and focus on innovation and transformation of clients, their customers, and the larger community. ""With our differentiated 'customer focused' strategy, superior execution, investments in building newer capabilities and sustained focus on research and innovation over the last decade, we are indeed well positioned to capitalise on the multi-year technology transformation opportunities that lie ahead,"" Rajashree added.

Infosys, at the third spot, emerged as the fastest-growing IT services brand globally following 52 per cent brand value growth since last year and 80 per cent since 2020 to USD 12.8 billion. Over the past two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the change is even more impressive with the brand recording an 80 per cent gain, the report said.

Strong business results can be attributed to the brand's ability to credibly adapt its offering to fast-evolving needs of today's economy as well as to its continued investment into innovative solutions that help clients securely accelerate their journey to the cloud, the report noted. Infosys has also continued to build brand recognition globally by nurturing sports collaborations with ATP, Roland Garros, and the Australian Open, while also forging new ones with Madison Square Garden and media-heavyweights The Economist, Financial Times, Bloomberg, it added.

While digital transformation accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, Wipro's performance demonstrated strong revenues and growth in brand value, the report said, adding that the Bengaluru-based conglomerate has a brand value of $6.3 billion with an increase of 48 per cent since the previous year. HCL – which has signed 58 projects across various sectors, including telecommunications, life sciences, manufacturing and technology – saw 10 per cent growth in brand value over the past year to $6.1 billion. The brand announced that its revenue grew by 2.4 per cent y-o-y to a total of $10.2 billion, the report stated.

Tech Mahindra had a brand value growth of 45 per cent over the last two years to $3 billion. The growth is a result of focussed brand building efforts, the report said, adding that it was also the only Indian organisation to receive the Terra Carta Seal by the Prince of Wales for its commitment to creating a sustainable future. ""By implementing projects that lay equal emphasis on people, planet, and profits, the organisation has been recognised for its social impact. Additionally, the business focus on digitalisation, cloud transformation, telecommunications, and other key digital requirements has consistently strengthened Tech Mahindra's brand positioning,"" it said.",841,0.999992468140342

After a significant rally of 10 percent, the market, for first time, saw some meaningful correction in the week ended January 21 as the benchmark indices fell 3.5 percent amid inflation concerns, rising oil prices, spiking US bond yields and FII selling. Traders also seem cautious ahead of the Union Budget.

The Nifty50 fell more than 600 points during the week to settle at 17,617, as selling pressure was seen across sectors barring energy, forming large bearish candle on the daily charts. It was down seven-tenth of a percent and formed Doji kind of pattern on the daily charts, indicating indecisiveness among bulls and bears.

The index defended the 17,500 level which is going to act as a crucial support next week as breaking the same can drag the index towards 17,300 levels, while the 17,700 mark would be a crucial hurdle, experts feel.

""Before this corrective phase, we had seen a sharp surge, too, wherein the index had rallied from 16,410 to 18,300 without any meaningful correction and thus, this down move could be seen as a corrective phase within the uptrend,"" says Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com.

He further says the index has retraced 38.2 percent of the previous rally and has formed a 'Doji' candlestick pattern on the daily chart. ""This pattern near the support indicates indecision and thus a follow up move in the coming week is likely to dictate the near term direction.""

For the coming week, Ruchit Jain says 17,500 will be seen as an important support while a move above 17,700 could again lead to a buying interest among market participants and take the index towards 17,900-18,000.

This week's correction is just a short-term corrective phase and the market should now resume the uptrend to mark a pre-budget rally, says Jain.

Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on the January 21 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,593.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,480 | Target: Rs 1,690-1,770 | Return: 6-11 percent

On Friday, the stock completed a corrective pattern between the Rs 1,610-1,600 levels. It was at Rs 1,838 in December 2021 and currently it is available at Rs 1,600, which is a decent correction from the high level but it is still in the trading range of the previous up-move, which was between Rs 1,480 and Rs 1,838.

Buy at the current levels, add more if the stock falls to Rs 1,540. Make the final stop-loss near Rs 1,480. On the upside, there would be resistance at Rs 1,690 and Rs 1,770.

Tata Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 241.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 225 | Target: Rs 268-287 | Return: 11-19 percent

Last month, the stock was consolidating into an ascending triangle, which was transformed into a breakout formation above the Rs 230 level.

It is pursuing a breakout formation that allows the stock to reach Rs 268, which was its previous highest level. Buy at current levels for a target of a minimum of Rs 268 and a maximum of Rs 287 over the next few months. For that, keep the stop-loss at Rs 225.

IRB Infrastructure: Buy | LTP: Rs 232.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 210 | Target: Rs 263-290 | Return: 13-25 percent

After hitting the support at Rs 200, it is forming a rounding bottom. It has taken almost a month, which is positive for the stock and may help the stock to move upwards.

It is advisable to buy between the Rs 240 and Rs 230 levels for the target of Rs 263, where the stock has left the bearish gap and the next target would be Rs 290. For that, keep a stop-loss at Rs 210.

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

Linde India: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,774.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,630 | Target: Rs 3,065 | Return: 10 percent

After showing a rangebound action in the last few weeks, the stock price (Linde India) has witnessed a sharp upside breakout in this week amid a volatile broader market. The stock price has moved above the crucial resistance of the consolidation at Rs 2,535 levels on Friday and closed higher. Hence, there is a higher possibility of further extension of upside momentum in the coming week.

Volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period relative strength index (RSI) shows positive indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price ahead.

Buying can be initiated in Linde India at CMP, add more on dips down to Rs 2,700, wait for the upside target of Rs 3,065 in the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 2,630.

CCL Products India: Buy | LTP: Rs 460.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 430 | Target: Rs 515 | Return: 12 percent

After showing minor weakness within a narrow range in the last two weeks, the stock price has witnessed a decisive upside bounce of the range movement at Rs 440 levels in this week and closed higher. The weekly candle pattern indicate a decisive upside breakout of the larger consolidation pattern.

The larger positive sequence like higher tops and bottoms is intact as per weekly timeframe chart. Volume has expanded on Friday during upside breakout and the weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication.

One may look to buy CCL Products at CMP, add more on dips down to Rs 445 and wait for the upside target of Rs 515 in the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 430.

Biocon: Buy | LTP: Rs 377.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 350 | Target: Rs 417 | Return: 11 percent

The down trend of the last many months seems to have completed in this stock (Biocon). The stock price is now making an attempt to stage upside breakout of the consolidation movement (type of triangle pattern) at Rs 385 levels.

After showing a larger downward trend in the last many months, the stock price seems to have halted its down trend and recently showed an accumulation type pattern at the lows. This bullish action could consider as an attempt of decisive change in trend in the stock price towards upside.

The volume has started to expand and weekly 14 period RSI and weekly ADX/DMI (average directional index/direction movement index) signal chances of further strengthening of upside momentum for the stock price ahead.

One may look to buy Biocon at CMP, add more on dips down to Rs 360 and wait for the upside target of Rs 417 in the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 350.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: 2,325.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,250 | Target: Rs 2,440 | Return: 5 percent

This stock has gone through a corrective phase in last four months and prices have corrected from its high of Rs 2,850 to Rs 2,200. Historically, the '20-EMA' (exponential moving average) on the monthly charts have acted as a support during price corrections from where we again usually witness buying interest in this stock.

After this recent correction, the stock is trading near its long-term moving average support and now even on the daily chart, we witnessed some buying interest in the stock on Friday. This up move during the day was supported by good volumes while a combination of short covering and long formation was seen in the derivatives segment. Hence, we expect a pullback move in the stock in the near term.

Thus, short-term traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 2,320-2,300 for a potential target of Rs 2,440 in next 2-3 weeks. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 2,250 on long positions.

Bharat Dynamics: Buy | LTP: Rs 459.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 435 | Target: Rs 500 | Return: 9 percent

In the recent corrective phases, the stock has managed to find support around its '200 EMA' on the daily chart and in this month, we have witnessed a decent buying interest in the stock. Prices have seen an up move supported by good volumes while the stock has also given a breakout from its resistance.

The weekly and monthly momentum readings are indicating a positive structure and hence, we expect the stock prices to continue its up move in the short term.

Hence, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 460-450 for a potential target of Rs 500 in next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 435 on long positions.

Hitachi Energy India: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,030.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,750 | Target: Rs 3,450 | Return: 14 percent

The stock has been forming a 'Higher Top Higher Bottom' structure on the weekly charts and is thus in an uptrend. In last couple of months, the stock went through a time-wise correction and prices have given a breakout from this consolidation during this week.

The price up move on Friday was supported by good volumes which indicate that the stock has resumed its broader uptrend. The breakout zone of Rs 2,850-2,800 should now become a support on any declines and hence, short term traders can adopt a strategy to buy the stock at current levels and add on dips towards the mentioned support.

Thus, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy around Rs 3,000 for a potential target of Rs 3,450 in next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 2,750 on long positions.

Expert: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One

Time Technoplast: Buy | LTP: Rs 86.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 77.90 | Target: Rs 102 | Return: 18.3 percent

Although the entire market corrected sharply this week, there were few handful of stocks who did extremely well and this stock is clearly one of them.

On Friday, despite stock prices falling sharply on the back of profit booking, the weekly structure still looks quite sturdy. We can see it traversing weekly '200-SMA' with some authority along with sizable volumes, indicating tremendous strength in the counter.

The momentum oscillators on daily charts are pointing northwards, which indicates momentum to continue in the upward direction. We recommend buying for a medium term target of Rs 102. The stop loss can be placed at Rs 77.90.

CTC generated revenue of EUR 71.3 mn (~81.36 USD mn) in CY20 which amounts to 2% of TechM’s FY21 revenue. In 9MCY21 it reported revenue of EUR 69 mn(~USD78.7mn) - (quarterly run-rate of USD 26 mn vs USD 20 mn in CY20). About 60% of its revenue are from an anchor client. CTC’s valuation of 4.3x EV/Sales is at upper end of similar transactions in this space. It is TechM’s largest and among its most expensive acquisitions, compelling the company to drive cross-selling deals for scaling up in insurance space. CTC acquisition will enable TechM – 1) to scale up in Insurance sector given CTC’s deep digital transformation expertise in the sector, 2) to expand Eastern European near shore delivery centre as CTC has over 720+ highly-skilled IT professionals located in Latvia (85%) and Belarus (15%), regions having highly skilled pool of tech talent and 3) provide TechM with tech talent having differentiated capabilities in end-to-end digital engineering which can be scaled up across different industries.

We arrive at DCF based target price of Rs.1945, earlier Rs. 1908 (implying target multiple of 23x on FY24 EPS).

This acquisition would drive the company’s growth going ahead given cross-sell opportunities, enhancement of capabilities in digital engineering space, creating integrated offerings for insurers and increasing the chance of winning large transformational deals.

As CTC has industry-leading margin, the acquisition will be margin accretive to TechM on a consolidated basis.

Motilal Oswal

Tech Mahindra’s higher exposure to the Communications vertical remains a potential opportunity as a broader 5G rollout can lead to a new spending cycle in this space. The company is seeing traction in 5G investments.

Technology companies will kick off the December quarter earnings season next week with Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Wipro releasing their numbers. Experts expect revenue growth to be healthy despite the seasonality factor, driven by a robust demand outlook amid digitalisation. Midcap IT companies are likely to continue to outperform large-cap firms.

The Nifty IT index surged 60 percent in 2021 and gained 10.5 percent in the quarter ended December, outperforming other sectors as well as the Nifty 50, which fell 1.5 percent during the quarter due to high valuations and US Federal Reserve tightening.

Tech Mahindra was the biggest gainer among IT stocks in the December quarter, rising 30 percent, followed by L&T Infotech with a 27 percent gain. Mindtree, Wipro, Infosys and Coforge rallied 12-14 percent, while HCL Technologies was up 3 percent. TCS underperformed, falling 1 percent.

Top line performance

Analysts expect the third quarter (October-December) of FY22 to be another strong one for IT companies as large-caps (tier-1) are expected to report 2.5-4.5 percent revenue growth in constant currency terms, and midcap IT firms (tier-II) are set to clock 3.5-6.5 percent top line growth in constant currency terms, driven by healthy deal flows. Dollar revenue growth is likely to be 2-3.3 percent quarter-on-quarter. December is generally a lean month due to Christmas and New Year holidays.

“Despite the impact of furloughs, we forecast extremely strong revenue growth led by high discretionary and continuing transformation spends,” Kotak Institutional Equities said. “Wipro, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies will likely deliver around 4.5 percent growth in constant currency. We forecast Infosys' growth at 3.7 percent and TCS to deliver modest 2.6 percent QoQ growth.”

The brokerage said mid-tier companies may deliver revenue growth rate of 5-6 percent in constant currency, with YoY growth of 20-34 percent.

Companies will have cross-currency headwinds of 20-90 basis points due to the dollar’s appreciation against the pound, the euro and the Australian dollar, it said. One basis point is equal to one-hundredth of a percent.

Elara Capital expects tier-1 IT service companies to report organic growth in the range of 2.5-4 percent QoQ in constant currency.

“Average revenue growth in USD terms is expected to be 3.1 percent QoQ, dragged by negative cross-currency impact of around 65 bp QoQ. Growth momentum has been robust despite Q3 seasonality and strong base (more than 4 percent CQGR over the past four quarters),” Elara said. CQGR refers to compounded quarterly growth rate.

The growth momentum is supported by healthy deal flows (small and mid-sized), a better annual contract value-to-total contract value trajectory, and continued offshore- and volume-led growth, the brokerage said.

In the midcap space, “Mindtree, L&T Infotech and Persistent Systems are expected to lead growth within the pack and would post mid-single-digit to high single-digit sequential growth,” said Elara.

Deal wins

Deal wins are expected to remain healthy, but reported total contract values (TCV) may not reflect the strength in demand fully.

“We expect deal intake to remain healthy across companies in Q3,” said Emkay Global.

However, TCVs may remain steady as deal tenures have become shorter with clients wanting digital transformation projects to be implemented in a short span rather than signing large, longer-tenure deals, which follow lengthy due diligence and legal processes, Emkay said.

The deal pipeline is robust across the IT sector, driven by an uptick in contracts related to cloud adoption, digital transformation and customer experience transformation, the brokerage added.

Accenture’s recent results created buoyancy among IT companies, indicating that growth in tech will continue and remain upwards.

FY22 guidance

Infosys and L&T Technology Services are expected to revise their full-year constant currency revenue growth guidance upwards.

“We expect Infosys to tighten the guidance band to 17-17.5 percent from 16.5-17.5 percent earlier,” said Kotak.

Infosys started the year with a revenue growth guidance of 12-14 percent. HCL Technologies estimated double-digit revenue growth.

“We expect HCL Technologies to deliver revenue growth of around 12 percent in constant currency for FY22. L&T Technology raised the revenue growth guidance after September quarter results to 19-20 percent. We believe it may further up the guidance to 20-21 percent,” Kotak said.

Emkay expects Infosys to revise its FY22 revenue growth guidance to 17.5-18 percent year-on-year, while IDBI Capital expects Infosys to up the guidance to 18-19 percent.

According to both brokerages, Wipro may project a 2-4 percent QoQ revenue growth in constant currency for the fourth quarter of FY22.

Operating performance

The earnings before interest and tax margin is expected to be steady on a sequential basis and lower on a year-on-year basis due to the high base in the year-ago quarter. The attrition rate is expected to remain on the higher side.

There were many benefits in December such as the deferment of wage revision (except for TCS), negligible travel costs and a pullback in discretionary spending. Companies have rolled out wage increases twice since the December 2020 quarter, which reflects in YoY decline in margins.

The margin picture will be steady on a sequential basis with primary headwinds emanating from the backfilling of attrition with lateral recruitment, which costs 25-30 percent more, a decline in utilisation rate as companies load up on fresher hiring, and a creeping rise in discretionary costs, Kotak said.

“These will be offset to some extent through further tightening of operations,” said Kotak, adding all companies will report a YoY decline in EBIT margins.

On the bottom line, Motilal Oswal expects tier-I tech companies to deliver growth of about 11 percent YoY and about 6 percent QoQ.

“Tier-II players are expected to report a robust PAT growth (around 23 percent YoY and 6 percent QoQ), driven by strong revenue growth, but partially offset by lower EBIT margins,” it said.

Key factors

Deal wins and the deals pipeline, outlook, attrition and hiring trends, commentary on CY22 IT budgets, demand environment in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), manufacturing, retail, and communications, the pricing environment and digital trends are the key factors to watch out for.

Stocks to bet

Emkay’s pecking order is Infosys, TCS, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra among tier-1 companies and Route Mobile, Mphasis, Firstsource Solutions, e-Clerx Services, Persistent Systems and Birlasoft in midcaps.

Motilal Oswal prefers tier-I companies, given their relative valuation attractiveness and tendency to narrow down the valuation differential over time.

“Among tier-I players, we like Infosys, HCL Technologies, and TCS. In tier-II, we prefer L&T Technology Services and Zen Technologies.

Elara Capital prefers Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Tech among tier-1 firms and Mphasis among mid-tier IT companies. IDBI Capital prefers Infosys and Wipro among large-caps and Zensar, Birlasoft and Tech Mahindra among midcaps.

Kotak is still constructive on the space, although returns will moderate from here.

“Infosys, HCL Technologies and Mphasis are our top picks,” Kotak said.

From the broader point of view, we believe that the index might consolidate between the 17,600 and 16,400 levels.

On the indicator front, the RSI (relative strength index) plotted on the daily time frame can be seen moving higher towards 50 after forming a bullish hinge near 30, indicating exhaustion in the bearish momentum in the price.

Going ahead, we expect the 17,200 mark to act as a strong resistance level. If the prices breach above the 17,200 mark, we can expect the prices to move higher towards the 17,600 level.

This analysis will not hold true if the prices breach below the 16,950 level.

Here are the three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

HCL Technologies: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,227.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,190 | Target: Rs 1,472 | Return: 20 percent

HCL Technologies on the long-term charts can be seen forming a higher high higher low pattern, indicating that the long-term trend of the stock remains strongly bullish. On the medium charts we can see that the prices are moving higher after a correction.

On the indicator front, the RSI can be seen moving higher after forming a bullish hinge near the 50 mark, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.

Going ahead, we might see the prices move higher towards the previous swing high of Rs 1,378. If the prices managed to sustain above this level, we might see the prices move higher towards Rs 1,472.

We would recommend a strict stop-loss of Rs 1,190 on the daily closing basis.

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,683.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 | Target: Rs 1,858 | Return: 10 percent

Tech Mahindra on the medium-term charts can be seen drifting higher since October 2021. On December 23, the prices tested a fresh 52-week high.

On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on both the weekly and the daily charts can be seen placed above 50 and moving higher towards the overbought, indicating presence of bullish momentum in the prices.

The prices action and the technical parameters mentioned above point towards the possibility of the prices moving higher towards the Rs 1,752 mark. If the prices sustain above the Rs 1,752 mark, we might see the prices move higher towards the Rs 1,858.

Tech Mahindra can be seen drifting higher and testing fresh 52-week highs. One can enter Tech Mahindra at current levels and continue to hold it with a target of Rs 1,858 and maintain a stop-loss of Rs 1,600 on closing basis.

MMTC: Buy | LTP: Rs 47 | Stop-Loss: Rs 40 | Target: Rs 62 | Return: 32 percent

MMTC bounced off the Rs 34 mark on November 29, 2021 and moved higher. On December 23, the prices gained momentum and moved above the three-week high of Rs 46.35. This up move was backed by good volume build up, indicating participation in the up move.

On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on the weekly chart can be seen placed above the 50 mark and moving higher, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.

Looking at the technical parameters, we expect the prices to move higher towards the Rs 53 mark immediately. If the prices move higher, we might see the prices move towards Rs 62 level eventually.

We recommend a strict stop-loss of Rs 40 on the downside.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra gave further insights into NXT.NOW growth strategy at an analyst meet. It also shared updates on progress made on large deals participation and win rate, steps taken to broaden growth, account segmentation, delivery excellence and capital allocation. The company remains confident of delivering double-digit organic revenue growth in FY22, given broad-based demand, strong deal wins (USD3bn in LTM), improving win rates (2x growth) and steady progress on client mining. TechM reiterated its guidance to maintain EBITM at 15% with an upward bias in FY22 on the back of revenue momentum, automation-led operating efficiencies, and offshore shift, negating salary inflation, spike in attrition and normalization of WFH savings.

Outlook

We maintain Buy with a TP of Rs1,870 at 25x Sep’23E EPS, considering an improving revenue growth trajectory with a stable-to-improving margin profile, improving payout (~60% of FCF on 3-year rolling basis) and reasonable valuations.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

We attended Tech Mahindra (TECHM)’s Investor Day; the overall management commentary was strong for both Communications and Enterprise, driven by 5G spending. The Communications vertical is expected to continue to witness growth, driven by 5G and digital transformation related spends. The management also outlined its aspirations to scale up the Enterprise verticals (HLS, Manufacturing, Hi-Tech, BFSI), which should provide comfort on the medium-term growth visibility. The deal win trajectory has accelerated, which the management expects would sustain. The company’s large-deal strategy and customer-led approach are showing results. Commentary around EBIT margins was strong, and while the management did not quantify medium-term margin aspirations, it was confident about margin expansion over the medium term. We see near-term headwinds and stretched operating metrics, and expect stable margins in 2HFY22. We expect margin expansion at 80bps over FY21–23, resulting in a 20% PAT CAGR over FY21–23E. TECHM's high exposure to the Communications vertical remains a potential opportunity as a broader 5G rollout could lead to a new spending cycle in this space. The company is seeing traction in 5G investments. Moreover, the focus on scaling the Enterprise vertical and driving large deals adds to the medium-term growth visibility. Our TP implies 22x FY23E EPS, and we maintain a Neutral rating.



Outlook

We expect TECHM to deliver growth in the mid-teens in FY22. We value the stock at 22x FY23E EPS and maintain Neutral.

The market snapped a three-day loss with a stellar run on November 12, taking the BSE Sensex strongly above the 60,000 mark and the Nifty50 above 18,100, backed by gains across sectors.

The BSE Sensex jumped 767 points to 60,686.69, while the Nifty50 rose 229.20 points to 18,102.80. The broader market registered less gains compared to the frontline indices with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices climbing 0.45 percent and 0.29 percent.

Stocks that were in focus include IndiGo operator InterGlobe Aviation which was the biggest gainer in the futures and options segment, hitting a record high of Rs 2,324.95 before closing with 7.39 percent gains at Rs 2,306.25, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company was the second biggest gainer in the F&O segment, rising 4.76 percent to Rs 672.60.

Sheela Foam was also in focus on Friday as it touched a fresh record high of Rs 3,247.70, before closing with 13.95 percent gains at Rs 3,117.35, and Tech Mahindra was the top gainer in the Nifty50, increasing 4.14 percent to close at Rs 1,585.

Here’s what Mehul Kothari, of Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

InterGlobe Aviation

After some relief from the COVID cases, India started moving to regain normalcy. With the business looking up and the economy resuming activities, aviation giant IndiGo started flying high in the market.

The price action indicates that the stock has a potential to go towards Rs 2,800-3,000 in the coming months. Thus, traders and investors both should continue to hold the stock. On the downside, support lies at the Rs 2,000 mark.

Sheela Foam

The daily chart of Sheela Foam depicts that the stock had been consolidating in a broad range of Rs 2,500 to Rs 2,000 since the past 6-9 months. It recently managed to break out of this range and is now trading above Rs 3,000.

We feel that the stock has some more fume left on the upside and hence traders and investors should continue to hold it. Downside support is at Rs 2,500.

Tech Mahindra

The line chart of Tech Mahindra construes that the stock is in a strong uptrend and investors should continue to hold it in their portfolio.

However, traders can stay long until the rising trend line remains intact. It means that strong support is placed at Rs 1,370. The trend would change only on a breach of the mentioned level. On the upside, the stock has the potential to test Rs 1,700-Rs 1,800 levels.

ICICI Prudential Life Insurance

The stock has confirmed a range breakout above Rs 540 during the month of May 2021. The theoretical target of the breakout comes around Rs 800.

The stock has turned from the rising trend line support as displayed on the chart. Thus we are of the opinion that the stock might be heading towards Rs 800 mark and, therefore, traders and investors should hold it for long. The stop loss for both the positions could be the recent low of Rs 600.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech M reported revenue of USD1,472.6 mn growth of 6.4% QoQ USD, much above our and cons estimates (Ple: 4.2%, Cons: 4%). It includes ~1% contribution from full quarter consolidation of two acquisitions, viz. DigitalOnUs and Eventus. Growth was strong across Enterprise vertical +6.3% QoQ USD and Communications vertical +6.7% QoQ USD. Growth momentum is expected to continue given strong net new deal TCV of USD750 mn, 78% YoY and TTM net new deal TCV of ~USD 3 Bn, +25% YoY. 2H is seasonally strong for TECHM. EBIT Margins were resilient despite supply side pressures at 15.2%, flat QoQ (Ple: 15%, Cons:15.1%). Tailwinds from revenue growth leverage was offset by lower utilization including trainees (87%, -100bps QoQ) and higher sub-con costs (+52 bps QoQ). Management is confident on maintaining EBIT margins above 15% despite headwinds from supply side pressures and higher attrition (21%, +400bps QoQ) due to margin levers - i) offshoring, ii) G&A costs centralization for portfolio companies, iii) pyramid optimization (doubled intake of freshers in FY22) and v) revenue growth leverage.



Outlook

Our EPS estimates increase by 5.4%/2.3% for FY23/24 led by revenue increase in revenue growth estimates for FY23 & FY24 and EBIT margin estimate for FY23. We arrive at DCF based target price of 1862 (implying target multiple of 18.5x on FY24 EPS). TechM is currently trading at 20X/18.5X earnings multiple on FY23/24 EPS of INR 75.8/82.5 on FY22/23E respectively, inexpensive. TechM has Revenue/EPS CAGR of 15.3%/12.8% over FY22-24. Maintain Buy.

Morgan Stanley

Morgan Stanley has kept overweight call on the stock and raised the target price to Rs 1,900 per share.

It believes that upgrade & re-rating triggers will continue to play out going ahead. The good deal win momentum and resilient margin in H2 will boost earnings, and improved capital allocation would drive further re-rating.

The growth gap with peers is narrowing, the brokerage added.

CLSA

The research house has maintained outperform call on the stock and has raised the target price to Rs 1,720 from Rs 1,600.

It was well-rounded Q2 that carried forward the momentum from Q1. CLSA raised FY22/23 EPS estimates by 1.4%/1.9%. The risk-reward is favourable despite a 35% rally in last 3 months, it further added.

Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs has maintained neutral call with a target at Rs 1,447 as results were in-line with strong revenue growth but not sustainable.

It has done better than expectations in this quarter. The strong revenue growth in this quarter is a function of pent-up demand.

Citi

Broking firm has maintained buy call and raised the target to Rs 1,765 from Rs 1,655, as it remains one of top sector picks.

Citi raises FY22-24 EPS estimates by 2-3% and company looks well placed in FY23.

IT services company Tech Mahindra added 14,930 employees for the quarter ending September 2021 as the demand for technology services continue to increase.

With the addition, the company now employs 1.41 lakh people.

While the company did not quantify the fresher intake for the year, the hiring strategy is likely to continue in the wake of the robust demand environment, and rising attrition. Its attrition soared to 21 percent, up from 17 percent in the last quarter.

The company added 5,200 employees in the previous quarter ending June 2021.

During the earnings call on October 25, CP Gurnani, CEO & MD, said, “It is a fairly complex environment, because as you know that the demand is coming from the corporates, global delivery centers and others.”

This is resulting in attrition, which is higher in the Indian cities such as Bengaluru or Hyderabad, and much lower in cities such as Nagpur based on the analytics done by the company. “So, we are obviously trying to see how to grow our business in tier two cities. And we are also looking at providing business continuity for a particular project not only from one location to one from multiple locations,” Gurnani said.

The company is also looking at attrition in the coming quarters, and has plans to hire or re-skill or upskill employees a little ahead to manage the supply-chain equation, he added.

Tech Mahindra reported $1.47 billion in revenues for the quarter ending September, growth of 6.4 percent on a sequential basis. The company closed $750 million in net new deals. CP Gurnani, CEO & MD, said it was the highest sequential growth in a decade the company had seen.

The 5G tech team

One of the key growth areas for the company include 5G, where the company has made significant investments.

Vivek Agarwal, president – BFSI, HLS, and corporate development, Tech Mahindra, said during the company's Q2 FY22 results that the company is looking at all possible avenues for bringing in the right skill set in sectors such as 5G. “We obviously have a very large pool of people reskilling in the emerging 5G technologies area.”

“Are we necessarily hiring from engineering colleges and looking at training versus hiring from telecom operators? I think it's a mix right. People come in with industry experience and technology expertise. So it's our ability to put all of that together – domain expertise, engineering expertise to be able to service our customers. So that's the approach we're taking here to fulfill the needs and demand in the 5G ecosystem.”",442,0.6873793005943298

Tech Mahindra share price traded in the red on October 25 ahead of its September quarter results.

The IT firm will declare its second quarter results today. It is expected to post a revenue growth of around 5 percent on a sequential basis based on the strong growth in Enterprise Segment (ES) driven by digitisation and a pick-up in momentum of 5G deals in Communication Segment (CS). For the company, ES segment contributes 60 percent of the revenues, while the rest comes from the CS business.

Analysts expect the bottomline to remain flat with a marginal rise of 2 percent on an on-quarter basis due to the impact of higher employee costs on margins. The company had given away 75-80 percent wage hikes to its workforce and the cost of lateral hiring will be on a higher side. Attrition rate will also be a key number to watch out for.

The stock was trading at Rs 1,500.20, down Rs 17.80, or 1.17 percent at 09:56 hours. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,535.00 and an intraday low of Rs 1,483.45.

Currently, it is trading 4.81 percent below its 52-week high and 91.78 percent above its 52-week low. Market capitalisation stands at Rs 145,508.14 crore.

Experts expect the TCV of new deals to be in the region of $700 million, which is higher than the quarterly average of $400-500 million. Kotak Institutional Securities expect the deal pipeline to be so strong that will power a robust growth.

EBIT margins are expected to remain flat at 15 percent with most experts predicting a less-than-1 percent improvement. They expect the benefits of higher efficiency to be negated by higher employee costs.

Analysts expect the company to report a PAT in the region of Rs 1,400 crore with an expected increase of around 3 percent. ICICI Direct expects the PAT to improve to Rs 1,398 crore aided by lower tax and higher other income. Kotak and Sharekhan expect PAT of Rs 1,405 crore and Rs 1,408 crore.

Tech Mahindra Ltd. (TECHM), part of the Mahindra group, and one of India’s top-five IT services companies, will declare its second quarter results today. It is expected to post a revenue growth of around 5 percent on a sequential basis based on the strong growth in Enterprise Segment (ES) driven by digitisation and a pick-up in momentum of 5G deals in Communication Segment (CS). For the company, ES segment contributes 60 percent of the revenues, while the rest comes from the CS business.

Experts expect the bottomline to remain flat with a marginal rise of 2 percent on an on-quarter basis due to the impact of higher employee costs on margins. The company had given away 75-80 percent wage hikes to its workforce and the cost of lateral hiring will be on a higher side. Attrition rate will also be a key number to watch out for.

“Multiple small acquisitions will contribute incremental $11.5 million or 0.8 percent to revenues. These acquisitions include DigitalOnUs and Eventus Solutions,” said a report from Kotak Institutional Securities. It expects the benefit of seasonal recovery in Comviva and growth leverage will be offset by a decline in the utilisation rates and higher cost of laterals to backfill attrition. It estimates the revenue at Rs 10,649 crore.

A Sharekhan report suggests a revenue growth of 4.8 percent QoQ on a CC basis and cross-currency headwinds of around 80 bps on its USD revenue. Hence, the USD revenue is expected to grow 4 percent QoQ. It expects the INR revenue at Rs 10,665 crore.

Sharekhan further echoes the views of Kotak and expects growth would be driven by strong growth in both CME and enterprise segments and incremental revenue contribution from multiple small acquisitions.

Motilal Oswal expects a CC growth of 3.5 percent on a QoQ basis. It estimates the USD revenue to be $1,432 million and INR revenues at Rs 10,600 crore.

Experts expect the TCV of new deals to be in the region of $700 million, which is higher than the quarterly average of $400-500 million. Kotak Institutional Securities expect the deal pipeline to be so strong that will power a robust growth.

EBIT margins are expected to remain flat at 15 percent with most experts predicting a less-than-1 percent improvement. They expect the benefits of higher efficiency to be negated by higher employee costs.

Motilal Oswal predicts EBIT margin of 14.8 percent, while Kotak expects it to be 15.1 percent. ICICI Direct follows the same line and predicts an EBIT margin of 15.2 percent.

Experts expect the company to report a PAT in the region of Rs 1,400 crore with an expected increase of around 3 percent. ICICI Direct expects the PAT to improve to Rs 1,398 crore aided by lower tax and higher other income. Kotak and Sharekhan expect PAT of Rs 1,405 crore and Rs 1,408 crore.

Motilal Oswal, however, has slightly lower expectations on PAT and expects it to come around Rs 1,300 crore due to the impact of hiring, higher sub-contracting and retention costs.

From the future growth perspective, it would be important to keep focus on margin levers, deal signings / pipeline and incremental order flows from 5G services.

As per Kotak’s report, the focus would be on pricing leverage, attrition rates, ability to backfill attrition and its impact on profitability, 5G opportunity and the likely timeframe when it will flow in and deal momentum in telecom.

Sharkhan would be focusing on commentary on enterprise business, especially the BFSI and manufacturing verticals; margin trajectory, pricing environment and steps taken to manage attrition rate; commentary on BPO business and progress in enterprise business; and M&A strategy and payout plans.",625,0.499675489962101

The market had attempted several times to get back decisively above 17,600 mark on the Nifty 50 amid its roller coaster ride but failed and finally settled below the same level with moderate losses. The BSE Sensex closed below 59,000 levels with losses of 78 points on September 22.

The broader markets hogged the limelight by outshining benchmark indices as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices gaining 1.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively.

Stocks that were in focus on Wednesday included media & entertainment company Zee Entertainment Enterprises after a merger deal with Sony Pictures Networks, which as a result shot up 31.86 percent to close at Rs 337.10 amid high volumes, the highest level since November 2019. Real estate major DLF was the second biggest gainer in the F&O segment as well as Realty index, rising 11.61 percent to Rs 369.15, while IT services company Tech Mahindra was the biggest gainer among largecap IT stocks, rising 3.7 percent to Rs 1,514.05.

Among others, media company NDTV shares hit upper circuit for third consecutive session, climbing 10 percent to close at fresh 52-week high of Rs 96.35, while tyre maker Balkrishna Industries share price hit a record high of Rs 2,709.95 before closing with gains of 6.57 percent at Rs 2,693.35.

Here's what Gaurav Sharma, AVP Research at Globe Capital Markets Ltd, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Zee Entertainment Enterprises

It was underperforming from quite some time before recent developments viz. removal of existing directors and more importantly after signing merger with Sony Pictures. On charts, it is looking quite attractive and we see it heading towards Rs 365-380 levels soon.

Considering, it has moved up sharply, possibility of some profit taking cannot be ruled out but that should be considered as a buying opportunity.

NDTV

This stock has posted fresh breakout after consolidating for almost 4 months. Back to back three upper circuits have already been seen.

We see stock continuing on the growth path and Rs 125 is the upside level that can be tested in coming months.

DLF

DLF is the largest listed real estate company, hence, it has its own space within Indian equity market. Cup & Handle formation is very prominently visible on monthly chart.

Hence, we maintain bullish view on this stock as we see it heading towards Rs 400-420 levels in the near term itself.

Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra is a prominent Indian IT company and is part of Nifty50 stocks as well. Off-late, it has posted fresh breakout on daily chart after consolidating in range Rs 1,406 – 1,475 levels.

The breakout was supported by strong volume indicating buyers' interest at current levels. Considering recent chart pattern, we see it heading towards Rs 1,600 levels in the immediate short term.

Balkrishna Industries

Balkrishna Industries manufactures off-highway tyres used in specialist segments like mining, earthmoving, agriculture, and gardening. It has been a continuous performer and has performed exceptionally well in past.

The stock is very well placed on multiple chart frames, short as well as long, giving us high conviction of the recent upmove continuing, Rs 2,850-2,900 is the next immediate target that we are eyeing at in the immediate near term.

Tech Mahindra’s R&D arm Maker’s Lab started research for developing a therapeutic drug for COVID-19 in March 2020, at the onset of the pandemic. More than a year later, it has applied for a drug patent in partnership with Indian R&D firms ReaGene Biosciences and INDRAS, and is likely to get into trial in 3-4 months, and then partner with pharma companies to commercialize it.

The whole process is likely to take two years or more, says Nikhil Malhotra, Chief Innovation Officer, and creator of Maker’s Lab.

But as more and more people get vaccinated, would such a drug be needed after two years? Malhotra answers this question and how the business potential of the expertise that the company is acquiring in life sciences.

Edited Excerpts:

At the onset of the pandemic, Tech Mahindra’s Maker’s Lab announced it was working on COVID-19 drug discovery. Could you share how the process started and the progress now?

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

We started studying the virus first. It took about 1.5 months to actually read about the virus and a month-long lesson with some of the virologists. Then we started delving deeper into the virus, started looking at if there are some kind of viruses already there in the history that we can draw on attention from. We had crazy ideas about whether sound could possibly produce some kind of effect, because harmonics does. In the US, one of the scientists has actually used harmonics to break cancer cells. What they believe is that every human body is essentially a harmonic system. If you read the resonance frequency, you can actually break the big thing, like a glass. We also started on molecular docking analysis (a computer assisted drug design in molecular biology), in April, on what kind of drugs can actually impact the virus. Our purpose was clear, we did not want to invent a drug, and only wanted to find already available agents, which can act as antivirals. There are 8,000 registered FDA drugs, and one of them could produce the impact. Using molecular docking, we brought it down to 17. We reached out to our partners ReaGene Biosciences and Hyderabad-based INDRAS, who found that the 17 we found were credible. From the 17, we came out with three using in vitro (studies done on microorganisms). We then had the idea to print 3D printed bio lungs and simulate the impact outside of the human body. Out of that one came out that was reacting well to the virus, was anti-diabetic and also prevents blood clots. All these took about a year and in March we decided to file a patent. These are all simulation studies. We need to get to the next stage where we should be trialing it, both in animal studies and humans.

We already have mRNA based vaccines such as Pfizer and Moderna and recombinant vaccines such as AstraZeneca and inoculation is gaining pace. How relevant will therapeutic drugs be for COVID-19?

Vaccines have a different impact from therapeutics. Vaccines will help create your own antibodies. For instance, mRNA vaccines will directly impact the virus, and AstraZeneca vaccines that we are using will build up your antibodies to fight the virus. But without therapeutics, it becomes very difficult to control the stem of the flow. While the vaccines have been given, it still takes time for you to develop antibodies. You are still liable to be an asymptomatic patient, sometimes when you can carry the viral load and liable to spread it across. These therapeutic drugs can actually be utilized in two cases. Number one is when vaccines are given along with these therapeutic drugs, they can augment the vaccine flow and they can also impact on the virus. And the second is, in certain cases where you can't give a vaccine, therapeutic drugs become useful.

You have applied for a patent, how long will the whole process take before you can come out with a product?

We are actually now at a stage when after three to four months, we can start the animal trials. Most animal trials take about 1.5-2 months. If it succeeds then we go into the first phase of human trials to see whether it works. Since it is not a new drug, but a repurposed one, it will take less as per my estimation. It will take us about two years.

You are saying it is going to take two or more years to market the drug. Already a large portion of people have been vaccinated in the US, Europe. In the next two years, India will get there as well. Do you see any takers for the drug?

We are not sure, number one. Number two, I am not sure about the virulence of this virus, whether it is going to last for 1-1.5 years, or it is going to last a little bit longer than that. It just keeps evading in some way or the other. You never know whether a new vaccine would come out with booster shots, whether vaccines would be, my fingers are crossed when I say that, at least most of the variants that this virus would produce would actually be taken care of even if it is at 60-70 percent. But they may not go away and may not drop out even after two years as well. That is where we are just forecasting the future at the moment. Now the other challenges are that it is not the end of the epidemics, these microbial infections. As we see more connections and more technology being utilized, you would have a lot of impact of these epidemics, even later down the line. It's not the be all and end all as what has happened has happened before, though they were all localized like SARS. So the whole idea from a technology community and the scientist has been that, can we draw a pipeline which will be faster. This (type of epidemic) may not occur after two years, but something else would. But can we look at a certain kind of a mechanism or a pipeline which gets us to these therapeutics and vaccines faster. I think that's where the effort of the community has been so that we can at least save a large number of lives from. That's the whole idea.

How will you commercialize the drug? Can you also share the revenue impact?

So, once we actually develop this, and let's say this is two years hence, the first idea is to actually take it to pharma companies, and actually develop a kind of that drug, it could be a tablet or drops, and then do joint marketing with them. Business is huge if it still works. I don't have a direct number, but we just calculated in our head. For example, if the epidemic and COVID are still there, I don't want to be there two years later, but if it's there, the revenue numbers are upwards of millions of dollars.

How much of a loss would it be for you if the drug stops being relevant?

For us it is about the whole idea. We have shown the world and also our own customers and partners, how an IT company can actually get into life sciences and go deeper. We have also gotten a lot of work from some of our partners who are already working on it. All of this is actually going to help us draw on more value in the life sciences sector. We learnt Natural Language Processing (NLP) in terms of life sciences, which is going to be a huge area. We are already helping some of our customers. We learnt about molecular docking and modeling, which can actually come up in some of those drugs that our customers and partners are doing. We have also done our actual practical approach, where we actually went out of silicone and went in vitro as well, which has given us a completely different foray into what we are already doing.

With deep knowledge in life sciences, how much of a business potential does this present to you?

We are already getting requests from our partners and customers. We are already working with them on some of these areas since they understand now that we know genomics science. It will be upwards of about $100 million or so is something that we are actually seeing. But I am the last guy that you should consider a number from.",1705,0.7542876303195953

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,494

The management has outlined its strategy (repair, rally, rise beyond) to transform the business and accelerate growth and margins.

We are assigning target multiple of 20X (earlier 17X) on Sep-23 EPS of INR of 74.7 (35 percent discount to TCS 5-year average + 2SD of 30.6X) to arrive at a TP of INR 1494 (earlier: 1237) with revenue CAGR of 13.4 percent & EPS CAGR of 18.2 percent.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1220

We expect the company to deliver double-digit growth in FY22. However, the extent is likely to be lower than its peers. We value the stock at 17x FY23E EPS.

Sharekhan | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,300

We have raised upward our earnings estimates for FY2022E/ FY2023E/FY2024E due to a strong all-round beat in Q1FY2022, healthy deal wins, and a strong deal pipeline in the communication vertical.

The company is well invested in capturing opportunities from the expansion of 5G value chain across networks and IT services from both telecom service providers and enterprises. The company’s investments and multiple small acquisitions for enhancing capabilities in newer areas have resulted in consistent deal flows in the enterprise segment.

We assume Tech Mahindra will continue to generate higher free cash flow (FCF) in the coming years, which would increase dividend/buyback payouts.

IT firm Tech Mahindra added 5,200 employees in the June quarter and will triple its fresher intake this year as it is confident about a double-digit growth trajectory in FY22.

During the earnings call on July 29, CP Gurnani, CEO & MD, said, “We will increase the fresher intake by 3X this year.” However, he did not quantify the intake. The company will also hire in focused verticals such as AI, IoT, deep tech, space tech and strengthen its leadership as it sees increased traction in the technology sector, where it counts unicorns and major tech companies as its clients.

To cater to this, the company is also looking to integrate freshers with VC and private equity firms to work better with its clients. While the hiring will be global, the majority of it will be in India. Tech Mahindra is also expecting more hiring to take place in tier 2 cities like Trivandrum, Nagpur, Bhubaneswar and Vizag.

At 17.2 percent, attrition is a concern as well. However, Gurnani said that business plans are done for 16-18 percent attrition, and it has planned for higher attrition if required. “Talent acquisition across the globe has been factored in and the strategy both across the globe, tier-2 cities and major hubs of India, we expect to have good talent to meet our business goals,” Gurnani said.

Even as 80 percent of its employees are vaccinated, the company has not legislated return to office for employees. “From 6-7 percent, we now have 20 percent of employees working from offices and that is voluntary. We have requested that those coming to office are doubly vaccinated, for theirs and safety of other employees and families,” Gurnani said.

Some of the managers and processes are meeting twice a week face to face. Clients are also not insisting on coming back to offices. “Guidance has been given that till December 2021, everything will be voluntary,” he added.

Tech Mahindra registered $1383.6 million in revenues, up 14.6 percent, for the quarter ending June 2021. The total headcount stood at 1.26 lakh for the quarter. Its net new deals stood at $815 million.",379,0.9999696016311646

Tech Mahindra share price added a percent intraday on July 29 ahead of June quarter results.

The IT firm may see its dollar revenue grow 2.4 percent QoQ at $1,362 million with 30 bps of cross-currency gains, says experts. Revenue growth is likely to be led by 1 percent contribution from acquisitions and by ramp-up of deals in the previous quarters.

The company may see its profit after tax (PAT) rise by 8 percent QoQ due to lower tax and higher other income.

In rupee terms, the company is expected to see revenue growth of 3.1 percent QoQ amid a weaker rupee at Rs 10,030 crore against Rs 9,730 crore QoQ, they said. EBIT margins are seen at 16 percent, down 50 bps QoQ with margin headwinds on the back of wage hikes.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tech Mahindra

TechM’s annual report titled “NXT.NOW – Experience the future now” outlines its strategy to enable clients experience the future of technology now. We believe TechM has rightly identified gaps and has set on path to transform itself - In ‘Repair phase’ (till FY21) it has identified strategic growth areas and is re-aligning itself to bring back growth focus. It has significantly improved its profitability too (EBIT margin of 10% in 4Q20 to 16.5% in 4Q21). In the ‘Rally phase’ (FY22) it aims to expand wallet share across clients as well as improve margins. Cost optimization and restructuring of acquired companies to turn them profitable will provide additional margin tailwinds (~50-70bps) apart from levers of pyramid optimization and automation. The third phase ‘Rise beyond’ involves building on efforts taken in previous phases and further accelerate growth momentum and margins.

Outlook

We value TechM at 17X on Sep-23 EPS (roll over) of INR 72.7 to arrive at TP of INR 1237 (earlier: 1085) with revenue & earnings CAGR of 11.9%/16.7% respectively. The company is currently trading at 18.8X/16.6X on EPS of INR 61.1/69.1 on FY22/23E respectively. Maintain ‘BUY’.

IT major Tech Mahindra said it has partnered with StaTwig, a Singapore and Hyderabad-based digital supply chain solution provider, to implement vaccine traceability platform ""VaccineLedger"" globally.

The companies aim to roll-out a blockchain-based traceability solution for global vaccine supply chain transparency, predict and prevent failures in supply chains, including problems related to expired vaccines, stock out and counterfeiting, a statement said.

VaccineLedger is an open source platform and designed to perform end-to-end traceability at vial level for vaccines in the global supply chain. It prevents the need of replacing the existing system, therefore, removing the barriers of adoption.

It can easily integrate with existing systems and show immediate results in the countries where it is deployed.

Through this partnership, Tech Mahindra and StaTwig will work towards building a global consortium of vaccine researchers, governments, pharmaceutical companies, distributors, and healthcare workers, the statement said.

StaTwig will leverage Tech Mahindra's go-to-market expertise, including access to sales and customer network, domain experience, balance sheet support, resource scale and system integration knowledge.

Further, Tech Mahindra has also invested in co-development and testing of various enterprise security modules for the mobile and web application, to support the unique requirements from manufacturers and state governments.

""Wastage of life saving drugs such as vaccines should be addressed on priority and we need to come together in order to effectively find a solution here.

""Our strategic partnership with StaTwig will enable supply chain participants with a single application to enhance traceability, and chain of custody,"" Tech Mahindra Blockchain and Cybersecurity Practice Leader - APAC and EMEA Rajesh Dhuddu said.

This will not only ensure safety and validity of vaccine supply but also helps in adherence to complex regulatory requirements, set up by Drug Administration Authority in any country, he added.

A blockchain-based application builds peer to peer bridges on current systems that support real time data sharing, authentication and validation. Vaccine manufacturers can use such data beyond track and trace to inventory management, vendor payments, IoT integration and smart contract.

""With VaccineLedger, we are aiming to re-design and re-engineer the traditional supply chain information systems to give continuous visibility and complete traceability.

""With the help of VaccineLedger, vaccine manufacturers and governments can work together to prevent counterfeiting, cold-chain failures and stock outs,” Sid Chakravarthy, Founder and CEO of StaTwig, said.

StaTwig is a UNICEF Innovation Fund Portfolio startup and the World Economic Forum Global Innovator focused on solving supply chain failures in multiple critical industries such as vaccines and food with easy to use apps that leverage its highly scalable and secure blockchain based supply chain management platform.",445,0.919262170791626

Dhyani said that Tech Mahindra's ability to computerise data and bring operating technology and IT for enterprises and deployment for 5G in organisations is driving the company's business in Europe, especially in the Nordic region. ""We are committed to hiring 250 people only in Nordics in the next 18-24 months. These additions will be in different technologies, but primarily it will be in the case of SAP and Cloud Network and 5G,"" Dhyani said.

Tech Mahindra has over 3,500 workforce in Continental Europe including Nordic Region. The company plans to hire local people in the Nordic region. It is opening a centre in Norway as well as twin centres in Mannheim, Germany.

""Subsequent to that we have expanded our operations and a centre in Gothenburg in Sweden. We have a concentration of large customers in that region,"" Dhyani said. Tech Mahindra officials said that the company is investing in localisation of service in the Nordic region and looking at each market differently.

""We have looked at country-level planning. For us, Sweden is one of the biggest from a market perspective when it comes to Nordic countries as well as an opportunity perspective,"" Dhyani said. Tech Mahindra claims to have doubled investments for business opportunities in manufacturing, banking, financial services and insurance sector, specifically to Sweden.

A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""As part of our #ResolveToRISE initiative, we are taking proactive measures and collaborating with leading hospitals to organise vaccination drives to ensure 100 percent employee vaccination.”

Notably, the company has also collaborated with hospitals to convert its Noida, Pune, Bengaluru, and Chennai campuses into COVID-19 care units with round-the-clock medical observation.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tech Mahindra

TechM reported modest revenue growth of 1.6% QoQ USD, ~70bps below our and street estimates. Growth was soft in both Communications (+1.4% QoQ USD) and Enterprise (+1.8% QoQ USD) segment. Delay in deal closures and lower-than-expected kicker from Comviva led to revenue miss. Net new deal win TCV was strong this quarter at $1.04 Bn +129% QoQ and 103% YoY. But for the full year FY21, net new TCV declined by 40% to $2.2 Bn due to weak deal wins in first three quarters. Management mentioned that deal pipeline is robust and they expect this deal win momentum to continue in 1QFY22 led by strong traction in 5G and cloud.

Outlook

Announced dividend of Rs45 per share for FY21 translating into a payout ratio of 88% on net profit and 55.4% on FCF. TM is currently trading at 15.4X/14.5X at EPS of INR 62.7/66.6 on FY22/23E respectively, inexpensive. Maintain Buy.

Top Indian IT companies reported muted earnings for the fourth quarter. Infosys, HCL Technologies, and Tech Mahindra missed the topline estimates by 0.5-1.1 percent, while TCS performed marginally better with revenue growth of 4.2 percent.

The revenue miss during the quarter is largely seen as a moderation after strong sequential growth in the last few quarters. The reasons for the drop in revenues were company-specific.

Infosys' revenue was largely affected by the increase in offshoring activities. HCL Technologies was hurt by the slow recovery in engineering and research & revelopment. As for Tech Mahindra, delayed recovery in the telecom vertical affected its Q4 earnings.

Strong deal wins, order pipeline give comfort

Several indicators suggesting that the revenue miss was just a blip and the IT industry is poised for a good run in the upcoming quarters.

Despite muted Q4 revenues, companies have seen strong net new wins and a good mix of small, medium, and large deals, increasing the total commercial value of new deals in Q4.

The overall deal pipeline has remained robust despite the strong conversion in Q4. It augurs well for revenue visibility beyond FY22. It is also reflected by the fact that Tier-1 IT companies have guided for double-digit revenue growth in FY22.

Robust hiring trends

Buoyed by the strong revenue visibility, hiring activities also picked up in Q4. It was for the second consecutive quarter that top five companies continued their hiring spree and it was at an all-time high in Q4FY21.

As per a Kotak Institutional report, Naukri JobSpeak Index for March 2021 has increased by 47 percent in the span of a couple of months for IT software/software services companies. Net additions of top five companies increased 29 percent QoQ to 46,087.

Robust hiring trend is likely to continue in FY22 as well. With strong demand for talent, wage hikes can be significantly higher in the coming quarters. It is likely to impact the margins of the company. In spite of this minor impact, record hiring indicates a low bench and strong optimism on demand. Companies ramped up the hiring of freshers while reducing the mid-management staff.

Winners and laggards

Financial services were one of the verticals resilient due to acceleration in digital transactions. It has been among the largest verticals for Tier-1 IT companies like Infosys and TCS.

The retail channel has recovered after being heavily impacted by COVID-19, while other verticals such as manufacturing and oil & gas continue to remain impacted. Growth momentum in financial services and retail is expected to sustain in the near term.

The communication vertical has been a laggard compared to other verticals. The year-on-year growth in Q4 is the lowest among all verticals for Infosys and TCS. It was second-lowest in the case of HCL Technologies. The industry is banking on the pick-up in digital transformation spending and 5G-related IT spends for sustained recovery.

Closing comments

The Tier-1 IT companies have guided for double-digit revenue growth in FY22 but it doesn't capture the full business strength as per a Kotak Institutional report. It foresees Infosys and TCS delivering 16.1 percent and 15.1 percent organic constant-currency growth in FY22, respectively. Wipro and HCL are likely to follow with 11.2 percent and 9.9 percent growth. The report estimates a 9.9 percent growth for Tech Mahindra in FY22.

IT services firm Tech Mahindra saw its headcount decline by 4,182 even as it looks at double-digit organic growth this fiscal. According to the firm, it will accelerate its hiring in the next few quarters with strong deal pipeline in place for FY22.

Speaking to media on April 26 during earnings announcement, CP Gurnani, CEO & MD, said, “We are not giving any firm guidance but we are looking at double-digit organic growth. To sustain the double-digit organic growth you also need to have a right level of hiring.”

“We are the net hirer for the next two quarters and will be adding 8-10 percent people over the next two quarters,” Gurnani added.

The company will also have a huge focus on skilling, future skills readiness, and hiring to make sure that the company has right supply chain and right balance between growth and utilisation, the CEO said.

Drop in headcount

As the company shifted its focus on Nxt.Now strategy, which aims to leverage the growing demand for new age services such as AI, blockchain, cybersecurity and 5G, it saw its headcount drop.

The headcount dropped to 1.21 lakh in FY21 from 1.25 lakh from a year ago period. However, this is likely to increase in the coming months. “The deal wins which we spoke about and robust pipeline across will mean that you will see acceleration in hiring over the next few quarters to reflect the deal wins and deal ramp ups,” said Vivek Agarwal, President – BFSI, HLS and Corporate Development.

According to Gurnani, this momentum is expected to last in FY22 as well.

The company reported $1.04 billion in net new deals for the quarter ending March 31, 2021 and $2.21 billion in new deal wins for the year.

IT services company Tech Mahindra is expected to report 2-3 percent sequential growth in dollar revenue and 1.5-2 percent QoQ growth in constant currency for the quarter ended March 2021 due to the weak new deal signings in the past nine months.

Tech Mahindra Ltd, a leading Indian multinational technological company, announced on March 19 that it would be covering the COVID-19 vaccination cost for all its employees across the world.

Headquartered in India's Pune, the company has its workforce spread across 90 countries. Currently, over 121,900 professionals work for the company globally.

All the employees in India have been urged by Tech Mahindra to register themselves for vaccination - if they are eligible - through the CoWIN or Aarogya Setu application.

""We will reimburse the vaccine cost for all our associates globally. This is to reiterate our belief in ‘wellness before business’, and underscore our commitment towards our employees’ health and safety,"" Tech Mahindra's Global Chief People Officer Harshvendra Soin said.

""Tech Mahindra has also launched ‘Mhealthy’, a comprehensive COVID-19 risk screening test to test the presence of anti-bodies along with all the vital health stats for COVID-19 co-morbidities,"" an official release stated.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

By generating real-time reports, the solution ensures that every individual stepping into the Tech Mahindra premises is healthy, making it a safe place to work, it added.

""Committed towards the fight against COVID-19, Tech Mahindra has institutionalized an integrated approach to not only enable a safe working environment for its associates, but to also enable customers to grow their businesses in a safe, secure, and sustainable way,"" the statement further said.

In India, the vaccination programme was launched on January 16. Only healthcare and other frontline workers were eligible to receive the shots in the initial phase.

In the second phase of immunisation drive, which started from March 1, citizens aged above 60 and 45-plus with comorbidities were permitted to take the vaccine doses.",576,0.8766638934612274

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

We assume Tech M would report revenue growth of 2.3% q-o-q in Q4 despite softness in the aero sub-segment, led by strong growth in BFSI; EBIT margin is likely to remain stable given cost-efficiency measures and higher offshoring. With the Telefonica deal ($300 mn-$400 mn), we expect the company’s total deal TCVs to be around 1.5x-2x higher in Q4 compared to its average quarterly deal TCVs of $400 million-500 million. Given strong deal wins in telecom, healthy deal pipeline in the enterprise segment, and strong demand across digital stack, the company is expected report strong revenue growth in FY2022E with margin improvement.

Outlook

We maintain Buy on Tech Mahindra (Tech M) with a revised PT of Rs. 1,150, given it is trading at an attractive valuation.

The ransomware attack on Pune’s smart city project last month that affected 25 servers and got IT firm Tech Mahindra in a soup, will not have an adverse financial impact and the affected servers are recoverable, said a top executive.

Sujit Baksi, Head, APAC Business and President, Corporate Affairs, Tech Mahindra, said in a statement to Moneycontrol, “Our team is monitoring the situation on a regular basis and has also continued the work on rebuilding the environment without touching the infected servers. The servers, which were impacted are recoverable and there are no commercial repercussions.”

However, the incident has put the spotlight on inadequate cybersecurity policy and lack of skilled manpower in the government sector. This ransomware attack is the latest in a long line of security breaches in the government sector.

What happened?

In December 2019, Tech Mahindra won the Rs 500 crore smart city project from the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). As part of this project, the company was expected to provide smart and sustainable infrastructure, integrated command and control centre and real-time monitoring.

According to an Indian Express report, close to Rs 15 crore was spent on firewall to secure the system.

On February 26, 2021, close to 25 servers of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Smart City Project were affected because of a ransomware attack. On March 9, the company filed a FIR, putting the estimated loss due to the attack at Rs five crore.

It is still not clear what caused the breach. However, cybersecurity experts threw some light on the possible modus operandi used.

Prasad T, Chief Information Security Officer, InstaSafe, an information security firm, said that the attack could have been carried out in a couple of ways.

For one, it could be a phishing attack, the most common thread used by hackers. Employees could have opened an email containing malware to launch a ransomware attack, which in turn encrypted the files.

The other mode of attack is through an IP address that is vulnerable. Hackers could have used it to enter the system to encrypt the important files and demanded ransom.

Experts said that since the project was an ongoing one, the end point security solutions were probably bypassed, leading to the attack.

Tech Mahindra did not respond to Moneycontrol’s pointed queries on how the attack was carried out. But, Tech Mahindra’s Baksi, said, “After detailed analysis of the situation in the last 10 days, we have come to the conclusion that 25 servers are impacted, which need to be rebuilt along with implementation of a robust security system.”

“Though the FIR mentions damage of about Rs five crore, which is not for any material cost or data, the only loss would be the rework efforts,” he added.

Need of the hour

This is not the first time that a government infrastructure has been attacked. According to a report by the US-based firm Recorded Future, 10 power assets, including state-run NTPC and Power Sector Operation Corporation Ltd (POSOCO), two ports, oil and gas assets and the Indian Railways were also exposed to cyber-attacks by Chinese group Red Echo.

Experts say that intervention from the government in the form of cybersecurity policy and deployment of skilled manpower in the government offices are the need of the hour.

According to Prasad, currently India does not have a stringent policy that mandates processes that vendors need to adhere to, and security validations required for systems that are exposed to the internet.

Karmesh Gupta, co-founder & CEO, WiJungle, a cybersecurity firm that helps government agencies and companies manage their security networks, said that when it comes to government, skilled manpower is a big issue.

Gupta explained that in close to 40 percent of government organisations that the company has dealt with, cybersecurity is given as additional charge instead of assigning someone who is trained and understands the system. According to him, this needs to change.

He also added that budgets for security need to be increased, especially for critical infrastructure like banks, and power infrastructure.",677,-0.9529058039188385

Dolat Capital Market's research report on Tech Mahindra

TECHM reported CC growth of 2.8% QoQ (DE: 2.0%) led by strong growth in Comm./Retail/Manuf. Verticals (4.5%/8.9%/4.5% QoQ). EBIT margin further improved by 170bps to 15.9% (DE: 14.5%) led by higher utilization of 87% and lower sub-contracting cost (down 1.8% QoQ). Net New TCV signs stood at $455mn (up 8% QoQ) including one 5G network related deal of $50mn+ value. The TTM TCV remains weak at $1.6Bn (down 53.8%) due to limited large deals signings in YTDFY21. EBIT Margin of 15.9% is stretched and unsustainable as headcount will increase due to peak utilization level (87%), impending wage hikes and incentives due since Q1. Expect FY22 OPM to be 14.0% as staggered hikes start from Q4FY21 and business spends gradually return.

Outlook

Factoring in improved Q3 performance and confident outlook, we increase our earnings estimates by 9.7/4.1% in FY22E/FY23E and maintain Accumulate rating with TP of Rs1020 valued at 18x FY23E EPS.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

TECHM’s 3QFY21 USD revenue growth of 2.8% QoQ CC came in ahead of our expectation as it continued to benefit from strong demand in its BPO business (+11% QoQ), which accounted for half of incremental growth in the second consequent quarter. Performance in the Communications vertical improved with 3.6% QoQ CC growth, while Enterprise was up 2.6%. n New deal wins rose marginally to USD455m, although TECHM continued to see a record high deal pipeline, including in 5G Network services. n We were surprised by the 170bp QoQ EBIT margin expansion in 3Q as it was on top of ~400bp increase in 2QFY21. TECHM achieved it through stretching its utilization (+200bp) to a record high of 87% along with a ~2% reduction in employees. As the business is running at elevated operational levers (utilization, employee expenses, etc.), we expect some normalization in EBITDA margin from 4QFY21. We upgrade our FY21E/FY22E/FY23E EPS estimate by 11%/7%/10% as we consider strong margin beat during 3QFY21 and factor it in for our FY22E/FY23E margins. Our TP implies 16x FY23E EPS. Remain Neutral.

Outlook

We value the stock at 16x FY23E EPS, a 40% discount to our target P/E for TCS. Remain Neutral.

IT services company Tech Mahindra will hire freshers, engineering and MBA graduates, and also laterals for new-age skills in the coming months, said CP Gurnani, Chief Executive Officer, Tech Mahindra.

However, the company net headcount declined by 2,357 in the quarter ending December 2020, a significant portion of them in business process outsourcing (BPO).

Speaking to media persons while announcing the results for the third quarter, Gurnani, said: “In BPO processes, work from home has not necessarily been adopted in every part. So there are some processes which we shifted to automation. And hence there is a drop in the headcount.”

The company’s net headcount stood at 121,901 in Q3FY21, down from 124,258 in the previous quarter. BPO accounted for a net headcount decline of 1,630.

Apart from decline in BPO workforce, the net hiring was less given the low attrition rate. Attrition stood at 12 percent for Q3FY21. “As you would see attrition is relatively low. It is a healthy sign that processes came down and we did not have to rehire people,” Gurnani explained.

However, as the company’s Nxt.Now strategy picks pace, Tech Mahindra has robust hiring plan in place. ""The technology modernisation cycle continues to gather pace and our positioning of creating experiences through Nxt.Now has seen us gain significant traction in the market place,"" he added.

The company has identified 190 skills that the company would need for the strategy. “On those 190 skills first task is to hire people and second is to bring experts from outside. Thirdly, we are likely to hire a lot of fresh engineering graduates.”

The company also plans to hire few hundred MBA graduates, those with consumer expertise and also people for leadership positions in cloud and AI. In addition to hiring, there is strong focus on talent and skill development.

Tech Mahindra posted a revenue of $1,309 million in Q3 FY21, down 3.4 percent compared to last year. The company signed net new deal wins of $455 million in the quarter.

Tech Mahindra, the country's fifth-largest IT company by market capitalisation, on January 29 reported better-than-expected earnings for the December quarter, with profit rising 23 percent sequentially to Rs 1,309.8 crore led by operating income.

Revenue from operations in Q3FY21 grew by 2.9 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 9,647.1 crore and dollar revenue at $1,308.7 million increased by 3.4 percent compared to the previous quarter.

""Our focus on operational excellence has again yielded results as we structurally change our delivery model.

IT player Tech Mahindra is expected to report subdued December quarter earnings on January 29.

Along with the numbers, the management's commentary on deal wins and outlook on communications and enterprise segments will be closely watched.

As per the estimates of brokerage firm Elara Capital, the company may report a 1.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in December quarter revenue.

""Revenue growth would be equally led by enterprise and communications vertical. Recovery in the communications business would be led by BPO services. Tenzing acquisition could add marginally to overall revenue,"" Elara said.

It expects Tech Mahindra's CC revenue to increase by 1.4 percent. Margins are expected to be stable led by cost optimisation initiatives, Elara said as it sees Tech Mahindra's Q3 profit rising 6.9 QoQ but falling 0.6 percent YoY.

Brokerage firm Nirmal Bang expects the company's margins to improve further in Q3FY21 as the salary hike is expected only in Q4FY21 for junior employees.

Nirmal Bang said the trajectory of improvement in margins in the portfolio companies is a key monitorable. Receivables situation and commentary on 5G will also be areas of focus for investors.

The brokerage expects a 1.2 percent YoY fall in revenue, while PAT may rise 12.4 percent YoY.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a modest growth of 2 percent in CC revenue on a sequential basis, split equally between telecom and enterprise segments.

It expects EBIT margin of 14.5 percent, a QoQ increase of 30 bps and a YoY increase of 226 bps. Strong YoY growth in EBIT of 17.5 percent will not translate into net profit due to lower forex gains and higher tax rates, it said.

The estimates of Kotak show a 0.8 percent YoY decline in net sales and a 2.1 percent YoY decline in Tech Mahindra's reported PAT for the December quarter.

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

We assume Tech M would report revenue growth of 1.9% q-o-q in Q3 despite furloughs, led by strong growth in BFSI, retail and technology verticals, recovery in engineering division and strong Comviva seasonality. We believe total deal TCVs would remain in the range of its average quarterly deal TCVs of $400 million-$500 million in Q3FY2021; small sized deal pipelines are converting faster compared to large deal pipelines. Tech M is well placed to capture the opportunity arising from 5G adoption by telecom and enterprise clients; expect to deliver improved revenue growth (at high-single digit) in FY2022, at 15% EBIT margin.

Outlook

We maintain Buy on Tech Mahindra (TechM) with a revised PT of Rs. 1,110, given it is trading at an attractive valuation.

Bucking the trend of strong buying across sectors, shares of Tech Mahindra fell over a percent in intraday trade on BSE on December 16 and traded among few losers in the Sensex index.

Apart from the occasional fall, the stock has been among the top performers in the IT pack.

As of December 15 close, the stock has gained almost 22 percent in the calendar year 2020 so far against a 12 percent rise in the benchmark Sensex.

Most brokerages are positive about the prospects of the company in the medium to long term.

Kotak Institutional Equities, in a report on December 16, said Tech Mahindra has indicated that growth in engineering services business was impacted over the past few years due to factors such as muted demand in the automotive, slowdown of projects in aerospace and delay in 5G rollout.

However, there are several growth opportunities in the next three years, said the brokerage firm.

""The shift towards electric vehicles, connected and autonomous cars provide new opportunities in automotive. Health and medical devices are other verticals with strong growth opportunities. The company noted that except aerospace most other verticals are recovering well in the aftermath of COVID impact,"" Kotak said.

Kotak has a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,020.

Global brokerage firm CLSA has maintained a 'buy' call on the stock and raised the target price to Rs 1,030 from Rs 981 per share.

The company had introduced its playbook for addressing the 5G opportunity. It indicated that the market could be close to opening up, CNBC-TV18 reported the research firm as saying.

CLSA sees single-digit revenue growth in communications vertical in FY22 ex-5G. The company planned to improve its EBIT margin to 15 percent by FY22 and the reiteration of its intent to increase its capital return was also a positive. The 5G market opportunity appeared closer to realisation, the research firm added.

Tech Mahindra on October 23 reported a profit of Rs 1,064.6 crore in the quarter ended September 2020, registering a 9.5 percent growth compared to the June quarter.

The profitability was supported by strong operating growth, but the 71.8 percent sequential fall in other income to Rs 117.5 crore restricted growth.

Revenue from operations during the quarter increased 2.9 percent to Rs 9,371.8 crore from Rs 9,106.3 crore in the previous quarter.

The stock traded at Rs 920.65, down 0.69 percent at 1130 hours.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

TechM's revenue growth of 2.9% QoQ CC was ahead of our expectations (1.5% QoQ). Growth was driven by the Enterprise business (4.3% QoQ) while Communications remained largely flat (0.8% QoQ) given the overhang in Network services. BPO (31.3% QoQ), which accounts for ~10% of the business drove more than half of the growth. Margin expansion of 410bp sequentially was a surprise. This was led by improvement in both supply/demand and operational efficiencies coming into play. New deal wins of USD421m were up sequentially. But, they were impacted by delay in few large deals and remained below average TCV in FY20 (USD900m+).

Outlook

We expect TechM to deliver single-digit growth in FY22 (unlike double-digit growth from its peers), which would lead to a lower P/E multiple. Hence, we value the stock at 20x FY22E EPS, at 25% discount to our target P/E for TCS. Remain Neutral.

ICICI Direct's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra’s (TechM) revenues increased 2.9% QoQ in constant currency terms (above our estimate of 1.1% QoQ in CC terms) mainly led by 0.8% QoQ growth in communication revenues and 4.3% QoQ growth in enterprise revenues. The company also reported a healthy expansion in EBITDA margins (up 397 bps QoQ to 18.2%) mainly led by higher utilisation, offshoring and rationalisation of SG&A expenses. The order book improved 45.2% QoQ to US$421 million.



Outlook

The company is well poised to capture improving IT spend in communication and digital traction on the enterprise side. Further, in the long term, we believe TechM will be a key beneficiary of 5G opportunities. This, coupled with improving margin trajectory led by cost rationalisation prompt us to revise EPS estimates upwards. Hence, we maintain BUY with a revised target price of Rs 1040 (15x PE on FY23E EPS).

TechM reported strong revenue growth of 2.9% QoQ CC (Ple:1.9%, Cons:2.0%) & $ revenue growth of 4.8% (Ple:3.1%, cons: 4%) at US$1265.4mn. BPO saw strong growth rebound of 31.1%(contributing to 53% of incremental revs) & IT services growth was modest at 2.4% in $ terms. EBIT margins surprised us positively at 14.2% (Ple:12%, Cons: 11.3%)& tailwinds are i) +160bps each from supply side and demand side recovery, ii) +160 bps from cost optimization due to improve offshoring, higher utilization and lower subcontractions and iii) +70bps aided by normalization due to seasonality. Management guided that margins can remain stable & can improve further. We continue to believe that 5G opportunity will start from 2HFY22 & TechM will witness strong acceleration of revenue growth.

HDFC Securities' research report on Tech Mahindra

We maintain our BUY rating on Tech Mahindra, based on better-thanexpected growth and improving margin profile. USD revenue was up 2.9% QoQ CC vs. TCS/INFY/WIPRO/HCLT performance of +4.8/+4.0/+2.0/+4.5% QoQ CC respectively. Telecom was up 3.2% QoQ (in line with our estimate), but Enterprise (+6.0% QoQ) performed better than expected. Growth was led by Technology & Media (+14.1% QoQ), BFSI and Retail bounced back strongly, while manufacturing was stable. BPM recovered strongly (+31.1% QoQ) due to market share gains and reversal in supply-side factors. Net-new TCV improved to USD 421mn, and the pipeline continues to remain strong. The 5G related spend has shifted to FY22E, but TechM is well-poised to benefit from this spend. Telecom recovery will be gradual (led by 5G), but Enterprise will drive growth, supported by a revival in Manufacturing and Retail verticals. Margin expansion of +413bps QoQ was better than expected (14.2% vs. the estimate of 11.3%), led by offshoring, higher utilisation, lower sub-con and visa fees.

Outlook

TechM aims to expand the margin to 15%, but it will still have the lowest margin in Tier-1 IT. We increase our EPS estimate by 7.1/8.1% for FY22/23E to factor in better growth and margin. Our target price stands at Rs 940, based on 16x (~15% premium to 5Y average) Sep-22E EPS. The stock currently trades at a P/E of 17.0/15.2x FY21/22E.

Tech Mahindra will roll out salary hikes in a phased manner in 2021 starting with its junior-most employees.

CP Gurnani, CEO, Tech Mahindra, said in an earnings call on October 23, “We are looking at early 2021 for appraisal and salary hikes. But the management team has not really sat down to decide the quantum of hikes.”

“But it is very clear that it will be rolled out and it will be staggered,” he said.

The way it is going to work out, Gurnani explained, is that the junior-most employees will get the salary hike the fastest and the senior-most employees will get it later. “But it is part of my budget and part of my planning to do salary hikes for junior-most employees in FY21 (before March 2021) and for the rest in calendar year 2021 (before December 2021),"" he added.

This is in line with what its larger peers have done. All of its peers -- TCS, Wipro, Infosys and HCL Tech -- have announced salary hike for employees, some rolling them out effective October 1 and others effective January 2021.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

IT player Tech Mahindra will announce its September quarter earnings on October 23 wherein, apart from the numbers, progress on deal ramp-ups and outlook on telecom vertical will also be in the focus.

The company is expected to post a fall in EBITDA margin and profit after tax (PAT) on a yearly basis.

As per the estimates of brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Tech Mahindra's revenue may inch up by 1.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) but PAT may fall 21.8 percent YoY.

While EBITDA margin may improve quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), on a yearly basis, it may be down.

""Q2 FY21 EBITDA margin may come at 15.5 percent, up from 14.3 percent in Q1 FY21 but down from 16.5 percent in Q2 FY20,"" Motilal Oswal said.

On similar lines, Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 2 percent YoY rise in Tech Mahindra's revenue but adjusted PAT may see a 14.6 percent YoY fall. EBITDA margin may slip 45 bps YoY.

""We forecast constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 1.8 percent QoQ. Revenue growth will be led by—(1) sharp growth in BPO business led by easing of supply-side constraints, (2) stabilisation in manufacturing

and growth in financial services and healthcare, (3) BPO-led growth in communications practice,"" Kotak said.

Kotak expects net-new TCV to range from $400-500 million. The normalisation of deal wins is largely on the back of decisions on mid-sized deals, Kotak said.

As per the brokerage, capital allocation policy will be an area of focus along with measures taken by the company to improve operating margins and sustainable operating band.

Centrum Institutional Research expects Tech Mahindra to deliver constant currency revenue growth of 1.6 percent QoQ.

""Cross-currency would be tailwind of 140bps for the quarter. Hence, reported USD revenues would grow by 3 percent QoQ. We expect EBIT margins for Q2 FY21 at 11.4 percent, up 135bps QoQ,"" Centrum said.

While Tech Mahindra has shown strong margin performance in Q1 FY21, Centrum believes the company may show this continued margin expansion in Q2 FY21 as well.

ICICI Direct's research report on Tech Mahindra

Strategy

Buy Tech Mahindra in the range of Rs 830.00–850.00 for target price of Rs 950.00 with a stop loss of Rs 780.00. Time Frame: Six months.

Technical View

The IT sector remain in secular up trend since bottoming out in March 2020. As the major IT companies as trading at their all-time highs and are forming higher peak and higher trough in all time frame. The share price of Tech Mahindra is currently placed at the previous multiple high since February 2019 around Rs 840-850 levels. We expect the stock to resolve above the same and extend the current up move. Our expectation of resolving above the major hurdle of Rs 840-850 is based on the following key observations:

a) the entire consolidation of the last eight months has taken the shape of a bullish rounding formation signalling a reversal of the corrective trend and resumption of fresh up move.

b) it has witnessed a faster retracement as it has completely retraced its previous four quarter decline (Rs 846-471) in just two quarters.

c) the last quarter up move is backed by strong volume of highest since CY 2009 highlighting larger participation.

Hence, we expect the stock to continue with its positive momentum and head towards Rs 950 levels in the coming months as it is the 123.6% external retracement of the entire CY’20 decline (Rs 846-471).

Fundamental View

Tech Mahindra is an IT service company catering to various segments like communication (~40%), manufacturing (~17%), technology, media & entertainment (~9%), Banking Financial, Services & insurance (~16%), retail transport & logistics (~7.3%) and others (11.2%). Geographically, the company generates ~49% revenues from Americas, 26% from Europe and 25% from rest of the world. The company is aiming to improve revenues and reaching industry leading growth by focusing on cross sell opportunities. The company is also increasing its. resource allocation to high growth geographies and reducing its focus on emerging & low growth geographies. Apart from improving revenues, the company is also rationalising cost to improve margins. The company aims to improve margins by improving margins of portfolio companies, lowering of discretionary spend, lower facility cost, lower travel cost, increased automation in some of the service lines, higher offshoring and benefits of large deal won in previous quarter. We believe ramp up of large deal won in previous quarters and improvement in deal wins in coming quarters will drive revenues. Further, in the long term, we believe its leadership in communication vertical will make it a key beneficiary of vendor consolidation in the segment. It would also benefit from 5G opportunities. Enterprise segment will also benefit from improved digital traction, success in large deals. Hence, we remain positive on the stock.

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

Revenue growth in Q2 would be driven by strong recovery in BPO business, stability around network services revenue and growth in BFSI, healthcare, and technology verticals. We expect margin improvement going ahead, led by higher offshoring, reduction in subcontractor expenses, improvement in margin profile of two large deals, and better profitability of acquired entities. Tech M is well placed to benefit from the expansion of 5G value chain across networks and IT services, when there is pick up in investments by CSPs and higher 5G adoption by enterprise would happen.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating on Tech Mahindra (TechM) with a revised PT of Rs. 910, given it is trading at a sharp discount to its large peers.

After pharma, technology sector has been the second biggest gainer this year so far. The reasons for this outperformance have been many, including increase in digitalisation due to COVID-19, strong deal pipeline, least impact on operations by lockdowns worldwide, lower travel cost due to work from home culture, freeze in hiring and lower discretionary spend.

The Nifty IT index has jumped 27 percent year-to-date and 77 percent from March 23's low. Meanwhile pharma index is up 46 percent and 82 percent in same periods, respectively.

""IT companies are witnessing healthy deal wins & deal pipeline led by vendor consolidation opportunities, acquisition of captives, and offshoring & automation. This gives visibility of revenues over coming quarters. Further, IT companies have also rationalised cost by reducing travel cost, no wage hike, hiring freeze, pyramid rationalisation and lower discretionary spend which is expected to keep profitability healthy,"" Pankaj Pandey, Head – Research at ICICI Direct told Moneycontrol.

As a result, he expects IT to be a star performer in the current times.

Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services also feels IT will stand-out tall this year as one of the few sectors as far as Q2 earnings are concerned.

""While rest of the sectors posted 20-30 percent earnings decline in Q1, IT looked relatively resilient with 5-10 percent earnings growth. The momentum will continue in Q2 as well especially after good guidance given by few large and midcap companies,"" he explained in its report High Conviction Basket - IT.

He expects series of earnings upgrade this quarter (Q2) ranging between 5 and 10 percent for large-cap IT names.

Both commonly bet on five recommendations, which are Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, Mindtree and Coforge.

Pankaj Pandey is also betting on Birlasoft and Sonata Software, while Siddhartha Khemka's other picks are TCS and L&T Infotech.

Khemka feels these stocks ideas from the IT space are expected to do well in the short to medium term.

From a longer-term perspective, for IT segment, Pankaj Pandey feels one of the structural changes that is witnessed amid COVID-19 times is virtualisation of business.

""This coupled with new age technologies like cyber security (to protect business from work from home scenario), app development (to help customers transact virtually) and Cloud (to bring entire business online) are gaining prominence in making the business model virtual,"" he said.

He believes most of the companies have been at a very nascent stage in making its entire business model online. He expects technology to become an integral part of a company's spending and key to revenue growth. Hence, he expects increased allocation towards technology making IT a structural story in the long run.

Motilal Oswal explains reason behind these stock ideas:

Infosys: Infosys delivered strong beat on both revenue and margin front in its Q1FY21 earnings. Deal wins and the deal pipeline both remains healthy. The brokerage expects further expansion in margins as investments stabilize and back-ended productivity benefits kick in.

Tech Mahindra: Ramp-up in recently won mega deals was largely on track, a key positive. Motilal Oswal upgraded EPS estimates over FY21–22 by 17 percent as it revisited growth and margin trajectory in light of the surprise in Q1FY21 and optimistic commentary. The brokerage believes the sector re-rating is likely to sustain given the phenomenal resilience and adaptability demonstrated during the quarter.

Wipro: The brokerage believes Wipro is a good re-rating candidate due to the (a) upside of a turnaround under the new CEO, (b) possibility of an impending buy back, and (c) relatively attractive valuations (versus TCS and Infosys, 13x 1-year forward P/E) and (d) possibility of large capital return. Despite the COVID-19 impact, margin resilience/cash generation was impressive this quarter.

Mindtree: The strategy change to increase focus on annuity revenue and tail account rationalisation is already reflecting in the revenue and client mix. The share of revenue from fixed-price contracts showed a meaningful increase in Q1FY21. (1) Continued robust outlook for the top account, (2) decent deal signings, and (3) strong margin execution are key positives.

Coforge: Coforge delivers services around the world directly and through its network of subsidiaries and overseas branches. The Company is rendering IT solutions and is engaged in Application Development and Maintenance, Cloud Computing and BPO services to organizations in a number of sectors. The company has excellent return ratios of RoE-21 percent and RoCE-27 percent and has a very good growth potential going forward.

Technology stocks have seen a sharp run up not only since March lows, but also in last three months. In fact the sectoral index has outperformed Nifty50. All the credit goes to digitisation happening at a fast pace, expected growth in the coming years, and healthy balance sheet.

The Nifty IT index shot up 29 percent in last three months against 21 percent upside seen in Nifty50, while from March 23's closing (low) point, the former surged 62 percent and the latter gained 53 percent, backed largely by FII money and hope of strong economic recovery in next calendar year.

Experts remained positive on the sector as a whole given the expected growth in coming years, but in the short term, they see limited room for upside in stock prices especially after stellar run seen since lockdown.

""During last three-month period most institutions increased their weightage in the sector by around 180bps on average basis in last three months. Weightage on IT stocks is now just below 150bps compared with BSE500 (12 percent) as against Underweight of about around 300bps as of May 31,"" Dolat Capital said.

""However, with IT Index now at 20 percent higher than pre-COVID levels despite average earnings compression of about 7 percent (for FY22) for our coverage universe implies expansion in earnings multiple by around 35 percent during this period. This re-rating has taken the valuations of stocks closer/higher than its +2SD of its 3-year Median PER,"" it added.

Hence, at these valuations, the brokerage sees limited room for further material upsides. Rather, it believes that the elevated valuations make them vulnerable to the potential risks of second order impact on the earnings and thus would prefer to wait for better entry points in these names.

At this point, Dolat Capital just sees a few names that have some more room for re-rating led by improved financial performance (across growth/OPM/FCF/Pay-out yield basis) expectations over next FY20-22E such as HCL Technologies (improving free cash flow-FCF to drive re rating – target Rs 795), Oracle Financial Services Software (acceleration in demand in Post COVID environment – DCF based target Rs 4,000) and Firstsource Solutions (US Mortgage revival led growth opportunities – target Rs 85).

HDFC Securities' top picks are Infosys (Buy, Target Rs 1,075), HCL Technologies (Buy, Target Rs 770), L&T Infotech (Add, Target Rs 2,750), Mphasis (Buy, Target Rs 1,450) and Sonata Software (Buy, Target Rs 370).

""Despite the recent re-rating in the sector (one-year fwd reached +2SD), reverse DCF based on current price implies: (1) TCS/Infosys growth at 6.9/6.7 percent over FY23-30 and HCL Technologies/Wipro/Tech Mahindra growth at a modest 5.1/4.4/5.8 percent and (2) Mphasis appears most attractive with implied growth of -0.6 percent over FY23-30,"" said the brokerage.

""Persistent Systems and Tata Elxsi are candidates for a higher payout, based on the disconnect between current efficiencies and high cash. Upgrades include TCS (Add), Persistent Systems (Add) and Cyient (Add),"" it added.

HDFC Securities maintained its positive outlook on IT sector despite the sector recently re-rating to +2-standard deviations (SD) valuations, as the centre of gravity is expanding beyond just the tier-1s, as mid-tiers are showing symmetry in balance sheet metrics (and reverting to growth premium).

The brokerage believes that the sector is poised for higher multiples, led by (1) the longevity of high-growth period (current valuations imply around 5 percent 10-year CAGR) with 'multi-year’ growth tailwind from the economic crisis, (2) the continuity of high (increasing) payouts, and (3) global ‘best in class metrics’ across growth, free cash generation, and balance sheet strength.

As per HDFC Securities' assessment of management discussion and analysis (MD&A), (1) the demand is expected to increase for services around digital channels, collaboration and workplace transformation; (2) pipeline is expanding in areas of cloud, workplace transformation, cost efficiency and automation; (3) companies have adopted remote management of upstream processes such as solutioning, requirements workshop and service transitions are done virtually without impact on productivity, leading to on track contractual commitments and go-live dates.

Sharekhan's research report on Tech Mahindra

Our positive stance underpins company’s comprehensive capabilities in telecom space, improving capabilities in enterprise business and a better-go-to market strategy. Tech M has successfully transformed itself from a telecom-centric player to one with a wide portfolio of differentiated offerings in the enterprise segment. Key levers for margin improvements are (1) reduction in subcontracting expenses, (2) higher offshore mix, (3) better profitability of acquired entities and (4) exit from non-profitable operations.

Outlook

Initiate coverage on Tech Mahindra (Tech M) with Buy rating and price target of Rs. 850, given potential 5G opportunity and anticipated rise in margins.

HDFC Securities' research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra posted better-than-expected revenue and margin along with strong free cash generation. Revenue was down 6.3% QoQ CC vs. TCS/INFY/WIPRO/HCLT performance of -6.9/-2.0/-7.5/-7.2% QoQ CC respectively. Telecom was down 8.2% QoQ CC (in line with our estimate) but Enterprise (-5.1% QoQ CC) performed better than expected. Growth was led by Technology & Media (+13.1% QoQ), while all other verticals were under pressure. BPS was down 12.6% QoQ due to both demand and supply-side factors, and recovery is expected from 2H. Net new TCV wins were down 39% YoY to USD 290mn, but the pipeline remains strong. TechM will be a beneficiary of vendor consolidation in the Telecom segment because of its leadership position. The 5G related spend has shifted to early FY22, but TechM is well-poised to benefit from this spend. Margin performance was better than expected (10.1% vs. the estimate of 8.7%), led by lower travel cost, offshoring, and lower SG&A offset by higher sub-con cost.

Outlook

The margin recovery will be gradual, and 4Q exit will be similar to the 1QFY20 level. We increase the EPS estimate by 7.7/5.0% for FY21/22E to factor in better growth and margin. Our target price stands at Rs 720, based on 14x (in line with 5Y average) June-22E EPS. Maintain BUY.

Dolat Capital's research report on Tech Mahindra

Revenue inline with 6.3% QoQ decline led by persistent challenges in Telecom vertical (down 8.2% in CC terms). Tight cost measures and Fx tailwinds drove OPM beat with QoQ gains of 10bps at 10.1% (DE 9.2%). PAT beat was led by one-time gains of US$60mn. TCV signings were soft at US$290mn but still the management commentary remains hopeful of recovery hereon given record funnel across vertical and better deal-closure expectancy in Q2. Believes worst-is-behind and expect improved performance in Telecom (Pipeline at multi-year high) as well as Enterprise segment (US pipeline quite healthy across HiTech, BFSI and Healthcare).



Outlook

Modest growth in Q1, Weak TCV signing, sustained delays in 5G roll-outs suggest no material uptick expected in Q2 and thus we broadly maintain our estimates and retain our Accumulate rating on the stock with TP of Rs720 (valued at 15x FY22E earnings – inline with 3ry Median PER).

TechM's resilience in revenue (-5% QoQ, CC), especially in Enterprise, is encouraging given the current context. Decline in Communications (8.2% QoQ) was on expected lines given the overhang in Network Services. The margin surprise was led by better-than-expected control on SG&A costs. Understandably, net new deal wins (USD290m) were weaker than the usual run-rate. Despite the elongated decision-making cycles, the company hinted at improving deal pipeline. Revenue and margins are expected to improve from hereon. Relatively higher client concentration and the resultant impact on pricing and working capital were key concerns initially. However, management commentary suggests these are not insurmountable. Ramp-up in recently won mega deals was largely on track, a key positive. -



Outlook

We upgrade our EPS estimates over FY21-22E by 17% as we revisit our growth and margin trajectory in light of the surprise in 1QFY21 and optimistic commentary. Remain NEUTRAL.

TM posted with -6.3% revenue (Ple: -6.6%, Cons: -8.3%) CC decline with core business (telecom) declined by -8.2% QoQ & Enterprise revenue declined by -5.1% QoQ. Tech M surprised on margin front beating our/cons estimates by 100bps to 10.1% & management also mentioned EBIT margins will improve from hereon. PAT came at INR9.72bn which is 22% higher than our estimates/cons led by margin beat & higher other income. TCV was weak on expected lines (USD290mn in 1QFY21 vs USD475mn in Q1FY20) management cited weak macro environment impacted wins but guided improvement from Q2FY21 onwards. Tech M cited that 5G related demand will be pushed over to next year owing to ongoing trade war & geo political issues. Management mentioned worst is behind & expect improvement from hereon from revenue, margin front & TCV. This will provide tailwind to valuations. Management mentioned 1/4th of rev decline is due to supply side challenges & rest due to demand side challenges. We expect Enterprise business to led growth in FY21E led by Hi-tech, healthcare, life sciences & BFSI. We now expect 5% total revenue decline $ terms in FY21E (earlier: -9.7%) & have increased our margin estimates. Margin upgrades led to EPS upgrades of 16%/11% for FY22/23E.



Outlook

We now value Tech M on 14X multiple (margin volatility & lower margins than peers will restrict further re-rating of multiples) on Sep-22 EPS of Rs.51 to arrive at a changed target price of Rs. 716 (old TP: Rs.493) Tech M is currently trading at 13.2X/12.8X earnings multiple of Rs.50.3/51.9 FY22E/23E EPS respectively. Upgrade to Accumulate from Reduce. Delay in pickup of TCV remains risk to the rating.

The company's consolidated net profit increased by 20.9 percent sequentially to Rs 972.3 crore in June quarter 2020, aided by higher other income and low base in the previous quarter.

The firm reported an impairment of goodwill and non-current assets at Rs 217.5 crore, while other income grew by 45.9 percent to Rs 416.1 crore QoQ during Q1 FY21.

Consolidated revenue from operations fell 4 percent QoQ to Rs 9,106.3 crore and dollar revenue dropped 6.7 percent to $1,207.5 million hit by COVID-19-led lockdown.

Checkout what brokerages' says about the stock and company post the Q1 results:

JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Raised to Rs 740 from Rs 680

The company beat low Q1 expectations across all the metrics, while deal wins were softer than peers as several cyclical headwinds are behind.

The growth recovery momentum should be solid till Q4. JPMorgan raised revenue estimates by 3/4/4%, and margin by 156/55/24 bps for FY21/22/23.

In the medium-term, it should benefit from telcos’ spend on network optimisation. The stock provides attractive risk-reward at 13x FY22e P/E, reported CNBC-TV18.

Citi | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 800

The margin recovery was ahead, while Q1 EBIT 11 percent was ahead of the expectations. The management commentary was cautiously optimistic.

Citi raised FY21/FY22 EPS estimates by 3-4% & multiple to 15.5x from 14x, reported CNBC-TV18.

Goldman Sachs | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 763

Research house raised EPS estimates by up to 8 percent on improving growth trajectory. The margin may improve on lower travel, facility expenses, higher offshoring & automation, reported CNBC-TV18.

CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Raise to Rs 700 from Rs 570

The Q1 earnings were good but not great. The strong margin management in the Q1.

The low revenue growth visibility could constrain stock’s incremental moves. CLSA adjust FY21/FY22 EPS estimates by 12%/4%, reported CNBC-TV18.

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Upgrade to accumulate from reduce | Target: Rs 716

The company delivered better than estimates revenue & margins performance. FCF to PAT% at 245% which is highest ever.

Management mentioned worst is behind & expect improvement from hereon from revenue, margin front & TCV. Prabhudas Lilladher now expect 5% revenue decline dollar terms in FY21E (earlier: -9.7%) & have increased our margin estimates. Margin upgrades led to EPS upgrades of 16%/11% for FY22/23E.

ICICIdirect | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 765

ICICIdirect believes ramp-up of large deal won in previous quarters and improvement in deal wins in coming quarters will drive revenues. Further, in the long term, it believes its leadership in communication vertical will make it a key beneficiary of vendor consolidation in the segment.

It would also benefit from 5G opportunities. Enterprise segment will also benefit from improved digital traction, success in large deals.

Dolat Capital | Rating: Accumulate | Target: Rs 720

The company expects the revenues to improve in this vertical both on supply-side factor as well as improved funnel in US market especially in BFSI, Hitech and Healthcare vertical. Also, expect better deal closures. The company also expects to maintain a tight leash on all costs and that should help it improve profitability hereon.

Factoring in inline results, soft TCV and modest outlook Dolat Capital have broadly kept its growth/OPM estimate largely intact.

Tech Mahindra will eventually have close to 25-30 percent of its employees work from home (WFH) permanently, said Manoj Bhat, CFO, Tech Mahindra.

Speaking to the media after the first quarter results, Bhat said, “Now more than 90 percent of people are working from home. Customers are appreciating that we have been able to meet expectations in terms of service delivery. To me, overall long term, 25-30 percent will be permanent WFH.”

“Given the current uncertainty, working from offices will be a very small number, potentially at least for one or two quarters,” he added.

In an earlier statement, the company said less than one percent of the employees are currently working out of office. Earlier, some of its service lines like business process services faced some challenges when employees worked from home.

Bhat explained that the company has made investments in the integrated command and control centre that allows it to drive outcomes and put in risk mitigation plans, be it working from home or office.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

More companies are moving to blended model when it comes to WFH. While TCS has said that it will have only 25 percent of employees working from office 25 percent of the time, others have taken a more cautious stand.

Most of them have said that it will be a hybrid model where some sections of employees will WFH and others from office. For instance, HCL Tech has taken a stand that WFH will not be a permanent feature for the company. In a recent interaction, VV Apparao, chief human resources officer, said working from home continuously is not healthy, neither physically nor mentally.

“In the office, they will meet people, get some fresh air. When they work from home continuously, we believe that it is not healthy in the longer run. So we are not mandating anywhere,” he added.

Moreover, Apparao explained that while the industry has permissions from the government and clients during the pandemic, they are temporary in nature. “So now if you want to make it a permanent way of working then all the policy framework, guidelines for STPI, all need permanent changes, including the security aspect,” he added.",645,-0.12130159139633179

Speaking to media persons after the results announcement, Manoj Bhat, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Tech Mahindra, said, “There has been some natural attrition during the quarter. We obviously have performance-based reviews around this time. Combination of these two has brought the headcount down.” However, he did not share hiring numbers for Q1 or outlook for FY21.

Attrition fell down from 21 percent in Q1 FY20 to 17 percent for Q1 FY21. For the quarter ended March 2020 attrition was 19 percent.

This is in line with what the other IT majors witnessed this year. Headcount in the top four IT companies went down by 9,000 for the quarter gone by compared to the March quarter for the first time in a decade. For Wipro, the headcount came down by 5,000 between January and June 2020.

This had come at the back of increasing performance-related layoffs, delayed on-boarding of freshers, and a drop in attrition at the back of COVID19, according to company executives. Attrition across the company came down significantly as employees stayed back due to uncertainties around the pandemic.

This is the trend we are likely to see more in the coming months as companies look to optimise costs and lean organisational structure. C.P. Gurnani, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tech Mahindra, said that the company is optimising and will come out leaner and stronger post the coronavirus induced pandemic.

Dolat Capital's research report on Tech Mahindra

TechM Management has acknowledged the near term pain in the Network side of the business but remains hopeful of recovery in H2 led by continued commitment by Telecos on 5G rollouts. In the Enterprise segment the near term worries remains in the Auto/Aviation clients and certain Geo (China/Italy subsidiaries) that may take longer time to revive. TCV signings in FY20 were pretty strong at 3.7bn$ up 120% but most of these are already in the run rate and thus would not provide support in H1. However, as per our recent survey of key clients’ commentaries suggest commitment intact on Network/5G spends although may try to conserve cash for six months and reduce Capex for the year – but should normalize in H2. Commentary in the BFS has been in line with peers but in general is bit cautious on the discretionary side.



Outlook

TechM acquisition track record in the recent past has been terrible and has been one of the structural factor behind its lower than peer profitability/FCF profile (Exhibit 3). However, we believe its valuations at sub12x fairly captures the risk and thus any visible sign of business recovery to act as a trigger for the stock.

Tech Mahindra employees are packing their bags and shifting to a company guest house as the lockdown in Pune comes into force on July 13.

The message, some employees pointed out, has come suddenly. Duration of stay would be close to 10 days, the duration of the lockdown, they added.

These employees primarily include those who are working on critical projects. There are also employees whose clients are yet to give permission to work from home, said techies.

The Maharashtra government imposed a 10-day lockdown in Pune from July 13 to July 23 to control the spread of COVID-19, which continued to increase in the region. The latest order allowed IT companies to work only at 15 percent capacity, while others can operate at 50 percent capacity.

Why would companies shift employees to their guesthouses when they are working at 15 percent capacity? Especially when IT firms have enabled work from home (WFH) for more than 95 percent of the workforce.

For one, not all employees can work from home. Tech Mahindra spokesperson said in a statement that less than 1 per cent employees are currently operating from offices for running critical engagements which cannot be moved to home.

In addition, the spokesperson said in the statement, “Given that some of our associates have to travel from or through containment zones, we have provided an option to stay at our guest house. Associates who are currently staying at our guest house have voluntarily opted to avoid the daily risk of travel.”

Apart from Tech Mahindra, another top IT firm too has asked some of its employees to move to a hotel as the lockdown began in the city. An employee of the firm pointed out that the company has given them an option to move to a hotel since the project they are working on could not get client permission.

“We were given the option to move to hotel for 10 days,” the employee added.

Though it is optional, employees added that the worry over the consequence of non-compliance is a huge deciding factor.

The June quarter earnings of information technology (IT) companies are expected to be hit by demand-side challenges as well as supply pressure, as the coronavirus outbreak takes a toll on the business.

The lockdown imposed to check the spread of the virus hit the supply side. Though some countries started easing restrictions and lifting lockdown in May but IT firms could not operate at full capacities due to the virus risk, which forced companies to lower discretionary spend, review pricing, delay the ramp up of deals and acquisition, which will spill into September quarter as well, brokerages say.

Brokerages expect IT companies to report a 5-9 percent sequential decline in constant currency revenue for the June quarter, with cross-currency headwind of 20-70 basis points, which may further impact dollar revenue growth QoQ.

""We expect Tier-1 IT companies to report a revenue decline in the range of 5-8 percent QoQ in constant currency (CC) terms. This, coupled with cross currency headwind of 30-60 bps, will further negatively impact dollar revenue growth,"" said ICICI Securities.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a sequential revenue decline of 5-9 percent and sequential cross-currency headwind of 20-70 bps largely from INR/USD movements.

According to them, country's largest IT services providers TCS and Infosys are expected to report more than 5 percent QoQ decline in revenue.

Tech Mahindra, Wipro and HCL Technologies are likely to see around 8-9 percent sequential fall in the topline but L&T Infotech may be best among them as well as midcaps, reporting 4.5-5 percent decline in revenue QoQ.

The demand pullback is expected to be severe in directly impacted segments but BFSI and telecom could be stable in terms of growth for IT companies.

""Directly impacted segments of travel, transportation, hospitality, retail (department stores and apparels) pulled back spending with magnitude of cut varying from 20-40 percent,"" said Kotak. The impact of these cuts would be visible through June and September quarters, it said, adding it expected a sharp revenue decline in the oil and gas segment.

It also expects a moderate revenue decline in banking and stable revenues in insurance and telecom verticals.

In addition, ICICI Securities says, companies with higher BPO revenues are also expected to be impacted by supply-related challenges and lower client approval for work from home mode.

""Headwinds are higher than tailwinds before a decision on variable compensation. Companies have anywhere between 3-4 percent of revenues tied to variable compensation; the extent of flex on this will determine margins,"" Kotak said. An 8 percent decline in revenues can lead to 3-4 percent hit on utilization and 120-150 bps impact on margin (assuming relatively lower hit to onsite utilization) and (3) operating leverage hit due to revenue decline, it said.

ICICI Securities expects margin of Tier 1 companies to decline around 32-200 bps while among Tier 2 companies NIIT and Tech Mahindra are expected to post a margin decline of around 161-200 bps.

""This is mainly due to a dip in utilisation, pricing pressure and cross currency headwind, partially offset by rupee depreciation, lower travel cost and lower general administrative cost,"" ICICI Securities said.

More or less Kotak's expectations with respect to margins are along similar lines.

Brokerages say IT companies may continue to avoid giving full-year guidance, given the uncertainty due to coronavirus but they expect a revival in the second half of FY21 and strong growth in FY22.

""While the pandemic is expected to impact near-term growth, we expect a revival in H2FY21. This, coupled with increased traction in digital technologies, vendor consolidation opportunity for Indian IT players, improved IT spending bodes well from a long-term growth perspective,"" ICICI Securities said.

Kotak said it expected a weak FY21 but FY22 revenue growth would be as high as double digits on the back of spending on core transformation programs, vendor consolidation again for offshore pure plays and pickup in IT spending. “We expect TCS and Infosys to capitalise on this growth opportunity,"" it said.

Stock picks

ICICI Securities prefers Infosys among Tier-1 and L&T Infotech among midcaps. Kotak said Infosys is its top pick while L&T Infotech is a solid compounding play in the mid-tier category.

""We would wait for a better entry point for TCS. Even as we expect HCL Technologies to report weak near-term financials, we believe that its IT services portfolio of business has a long runway for growth. Tech Mahindra is inexpensive,"" Kotak said.

A: COVID-19 has initiated a 'Big Reset'. We expect to see a hybrid model of working - a mix of remote and physical working mode. This will be the new paradigm for a long term.

Q: Can you elaborate on the 'Big Reset' aspect?

A: The ‘Big Reset’ has three phases. The first phase is ‘Survive’, which has already happened and where we have used our existing infrastructure to ensure there was business continuity. The second phase is ‘Revive’ – the current stage – where we are reintegrating the workforce by making improvements related to social distancing. In the third phase, which is ‘Thrive’, we will have to reimagine the workplace with sign-based workplace solutions that deliver touchless work experience.

The first big shift will be from shared devices to personal devices. Touch will be replaced with voice, gesture and facial recognition, especially in terms of safety and social distancing this will be the key enabler. At Tech Mahindra, in 2019, we had already introduced K2 which is our humanoid which responds to employee queries around the globe. We also have a facial recognition system, which apart from including our daily emotion analysis, takes our attendance too through facial recognition. Our chatbot UVO has been taking care of everything which has to do with first level recruitment, filling up your travel vouchers applying for leaves and so on.

We also have a virtual onboarding app — DOVE — that does virtual tours, leadership videos and also enables all the joining documentation for people. Even during the current crisis and prevalent social distancing norms, we have also come out with various apps like the ‘BookMySeat’ app and a Cafeteria/Canteen app. We have been recognised as one of the 50 Best Companies to Work for in 2020 by the Great Place to Work Institute for our employee friendly initiatives and people first policies recently.

Q: What percentage of people will continue working remotely or come back to office premises?

A: Majority of our associates are working from home but gradually, we are getting people back into the workplace. However, we are not in a hurry to do so because we want to comply with the state- wise regulations and norms, which are still evolving. So, we have about 10-20 percent of people back at office premises and the remaining are working from home.

Q: Has WFH effected the productivity levels in any way?

A: Though initially, productivity dipped a little, very soon we saw an increase in productivity and efficiency like never before due to commute time being saved and various collaboration tools brought on board. People have also started attending meetings on time. It was also driven by the instinct to survive which ensured we were efficient and productive.

However, we have clearly seen that screen fatigue and a double shift fatigue has started to affect employees. While working from home, people have to balance both office work and home chores. Also, there are difficulties like lack of infrastructure, power cuts, Wi-Fi issues, etc. So, while the initial euphoria and productivity is high, for it to be sustainable, we will need new technologies like 5G to come up in a big way. We will also need the pricing of devices to go down. It is then that sustained productivity levels will reach high levels.

Q: The leadership paradigm has changed. Given the present challenges, how would you identify new talents and leaders and also maintain employee- organisation trust?

A: Leadership has undergone a revolutionary change from the earlier command and control leadership to a more inspirational and resilient one. We have seen a rise in flexible workforce and gig workers with people working from home. We have also seen that a thrust on overall wellbeing and employability has taken over the whole salary fundamentals in retention and value proposition.

Collaboration and inspiration have been important constituents and in times of crisis like this, we have observed, wherever the leader is inspirational and resilient, you will see a higher productivity and better customer feedback. We have many 'Peace Time Generals'. But we are now witnessing 'Peace Time Generals' change to 'War Time Heroes'. People who have taken up the challenge and reacted to the crisis, have emerged as 'War Time Heroes'.

Q: With the COVID-19 having 'eaten away' into the 'human touch' at work or the 'water cooler moments' at work, do you think this will increase the stress levels in associates? How do you plan to tackle this problem which may also adversely affect their productivity?

A: 'Water cooler' moments are important because they connect people on an emotional level but in the situation created by COVID-19, we had to resort to a technology-enabled, high touch environment which replaced the human touch aspect. To tackle this, we at Tech Mahindra have introduced something called ‘TechmighTea’ an AI-driven collaborative tool which recognises the need for two people to meet. For example, it randomly picks up and combines people from two different units or two different areas and invites them for a virtual cup of tea.

We also have an ‘AI Coach’, which recognises your normal style of writing mails and actually stops and asks you when you are writing a mail during a stressful moment. It also coaches you on specific areas that under normal circumstances you may not want to get coached on and it will be almost like a friend available to you where we don’t have a real physical friend.

Our yoga bot - ‘Aasana’ is on display every time you open your computer. Everybody has to opt for a five- minute Yoga or 40 second Yoga session.

Tools like these ensure make sure that while we miss the physical, we don't miss being together. Virtual parties and meetings all help us to stay 'in touch'. I think really, the future is a high tech-enabled high touch environment, because whatever happens, technology has to be used to really create moments of truth which are human and that is the whole belief of Tech Mahindra. Functioning and productivity are based on human experiences and this basically means that we can use technology to enable the human experience.

Q: In what ways has this situation affected your business and when do you see things going back to normal or rather to pre-COVID times?

A: Tech Mahindra was one of the first companies to respond and keep connected with clients during the lockdown and we were functioning at 94 percent levels in the first 72 hours itself. We worked intelligently and instead of ordering laptops we asked our employees to give us their laptops. We rented their laptops, converted them, put a two-layered security into it and gave it back to them. Employees were promised reimbursement for the use of their personal laptops. For the rest, we moved desktops from our offices to their homes. It was incredible to see people taking desktops in their car, people taking laptops on their two-wheelers. But it was a huge win for us because we were agile in the first 72 hours.

This was an important task because we have clients in banking, e-commerce, police; our customers are in every kind of essential services. If we would have been delayed, it would have meant a direct delay in essential services reaching the common man. In a way, our response time was quite incredible, and it was because we were nimble in our thinking.

Government think tank Niti Aayog has formed a panel including top officials of tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Tech Mahindra to develop a job platform for migrant labours, according to sources involved in the project. The move comes at a time when a huge number of migrant workers have lost their jobs during the lockdown period.

The goal is to develop a platform that can help blue-collar workers find job opportunities in their own language and location, an industry source said.

The platform will connect job seekers, employers, government agencies, skill centres and external partners using new-age technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, the source said.

""Niti Aayog under the leadership of its CEO, Amitabh Kant has formed a high-powered committee to drive public and private partnership in order to engage and develop technologies that can solve this looming crisis and provide better job opportunities to the migrant workers,"" the source said.

The panel has some prominent names from the industry including Reliance Industries President Kiran Thomas, Microsoft India President Anant Maheshwari, Tech Mahindra MD and CEO CP Gurnani, Google India country manager and vice president Sanjay Gupta, Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal, among others.

""With the pandemic continuing to create disruptions and lockdowns virtually bringing the economy to a standstill, lakhs of blue-collar workers and migrant labourers were left stranded without a job forcing them to return to their native places. The panel will look at technology-based solution to resolve the issues being faced by the migrant labours,"" the source said.

As per estimates, there are over 40 crore workers in the unorganized sector accounting for around 30 per cent of India's GDP and nearly 60 per cent of these migrant workers are either semi-skilled or unskilled who struggle everyday to find the right job opportunity.

""The platform will cover the digital divide by providing these workers with an opportunity to find jobs, acquire requisite skillsets, find training centres that will provide them with the opportunity to train in their local language. This will also help the job providers with addressing their specific category of labour and worker requirements, location-based searches and adequate reference checks,"" the source said.

The project would come up with a multilingual application that can be accessed via feature phones and help identify location-based jobs, skill development gaps.

""MSME secretary A K Sharma has been also engaged in this project,"" the source said.

The government is also working to start a pan-India helpline number for migrant workers to report their grievances, according to an official note.",435,0.9589811364809672

Shares of most IT players, including Infosys, TCS, HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra and Wipro, suffered losses on June 12 following reports that US President Donald Trump could suspend a number of employment visas, including the H-1B.

In view of the massive unemployment in America due to the coronavirus pandemic, Trump was considering suspending job visas including the H-1B, which Indian IT professionals rely heavily on, a PTI report said.

H-1B is the most coveted foreign work visas for technology professionals from India.

Shares of Tech Mahindra fell 2.91 percent while those of Wipro declined 2.26 percent.

Shares of Infosys, TCS and HCL Tech slipped 1.63 percent, 1.41 percent and 1.10 percent, respectively.

As per Edelweiss Securities, techolution (ignited by apps) further fueled by COVID-19 will lead to a substantial jump in global technology spends, implying higher revenue growth for Indian players along with cost optimisation.

Substantial cash generation capability with robust distribution policy and higher ranking of most tech companies on ESG parameters will keep large focused funds’ interest in them ticking, Edelweiss said.

""These factors, we believe, will trigger substantial multiple expansion, coupled with a significant upgrade in earnings over the next year. This prompts us to revise up our earnings, multiples and target prices across the spectrum and estimate 20-56 percent return in the base-case scenario with a near-term downside risk of 10 percent,"" said Edelweiss.

Edelweiss recommends ""buy"" on HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, Infosys and TCS among large-caps. L&T Technology Services, Mindtree and Larsen & Toubro Infotech in the midcap space, in that order of preference.

The company is also collaborating with a bio-scientist for plausible therapeutic drugs and research laboratories for synthesising and testing these compounds, according to an official statement.

The R&D team used molecular docking approach for the development of the drug, given the high transmission rates of COVID-19.

What is molecular docking? Molecular docking is a computer-assisted drug design method used to understand how one molecule interacts with another to form a stable compound.

Tech Mahindra conducted molecular docking studies across 19 FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved ligands (binding agent) and anti-viral drugs on the RNA of virus.

Nikhil Malhotra, Global Head of Makers Lab, Tech Mahindra, said in a statement that the idea was to prevent the entry of virus into human host cells such as lung airway. Blocking the entry into the host cells would render the virus harmless.

“Also use of artificial intelligence helped the research team to evaluate multiple scenarios with different parameters while finding how molecules dock with the main protease (DNA/RNA),” Malhotra added.

The computational analysis has helped reduce the amount of time taken to narrow down the search among the vast array of molecules present in the process of finding a cure to COVID-19, the statement said.

However, there is more work to be done. Molecular docking has to be converted to actual drug design, testing and drug development at scale, the statement added.",255,0.2828292449315389

Tech Mahindra employees were disappointed after the company suspended shift allowance starting May 1 on account of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, led disruption.

""It is unfair,"" employees said, as most of them continue to work in shifts.

Given that most of them took the shift attracted by the allowance, it was indeed disappointing.

However, this is unlikely to change and probably just the beginning of newer policy changes the industry will be witness to. According to hiring executives, there could be more in store as the IT sector is adopting to the new normal after the coronavirus outbreak, whether employees like it or not.

What happened in Tech Mahindra?In a recent email to employees, Tech Mahindra said, “In order to adjust our policies to these newer ways of working, we are suspending payment of shift allowance and holiday allowance for all India-based associates with effect from May 1.”

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Shift allowance is common in business process management (BPM), IT support and global in-house centres, where employees work on 24*7 projects mostly on a rotational basis. This would mean employees will have to alternate between night, early morning and day shifts, taking a toll on their health.

That is why IT firms usually incentivise employees working in these shifts by giving them additional allowance to make it more attractive, though they are not legally bound to. This is also a motivating factor for employees who are working at odd hours.

Ajay Shah, Head – Recruitment, Teamlease Services, said, “This is the premium companies were willing to pay to get workers in the night shift.”

However, with Tech Mahindra suspending the allowance, employees question the need to work in shifts.

A Tech Mahindra spokesperson explained that the shift allowance was paid for hardship due to travel to work at odd hours and other out of pocket expenses. With most of the employees working from home, the company had suspended the allowance. However, those working in office and client locations will continue to be eligible for the allowance, the spokesperson added.

Employees are unhappy with the fact that work from home (WFH) is here to stay. An employee Moneycontrol spoke to said, “Most of us moved to a 24*7 support project since we were promised an additional shift allowance of Rs 400 per shift.” This translates to Rs 6,000-7,000 per month and accounts for about 20-25 percent of an employee’s salary.

“Just because we are WFH, it does not mean that we are not working in shifts. I would rather move to day shift than working in 24*7 project,"" the employee added.

This will probably not be an isolated case. A hiring executive explained that as all IT firms brace for their worst quarter on the back of the virus outbreak, more such changes are expected and would become the new normal.

What more is in store for IT employees?Since the virus outbreak, some IT firms have asked employees to accept voluntary pay cuts. However, these are hardly voluntary as employees fear that non-compliance would lead to termination during these difficult times.

Wage hikes and promotions have been deferred indefinitely. Some firms have cut down travel allowance as well.

The executive pointed out that firms will continue to look at every aspect of salary structure and premium offerings would go away like shift allowances. The industry is already seeing job losses and hence people would be willing to work without a premium. So doing away with shift allowance could become permanent.

If WFH is the new normal, there would be no need for travel allowances as employees are not travelling. So, this is another aspect that will come under review. In cases where employers were offering allowance for upskilling or reskilling that would be done away with as well.

Aditya Narayan Mishra, Director and CEO, CIEL HR, said higher variable component in the salary is going to become a norm. At present, Mishra explained, the fixed versus variable component is 85-90:10-15 in the IT industry. “Going forward, fixed salary would fall to 70 or 60. So your performance will be more outcome based,” he added.",967,-0.5906387188217856

Tech Mahindra has received a notice from the Pune labour commissioner after complaints of salary-cuts during the nationwide lockdown.

The National Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES) claimed that it had received complaints from Tech Mahindra staff, according to a report by Mint.

The report said the shift allowance payment between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 per employee would be discontinued from May 1, a move affecting 13,000 Tech Mahindra employees.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

The notice issued by Assistant Labour Commissioner Nikhil Walke asked Tech Mahindra not to violate the government's rules, Mint reported.

""NITES demands strict action against Tech Mahindra Pune, as the organisation has failed to follow the basic policies of human rights and violates Maharashtra State government's regulations,"" said the organisation in a letter, as seen by the publication.

IT company Tech Mahindra expects 5G rollout, demand for home connectivity and digitisation will drive business growth in the coming days, senior officials of the company said.

The company expects short term setbacks for businesses due to coronavirus pandemic, however, telecom clients will support business growth.

""There will be some headwinds, and those headwinds will be common to everybody, but company continues to innovate, continues to leverage every of my acquisition and certain businesses where the expansion is likely to happen faster, for example, digital, for example, healthcare, we are doing a double click or a double drilling,"" Tech Mahindra MD and CEO CP Gurnani said in an investors call.

According to the details uploaded on the company's website, 93 per cent employees in the company's IT team and around 85 per cent in the business process services were working from home after the lockdown was announced.

Tech Mahindra CEO for Network Services Manish Vyas said that major service providers continue to remain focused on investment in network expansion and 5G services.

""The new workspace is clearly shifting more towards the home and that is something telcos, particularly the large ones who have been incumbents, they are all going to be looking at that product mix and all looking at digitisation and strengthening the product mix with home as the new access of growth,"" Vyas said.

He said that a lot of discussions are going on telecom players towards digitisation of homes.

During the lockdown, most of the employees across businesses are working from home.

IT major TCS has already announced plans to allow 75 per cent of employees to work from home by 2025.

Tech Mahindra in the quarter ended March 31, 2020 reported 29 per cent dip in the March quarter consolidated net profit at Rs 803.9 crore owing to narrowing of margins due to factors including a surge in COVID-19 related costs.

For the 2019-20 financial year, the Mahindra group company reported 6.15 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 4,033 crore. In December quarter, the profit stood at Rs 1,145.9 crore.

After posting a 7 percent gain in just four sessions last week, market erased most of the gains on Monday.

Brutal selling witnessed across the counters amidst subdued global cues as the tension rising between the US and China over coronavirus, weak earning from companies like Reliance, HUL, and Tech Mahindra and implementation of economic lockdown 3.0 also weighed on sentiments.

Selling got accelerated after India’s manufacturing PMI for the month of April reduced to a record low of 27.4.

Events that can impact the market for this week are services PMI data, government measures to combat the impact of lockdown extension, and the US-China relationship.

Q) How is May likely to pan out for investors. There is a very popular Wall Street adage ‘Sell in May and Go Away’? Do you think we could hold onto gains if not why?

A) Since this doesn’t seem to be a fundamentally driven rally (14 percent rally in April), we are not confident of market sustaining at higher levels. The market is almost 30 percent higher than the recent low. So, we are advising investors to partially book gains from the market.

Q) What is your call on Banking and auto stocks which have run up quite sharply in the week gone by?

A) We have a cautious to negative view of both sectors in the near-to-mid-term.

Q) What are the important factors which investors could track in the coming week and in the month of May?

A) As the initial lockdown started from the last 10 days of March 2020, we are not anticipating much negativity in the earning results of the companies. Nevertheless, the market needs to closely watch the earning results and the commentary of the companies.

Investors are expecting another stimulus package from the government and if the package is sufficient than the market could sustain the rally.

Q) What is your view on Tech Mahindra and HUL which came out with results on Thursday? What should investors do – buy, sell or hold?

A) Tech Mahindra Q4 result was below market expectations, which was mainly due to the disruption caused by COVID-19 related lockdown.

The company has not reported any significant deal cancellation but is operating at below capacity as clients struggled with the lockdown. In the near term, our view on Tech Mahindra is negative, but positive in the mid-to-long term.

For the whole sector, we are cautiously optimistic, but at the individual company level, it depends on sales-mix across various verticals.

HUL’s earning results too were below market expectations. The company reported a 7 percent fall in sales volume as against the consensus expectations of -4 to 4 percent.

EBITDA margin declined to 22.9 percent vs. expectations of 25.5 percent. The company indicated that it is currently operating at 70% utilization as compared to almost zero percent for the seven days after 25th Mar. 2020 (1st phase of lockdown).

We feel that despite reporting below-consensus results, it will remain in investor’s radar, because of its defensive nature in this uncertain environment.

Q) What are your view on RIL results and Rights issue and what should investors do?

A) RIL result was also below the market expectations. The company reported a consolidated PAT of Rs 6,348 crore. It has taken an inventory loss of Rs 4,267 crore, mainly due to the volatility in international crude prices. Net sales too were below the expectations and stood. GRM stood at USD 8.9 per barrel vs. expectations of USD 7.2.

Driving ahead of its plan to become a net-zero debt company by March 2021, the company has planned to raise massive equity of Rs.53,100 crore (i.e. around USD 7bn) via the right issue plan.

This is the first time the company is tapping the equity market in nearly three decades and this is the largest equity offering in Indian corporate history. The right issue will be a ratio of 1:15 with a price of Rs 1,257 per share

The issue will be structured as partly paid shares and payment of residual subscription amount over a period of time.

Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Initially, it was led by defensive sectors like FMCG and Pharma. Recently, it was fueled by Auto and Commodity relief rally along with Banks and IT sector.

Q) As we close the month of April on a positive note after a massacre in March – how is May likely to pan out for investors. There is a very popular Wall Street adage ‘Sell in May and Go Away’? Do you think we could hold onto gains if not why?

A) The Nifty50 has now retraced 50 percent of the whole decline, so the index is approaching a resistance zone in terms of retracement levels.

It needs to be seen that the market can sustain at current levels and some profit booking may be expected.

Q) What is your call on Banking and auto stocks which have run up quite sharply in the week gone by?

A) Though banking stocks have rallied recently, they are not out of the woods yet and are still within a range of 6 weeks. So, banks need to show follow-through action from here on for a fresh rally to emerge.

The auto sector was in pain long before the pandemic hit and was one the weakest sector. So, for now, it seems like a relief rally coming off a low base.

Q) What are the important factors which investors could track in the coming week, and in the month of May which could dictate the trend for markets?

A) Relaxation in lockdown, economic policy measures, and how the activity at the ground is picking level is likely to dictate the market direction, going forward.

Results season has already started and it would provide a peek on how earnings will be impacted in next quarter.

Q) What is your view on Tech Mahindra and HUL which came out with results on Thursday? What should investors do – buy, sell, or hold?

A) The HUL result was disappointing with a volume de-growth of 7 percent, the number not seen even during the demonetisation period. Personal care and ice cream segments witnessed a soft demand leading to the weak performance of the company.

In the short run, the stock is expected to underperform given the expensive valuations and poor quarterly performance. However, in the medium term, HUL should farewell as it will be a key beneficiary of the rural demand recovery and one of the least impacted companies from COVID-19 led disruptions.

Tech Mahindra too disappointed the street with a 29 percent fall in earnings. COVID-19 led disruptions are bringing extraordinary changes in the business models of the IT industry. Hence, it will be important to see who all are able to adapt to the rapid changes.

While the stock has corrected by about 35 percent over the last two months, it not expected to rally in the near term in absence of any strong trigger.

Q) What are your view on RIL results and Rights issue and what should investors do? Do you see a positive/negative reaction on Monday?

A) RIL reported a resilient performance in all the segments even in this challenging quarter. The company also announced a rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore. This is a step towards the company's target of becoming a zero-net debt company by end of current fiscal.

Promoters are expected to fully subscribe to the rights issues which will instil confidence in investors' minds about promoters’ commitment to the business in addition to improving the balance sheet strength. We believe investors should take this positively.

Shares of Tech Mahindra plunged nearly 8 percent in early trade on BSE on May 4, reacting to the company's March quarter numbers released on the previous trading session on April 30.

Tech Mahindra March quarter results were below analyst estimates, and the pain seen in the March quarter is likely to extend in Q1FY21, suggest experts. The IT company on April 30 posted a 29 percent year-on-year fall in profit at Rs 803.9 crore for the quarter ended March 2020.

Brokerages have a mixed view on the stock. While some maintained their positive stance on the stock, some cut the target prices and some analysts downgraded the stock to sell.

Morgan Stanley

CNBC-TV18 reported Morgan Stanley has maintained an 'overweight' call on the stock with a target price at Rs 680 and said that Q4 performance was weaker than expected as COVID-19 impaired growth and margin.

Morgan Stanley is of the view that the company has an opportunity to gain market share in BPS.

""Margin improvement plan could get pushed out by a year. We cut EPS estimates by 11 percent for FY21 and 3 percent for FY22,"" said Morgan Stanley.

It highlighted that the valuation of the stock is cheap against other large-cap peers.

Macquarie

As per CNBC TV-18, Macquarie has an 'outperform' call on Tech Mahindra but cut the target price to Rs 738 from Rs 839.

""Higher exposure to BPS business will put pressure on growth in near-term,"" said Macquarie, adding that the delay in deal ramp-ups due to COVID-19 induced uncertainty will weigh on growth.

CLSA

CLSA has maintained 'outperform' call on Tech Mahindra but cut the target price to Rs 635 from Rs 920, reported CNBC-TV18.

""We see headwinds from slowed discretionary spending in the enterprise segment. Margin will be under pressure in FY21 on lower volumes and pricing discounts. We cut revenue estimates by 16-17 percent and margin by 200-250 bps for FY21-22,"" said CLSA.

CLSA added that continued strong deal win momentum provides hope of a recovery in the second half of the year.

Jefferies

Jefferies has a buy call on the stock. It raised the target price to Rs 615 from Rs 590.

As per CNBC-TV18, Jefferies underscored that the disappointing Q4 as communications business was surprisingly weak and the performance of the company was disappointed on both revenue growth & EBIT margin.

Jefferies finds a total contract value of $505 million a silver lining.

""Revenue decline led by communications though some of this is likely transitory. 5-G spend ramp-up and demand-side pressures will be key going forward,"" said Jefferies.

Kotak Institutional Equities

Kotak has a 'buy' call on Tech Mahindra but cut the target price to Rs 360 from Rs 680. The brokerage expects Tech Mahindra's EBIT margin to decline to 10.2 percent in FY21.

Kotak said it saw growth normalisation in FY22 after a poor FY21. It has trimmed FY21-22 EPS estimates by 10-22 percent on Q4 disappointment.

Investec

Investec has a buy call on the stock with a target price at Rs 630.

""Q1FY21 is likely to be another quarter of meaningful revenue declines. We cut our FY21 and FY22 EPS estimates by 4.3 percent and 0 percent, respectively,"" said the brokerage.

Investec said its estimates factor in revenue drops over Q1 and Q2 and weak margin in the first half of the year and added that the revenue and margin performance in Q1 will be key to stock performance.

Motilal Oswal

Motilal Oswal downgraded the stock to Neutral with a target price of Rs 590.

Sharp revenue decline and EBIT margin contraction were disappointing given the COVID-19 impact on March were only limited to just two to four weeks across the core geographies.

This indicates what lies ahead in subsequent quarters when the full impact of the COVID-19 crisis is likely to kick in. Tech Mahindra has been slower in enabling work-from-home (WFH) access in comparison to its peers, indicating supply issues may not completely ease out in the near-term.

Motilal Oswal downgraded its EPS estimates over FY21–22E by 22–25 percent in light of the disappointing results and downbeat commentary.

Edelweiss Securities

Edelweiss Securities maintained its buy rating on Tech Mahindra post-March quarter results but slashed its 12-month target price to Rs 640 from Rs 796 earlier.

“We believe the current quarter pain is likely to extend in Q1FY21 as well and is in line with our trimming of estimates (on 9th April 2020) for the company and the sector. In view of the current uncertainty and lower growth, we trim our multiple to 14.5x (16.0x earlier), in line with a cut in our sector multiples,” said the note.

Some analysts have also downgraded the stock to ‘sell’.

Tech Mahindra March quarter results were below analysts estimates, and the pain seen in the March quarter is likely to extend in Q1FY21, suggest experts. The IT company on April 30 posted a 29 percent year-on-year fall in profit at Rs 803.9 crore for the quarter ended March 2020.

The company posted a net profit of Rs 1,132.5 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal and Rs 1,145.9 crore profit in the December quarter of FY20.

EBIT for the quarter came at Rs 949.6 crores and the margin was 10 percent. EBIT was 17.9 percent below, while margin was 180 bps below CNBC-TV18 estimates.

Revenue from operations stood at Rs 9,490.2 crore, down from Rs 9,654.6 crore reported in the December quarter. However, it was up from Rs 8,892.3 crore reported in the March quarter of FY19.

""Tech Mahindra posted weak results as profit fell by 29 percent YoY. EBIT margin was a big miss too. Telecom is a very important business mix for the company which has a positive outlook due to higher consumer spending in telecom & data,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

""We believe that the entire IT space will go through transformation post-COVID-19, and with respect to Tech Mahindra as most companies have delayed their 5G CAPEX that could impact the telecom revenue for the stock. We are downgrading forecast and outlook on the stock,” he said.

We have collated views from various experts and brokerage houses on Tech Mahindra post-March quarter results:

Expert: Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities

The pandemic and consequent lockdown in India and across the globe has disrupted the IT industry which will impact Tech Mahindra’s revenue as well. It would be advisable to 'sell' Tech Mahindra as there are other large players which can provide better-investing opportunities going forward.

Expert: Ashish Chaturmohta, Head of Technical and Derivatives, Sanctum Wealth Management.

COVID-19 led disruptions are bringing extraordinary changes in the business models of the IT industry. Hence, it will be important to see who all are able to adapt to the rapid changes.

While the stock has corrected 35 percent over the last two months, it is not expected to rally in the near term in absence of any strong triggers.

Here are the edited excerpts of the interview:

Q. A strong day to end the week! While the Sensex is back above 33,000, the Nifty50 reclaimed 9,800. What is fuelling the market rally on D-Street?

A. The Nifty50 closed 7.7 percent higher for the week post the breakout above 9,500 levels and positive momentum from the global markets led to a sharp up move.

Among stocks, there was positive news flow from the quarterly results like IndusInd Bank, Ambuja Cement and Hexaware Technologies and expectations of strong results from Reliance Industries helped the overall market momentum.

The monthly expiry and crossover of key resistance levels resulted in short covering in the index options due to which the markets ended at the highest point in the expiry month.

Q. As we close the month of April on a positive note after a massacre in March, how is May likely to pan out for investors. There is a very popular Wall Street adage ‘Sell in May and Go Away’? Do you think we could hold onto gains if not why?

A. The Nifty50 closed 14.1 percent higher for the April expiry to post one of the best months of gains in the last decade with strong positive momentum across sectors and stocks.

The Nifty50 has rallied by about 31 percent from its swing low of 7,511 recorded in March. The pullback started since the countrywide lockdown came into effect and got stronger with global markets pullback.

The adage ‘Sell in May and Go Away’ did not hold true in recent years as we have ended positively in May month for the last five years.

We believe there could be some more positive momentum till 10,400 levels and then correction could set in as the 200-week average and 38.2 percent pullback from its 52-week lows are placed in the range of 10,350-10,400 levels.

The later part of the results season is always very weak which could also pull the markets lower in the second half of May.

Q. What is your call on banking and auto stocks which have run up quite sharply in the week gone by?

A. The Nifty Bank was being a laggard in the current up move but private banks gained traction post the results of HDFC Bank and gained further traction as other private banks announced their full-year results.

PSU banking has remained flat trading near to its all-time lows and we could expect a strong up move in May as the monthly candle ends in a Doji pattern and the set up on daily and weekly charts looks positive.

Auto sector has moved up 33 percent from its 52-week low. We expect some weakness as individual stocks are being in the overbought zone on the daily charts and on the higher side the 200-Day average is placed at 7,200 levels which will act as a strong resistance. The risk-reward is not favourable from current levels.

Q. What are the important factors which investors could track in the coming week and in the month of May which could dictate the trend for markets?

A. In the coming week, D-Street's reaction from Nifty50 companies like HUL, Reliance Industries and Tech Mahindra would be the key to watch and how the global markets pan out.

We remain positive on markets and any correction near to 9,400 levels would be a good entry point as the resistances will act as support from current levels.

The Q4FY20 results season would move into the third week and selectively, the lockdown will also open in non-containment zones of various states which will be important to watch for the manufacturing and industrial activities to resume.

Q. What is your view on Tech Mahindra and HUL which came out with results on April 30? What should investors do — buy, sell or hold?

A. HUL has already witnessed a sharp correction in the past two weeks and the results were largely in-line with expectations as it has gained market share in the overall business and low volume growth is mainly due to low stocking.

Tech Mahindra posted a weak set of numbers. We expect a weak opening for the stock but one should buy on dips near its support at lower levels in the range of 490-500 levels. It could be a good entry point for the stock to accumulate on declines.

Q. What are your view on RIL results and the rights issue, and what should investors do? Do you see a positive/negative reaction on May 4 (Monday)?

A. The results are in-line except for the exceptional loss which dragged the overall profits. But consumer business and Jio subsidiary reported stronger growth for the quarter.

Reliance Industries’ rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore is priced at Rs 1,257, the ratio of 1:15 held by shareholders, which will enable shareholders to increase the holdings at a lower price compared to the closing of Rs 1,467 per share.

We expect a positive opening on May 4 (Monday), but the upside could be capped as multiple resistances are placed in the range of 1,550-1,600 levels near to its previous tops.

Q) A strong day to end the week! The Sensex is back above 33000 while Nifty50 reclaimed 9800. What is fuelling market rally on D-Street?

A) Push in global liquidity, the expectation of a bonanza stimulus in India, developments on the treatment, and supportive chart parameters are the main reasons for the momentum while economic fundamentals continue to be dim.

Optimism has also developed that the economy will open in a phase-wise manner, given the reduction in the rate of virus spread.

Q) As we close the month of April on a positive note after a massacre in March – how is May likely to pan out for investors. There is a very popular Wall Street adage ‘Sell in May and Go Away’? Do you think we could hold onto gains if not why?

A) At the current level, we have a cautious view on the market, unless the global health environment improves with better treatment and vaccination in the future.

We term this as a bear rally, the sustainability of which is difficult in the short-term given rising cascading economy effect.

We are advising traders to capitalise on this rally and book gains in the near-term. Long-term investors can accumulate on dips.

Q) What is your call on banking and auto stocks that have run up quite sharply in the week gone by?

A) Banking stocks are under the assistance of supportive measures by RBI & the government to support the economy. The highest concern is on SME, MSME, and continuity of business in the near to medium-term.

Even though a good amount of weak credit growth and higher provisions during Q1 and Q2 is factored in price, we remain cautious due to asset quality concern & downgrade in outlook.

Having said that private banks' premium valuations have beaten down, presenting an opportunity for long-term investors. Banks having exposure in the retail segment with a good branch presence, better loan mix, and comfortable balance sheets like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and SBI will stand out.

In the auto sector, the stocks that have lower debt and a rich balance-sheet are expected to outperform in the auto segment, post-COVID-19.

The auto index has given a return of 30 percent in the last 1 month from its low due to the expectation that the government’s stimulus package on the economy will benefit the industry & sales will improve in Q2.

However, improvement in demand and change in consumer spending might have a longer impact on the sector. Currently, the index is trading at 18x on a 1-year fwd basis which is 13 percent premium to its five-year historical average at 16x.

We have a cautious view in the short-term with a selective Buy rating on Maruti Suzuki, Escorts, and Minda Industries Ltd.

Q) What are the important factors which investors could track in the coming week, and in the month of May which could dictate the trend for markets?

A) A large portion of Indian company results is likely to be released in the month of May with a negative bias. Possibility of opening the economy, the size & effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus to be announced will define the trend of the domestic market in the near-term.

While globally, the grim economic data, news regarding treatment, and vaccination are the watchlist.

Q) What is your view on Tech Mahindra and HUL which came out with results on Thursday? What should investors do – buy, sell, or hold?

A) Tech Mahindra posted weak results as profit fell by 29 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 803 cr. The EBIT margin is a big miss and came at 10 percent.

Telecom is a very important business mix for the company which has a positive outlook due to higher consumer spending in telecom & data.

We believe that the entire IT space will go through transformation post-COVID pandemic and with respect to Tech Mahindra, as most companies have delayed their 5G CAPEX that could impact the telecom revenue for the stock. We are downgrading forecast and outlook on the stock.

COVID-19 has impacted HUL in terms of demand and supply but comparing to other stocks and sectors the outlook has not deteriorated much.

On the demand side, already subdued rural demand could further impact by lower-income with the weaker sale of crops amid labor and supply chain issues.

But, monsoon will play a vital role in demand. As the economy improves, we expect V-shape recovery and have a HOLD rating.

The company plants are running at 70-75 percent of the capacity and is expected to be among the best performing stock in the near to medium term given the cautious trend of the market.

Q) What are your view on RIL results and Rights issue and what should investors do? Do you see a positive/negative reaction on Monday?

A) The medium to long term outlook of RIL has significantly improved on account of its plan to consolidate its key assets which will create value to shareholders through strategic development, equity infusion, and deleveraging of balance sheet.

The proposed right issue (Rs 53,000 crore) is a step in that direction. The total amount of proceeds is likely to be about Rs 1,04,000 crore (Rights, Facebook & BP), excluding transactions with Aramco & Financial investor.

Going ahead, there will be challenges in cyclical business that would be offset by digital & retail business. However, in the near term, weak oil prices are likely to impact its cash cow (refining and petro-chemicals business), dilution in equity, high leverage, and uncertainty in business post-COVID, which will impact the performance of the stock in the near to medium-term.

Software services provider Tech Mahindra has reported a 29.8 percent QoQ decline in profit at Rs 803.9 crore due to impairment of the company’s subsidiaries (Rs 217crore).

Revenue from operations degrew by 1.7 percent sequentially to Rs 9,490.2 crore in quarter ended March 2020.

The sequential decline in revenue was 3.3 percent in constant currency, while EBIT margin declined 220bps included the credit loss margin evaluated every quarter.

Here are the highlights of Tech Mahindra's Q4FY20 earnings call compiled by Narnolia Financial Advisors:

Management Participant: CP Gurnani – MD & CEO, ManojBhat – CFO

Q4FY20 performance:

The sequential decline in revenue of 3.3 percent constant currency terms was mainly attributable to; 1) half came from COVID-19 impact (impact in BPS due to supply side constraints and delay in approval from client); 2) deferral of IT spend from customer side in network; and 3) due to weakness in Comviva business (renewal & new sales were impacted).

Many deal wins which started during the course have seen impact. Execution start slowed down during Q4.

Margin performance:

EBIT margin declined 220bps included the credit loss margin evaluated every quarter.

The company has a higher risk for potential future problems, which impacted margins by 100 bps (including CSR).Transition cost for new deal impacted the margins. And then COVID-19 related revenue and utilization impacted margin by further 80 bps.

Currency was positive for the company which benefited 30 bps.

PAT for Q4 was impacted due to impairment of the company’s subsidiaries (Rs 217crore).

Demand environment

Broadly, there is no communication of dilution of focus from strengthening the network, expanding the network and 5G rollout. The Company is seeing temporary setup in these areas but for long term most of operators have confirmed it to happen in next few quarters from opex standpoint.

The company is seeing a shift in new work space more towards home which the larger telecom companies are discussing in this direction.

The company will see short term impact in its BPS business.

In the enterprise part, the company is seeing discretionary spending is slowing and also the focus on change in growth strategy has got an impact because of focus moving towards digital. The company sees the situation as temporary setup and will continue to become stronger post COVID-19.

No major exposure to travel, transport and oil & segment will be a positive part for the company.

Outlook

Q1 will see more demand led impact.

For communication the company sees optimism for the mid to long term time frame.

Revenue impact will pressurize the margins. Goal is to get back to margin to teens by a year.

The company focusing on-

1) Reducing the subcontracting cost;

2) Increased focus all third party cost;

3) Saving coming through travel (at 5 to 3 percent cost);

4) Rationalization of the facilities (tighter synergy of subsidiaries);

5) Various bonus pay and hikes which already the company has taken will support margins.",497,0.1773445799946785

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

However, he said there are no plans for layoffs yet.

""Unless there is a natural situation where particular line of business has to be closed I am not looking at anything that is not in the interest of employees or the society,"" he said.

The company employs close to 1,25,236 people, down by 4.3 percent compared to the previous quarter. Utilisation has come down as well due to the pandemic. Close to 93 percent of the employees are working from home. However, in case of business process outsourcing, it took longer since due to delay in client permissions, especially Europe and New Zealand where data privacy laws were stringent.

In terms of recovery, the company expects certain verticals to recover faster.

The company registered revenue of 5,181.9 million for the year ended FY20, up 4.3 percent year-on-year. However revenue declined by 3.3 percent on constant currency terms on a quarter-on-quarter basis to $1294.6 million due to COVID-19. The company is also seeing reduction in discretionary spend and volumes as customers across sectors are bracing for the COVID-19 impact.

""Due to COVID-19, 5G rollouts have been affected as well. However, as economy and business recover, 5G will get a boost as remote infrastructure and cloud are gaining traction,"" Gurnani added.",595,-0.08020203312238057

The company's board has proposed a final dividend of Rs 5 per share (100 percent) on the face value of Rs 5, in addition to the interim dividend of Rs 10 per share declared earlier.

EBIT for the quarter came at 949.6 crore and the margin was 10 percent. EBIT was 17.9 percent below, while margin was 180 bps below CNBC-TV18 estimates.

Revenue from operations stood at Rs 9,490.2 crore, down from Rs 9,654.6 crore reported in the December quarter. However, it was up from Rs 8,892.3 crore reported in the March quarter of FY19.

CNBC-TV18 had estimated the revenues to the tune of Rs 9,712 crore for the quarter.

EBITDA came at Rs 1,348 crore, down 13.8 percent QoQ, while margins came at 14.2 percent, down 200 bps QoQ, the company said in a BSE filing.

“Q4 has been a quarter where some of our metrics were impacted by the environmental challenges. Efficient operations, cost optimization and delivery automation will be the key focus areas going into the next year,"" Chief Financial Officer Manoj Bhat said.

""Our strong balance sheet combined with a focus on cash conservation will help us tide over the volatility in the near-term, as we look to emerge stronger and leaner to capture opportunities ahead.”

CP Gurnani, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Tech Mahindra, said the coronavirus outbreak had brought an unprecedented change in the business model for the IT industry. ""Ensuring the wellness of employees and contribute to society while maintaining business continuity under all circumstances continues to be our priority,"" he said.

""While the demand traction seen through the first three-quarters of Fiscal 19-20 has reversed in Q4, we expect that the focus on digital transformation, remote working and network modernisation will recover in the medium-term. The company has shown strong growth for the fiscal 20 and we remain committed to delivering sustainable solutions to our customers enabling them to adapt to new normal.”

The currency plays a key role in IT companies' revenues as any depreciation in rupee plays out well for export companies.

The currency weakened by 6 percent during the March quarter as well as year-to-date 2020.

The stock fell sharply not only in the March quarter but also through 2019-20 and year-to-date 2020, down 25.8 percent, 27.1 percent, and 30.6 percent, respectively.

In comparison, BSE Information Technology index shed 17 percent, 16 percent, and 13 percent, respectively.

IT major Tech Mahindra is expected to announce a subdued set of Q4FY20 numbers owing to disruption caused by COVID-19, shutdown in China and India, and cancellation of a few network projects.

The company will release its March quarter results on April 30.

A few points to watch out for in the results are - strategy to improve the work from home coverage for BPO work, measures taken to ensure that profitability is higher than FY20 levels, impact on 5G rollouts from the recent chain of events, demand outlook from the impacted auto vertical and large deal pipeline, and drivers of revenue in FY21E, according to brokerages.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 21.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall and 22.8 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) fall in Tech Mahindra's adjusted net profit at Rs 884 crore for Q4FY20.

The estimates of the brokerage show the EBIT of the company for the quarter may see a 15 percent YoY decline while EBIT margin may fall by 348 bps YoY.

Revenues may rise 9.8 percent YoY to Rs 9,763.8 crore while revenue in constant currency (CC) terms may fall 30 bps YoY, Kotak said.

""We expect a steep net profit decline sequentially due to forex loss against forex gains of Rs 143 crore in December 2019 quarter and decline in EBIT margins,"" Kotak said.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects a 7.7 percent YoY increase in Tech Mahindra's revenues at Rs 9,578.8 crore for Q4FY20. EBIT margin is expected at 11.8 percent while EBITDA margin is expected at 15.9 percent, said Motilal.

As per Motilal, margin commentary, outlook on telecom vertical and progress on deal ramp-ups are key things to watch out for when Tech Mahindra declares its Q4 results.

Brokerage Sharekhan expects a 20.8 percent YoY and 21.8 percent QoQ fall in Tech Mahindra's net profit to Rs 897 crore.

Sharekhan expects revenue to decline by 0.2 percent QoQ on CC basis despite additional revenue contribution from BORN acquisition and ramp-up of Prudential deal.

""The decline in revenue during the quarter is expected due to lower billings in BPO (10 percent of its total revenue), a drop in AT&T revenue, decline in Pininfarina revenue, China shut-down, and cancellation of few network projects. Further, the cross-currency headwind is expected around 110 BPS on its dollar revenue,"" Sharekhan said.

As per Sharekhan's estimates, EBIT margin is expected to decline by about 21BPS QoQ, owing to transition costs of large deals, lower billing and decline in utilisation.

On the other hand, ICICI Direct expects Tech Mahindra's dollar revenues to grow 1 percent QoQ to $1,367 million mainly driven by partial contribution by the acquisition of Born group, AT&T deal and Jackson National Life Insurance deal.

Rupee revenues may grow 2.6 percent QoQ to Rs 9,903 crore. EBITDA margins could decline 50 bps QoQ to 15.7 percent on account of the continuity of large deal transition cost in the quarter partially offset by rupee depreciation, ICICI Direct said.

IT companies - like Infosys, Tech Mahindra and others - are expected to let employees continue work from home (WFH) for the next few weeks as many states have decided to impose full lockdown till May 3 without any relaxations.

Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka have already said that companies will have to keep premises closed during the lockdown.

In fact, the Telangana government has extended the lockdown in the state till May 7.

""Our plan is to come back in a gradual manner, we are not in a hurry to come back aggressively. In phase one, less than 5 per cent will come back to work for 3-4 weeks. Over the next 4-8 weeks, maybe 15-20 per cent will come back in a gradual manner. We will maintain very high standards of safety, temperature check, social distancing,"" Infosys COO Pravin Rao said.

Harshvendra Soin, chief people officer at Tech Mahindra, said the company is closely monitoring the situation at its end and working as per the government's order and advisories.

""With the rapid outbreak of COVID-19, the lockdown has not yet been relaxed and hence the majority of our associates are still working from home. We are working in parallel with our backend IT and security teams for smooth transition.

""We also have a robust business continuity plan – powered by next-generation technologies – in place to combat the situation and to ensure continuity of essential services and business as usual,"" Soin said.

Industry body Nasscom had also advised members to adopt a staggered approach and start with 15-20 per cent workforce in the first phase, and subsequently scale it up depending on the situation on the ground.

""The home ministry guidelines had allowed IT-ITeS companies to operate with up to 50 per cent strength from April 20 and we had suggested member companies to take a staggered approach and start with 15-20 per cent workforce in phase I, and then increase it depending on the on-ground situation,"" Nasscom Senior Vice-President and Chief Strategy Officer Sangeeta Gupta told PTI.

IT companies are just settling into the work from home mechanism, and they have taken requisite permissions from clients for this, Gupta added.

""So, I do not think they will be in a hurry to get employees back to offices and risk their health,"" Gupta said.

About 90 per cent of IT employees and 70-80 per cent of BPO and small and medium businesses in the sector are estimated to be working from home to ensure business continuity.

An industry executive, who did not wish to be named, said many areas in cities like Noida, Bengaluru and Pune -- that are hubs for IT-BPO companies -- fall in red zones and companies are being cautious towards the safety of the employees.

The executive added that companies will continue this practice of allowing WFH for employees for the next quarter or so.

Tech Mahindra will acquire 100 per cent stake in the company for $64 million or about Rs 460 crore out of which $42 million or about Rs 300 crore will be paid at closing and the remaining is linked to the financial performance of the Microsoft customer account for the upcoming three years, Agrawal said.

Zen3 revenue for six month period ended June 30, 2019, was $25 million (about Rs 180 crore).

Tech Mahindra expects the deal to close by April 1, 2020

Agrawal said that Zen3 capabilities can be leveraged by Tech Mahindra in developing various voice-based applications, autonomous car projects etc.

In a separate filing, Tech Mahindra announced a dividend of Rs 10 per equity share for 2019-20.

""It has been a quarter of strong growth with substantial operational and financial metrics improvement.

The coronavirus outbreak may impact the economy, including the IT sector, CP Gurnani, Managing Director and CEO of Tech Mahindra, told CNBC-TV18 in an interview on the sidelines of the Nasscom India Leadership Forum 2020.

He revealed that the mood of the tech CEOs was ""very positive"". “Talking to all the CEOs of the Indian IT industry, you would find that the performance has been good. You will also see that overall the mood of the CEOs is very positive, which considering that many naysayers have been discussing Indian economy in great detail – every positive news helps,” he said.

However, he added that the IT industry will not go unscathed by the coronavirus outbreak. “I do have a word of caution here – this whole coronavirus because it may impact the economy during the year and if it impacts the economy, I cannot say that IT can be isolated completely.

""To what extent and when is a very difficult question because we know that all the governments around the world are putting their might to contain the virus and to be able to fight the virus. Usually with kind of a might, one is very confident that it is just a matter of few more weeks and the virus would be contained and we do have an action plan.

“I have met a few customers who are saying that because this supply chain is getting disturbed both for internal consumption and for external exports, they would have to take shut downs of their plants. Economy is all about circulation and if the circulation stops, it will have an impact.

On the likely extent of the impact, Gurnani said: “My personal assessment is that the impact is going to be very short-term because it is a short-term break. It is, in a way, an accident which was totally unavoidable for any corporate. So I don’t think it is going to last more than a quarter. Lunar New Year of China anyways meant holidays. So I don’t think there will be any impact in the January-February-March quarter. If there is an impact, it will be the Q1 of the next financial year.""

IT player Tech Mahindra will release its December quarter numbers on January 31 in the wake of mixed earnings reported by major industry players such as TCS and Infosys.

December quarter is a seasonally weak quarter for IT players and brokerages are expecting a weak show from Tech Mahindra also.

Other than the quarterly numbers, the market will keenly observe Tech Mahindra's outlook for the communications segment, said brokerages.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects a tepid growth in both communication and enterprise with a partial AT&T deal impact on growth.

The estimates of the brokerage show a 4.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in the company's revenue to Rs 9,378.7 crore, but EBITDA may see a 13 percent YoY fall to Rs 1,502.6 crore against Rs 1,722.6 crore.

The EBITDA margin is also likely to slip to 16 percent in Q3FY20 against 19.3 percent, reported in Q3FY19. PAT, excluding BT amortisation and expression of interest (EOI) may see a 16.2 YoY fall to Rs 1,008 crore for Q3FY20, said Motilal Oswal.

On similar lines, Antique Stock Broking expects a 17 percent YoY decline in Tech Mahindra's net profit to the tune of Rs 1,010.9 crore, while EBITDA, too, is expected to see a 13 percent YoY fall to Rs 1,500.1 crore.

However, revenue can see a 5 percent YoY gain to Rs 9,414.5 crore and the brokerage sees a 2.2 percent growth in CC terms led by growth in both telecom verticals.

Kotak Securities has forecasted CC revenue growth rate of 2 percent on sequentially and 5 percent on YoY basis for Tech Mahindra.

Besides, the brokerage expects a 30 bps inorganic contribution to revenue growth from the acquisition of BORN Group.

""Revenue growth will be led entirely by communications vertical. All verticals in the enterprise segment will grow but will be offset by a decline in revenues from HCL,"" said Kotak.

""Revenues from AT&T contract are likely to be spread across December 2019 and March 2020 quarter as compared to our earlier expectation of entire revenue flowing through in the December 2019 quarter,"" it added.

The estimates of Kotak Securities show EBIT margin may decline 325 bps YoY despite the benefit of rupee depreciation on account of large rebadging and transition costs of AT&T deal, and one-off gain of 60 bps from the recovery of bad debt. Adjusted PAT may see a YoY fall of 22.7 percent to Rs 929.3 crore.

Leading international investors are planning to visit India in March-April and all of them are looking for stability and predictability in policy as well as judicial reforms, Tech Mahindra MD and CEO C P Gurnani said on Thursday. He added that India is an important destination for businesses where investors are getting decent returns.

""I was talking to a few leaders here and they are all visiting or are planning to visit India in March-April time frame. The only two request everybody has is stability and predictability of the policy and judicial reforms,"" Gurnani told PTI.

He expressed concern on recent statutory levies on the telecom sector and said that judicial reforms go hand in hand with ease of doing business.

In an about 12-year-old case on revenue sharing, the Supreme Court recently upheld the government's stand and broadened the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) for telecommunications companies to include non-core operations. The apex court ordered telecom companies to clear all pending AGR dues amounting to around Rs 1.47 lakh crore by January 23, 2020.

Vodafone Idea Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla announced in December that the company will shut shop if it does not get any support on payment of the AGR dues.

""There will always be some interpretation of law. Something which will go wrong, something which will go right. As long as there is justice on time, I think people will appreciate it,"" Gurnani said.

He said that global leaders at the World Economic Forum (WEF) here are talking about 5G technology which will transform businesses but the same is delayed in India.

""World over people are looking at 5G as an opportunity. US President Donald Trump had dinner with 35 people and even he wanted to talk about those 35 people about 5G. Nobody is discussing 5G for India. 5G is delayed in India, the world has started issuing spectrum licences for 5G. The rollout was supposed to start in 2020. Right now the telecom sector is itself stressed,"" he said.

The government has plans to conduct a spectrum auction in April-May which will also include airwaves for 5G services.

Tech Mahindra has signed an agreement with Business Finland for research and development in 5G and 6G technology.

Top five technology companies are expected to report sequential constant currency revenue growth of 0.8-2 percent each in the third quarter of financial year 2020, brokerages say.

The October-December quarter is seasonally weak for the IT companies due to furloughs and holidays in the US.

Appreciation of GBP against the US dollar is likely to be a cross-currency (CC) tailwind which ultimately may support dollar revenue growth that could be around 1-2.3 percent over previous quarter, according to brokerages.

""We expect moderation in revenue growth due to tepid growth in BFSI, retail & manufacturing verticals with higher furloughs & client-specific challenges for few companies,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher which sees tier-1 companies reporting sequential growth between 0.9 percent and 2 percent CC, and 0.5 percent and 3 percent CC in tier-2 in Q3FY20.

Sharekhan also expects top five Indian IT companies to deliver 0.8-2.1 percent QoQ CC revenue growth in Q3FY20.

""Unlike Q3FY19, appreciation of GBP against USD would create cross-currency tailwinds of 20-60 BPS on USD revenue growth, resulting in USD revenue growth of 1.1-2.3 percent QoQ, the brokerage said.

Brokerages expect top five IT companies' margin to be supported by rupee depreciation, but among them, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies are likely to report degrowth in margin QoQ.

""Though depreciation of rupee against USD and GBP would provide margin tailwind to companies on a QoQ basis, margins of HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra are expected to decline on a QoQ basis,"" Sharekhand said.

Edelweiss also said, barring Tech Mahindra and HCL, it expects margins of the other three to rise 40–65 bps QoQ as weak rupee (down 1 percent QoQ against the USD) and operational levers kick in.

Sustained momentum in digital and robust deal pipeline across verticals are likely to underpin strong management commentaries after Q3 earnings, the brokerage said.

Key things to watch out for would be increase in deal sizes & tenures in digital; demand commentary, specifically BFSI & retail; and commentary on the improving geopolitical scenario.

From an operational standpoint, many companies have been struggling to tame high attrition over the previous few quarters. This, along with commentary around onsite supply bottlenecks, will be the key areas of investor focus, Motilal Oswal said.

Most brokerages do not expect any material change in the current guidance of Infosys (9-10 percent CC revenue growth YoY for FY20) and HCL Technologies (15-17 percent YoY).

But they expect moderation in revenue growth in medium term due to US elections, lower tech spending by US and Europe in capital markets & banking sectors, waning impact of US tax reforms and margin headwind.

""We expect Brexit outcome to be negative for Indian IT companies, as when UK will leave EU there will be lot of uncertainties due to transition process which could further result in delay in decision making hurting the IT spending environment,"" Prabhudas Lilladher said.

Despite these headwinds, the demand environment remains healthy, which is evident from the large deal momentum, robust deal pipeline and acceleration in core transformation works by large global enterprises, said Sharekhan which expects operating profitability to remain under pressure owing to elevated attrition, higher onsite expenses, transition costs in large deals, and intense competition.

Nifty IT index gained 0.72 percent during the quarter ended December 2019, underperforming Nifty50 which rallied 6.05 percent in same period.

The underperformance of IT index was due to Infosys whistleblower issue, weak global macro set up, muted spending by US banks, muted performance from european geography, higher impact of furloughs and upcoming election in the US.

Most brokerage houses bet on three stocks - Infosys, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies, citing better revenue growth than peers and reasonable valuations.

""We believe companies with the right set of services and capabilities are well placed to capture the opportunities available in the market and are able to deliver growth in CY2020,"" Sharekhan said.

Global financial services company Credit Suisse expects the economic slowdown to continue in 2020.

Earnings may bounce back and investing in ""safe stocks"" should be the prefered strategy for next year, the brokerage said in a report, India Market Strategy, released last week.

“Market performance in CY20 thought would be affected by how FY22 EPS moves—we expect this too to settle at a low to mid-teens growth on the reduced FY21 base. We expect narrow market performance to continue for now, as economic uncertainty continues to push funds into the safe stocks,” said the note.

For 2020, Credit Suisse has shifted to a more concentrated 30-stock portfolio where they have tried to reduce concentration risk by being more overweight on SBI than HDFC Bank.

The global investment bank will stay overweight on financials, telecom, utilities and metals. Pharma and IT also received minor uptick. It has a ‘Market Weight’ on staples and Underweight on discretionary cement, and industrials.

Top 30 stocks in Credit Suisse portfolio include RIL, HDFC Ltd, TCS, HUL, ICICI Bank, ITC, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finance, SBI, Tech Mahindra, Coal India, Dabur, Lupin, Chola Finance, ICICI Prudential, and Motherson Sumi.

Credit Suisse also highlighted ""quality bubble"" which is likely to remain inflated for some more time till growth comes back.

The global investment bank in the report highlighted that foreign investors reacted to the weak economic activity levels. FPIs too have been focusing on the top 100 names, though that has been their focus generally.

Almost 76 percent of the FPI holdings are in the Nifty stocks, compared to 66 percent for the domestic institutional holdings. This ratio for DIIs was 56 percent a year back.

As a result, performance is becoming lopsided, driven primarily by a select few large and liquid stocks, with the majority of stocks being 20-30 percent below their all-time highs even though most indexes are close to lifetime highs.

“Till growth uncertainty continues (we expect for another six months), we expect this “quality bubble” to stay inflated and market concentration to remain high,” said the note.

Global brokerage house Morgan Stanley remained bullish on Tech Mahindra, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank as it expects these stocks could return 10-20 percent in next one year.

While having overweight call on largecap IT company Tech Mahindra with a target price of Rs 850 per share, the research house said the company was confident of improvement in deal pipeline for communications business.

Hence, Morgan Stanley expects FY20 revenue growth of the company at 6.7 percent and FY21 at 8-10 percent against 4.2 percent in FY19.

With improving margin, earnings growth could be even better, it said, adding valuation looks cheap at current levels. Tech Mahindra share price was quoting at Rs 780.15, up Rs 7.20, or 0.93 percent on the BSE at 1027 hours IST.

Morgan Stanley also has overweight rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank, the fourth largest lender by market capitalisation, with a target at Rs 1,900 per share as it believes share price will rise relative to the industry over the next 30 days.

After the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman confirmed hiking statutory FPI limit to sectoral foreign investment limit from April 1, 2020, the company is a likely candidate to be included in MSCI Index with 5.7 percent weight, the brokerage said.

On Monday, Morgan Stanley said it expected MSCI India's weight to rise about 70 bps when it would do semi-annual review in May 2020. According to the brokerage, the increase in India weightage will lead to a passive flow of $2.5 billion.

The global research firm also has overweight rating on IndusInd Bank on the back of strong capital and focus on granularising assets/deposits. ""We see pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) growth increasing further and return on equity at 17.5 percent in FY21.

It raised target price of the stock to Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,700, though market is concerned with corporate NPLs, which could drive stock in near term.

Kotak Mahindra Bank was quoting at Rs 1,714.65, up Rs 10.30, or 0.60 percent and IndusInd Bank was up 0.6 percent at Rs 1,502.10 at the time of publishing this copy.

Shares of Tech Mahindra opened with softer gains on December 17 even as most brokerages maintained their positive view on the stock a day after the analyst meet with Tech Mahindra's leadership.

In the analyst meet, Tech Mahindra reiterated its focus on the ‘three (main trends) – four (big bets) – three (objectives)’ strategy, said brokerages.

Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Tech Mahindra with a target price at Rs 850 per share and said that the valuation is cheap at the current levels.

The foreign financial firm highlighted that the company is confident of the improvement in the deal pipeline for the communications business.

""We expect FY20 revenue growth at 6.7 percent and FY21 at 8-10 percent against 4.2 percent in FY19. With improving margin, earnings growth could be even better,"" said Morgan Stanley.

Nomura has maintained a neutral call on Tech Mahindra with a target price of Rs 775 and underscored that large deals in the last 4-6 quarters have driven communications and enterprise revenue growth.

Nomura added that the company guides for high-single-digit revenue growth in FY21 and aspires to deliver FY21 EBIT margin, similar to FY19.

In a report on December 16, domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services said Tech Mahindra is likely to be a key beneficiary of BSS digitization and network services themes, given its competitive advantages and big bets in these areas.

Motilal Oswal added while currency, large deal transition costs and vertical headwinds have hurt the margins in FY20, delivery excellence, recouping transition costs and portfolio synergies may be the key margin tailwinds in FY21.

Moreover, as per the brokerage, the management of the company hinted at a meaningful improvement in employee engagement and a significant reduction in attrition over the last four months.

However, the management indicated that the normalised attrition levels of Tech Mahindra will be above the industry normal given the high share of BPO in the overall headcount (38 percent) and the higher attrition levels in this service line.

Motilal Oswal has a buy recommendation on Tech Mahindra with a target price of Rs 910.

""We keep our estimates unchanged for FY20 and FY21. The stock trades at 14 times one-year forward P/E, in line with its long-term average. Our target price implies a marginal re-rating to 15 times on the back of the decent near-term growth prospects despite slowing demand,"" said Motial Oswal.

As of December 16 close, the stock has gained 7 percent on BSE in the calendar year 2019 against an almost 14 percent gain of the benchmark Sensex.

Shares of Tech Mahindra traded 0.45 percent up at Rs 776.40 on BSE around 09:25 hours IST.

HDFC Securities' research report on Tech Mahindra

Revenue stood at USD 1,287mn (+3.2% QoQ, +4.1% CC), which was above our est. of USD 1,261mn.Growth was led by 5.6/2.0% QoQ CC growth in Enterprise and Telecom. Enterprise (59% of rev) was up 4.8% QoQ (highest in last eight qtrs) due to strong recovery in Hi-Tech (+10% QoQ), Retail (+14.7%) and Healthcare (+11.0%). Manufacturing (-4.2%, auto exposure) remains weak but will recover in 2H. Healthy Enterprise TCV of USD 490mn (highest ever) bolster confidence. Telecom growth was slightly lower than expectation but deal win and healthy pipeline provides growth visibility. Telecom registered the largest deal win (AT&T), TCV of USD 1bn, which will start contributing in 2HFY20. 5G also remains a potential growth driver. Digital (39% of rev, +39.7% YoY) remains the key strength while legacy was down 8.6% YoY in 2QFY20. The acquisition of Born group (Design agency) will further enhance capabilities. It has revenue of USD 50mn (+28% YoY) with 1,100 employees. The deal was valued at 1.7x and has rev/emp of USD 50K. EBIT margin improved 131bps QoQ to 12.8% (vs est. of 12.3%) led by efficiencies, lower SG&A (+100bps) and higher utilisation offset by wage hike (-40bps). 2H margin will remain subdued due to transition cost. Margin trajectory will improve in FY21E. High attrition of 21%, one of highest in the industry, is a concern.

Outlook

We upgrade Tech Mahindra to BUY from NEU based on strong show in 2QFY20. Growth engine has revived with large deal win in Telecom and strong Enterprise TCV. We increase earnings est. for FY21/22E by 3.9/4.3% based on better visibility and margin recov ery. We increase our P/E multiple to 15x vs. 12x earlier. Our TP now stands at Rs 850 based on 15x Sep-21E earnings.

ICICI Direct's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TechM) reported a healthy performance on all fronts. The key highlights for the quarter were constant currency revenue growth of 4.1% QoQ (better than ours and Street estimates), record deal wins (increased 3.1x QoQ to US$1.5 billion) and growth in digital revenues (11.8% QoQ, 37.4% YoY). Digital now contributes 39.0% of overall revenues. The revenue beat was driven by the better-than-expected performance in the enterprise segment, which grew 4.8% sequentially.



Outlook

Further, considering most margin headwinds being absorbed in FY20E, we believe FY21E could witness EBIT margin expansion to 14.3%. Hence, we maintain our BUY recommendation with a revised target price of Rs 900/share.

The index is still holding above 40,000 though weighed down by muted global cues, but the Nifty slipped below its crucial support at 11,900.

The hopes of a trade deal have fizzled out for now and with no big triggers lined up, investors should stay cautious in the near-term. The recent rally was led by good Q2 results and in expectation of more reforms.

“Q2 provided a hope that H2 will add more colour to earnings growth, which has been dull in the last five quarters. At the same time, expectation also build-up about likely government measure to provide more stimulus to the economy and equity market with changes in tax structure like income tax, LTCG & DDT,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, told Moneycontrol.

“No big event is expected next week other than Q2 results. The market has done well during the recent times, cautious may be required in the short-term.”

We have collated views and recommendations from various global brokerage firms on stocks post- September quarter results or general news flow:

Maruti Suzuki: Overweight| Target Rs 8,205

Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating on Maruti Suzuki with a target price of Rs 8,205, which translates to an upside of 11 percent from closing price of Rs 7,385 on November 5.

Suzuki's guidance tends to be lower than Maruti’s guidance. For FY17/18/19, Suzuki guided for 7%, 8% & 6% while Maruti saw double-digit growth, said the note. Going forward, with BS-VI change, volumes could get disrupted in the coming months.

There could be downside risks to estimates but would buy the stock if it corrects on weak Nov/Dec data as sales are at a multi-year low.

Titan Company: Downgrade to Sell| Target cut to Rs 1,025 from Rs 1,350 earlier

CLSA downgraded Titan Company to sell from underperform post- September quarter results and reduced its target price to Rs 1,025 from Rs 1,350 .

Infosys has rallied over 25 percent, so far, in 2019, supported by strong revenue, consistent deal winds and a fairly strong growth outlook. With a market capitalisation of Rs 3.6 lakh crore on the BSE, the IT giant remains a strong defensive player in a weakening demand environment, say experts.

The Bengaluru-headquartered company has been hitting fresh 52-week highs consistently in 2019. It did the same on September 6 at 847.40 on the BSE. Experts are in favour of remaining invested in the stock for a long term, but say that a mild profit booking could take place at higher levels as we approach September quarter results.

Kotak Institutional Equities maintained its add rating on Infosys and increased the target price to Rs 850 from Rs 775, though the outlook is still cautious.

The brokerage’s confidence on growth emanates from the large deal ramp-up and an improved positioning in clients/verticals, thanks to accelerated investments in FY2019.

“Efficiency drive will lead to margin in 21-23% band without baking in the recent INR depreciation. Attrition at the senior management level is under control. We bake in revised currency rates of KIE economist resulting in 2-4% increase in FY2020-22 EPS,” the brokerage said in a report.

The software services provider’s June quarter profits fell 6.8 percent sequentially but raised its full-year constant currency revenue guidance to 8.5-10 percent.

The company increased its FY20 revenue growth guidance range to 8.5-10 percent in constant currency from 7.5-9.5 percent earlier and maintained operating margin guidance range of 21-23 percent.

Recent interaction with brokerage firms suggests that the management is confident of achieving 8.5-10% c/c revenue growth guidance for FY2020E

UBS also maintained buy rating on Infosys, with a target price of Rs 850.

The global investment bank sees higher FY20 revenue visibility.

The margin improvement is likely to help the outperformance. The demand trends have softened for the sector, but Infosys remains a strong defensive in a weakening demand environment.

The CNX IT index has moved up by around 3 percent in the last one year and outperformed the Nifty by 9 percent in the same period.

The steady performance was led by a stable demand environment, strong deal wins and the rising share of the digital segment.

“TCS continues to trade at a premium valuation on account of its strong business model and superior execution capabilities. HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra are trading significant discount to large peers due to certain challenges in their business models,” Sharekhan said in a report.

“We believe margins would remain under pressure, the rupee depreciation could be a wild card from margin tailwind. We prefer HCL Tech, and Infosys and Tech Mahindra among largecaps,” the report added.

Technical outlook

After consolidating in a broader range of Rs 760-800 levels, the stock gave a fresh breakout above the key resistance level of Rs 800 last week along with marginally higher volumes.

“The breakout has been observed above the ascending triangle formation, which is generally traded as bullish pattern,” Shitij Gandhi, Senior Research Analyst, SMC Global Securities Ltd, told Moneycontrol.

“Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 810-815 levels for the upside target of Rs 859 levels, with a stop loss below Rs 780.”

Indian markets remained volatile on September 4 after a selloff in the previous session.

The Sensex broke below 37,000 on September 3, its worst fall of the year in percentage terms. In terms of sectors, the S&P BSE Telecom index was the top gainer, followed by banks, metals, and public sector stocks. On the other hand, auto, consumer, and healthcare stocks remained under pressure.

A list of stocks that were in focus on September 3 because of their price action. The technical outlook is limited to near and medium-term:

Analyst: Romesh Tiwari, Head of Research, CapitalAim

TVS Motor: Contra buy at current levels with a target of Rs 390-400

TVS Motor Company reported a fall of 15.3 percent in August sales on a year-on-year basis. It registered sales of 290,455 units, a 15.3 percent decline from the 343,217 vehicles it sold in the same month in 2018.

However, the August figure show a minor uptick from the 279,465 units the company sold in the previous month.

The stock is beaten down badly along with other auto stocks for quite some time. It showed a bounce back after hitting a 52-week low of Rs 340.30 but on the daily chart, it is still indicating weakness with negative MACD and RSI(14) at 42.92.

There are some signs of a decrease in volatility, and hopes of a positive festive season, I will advise a contra play on this stock for the medium term. TVS Motor can be bought on dips for a target of Rs 390-400, with a stop loss of Rs 348 for a medium term.

Tata Motors: Buy on dips with a target of Rs 125

Tata Motors reported a 58 percent decline in domestic passenger vehicle sales in August. The company sold 7,316 units against 17,351 vehicles in the same month in 2018, the automaker said in a statement.

The stock has been in the bear grip for months now and it touched a multi-year low on August 22 at Rs 106. The recovery from Rs 106 level will need some consolidation in the range of Rs 110-125 for at least a couple of weeks.

A breach of this range on either side will strengthen the directional move. On the daily chart, it is still weak, but on weekly charts, it is trading in the oversold zone.

I would suggest a buy, better when it drops around Rs 106-108, with a target of Rs 125 in the short term, with a stop loss of Rs 100 in a month’s time.

Tata Steel: Sell on rallies; next target on downside seen at Rs 305

Tata Steel witnessed selling pressure on September 3 after it announced the closure of a plant in the southern Welsh city of Newport, with a potential loss of around 400 jobs at the UK site.

We have seen a steep fall since the beginning of July and still there are no signs of stability in the stock. Though the stock is weak but in oversold zone on the weekly chart (RSI (14) at 20.245 and ROC -31.681) and hence there may be some pause in the downslide, the scope of recovery is low for the stock.

On the daily chart also, it is looking weak with RSI(14) placed at 32.915I and negative MACD. I will advise to go short on any bounce with a stop loss of Rs 352, and a target of Rs 305.

Tech Mahindra: A conditional buy after a dip towards Rs 640 & a target of Rs 750

IT companies will get the upside of falling rupee at a time when most of the other sectors are heading south. Investors and traders are looking at stocks such as Tech Mahindra, Infosys for good returns for the next couple of quarters.

The stock is trading above its 30 and 50-day moving averages and has good support around Rs 650 levels. On the daily chart, RSI(14) at 61.78 and positive MACD and ROC is indicating that the stock can move further upwards and test its 100 DMA placed around 727.

But, given the negative sentiment in the general market, I will advise a buy only if it dips near its support around Rs 640, with a stop loss of Rs 600, and a target of 750 in medium-term.

HDFC AMC: Avoid putting fresh capital in the stock

In the last couple of weeks the stock has seen a steep rise from the level of Rs 2,138 and the momentum is still high, with RSI(14) at 75.80 and ROC at 19.13 on the daily chart.

Those who are holding the stock should enjoy the ride and keep trailing stop losses but I would not advice new traders to enter at these levels. With this momentum, the stock may touch Rs 2,950 in the short-term with support levels around Rs 2,300-2,370.

ICICI Bank: Use sell on rise strategy above Rs 400

The stock is near its support level around Rs 390 and can fall further to Rs 340 levels in the short-term. On the daily chart, the stock is weak and I will suggest investors to sell on rise above Rs 400 for a short-term target of Rs 340, and a stop loss of Rs 421.

Tech Mahindra shares fell nearly 5 percent intraday to hit a 15-month low on July 31, as global brokerages cut price target after weak set of earnings in June quarter.

The stock has already lost 27 percent in last three months, hitting Rs 609.30, the lowest level since April 4, 2018. It was quoting at Rs 620, down Rs 20.30, or 3.17 percent, on the BSE at 1014 hours .

The IT company's profit fell 15.3 percent sequentially to Rs 959 crore despite higher other income, impacted by subdued revenue and operating income.

Dollar revenue grew by 1.6 percent and revenue in constant currency slipped around a percent compared to previous quarter. At operating level, earnings before interest and tax fell sharply by 27 percent and margin contracted by 390 bps QoQ due to wage hikes, visa cost, rupee appreciation, and deal transition costs.

After the company's dismal performance in Q1 , brokerages slashed price target but remained positive on the stock on hope of recovery in the second half of FY20 and sharp correction in the past.

""Company's Q1 revenue & margin missed estimates, but deal wins were strong with soft margin outlook. Deal wins should translate to a growth recovery over Q2-Q4 FY20 but margin resilience is likely to be tested more. Company faced supply challenges, transition costs and initial digital margin deflation,"" said CLSA, which cut its revenue estimates by 1-3 percent & margin by 170-230 for FY20-22, as a result of which it slashed EPS estimates by 6-10 percent for FY20-22.

The brokerage retained outperform call on the stock but cut price target to Rs 740 from Rs 800 .

Here is what brokerages say about stock and earnings:

Brokerage: Citi | Rating: Neutral | Target: Cut to Rs 705

It was a weak quarter with communication & enterprise revenues declining QoQ, but deal wins were decent at $475 million for the quarter.

Management commentary remained optimistic and Citi expects a strong second half of FY20, but correlation between deals & growth across industry needs to be monitored.

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Cut to Rs 730

Credit Suisse maintained outperform call on the stock but slashed price target sharply to Rs 730 from Rs 910, as Q1 was a weak quarter for margin, but telecom & deal wins were steady.

The brokerage is surprised by the weak margin and poor show of the non-telecom business. It incorporated the miss this quarter leading to 9-11 percent EPS estimates cut and reduced valuation multiple to 14x from 16x.

Brokerage: BNP Paribas | Rating: Buy | Target: Cut to Rs 760

BNP Paribas remained bullish on the stock, maintaining buy call but cut price target to Rs 760 from Rs 820 after slashing FY20-22 earnings estimates by 6 to percent on lower margin confidence.

The management largely retained its FY20 revenue outlook and significant portion of the margin drop can be recouped through FY20.

Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Cut to Rs 765

Morgan Stanley has an overweight call on the stock, but slashed price target to Rs 765 from Rs 850 per share.

Q1 revenue was in-line but margin is below estimates. Robust deal pipeline gave company confidence for improved growth trajectory.

The brokerage cut its FY20, FY21 & FY22 EPS estimates by 5 percent, 4 percent and 4 percent, respectively.

Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Outperform | Target: Cut to Rs 740

Company's Q1 revenue & margin missed estimates, but deal wins were strong with soft margin outlook.

Deal wins should translate to a growth recovery over Q2-Q4 FY20 but margin resilience is likely to be tested .

Company faced supply challenges, transition costs and initial digital margin deflation. Hence, CLSA cut its revenue estimates by 1-3 percent and margin by 170-230 for FY20-22, as a result it slashed EPS estimates by 6-10 percent for FY20-22.

Following the recent correction, it is inexpensive at 12x FY21 expected PE.

Software services company Tech Mahindra is expected to report more than 15 percent sequential decline in profitability and one percent fall QoQ in dollar revenue for the quarter ended June 2019, according to brokerages.

The delay in deal ramp up in enterprise business, the slowdown in telecom growth and seasonality in Comviva business may hit topline growth.

""We expect dollar revenues to decline 1 percent QoQ to $1,255 million on the back of a delay in the deal ramp up in the enterprise and Comviva seasonality. Rupee revenues may de-grow 1.9 percent QoQ to Rs 8,725 crore,"" said ICICI direct which expects profit to fall 18.2 percent sequentially.

Prabhudas Lilladher also sees dollar revenue falling 1 percent QoQ and constant currency revenue declining 0.7 percent QoQ. ""We have built a revenue decline of 3.5 percent QoQ in dollar terms in the communication segment due to Comviva seasonality and flat growth 0.7 percent QoQ in dollar terms in enterprise vertical.""

According to Lilladher, profit is likely to fall 17 percent QoQ.

At operating level, Tech Mahindra's earnings before interest and tax margin may contract in triple-digit sequentially due to a wage hike, visa cost and currency headwind.

Kotak expects sequential EBIT margin decline of 250 bps contributed by -- (1) 100 bps impact from wage revision, (2) higher visa applications, (3) Rupee appreciation and (4) seasonal impact of lower Comviva revenues.

The brokerage further expects robust new deal signings with good spread across enterprise and telecom segments.

Key issues to watch out for would be commentary on 5G and related impact on company's communications vertical, outlook for BFSI, health of enterprise business especially in the manufacturing vertical where the company has high exposure to the auto sector, deal wins on the back of two quarters of above-average total contract value, and proportion of wins in the enterprise segment.

ICICI Direct's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TechM) reported a below expected performance on the operational front. The subdued performance in Q4FY19 revenues was mainly due to a decline in enterprise segment (led by seasonality in retail, cut down of less profitable projects, revenue pressure in healthcare and lower growth in financial segment). Further, EBITDA margins declined 80 bps QoQ mainly led by rupee impact and one off provisions of 30-40 bps. Adjusted for one offs, EBITDA margins were at 18.7% (still below our estimate of 19.0%).

Outlook

Improving growth trajectory in communication and healthy deal pipeline are key positives. However, slower growth in enterprise revenues, absence of currency benefit and higher wage hike compared to prior year are expected to keep revenues and margins under check in the near term. Further, trade war uncertainty could play spoilsport for communication growth (not factored in our estimates). Hence, we revise our rating to HOLD with a revised target price of Rs 845/share (~15x FY21E EPS).

Dolat Capital's research report on Tech Mahindra

TECHM reported muted Q4FY19 results, which were largely in line with our estimates. The company’s communication business grew in Q4FY19, but fell 1% YoY in USD terms in FY19. This was below the management’s guidance of a low single digit growth. The management is confident of total revenue growth in FY20, but expects the communication business to contribute the bulk of the rise. TECHM should report a USD revenue growth of 8.5%/9.5% in FY20E/FY21E, as we believe healthy deal wins will raise revenue and lower volatility in the enterprise business. We expect TECHM to report a margins decline of 100bps in FY20E, as wage hikes, visa costs, and seasonality in Comviva are likely to impact margins in Q1FY20. We downgrade our earnings 4.8%/9.2% for FY20E/FY21E, as we factor in volatility in the enterprise business, lower margins, and a change in our USD/INR assumption to ` 70 (vs ` 74/` 76 for FY20E/FY21E earlier).

Outlook

We downgrade TECHM to ACCUMULATE, with a TP of ` 880 based on 15x one-year fwd. PER.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Tech Mahindra

We hosted Manoj Bhat, CFO of Tech Mahindra, in Mumbai where he shed some light on the industry environment and TECHM's outlook and strategic approach. Key highlights: Telecom is back on the growth trajectory due to multiple broad- based services deals. Action on the 5G rollout front - not as significant currently - is expected to accelerate CY20 onwards; lest there is positive disruption driven by some Service providers. Enterprise had a muted exit due to a couple of Healthcare deals spilling over into 1HFY20. This, combined with some near-term slowdown in Automotives (on weak macros) poses a challenge to mathematically achieving industry growth. Funnel of deals remain strong and conversions in 1HFY20 should improve the outlook. BPS has strong profitability and disproportionate growth is not a drag on margins. In recent quarters, even growth has turned around, and should remain high in FY20 as well. Margins are expected to remain at similar levels; operational efficiency and subsidiary profitability will help offset headwinds from wage hikes.

Outlook

Our TP of INR900 discounts forward earnings by 15x. Maintain Buy.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech M had an impressive FY19 with EBITDA margins expanding by ~290bps YoY, strong TCV growth of 43% YoY to US$400mn in Q4FY19. Digital services grew 41% YoY and stands at 31% of the total revenues in FY19. Overall, Tech M has impressed us with broad-based growth, margin expansion & impressive free cash generation in FY19. EBITDA margins were 12.7% in Q1FY18 and have expanded to 18.4% in Q4FY19 which have also helped the stock to get double from that period. We believe expansion in the margins will be muted in coming quarters due to elevated attrition levels, supply side constraints, visa constraints & large transition cost which led to our margin cut by ~50-60bps in FY20E/21E. We believe Tech M margins should be in the range of ~18% in FY20E & FY21E. Even though margin expansion theme has played out, we believe inexpensive valuations (13.7X FY21E earnings) & 5G opportunity theme keeps us constructive. We expect 8.2% revenue CAGR & 8.0% EPS CAGR from FY19-FY21E respectively and value Tech M at 15X FY21E March earnings to arrive at a changed target price of Rs.847 (earlier Rs. 886).

Outlook

Tech M is currently trading at 14.8X/13.7X FY20E/21E earnings at an EPS of Rs.52.3/Rs.56.5 FY20E/21E respectively. Maintain Buy.

Tech Mahindra is betting on communication segment to drive growth in FY20, on the back of deal wins and increasing spending by telecom providers, said Manoj Bhat, Chief Financial Officer, Tech Mahindra.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Bhat said, “What we are seeing is a revival in spending in telecom backed by deal wins across the board from the US to New Zealand.”

“If you look at that trend, this is a trend which ceased. From 2015 onwards there has been a bit of a slowdown in that vertical. To me, that is a very positive sign. Hoping that that kind of momentum would continue going to next year,” he added.

Communications is the largest revenue generator for Tech Mahindra.

The company reported a 13.1 percent increase in its FY19 consolidated net profit at Rs 4,298 crore. Its revenue rose 12.9 percent to Rs 34,742 crore in the year ended March 2019, from Rs 30,772 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

However, the communications vertical saw a dip in revenue in FY19. For the year ended March 2019, the sector revenue accounted for about 41.2 percent of the total revenue as opposed to 43.3 percent in FY18.

Bhat said that while communication de-grew annually, the company saw healthy growth in the last three quarters. “But if I really look at the quarterly trend, Q1 was a dip, Q2, Q3 and Q4 saw compounded growth rate averaging about 4 percent,” he added.

Bhat attributed this to the dip in spending by the telecom sector in the last 2-3 years and consolidation the sector witnessed.

“I think we are just emerging out of that phase and into a new phase where spends increasing and people are spending money on digital transformation and moving to cloud very aggressively,” Bhat said.

Bhat said, “To me, that is a very positive sign and we are hoping that this momentum would continue next year as well.”

Apart from communications, the company is looking at strong growth from enterprises business as well. Bhat said, the enterprise segment will be on a growth track in FY20 due to increased spending by manufacturers on factory automation, implementation of IoT-based solutions, modernising factory floors and warehousing and logistics.

In terms of geographies, India is a big focus area for the company. Bhat said, “For us, India is the focus market and has been doing extremely well. If you look at constant currency India grew about 20 percent last fiscal.”

Americas account for about 47.2 percent followed by Europe at 29.3 percent and rest of the world at 23.5 percent. The company did not report India-specific revenue figures.

In India, the company works on projects including e-governance, smart city projects, modernisation of the private sector in India including banks and defence modernisation.

The company recently signed a Rs 300 crore defence contract. As part of the 'Armed Forces Secure Access Card' (AFSAC) Project, the company will implement RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) based access control system across all naval bases and ships.

Talking about the deal, Bhat said, “It is a combination of our abilities and some of our latest technologies like RFID tracking and security, making sure that the whole network is secure creating almost identity management system using this technology.”

Going forward, Bhat said defence modernisation is a big focus area for Tech Mahindra. “There is a market that is only growing in size and that is something which is good for the country. From our perspective, we are positioning ourselves to the preferred provider for some of these areas we are focusing on,” he added",607,0.663632740577062

Most brokerage firms maintained their rating on Tech Mahindra after the IT major reported 8.8 percent fall in its fourth quarter consolidated net profit at Rs 1,126.6 crore against Rs 1,230.8 in the quarter ended December 2018.

The figure above includes profit attributable to shareholders of the company and non-controlling interests.

Operating revenue of the company was up at Rs 8,892.3 crore from Rs 8,054.5 crore from a year-ago period.

The company's dollar revenue stood at $1,267.5 million in Q4FY19. The dollar profit of the company slumped 13.7 percent YoY to $162.3 million.

Here’s what global brokerage firms recommend on Tech Mahindra post Q4 results:

Credit Suisse: Outperform| Target cut to Rs 910 from Rs 950 earlier

Credit Suisse maintained its outperform rating on Tech Mahindra but slashed its target price to Rs 910 from Rs 950 earlier.

The results were a mixed bag although the telecom business looked good, it said. The global investment bank does not expect any immediate impact from the Huawei ban.

Credit Suisse slashed its EPS estimate by 3 percent. The management expects to hold margins steady in FY20, as the headline numbers were a tad weak, and the profit is 5 percent below estimates.

CLSA: Outperform| Target: Rs 810

CLSA maintained its outperform call on Tech Mahindra with a target price of Rs 810. The telecom segment grew for the third consecutive quarter but the decline in margins was largely driven by FX headwinds.

The telecom segment has improved and CLSA expects it to be a prime mover in FY20. The global investment bank slashed revenue estimate by 0.5 percent, raising margin by 50 bps. It slashed EPS estimate for FY20-21 by 0.5-1 percent.

Jefferies: Buy| Target: Rs 880

Jefferies maintained its buy rating on Tech Mahindra with a target price of Rs 880.

The growth rate disappointed but FY20 guidance suggests that the risk-reward is favourable. The global investment bank slashed estimates for FY20-21 slightly to reflect the lower revenue base.

The stock trades at 14/12x FY20/21 P/E, assuming stable margin and revenue growth of 7.5/9 percent. Tech Mahindra offers good risk-reward at current levels.

The Department of Telecomm need to commence the auction of 5G spectrum in India as the regulators in some countries have already formulated policies and initiated spectrum auctions for the 5G roll out in their respective nations, a senior official of the IT giant Tech Mahindra has said.

Manish Vyas, President of Communications Business and Chief Executive Officer of Network Services, Tech Mahindra said 4G is yet to touch all parts of the country, and while that happens on a massive scale, there are some ""definite green-shoots"" of 5G trials.

More than technology however, the bigger impediment could be the regulatory body's policy on 5G spectrum. The experimental license by DoT will need modifications, and till that happens, the sector is in for a ""waiting game,"" he said.

""US, Australia, Italy, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia and more (have started 5G spectrum auctions). Spectrum is the life blood of any wireless network. For 5G, globally regulators have been licensing mid-band (3.5GHz) and in some countries mmWave (millimeter Wave) spectrum bands as well.

For 5G to be rolled out in India, the first necessary step is for the regulator to auction the 5G spectrum. Everything else will be gated on spectrum,"" he told PTI in an email. India's largest telecom operator Vodafone Idea Ltd recently said the auction of 5G spectrum should not be held before 2020 as the industry needs time to develop India-specific use cases for the next-generation technology.

A DoT official in December last year said the government expects to complete processes for 5G spectrum auction by August, 2019. TechM established a strategic partnership with Intel on a wide range of topics spanning across Virtualisation of RAN ( radio access network) , Cloud native 5G Core and on Edge Computing, Vyas said.

""Intel brings best in class technology for 5G infrastructure and will form the foundation of 5G networks. We are collaborating with Intel to maximise the benefits of their technology for 5G networks and we are also working on developing 5G use cases for specific industry verticals in the CoE,"" he said.

Though Tech Mahindra is currently not working any Indian telecomm operator on 5G,it is engaged in detailed Boardroom discussions with all top Telcos in the nation.

The IT firm is working with many Telcos across North America, UK, Germany, Asia-pacific Australia New Zealand and North Asia regions on 5G launch and digitalisation programs, he explained.",400,0.03447002172470093

Tech Mahindra is expected to report a fall in its Q4 profits, according to the brokerages and research firms tracking the company.

The IT major is expected to come out with its March quarter earnings on May 21.

Prabhudas Lilladher expects Tech Mahindra to report a net profit of Rs. 1.078.5 crore down 10.3 percent quarter-on-quarter (down 11.7 percent year-on-year). Net Sales are expected to increase 11 percent Y-o-Y to Rs 8,939.2 crore.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are likely to fall by 1.5 percent Q-o-Q (up 20.2 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs. 1,697 crore.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects Tech Mahindra to report a net profit of Rs. 1,134.3 crore down 5.7 percent quarter-on-quarter (up 20.3 percent year-on year). Net Sales are expected to increase by 0.6 percent Q-o-Q (up 15.7 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs. 8,997.2 crore while EBITDA are likely to fall by 0.1 percent Q-o-Q (up 36 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs. 1,720.5 crore.

Centrum Broking Research expects Tech Mahindra to deliver a modest CC revenue growth of 1 percent QoQ in Q4FY19. The telecom vertical is likely to remain on the growth path, led by a ramp-up of the recent deal wins. However, it feels that the vertical is likely to remain flat QoQ in Q4FY19.

Cross currency would be a tailwind of 20bps for the quarter. Hence, the reported USD revenue growth could be 1.2 percent QoQ. Centrum expects Tech Mahindra’s Q4FY19 EBITDA margin at 19 percent, down 30bps QoQ, led by rupee appreciation.

It expects Tech Mahindra to deliver a 4.4 percent and 7.9 percent USD revenue growth for FY19E and FY20E respectively. The organic revenue growth for FY19E would be 3.7 percent and the rest owing to acquisitions. The company is likely to show a turnaround in the overall revenue growth trajectory in FY20E, led by a revival in Telecom vertical.

Profit after Tax is likely to fall 4.8 percent QoQ (down 6.2 percent YoY) at Rs 8,999.5 crore, the Centrum report said.

According to Narnolia Financial Advisors, Tech Mahindra may report Rs 1,190 crore of profit, down 3 percent QoQ. The IT firm is expected to post strong growth of 3.3 percent QoQ in USD term led by turnaround in telecom, robust deal wins ramping up (USD 440 million wins in 3QFY19) and continued growth in enterprise segment.

The communication segment is expected to post a strong growth again in 4QFY19 led by ramping up of large wins (USD 240 won in 3QFY19) and a continuous growth in deal win in digital transformation work.

Margins are expected to be muted in 4QFY19 (slight decline of 20bps QoQ) mainly impacted by currency headwind and onsite/offshore impact. However, some parts will be mitigated by levers like improvement in business mix, increase in digital share and continued improvement in telecom space, the report said.

Nifty snapped 9-day losing streak on May 14 and reclaimed 11,200. However, for bulls to regain control, the index has to close above 11,250-11,300 convincingly else selling pressure could continue.

The final tally – the S&P BSE Sensex rose 227 points to 37,318 while the Nifty closed 73 points higher at 11,222.

“On the higher side, 11,280-11,300 indeed proved to be a key resistance zone for the day. If the bulls manage to take out that hurdle then 11,370-11,400 shall act as a subsequent barrier,” Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.

“Nevertheless, the overall trend for the index continues to be down. Once the bounce is over, the Nifty can head lower towards the medium term rising trendline drawn from the October low, which is near 11,000,” he said.

We have collated technical outlook on five stocks which saw wild swings in intraday day trade:

Analyst: Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.

Vodafone Idea: Stock fell post Q4 results| Use pullback to exit

The stock is in a bearish trend for over three years now making lower tops and lower bottoms. There has been some sideways movement, but the overall momentum has been in the favour of the bears.

Failure to take out previous swing highs, lower tops and lower bottoms, minor pullbacks are some indication that bears are aggressively riding it.

Technically, there may be some pullbacks but those eventually end up trapping biases of investors. We believe this stock may remain in a negative trend and any pullback is an opportunity to exit.

Also, this sector has been underperforming since the last few quarters as the weakness continue to haunt telecom as space. This is an avoid/sell the stock.

HDFC: Buy on dips post Q4 for your long-term portfolio

This is one of the stocks that is a must in any investor or trader’s long-term portfolio. It has been in its secular uptrend since 2009, post the fall of 2008.

Though in last few quarters we are seeing sideways consolidation in stock as it is oscillating in the range and capped at Rs 2,100.

Trend indicators are also pointing towards sideways trading. The stock should be accumulated on any dips and correction towards Rs 1,800 as there is an uptrend channel formation.

The stock could retest higher targets of Rs 2,200. Hence once should continue to hold or buy on dips.

Tech Mahindra: IT stocks remained under pressure| Down over 3 percent

Tech Mahindra is in an overall uptrend and may continue to remain strong. The stock has recently breached its previous all-time high placed at Rs 748 to mark a new all-time high.

Since prices are in the unchartered territory, we believe the trend may remain in place with Rs 748 being the point of inflection.

There is also a positive (golden) cross on a higher timeframe which will now attract smart money on any dips. Hence, any correction from Rs 750 is an opportunity to enter into the bullish trend for a target of Rs 900. It is a hold/ buy on dips stock.

Bajaj Auto Ltd: Sell on rallies as long as it trades below Rs 3,150

The stock has broken out from a long term upward channel that prices were trending since 2009. The overall pattern of stock now looks weaker since the stock is seeing a change of character.

We believe it may face stiff resistance around Rs 3,110-3,150. Further, a break below Rs 2,800 would confirm its correction and the stock may slip to Rs 2,450. We believe as far as stock is below Rs 3,150, it is a sell on advances.

Bajaj Finance Ltd: Use dips to buy this blue chip stock

It was one of the outperformers that clearly witnessed smart money flowing in on dips in the last 3-4 years of its bullish run.

Though, in this stock, one should be looking for dips rather than buying at random points. It has recovered from the last three major corrections.

The stock is well supported by long-term support line that now comes at Rs 2,550–2,600. Hence, any correction in stock towards these levels should be utilized to buy. At present we believe the stock is expensive.

Cognizant forecast 2019 revenue growth in the range of 3.6 percent and 5.1 percent in constant currency terms, compared with between 7 percent and 9 percent earlier.

Chief Financial Officer Karen McLoughlin said the company was seeing some cautiousness in the banking sector around levels of spending in the second half of the year.

The company's reliance on the financial services sector has been weighing on its overall revenue growth in the past few quarters.

Revenue in its financial services unit fell 1.7 percent to $1.44 billion in the first quarter, while healthcare services revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $1.17 billion but missed the $1.20 billion forecast by three analysts polled by Refinitiv.

After many weeks of consolidation, IT index has finally given a breakout from Cup & Handle technical formation. Cup & Handle breakout is considered as a bullish momentum continuation pattern. Upside targets of this breakout are 17,500-18,500-20,500 in coming months. IT index has tradable future and traders can take advantage of that instrument.

IT stocks tend to perform better when there is increased volatility in the market as they are considered as a safe haven in volatile times. On May 23, the Lok Sabha election result is scheduled and this will lead to increased volatility for next one month. This is one of the reasons for bullishness in IT stocks.

Historically, IT index has given a superior return in six months after the election outcome. As evident in the graph below, the IT index has given 43.8 percent, 91.3 percent and 29 percent returns in 2004, 2009 and 2014, respectively. Returns are calculated from May 1 to November 30 in the respective years.

Another factor that will support the IT stocks is the dollar strength. As shown below in the image, USDINR is bouncing back from the cluster of the support area. 68.30 is the zone traders should watch out for. If the currency does not violate this area then we can expect a sharp pullback in USDINR. on the other hand, 70.3 is the breakout level and once it crosses this level, we can expect it to reach 72-74 zone in the coming weeks. If that were to happen then it will be a big supporting factor for the IT stocks.

Both these factors will help IT stocks outperform in coming months but which stock will lead the rally is the money-making question. Both TCS and Infosys hold 27 percent each in the index weight and they are likely to take leadership alternatively to help index inch up.

Though we believe both stocks are poised for the upside, there are other stocks from the IT sector that can give better returns. Tech Mahindra, Wipro and Mindtree are our three top picks from the sector.

Tech Mahindra: Buy | Target: Rs 1,030 | Stop loss: Rs 730 | Upside: 25 percent

After breaking out from consolidation phase stock has rallied from Rs 725 to Rs 840. After this upside, the stock has corrected to retrace 50 percent of the rally. Now again stock has resumed the upside rally and heading towards Rs 925-1,030 in coming weeks. Investors should accumulate between Rs 800-830 and keep a stop loss of Rs 750.

Wipro: Buy | Target: Rs 350 | Stop loss: Rs 250 | Upside: 18 percent

After the throwback towards the breakout level, which was also a retracement support area, the stock has rallied sharply and is heading towards new highs. Investors should accumulate between Rs 285-300 and expect upside till Rs 325-350 while Rs 250 should be kept as a stop loss.

Mindtree: Buy | Target Rs 1200 | Stop loss: Rs 940 | Upside: 20 percent

The stock is in accumulation phase for last many weeks and it is on the verge of the breakout from the resistance level. Rs 1,000 is the polarity level and has acted as strong resistance in the past. Once the stock closes above Rs 1,000, it is a strong buy.

Traders can buy above Rs 1,000 and expect upside till Rs 1,100-1,200. Once it breaks out from this level, Rs 940 should be kept as a stop loss.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects strong growth from Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies and muted growth from Wipro and Tech Mahindra for the fourth quarter.

""We expect constant currency revenue growth rate at 1.8-2.5 percent for Infosys, TCS and HCL Tech. On YoY comparison, revenue growth will be robust 10.8-13.8 percent for the three companies,"" Kotak said in a note.

According to the report, growth in the IT sector will be led by the increasing number of large deals won by companies over the past two quarters.

Tech Mahindra may report muted numbers due to seasonal weakness in retail and a slower manufacturing vertical. Meanwhile, Wipro will likely report a modest 1.5 percent sequential revenue growth.

The report further noted that despite currency depreciation, Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro will report marginal sequential decline in EBIT margin.

""Sequentially, EBIT margin will decline marginally due to 1.9 percent appreciation of the INR against USD and talent constraint-led increase in cost structure in the US. Profitability performance will be a key focus area.""

For FY20, the revenue growth guidance for Infosys is expected to be 8-10 percent, while HCL Tech has growth guidance outlook of 14-16 percent, including IBM’s product business acquisition, assuming it gets consolidated from July 2019.

The report also cautioned that sedated spending growth in FY20 will offset the benefit from a strong deal flow and increasing digital sizes in the IT sector.

Even as share buybacks are getting a bipartisan pounding in the US Congress, where critics have argued that such buybacks are bad for the overall economy, there is enough research to show that corporate profits grow fastest when companies give more money back to shareholders, not less.

Only last week, here in India, the board of India's fifth largest IT company Tech Mahindra approved a share buyback for a total sum not exceeding 1,956 crore rupees at a price of 950 rupees per share. This constitutes about 2.1% of the total paid-up equity capital of the company. The 6th of March is fixed as the record date for the purpose of ascertaining the eligibility of shareholders to participate in this buyback. The news of the announcement was welcomed by the Street. Shares of Tech Mahindra hit a 52-week high of 840 rupees, gaining about 3.5%.

The questions we are addressing on our explainer today are - what are share buybacks? Are they a good idea for the company or the shareholder? Why is there a new resistance to them in the US? And what does this buyback mean for Tech Mahindra. These issues addressed on this episode of Pick of the Day with me Rakesh Sharma on Moneycontrol.

What is a share buyback?

As we know, last year, boards of many IT firms including TCS, HCL Technologies and Mphasis approved proposals to buy back shares. TCS announced buybacks worth 16000 crore rupees and HCL 40000 crore worth of share buybacks. Seven weeks into 2019, two dozen companies led by technology major Infosys (8,260 crore rupees) have announced or completed plans to buy 17,050 crore rupees worth of their own stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The latest to join the list is Tech Mahindra.

For the uninitiated among us, what is a share buyback proposal? And why do companies do it?

Investopedia describes share buyback thus:

Stock buybacks refer to the repurchasing of shares of stock by the company that issued them. A buyback occurs when the issuing company pays shareholders the market value per share and re-absorbs that portion of its ownership that was previously distributed among public and private investors. With stock buybacks, aka share buybacks, the company can purchase the stock on the open market or from its shareholders directly. In recent decades, share buybacks have overtaken dividends as a preferred way to return cash to shareholders. Though smaller companies may choose to exercise buybacks, blue-chip companies are much more likely to do so because of the cost involved.

Why would companies do this? There are plenty of reasons. One of the most common reasons cited is ownership consolidation. Let’s say there is a company with one owner and 10,000 shareholders. It effectively means that the company has 10,001 owners. Why do companies issue shares? To raise equity capital to fund expansion. But when a company gets to a point where there are few expansion opportunities in sight, it essentially means holding on to all that equity funding that is not even being used, and sharing ownership for no good reason. Let’s also not forget that shareholders expect dividends which is a cost of equity, meaning the business is paying for the privilege of accessing funds that it is not even using. As Investopedia cited, “Buying back some or all of the outstanding shares can be a simple way to pay off investors and reduce the overall cost of capital. For this reason, Walt Disney (DIS) reduced its number of outstanding shares in the market by buying back 73.8 million shares, collectively valued at $7.5 billion, back in 2016.”

More so, the company is expected to keep the shareholders happy – by giving dividends. And indeed one of the goals of the company executives is to increase shareholder wealth. And this is where the great balancing act comes. They also need to ensure that the company stays in lithe financial condition should there be a recession. The tightrope walk of ensuring the company stays afloat in tough times while also keeping shareholder wealth increasing is a tough one. One way to do that is by offering share buyback. Per Investopedia, “If the economy slows or falls into recession, the bank might be forced to cut its dividend to preserve cash. The result would undoubtedly lead to a sell-off in the stock. However, if the bank decided to buy back fewer shares, achieving the same preservation of capital as a dividend cut, the stock price would likely take less of a hit. Committing to dividend payouts with steady increases will certainly drive a company's stock higher, but the dividend strategy can be a double-edged sword for a company. In the event of a recession, share buybacks can be decreased more easily than dividends, with a far less negative impact on the stock price.”

Share buyback is also a quick fix for the financial statement. By reducing the number of outstanding shares, a company's earnings per share (EPS) ratio is automatically increased – because its annual earnings are now divided by a lower number of outstanding shares.

One analysis of buybacks is that the company offering it is fiscally healthy and wants none of the excess of equity funding. Even though credit rating agencies don’t often see buybacks in a positive light – as it is essentially taking on more debt – it can also be seen by the market that the management has enough confidence in the company to reinvest in itself. Writer Troy Segal says, “Share buybacks are generally seen as less risky than investing in research and development for a new technology or acquiring a competitor; it's a profitable action, as long as the company continues to grow. Investors typically see share buybacks as a positive sign for appreciation in the future. As a result, share buybacks can lead to a rush of investors buying the stock.”

Outlook for the Indian IT sector

Returning to Tech Mahindra now, CFO Manoj Bhat told PTI, ""We evaluate the cash needs of the business from time to time and intend to return excess cash to shareholders. In terms of the method adopted, we will be using a combination of buybacks and dividends to return capital to reward our shareholders.""

Sanjeev Hota, AVP Research at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said Tech Mahindra plans to return around 22 per cent of its cash and cash equivalents to investors through the buyback programme. ""Tech Mahindra used to utilise its incremental cash generated by the business in acquisitions/ investments in the earlier years. Now the company has joined the league of the large peers that have opted for the share buyback route to boost the shareholders' returns,"" he said.

The stock remains a top pick within the IT sector. Domestic brokerage house Edelweiss said in a report, ""A strong revival in the telecom vertical before 5G spends kicking in enhances Tech Mahindra’s long-term growth prospects. While the enterprise business looks solid with industry-leading revenue growth, the turnaround in telecom is getting stronger with each quarter."" Edelweiss maintains a Buy call on Tech Mahindra, with a target price of 1,002 rupees on the stock.

IT is a sector where there is a good cashflow each year and not great capital expenditure, and companies, in order to maintain healthy return ratios, keep a generous payout ratio in the form of dividends or buybacks. Another reason that is being cited by analysts is expectation of a global slowdown that may in turn affect clients' budgets.

As Sunil Matkar noted on Moneycontrol, while it is a common practice for companies which are facing significant erosion in their stock price but which believe the prospects are good to engage in buybacks (as we have seen in the PSU sector), the IT sector buybacks buck that trend considering the Nifty IT index has rallied as much as 24% in the past year - greater than any other sector - and 44% in the last two years backed by US growth and rupee depreciation.

""The outlook for Indian IT companies is good as growth in the US remains robust, and depreciation of INR versus USD has further strengthened their margins. However, all IT stocks may not do well. We are positive on Tech Mahindra,"" said Ajay Jaiswal, Strategies & Head of Research at Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management, adding also, ""We presume most IT companies are doing a buyback because dividend payment attracts a 15 percent dividend distribution tax and also individuals who receive dividend income in more than Rs 10 lakh pay a dividend tax of 10 percent.""

As Moneycontrol noted, for Q3FY19 IT companies' performances came in line with the estimates (Q3FY19 revenue ranged between 1 percent QoQ and 6.5 percent QoQ in constant currency term). Companies like HCL Technologies and L&T Infotech saw strong revenue growth, while others saw a furlough impact.

Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors remains optimistic about the sector. She said to Moneycontrol, ""In our view, positive triggers of FY20 will be 1) continued growth in financial services revenue in North America; 2); large deals participation; (3) capex visibility owing to 5G roll-out; and (4) strategic M&A activities to build capabilities could lend support to FY20E revenue acceleration.""

Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra, are the top picks in that order within the sector, according to the analysts Moneycontrol spoke to.

Why the backlash against buybacks?

We did earlier mention that there is a growing dialogue not just among academics and thinktanks but also now politicians about the widespread use of share buybacks in the US. Politicians of all stripes, including Chuck Schumer (Democratic), Bernie Sanders (Independent), and Marco Rubio (Republican) seem to have found rare common ground in advocating legislation that would restrict buybacks, give the SEC greater oversight over buybacks, and ending their tax advantages, or by banning the practice. For the record, as Fortune magazine noted, buybacks in 2018 reached a record of $800 billion, equivalent to about 75% of all S&P 500 profits. (Or $1 trillion according to one CNN estimate)

Rita McGrath, professor at Columbia Business School, writing for CNN, noted that while there are some legitimate reasons for companies to repurchase their shares - if the leaders believe the stock is undervalued or to make shareholders whole after employees receive stock grants or to boost the company's stock price considering the uncertainty around such big gamechangers as Brexit, trade wars, more government shutdowns - the reasons to not go down the buyback route are just as many and compelling. One of them, she said, was ""The bulk of executive pay is now tied to a company's stock price, creating an incentive to make that price as high as possible."" Indeed, the buyback phenomenon may be one of the reasons why American business leaders make a whole lot more money than do their counterparts in the rest of the world. The worker-to-CEO pay ratio in American companies is also much higher than in other places, worsening the already terrible income inequality.

Before an SEC rule change in 1982, as a matter of fact, buybacks were illegal, as they were seen as a form of stock price manipulation. Professor McGrath noted that for long-term shareholders, risks are increased. Companies invest in buybacks when the times are good and there is cashflow, and refrain from it during hardtimes, effectively, using current shareholder's money to buy high and sell low.

There is also the oft-raised issue of companies being left with less money for investment. Money spent on repurchasing shares, critics argue, could be spent elsewhere - investing in innovation, storing the money as buffer for hard times, paying and skilling workers, creating healthier local communities. The available numbers are nothing less than staggering. A CNBC analysis found that companies in the S&P 1500 which engaged in the most buybacks relative to their market caps underperformed in comparison to their peers who did not. A Deloitte analysis has found that the percentage share of GDP being directed towards stock buybacks is steadily increasing while that directed towards equipment and structures is either flat or falling.

A solid example cited by critics of buybacks is Sears, which, since 2005 spent $6 billion buying back shares - money it could have used for long-term investment which, who knows, might have prevented it from going bankrupt. GE, for another example, spent $24 billion in buybacks in 2016 and 2017 (average price of $30.2 per share and $19.65 per share respectively). The stock these days is worth around $10. Boop.

The Roosevelt Institute found that if the top five issuers of stock buybacks in the restaurant industry (Starbucks, McDonald's, Domino's being the top three) during the period from 2015 to 2017 ended the practice, these companies could pay their workers an average of 25 percent more each year. The study noted that Starbucks spent the most on buybacks per worker, and if it had reallocated funds from stock buybacks to compensation, could have given each worker more than a $7,000 raise. A much better premise for income equality rather than waiters having to depend on tips for sustenance or visiting Indians crying blue murder about having to tip 15-20%. (Outrageous, for the record.)

As Rita McGrath noted, ""Unlike other ways of returning excess cash to investors, such as dividends, buybacks can distort financial measures, such as earnings per share. Fewer shares? Voila, higher earnings per share.""

There is, of course, research to indicate otherwise, too - a study from 2003 by Rob Arnott and Cliff Asness, which simply said, higher dividends = higher growth. Which to a large extent, remains true. The 16-year old study did not have access to data about the gigantic buybacks of later times. Rita McGrath again: ""Dividends encourage stockholders to retain stocks for a long time, since that's how they will make money. Buybacks, however, reward those who sell their stocks — not those who hang in there.""

I can't help but wonder however that if indeed buybacks are restricted, will companies actually invest the extra cash in its workers and innovations or if it might indeed be a better option for a prudent shareholder to take the money and invest in other industries and companies relying on innovation.

For now though, it's buyback time for Tech Mahindra.",2384,0.7007540739499606

Tech Mahindra, the country's fifth largest IT company by market capitalisation, is set to buy back from shareholders up to 2.05 crore shares worth Rs 1,956 crore at a price of Rs 950 apiece. Its peers TCS, Infosys and HCL Technologies also completed their buybacks earlier.

Generally, the cash-rich company buy back shares to support price as well as to distribute cash among shareholders. It is also seen that when the stock price falls sharply despite strong fundamentals, the company uses share buyback to increase trust among shareholders.

A share buyback is a corporate action wherein a company takes back shares from its shareholders at a price higher than the market price. In doing so, the number of outstanding shares in the market reduce. This allows companies to invest in themselves.

So should shareholders tender shares in the buyback?

Moneycontrol spoke to several analysts about what investors should do and they are mixed in their opinion for short term. Experts are though confident that one should hold the stock for long term.

""Minority shareholders, especially retail shareholders, should participate in the buyback and hold on to rest of the shares for long term,"" Sameer Kalra, Founder & President (Research), Target Investing said.

This buyback is more like a replacement of dividend in more tax-efficient manner and the amount announced is 2.7 percent of market cap which is more like a dividend yield, he added. ""If investors do not participate they forego the outgo.""

Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research, Narnolia Financial Advisors also said investor with a short term, one-year horizon may tender shares for the buyback, while those having a long-term horizon may continue holding the stock.

Assuming 10 percent of shareholders in retail segment tender shares in the buyback, the acceptance ratio is expected at 45 percent, according to Sharma, who said at CMP of Rs 825, this generates an expected tax-adjusted return of 6.1 percent assuming post buyback price to be Rs 841, valuing 17x FY20E EPS.

AUM Capital also advised participating in the share buyback.

On the other hand, Shubham Kakrania, Research Analyst at Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management said one should hold the investment for the long term since the buyback size is small and he believes the strong growth visibility in the telecom vertical on the back of large deal wins in last few quarters fares well for Tech Mahindra in the longer term.

He believes with the pressure on telecom industry waning, and enterprise business showing good momentum on the back of manufacturing and public services, the growth trajectory looks much stronger for Tech Mahindra.

Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities also agreed with Shubham saying as the acceptance ratio is around 5-15 percent, one should be better to hold the stock for long term rather than tendering shares in buyback. She expects the stock to surpass Rs 1,000 levels in next one year.

Meanwhile, the outlook on the stock as well as entire sector is positive, experts said. Here are their comments:

Shubham Kakrania

We have a buy rating on Tech Mahindra with a target price of Rs 954 per share and it is one of our top pick among IT stocks.

Central to our investment rational is our view that Tech Mahindra is nicely putting in place the building blocks to win big in 5G. The industry expects 5G spending by the carriers to pick up in CY19, with the company getting its fair share of the network services piece from FY21 onwards. This holds the potential to drive double digit growth in telecom revenues.

Further, enterprise is likely to maintain good growth aided by higher digital revenue and strong total contract value. Margin can improve modestly from here, given the scope in profitability improvement among subsidiaries.

Sameer Kalra

We have buy rating on the company and it is one of top recommended IT stocks post Infosys & TCS.

Tech Mahindra has won big deals in past one year which have started showing into the revenue line and telecommunication segment which is biggest contributor to the revenue and margins is showing reversal since last two quarters. There has been improvement in cashflows of the company which should increase from hereon.

Vineeta Sharma

We expect Tech Mahindra’s EPS to grow at 14 percent CAGR for the next 2 years led by a strong revival in communication, continued deal wins ($440 million win during the current quarter) and improvement in the enterprise segment.

5G is expected to roll out late in FY20 should provide impetus to growth. Margins are expected to be bit lower level in FY20 as some pressure are expected due to addition in workforce and training and localization challenges which most of the IT companies are suffering from.

Global brokerage house CLSA expects the calendar year 2019 to be strong for the IT sector that reported strong earnings growth in the quarter ended December 2018 on deal wins and execution.

""Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro and Tech Mahindra are expected to see strong growth in CY19 as the year is expected to be sharply better than CY18 for most Tier-1 IT firms,"" the investment firm said.

Stronger deal activity in the second half of CY18 promises 250-500 bps growth acceleration, it said.

CLSA expects NASSCOM, the trade association of Indian IT-BPM industry, to guide for 8-10 percent growth for the industry in FY20.

Hence, its top buys are Infosys and HCL Technologies among IT stocks.

The dollar revenue growth in Q3FY19 was strong for most Indian IT companies, despite headwinds like furloughs, holidays, and negative cross currency movement.

Large-cap companies reported a dollar revenue growth in the range of 0.7-4.9 percent despite a seasonally weak quarter, led by large deal wins throughout the year.

HCL Technologies reported the highest dollar revenue growth of 4.9 percent QoQ, followed by Infosys (2.3 percent), TCS (0.7 percent due to a muted performance of the BFSI vertical).

Tech Mahindra shares gained nearly 3 percent in the morning on February 18 ahead of its board meeting to consider share buyback proposal later this week.

The stock was quoting at Rs 807.20, up Rs 6.50, or 0.81 percent on the BSE, at 0940 hours IST.

""The meeting of the board of directors of the company is scheduled on February 21 to consider a proposal to buyback the fully paid-up equity shares of the company,"" the software services provider said.

Hence, the trading window for transacting in the securities of the company would remain closed from February 16 to February 23.

While maintaining overweight call on the stock with a price target at Rs 830, global brokerage house Morgan Stanley said the buyback could be its first-ever and positive for sentiment.

Buyback over and above regular dividend payout would help boost return ratios, it added.

As the company has networth of Rs 19,300 crore in FY18 and cash of around Rs 6,500 crore on its books, Motilal Oswal said there could be two option with the company while considering buyback proposal.

One is the company can buy back shares worth Rs 1,930 crore—10 percent of networth—(3.8 percent of equity) without shareholder approval.

The second option could be to buy back shares worth Rs 4,800 crore—25 percent of networth—(9.5 percent of equity) with shareholder approval.

""The latter scenario is unlikely, considering it consumes around 3/4th of cash, and Tech Mahindra's acquisitive strategy,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Calendar year 2018 was quite strong for technology companies, which reflected in stock prices as well, thanks to strong IT spending by clients, and rupee depreciation.

These stocks rallied in the range of 12-39 percent in last one year with biggies like TCS, Infosys, Wipro and Tech Mahindra climbing the maximum 32-39 percent. However, correction seen in these stocks in December quarter was largely due to overvaluation, rupee appreciation and weak market conditions.

""The December 2018 quarter was strong courtesy a solid IT spending environment and was powered by execution of deal wins of the earlier quarters. Consistent with expectations, total contract value (TCV) and deal pipeline are strong,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said.

Increased onsite cost structure was visible though cost rationalisation helped many companies mitigate it, it added.

Revenue growth was strong across companies. Tier-1 IT companies reported constant currency revenue growth in the range of 1.8-5.6 percent on sequential basis and 7-13 percent YoY on constant currency basis.

Companies reported record TCV wins with growth in excess of 14 percent on YoY (trailing twelve months) basis in many cases.

Digital continued as a major growth driver during Q3FY19 with a growth of 30-50 percent YoY for most companies. Managements of most companies are seeing positive demand for FY20 as digital transformation journey.

Out of top nine companies, six beat Kotak's estimates on profit front — of the six, three beat on margin front and three on revenue. Only two companies, Tech Mahindra and L&T Infotech, surpassed expectations on all parameters.

""Performance on margins was a mixed bag with decline reported by TCS and Infosys and increase by Wipro and Tech Mahindra. The pressure point on profitability is resulting largely from shortage of talent in the US combined with challenges on procurement of fresh visas and even renewals of existing ones,"" Kotak said.

The research house expects the headwind (increase in reliance on subcontractors in the US to fulfill demand, inflating costs in the process) to continue in FY20.

Analysts largely expect steady growth in the fourth quarter as well, but after strong exit from FY19, FY20 is not expected to be strong one due to challenges of likely slowdown in the US, and China-US trade war concerns. In addition, movement in USD-rupee rate is the biggest risk.

""FY20 growth will be a function of two factors — (1) external headwinds emanating from slowdown in the US, uncertainty around Brexit and trade wars, and (2) tailwind from increasing digital deal sizes and accelerated deal momentum courtesy clarity on simplification of the core,"" Kotak said.

Admittedly a strong exit to FY19, bulging order book and positive commentary on demand should translate into a far better FY20, but the downside of a slowing market and the margin implications of the same cannot be ignored either, it added.

All said, the research house expects FY20 growth to be broadly in line or marginally lower than FY19. ""Within this, certain companies will report higher growth and some other lower in FY20E over FY19.""

Niharika Ojha, Analyst at Narnolia Financial Advisors also believes demand looks robust but the industry is grappling with supply-side constraints to cater to the demand.

""In order to meet the skill to aggressively capture the demand, companies are moving towards subcontracting to fulfill their needs resulting in margin contraction due to higher cost involved. Also, companies are making investments into training employees and adding workforce. Infosys, which captured the early sign of these challenges, should be the first to start bearing fruits of its early investment,"" she said.

According to her, attrition remains a key concern as the shortage of talent is giving the skilled employees a higher advantage across the market.

Experts largely feel majority of positives seem to have been priced in but there are stocks, where valuations are still attractive on expected growth in revenue and margin front, which can still give good return going ahead.

Table: Ratings and target prices on IT companies by Kotak Institutional Equities

Kotak advised adding HCL Technologies, L&T Infotech, Mindtree and Tech Mahindra which could return 8-12 percent. The research house prefers stocks that trade at inexpensive valuations and have potential to surprise either on revenue growth and margins.

""Tech Mahindra meets the criteria effectively with potential for revenue growth acceleration and available at reasonable valuations of 14X FY20 earnings. Infosys has scope for revenue growth acceleration though the post-result multiple expansion and closure of valuation gap with TCS could potentially limit meaningful returns in the near term,"" it explained.

Niharika Ojha said Narnolia's top picks are Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra.

Centrum, which believes a strong exit revenue run-rate in Q4FY19 could help momentum for the sector in FY20E, expects TCS/Infosys to outperform

on USD revenue growth, expecting 9.5-10.5 percent growth for both vendors in FY20.

""Wipro is also likely to show marked acceleration in FY20 and we expect Wipro to deliver 5.4 percent organic USD revenue growth for FY20,"" it said, adding Tech Mahindra is also likely to pivot in FY20 with 7.5 percent USD revenue growth rate, led by revival in the telecom vertical.

The research house prefers Infosys, Tech Mahindra and Wipro among Tier 1 IT companies. NIIT Tech and Mindtree are its preferred midcap picks while Sonata Software is its top pick among small caps.",890,0.4343476917432702

Company remained confident on revenue growth outlook and We believe that 5G led uptick can be a potential trigger for Communication vertical in FY20E. We see scope for cyclical upturn in Telecom vertical (41% of Tech M's total revenues) in FY20E which could swing consolidated revenue growth trajectory in FY20E.

IT firm Tech Mahindra on Monday said it is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 22 percent by the year 2030, from a 2016 base-year. The company aims to further reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by the year 2050.

The same has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), Tech Mahindra said in a statement.

""The SBTi approval confirms that Tech Mahindra's long-term targets are in line with the level of decarbonisation required to keep global temperature increase below 2°C, as compared to pre-industrial temperatures, as set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change,"" it added.

Dolat Capital's research report on Tech Mahindra

Company won deals worth USD 440mn in the quarter. Of these, USD 240mn was in the communication vertical and USD 200mn in enterprise. Deal wins in the communication vertical are wide spread and all in upcoming transformation areas of 4G/5G network. We believe recovery in the communication vertical with a healthy deal inflow will aid margin and profitability in the near to medium term. We expect TECHM to report a USD revenue growth of 4.7%/10%/10.2% in FY19E/FY20E/FY21E. However, the management believes that margin expansion to be moderate helped by digital revenue and synergy between portfolio companies.

Outlook

The stock trades at an inexpensive valuation of 13.1x/11.1x FY20/FY21 earnings. We continue to prefer TechM within our large cap IT universe, and maintain BUY with a TP of ` 950 based on 15x one yr. fwd. PER.

The December quarter results reported by India Inc. were a mixed bag, but largely on the positive side and that is one reason we have not seen any major knee-jerk reaction in equity market as well.

Of the 34 Nifty companies that have announced their earnings, 25 have either met or exceeded consensus estimates on both the PAT and EBITDA front. The earnings upgrade/downgrade ratio is over 1, Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Among the Nifty constituents, Maruti Suzuki, UltraTech Cement, Yes Bank, SBI, IOC, Bharti Airtel and NTPC missed PAT estimates, while L&T, Axis Bank, ITC, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries and HCL Tech exceeded expectations.

“The December quarter earnings have been a mixed bag. We believe banks (both private and PSU banks) delivered yet another strong QoQ performance with improved asset quality and strong credit growth,” Jayant Manglik, President Religare Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Further, sectors like FMCG, IT and Capital Goods performed largely in-line with estimates with margin pressure witnessed across these sectors. However, the Auto companies’ results so far, have disappointed with pressure witnessed on volume growth as well as on margins,” he said.

Weak margins have impacted earnings for the 52/100 BSE-100 companies that have reported their results for the quarter ended December, Citigroup highlighted in a report.

Earnings expectations for FY19E have seen downgrades on a year-to-date (YTD) and now stand at 12-14% YoY for NIFTY. The global investment bank maintains its Sensex target at 39,000 (16x Mar-20 P/E).

Significantly more companies ‘beat’ earnings than ‘missed’. As many as 28 out of 52 ‘beats’ expectations compared to 14 out of 52 which ‘missed’. Similar trends across Revenue/EBITDA performance as well.

Among sectors, materials (cement, base metals) and energy (better than expected refining performance) sector positively surprised expectations while consumer discretionary (auto) and utilities have disappointed the most, said the Citi report.

Here is a list of 10 stocks where global brokerage firms raised their target price post December quarter results:

IGL: Buy| Target raised to Rs 330 from Rs 315

Deutsche Bank maintained a buy rating on IGL post December quarter results but raised its target price to Rs 330 from Rs 315 earlier.

The global investment bank also increased FY20-21 earnings estimates by 3 percent. It forecast 18 percent CAGR for FY18-20 EPS, driven by a 14 percent CAGR rise in volumes. The company is well placed to benefit from expansion in new areas.

Tech Mahindra: Outperform| Raised target to Rs 950 from Rs 925

Credit Suisse maintained its outperform rating on Tech Mahindra and raised its target price to Rs 950 from Rs 925 earlier.

The IT major reported a 13 percent sequential rise in Q3 profit at Rs 1,203 crore. The company reported 27.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit.

After many quarters of sluggishness, the mainstay of telecom and communications vertical reported a 2.6 percent growth in revenues during the reporting quarter over the preceding one, while the enterprise segment grew 4 percent.

The telecom story has started to pan out. It is a well-placed stock despite good performance, said the note. The valuations look reasonable at current levels.

Marico: Outperform| Raised target to Rs 400 from Rs 380 earlier.

Credit Suisse maintained its outperform rating on Marico post December quarter results and raised its target price to Rs 400 from Rs 380 earlier.

The FMCG major reported a steady Q3 and looks poised for a strong margin expansion in FY20.In terms of products, Parachute leads growth despite not dropping prices. The gross margin is poised to see a Year-on-year (YoY) expansion in FY20.

Aditya Birla Fashion: Buy| Target raised to Rs 265 from Rs 240 earlier

CLSA maintained its buy on Aditya Birla Fashion but raised target price to Rs 265 from Rs 240 earlier.

Strong Pantaloons same-store-sales (SSS) growth came as a surprise. The Q3 revenue was up 23 percent driven by strong SSS growth. Margin expanded even with a contraction in gross margin and higher A&P spend, said the note. The innerwear business continues to grow rapidly. The global investment bank raised FY19 PAT estimates to Rs 1,73.6 crore from Rs 114.6 crore.

Titan Company Ltd: Outperform| Target raised to Rs 1,175 from Rs 935

Credit Suisse upgraded Titan to outperform from neutral post the earnings and raised target price to Rs 1,175 from Rs 935 earlier.

The global investment bank also raised earnings estimates by 3-10 percent. It sees tailwinds for the stock from a strong wedding season. Higher gold prices aid an already strong growth trajectory, said the note.

State Bank of India: Buy| Target raised to Rs 380 from Rs 370 earlier

CLSA retained its buy call but raised the target price to Rs 380 from Rs 370 earlier.

SBI is the preferred pick among PSUs, said the note from CLSA. The profit was ahead of estimates which was aided by higher treasury gains. The key positive was the decline in slippages.

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd: Outperform| Target raised to Rs 3200 from Rs 2850

CLSA retained outperform rating on the company and raised target price to Rs 3,200 from Rs 2,850 earlier.

The cost controls continue to deliver, and a revival in the US growth in FY20 will be a key catalyst. The earnings beat was largely driven by cost-control initiatives.

The US sales improved by 4 percent on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis and US pricing dynamics remained stable. The global investment bank increased FY19-21 EPS estimates by 2-9 percent.

ICICI Bank: Outperform| Target raised to Rs 460 from Rs 416

Macquarie maintained outperform rating on ICICI Bank and raised the target price to Rs 460 from Rs 416 earlier.

The private sector lender displayed a strong asset quality performance, while other operational parameters were stable. The management foresees FY20 credit costs between 85 bps and 125 bps. It is a preferred play on the ‘normalisation of credit costs’ theme, said the report.

Asian Paints: Outperform| Target raised to Rs 1580 from Rs 1180 earlier

Macquarie upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral earlier and also raised its target to Rs 1,580.

The volume growth picks up significantly, and the volume growth outlook has also improved which is a big positive. The recent price increases with falling input costs will improve margins.

The global investment bank raised FY19-21 EPS estimates by 7-16 percent. However, the full effect of lower GST rates yet to play out.

Havells India: Outperform| Raised target to Rs 775 from Rs 720 earlier

CLSA maintained an outperform rating on Havells India but raised its target price to Rs 775.

The revenue growth surprised across categories. Large channel inventory in the AC industry remains a concern. Revenue from switchgear division was Rs 416.2 crore as against Rs 344.3 crore in the third quarter of the financial year 2017-18.

On January 7, 2009, Byrraju Ramalinga Raju, founder and chairman of Satyam, wrote to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the company's shareholders admitting that he manipulated the company's accounts to the tune of Rs 7,000 crore, shocking the global corporate community. Nearly 94 percent of the reported cash reserve of the company had been fictitious.

The confession blew the lid on what came to be known as India's Enron. Satyam's shares fell from a high of Rs 180 to a low of Rs 76, dragging down the Sensex 7 percent.

As Raju explained, the company had started off by inflating some of its financials, and got caught in the quagmire of ever-increasing expectations on how to keep up the performance. ""It was like riding a tiger, without knowing how to get off without being eaten"".

Satyam's backstory

Satyam Computers was India's fourth-largest IT company, behind TCS, Infosys and Wipro. Raju was held as one of the torchbearers' of the Indian IT story. Satyam had won several awards for corporate governance.

But something was amiss. A few months before Raju confessed, Satyam had announced it would take over its group company Maytas Infra (Maytas' name was Satyam's spelled in reverse).

The proposal led to a lot of consternation among investors. Why would an IT company want to acquire an infrastructure company? Were there not enough opportunities left in IT?

In hindsight, this was a last-ditch attempt by the Satyam promoters to merge two companies -- a move that would have helped Raju continue to cook his books more effectively with an asset-heavy infrastructure firm.

The evening the announcement came out, Satyam shares sold off in US trading, sealing the fate of the proposed acquisition. With the share price depleted, Satyam couldn't use its stock to buy Maytas. The next morning, Raju confessed.

Events since

After the scam came to light, independent directors, auditors, banking partners and related entities to Satyam became the center of attention. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) were independent auditors of Satyam when the news of the scandal surfaced. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined the Indian arm of the auditor $6 million, slamming its failure to detect such a fraud. In 2018, SEBI banned the company from auditing any listed company in India for two years.

The Company Law Board disbarred the board of the company and appointed 10 nominal directors in 2008. The then Corporate Affairs Minister Prem Chand Gupta said the board failed to do their duty and at their expense, the credibility of India's IT industry should not suffer. Deepak Parekh, former NASSCOM chief Kiran Karnik, and former SEBI member C Achuthan were nominated by the government to Satyam's board.

In April 2009, Tech Mahindra bought a 46 percent stake in Satyam via a public auction process, to form the country's fifth largest IT exports company. It subsequently merged within Tech Mahindra in June 2013.

What happened to Raju?

Raju was arrested by the police in January 2009, along with his younger brother B Rama Raju and got bail from the Supreme Court in 2011, as the CBI failed to file a chargesheet.

The market regulator slapped a fine of Rs 1,849 crore on Raju and barred him from the markets for 14 years. In 2015, Raju and nine others were found guilty under various counts of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to seven years in prison by a Hyderabad court.

Raju is currently out on bail and lives in Hyderabad.Satyam Raju's Letter to... by on Scribd",599,-0.5031355082988739

Earnings for the quarter ended December 2018 will be kicked off by technology companies Infosys and TCS in later part of the next week. Most brokerage expects growth to continue in third quarter driven by rupee depreciation and strong US growth.

Global investment firm CIMB expects top five IT companies to report 1.5–4.8 percent sequential growth in dollar revenue in constant currency terms.

According to the research house, country's second largest IT firm Infosys is expected to raise its lower end of FY19 revenue growth guidance and HCL Technologies is likely to maintain its guidance for dollar revenue in FY19.

After the end of Q2FY19 earnings, Infosys said it expects its full year dollar revenue growth at 7-9 percent but lowered EBIT margin guidance while HCL Tech maintained FY19 constant currency revenue growth guidance at 9.5-11.5 percent and EBIT margin at 19.5-20.5 percent.

CIMB retained its overweight stance on Infosys & Tech Mahindra as both are its preferred large cap picks. Among midcaps, it likes L&T Infotech & NIIT Technologies.

Any adverse macro event and/or regulations are downside risks, it said.

The Hyderabad High Court on Monday set aside an Enforcement Directorate order provisionally attaching fixed deposits worth Rs 822 crore belonging to Tech Mahindra.

The Enforcement Directorate or ED in 2012 provisionally attached the fixed deposits under Section 5 (1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002, before Tech Mahindra formally took over scam-hit Satyam Computers.

The ED attached the amount alleging that it was ill-gotten proceeds of Satyam Computers.

A bench comprising Justices V Ramasubramanian and J Uma Devi set aside the ED's order.

Counsel for Tech Mahindra Vivek Reddy told PTI that they argued that there was no money with the fraud-hit Satyam Computer Services Ltd in 2009, when it was taken over and the Mahindra group company infused the amount to revive the Ramalinga Raju-founded company.

On January 7, 2009, Raju in his capacity as chairman had sent an email to SEBI, wherein he admitted and confessed to inflating the books of Satyam besides understating liabilities and other financial misstatements.

After the fraud came to light, the government ordered auction of the company to protect investors and employees of the then fourth-largest IT firm.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tech Mahindra

We believe Tech M is poised for turnaround in revenue growth trajectory post three years of tepid performance led by a) Turnaround in Telecom vertical b) expansion in portfolio in Enterprise vertical through acquisitions which has broadened the service offerings. We believe margins have also reached a stable state (2QFY19 EBIDTA margin at 18.8%). Improving margin profile of subsidiaries and revival in growth should aid margin stability from hereon. Valuations remain cheap (12x FY20E EPS) and risk return remains favorable.

Outlook

Retain TP at Rs885/sh (15x Sep20E EPS). In this report, we analyze the key opportunities for Tech M in 5G which could drive growth revival.

Moderator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and a very warm welcome to the Q2 FY19 Earnings Conference Call of Tech Mahindra Limited. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode, and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing ‘*’ then ‘0’ on your touchtone telephone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I am now glad to hand the conference over to Mr. C.P. Gurnani – Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer for Tech Mahindra. Thank you and over to you, sir.

C.P. Gurnani: Thank you. Good evening, good day to all of you. Welcome to Tech Mahindra Q2 earnings call. I am delighted to inform you that your company has reached an important milestone in its journey to become a digital company of the future. Tech Mahindra has been highest ranked non-US company and the highest ranked amongst IT services and consulting companies amidst all our peers; it stood 15th in the overall rankings in the Forbes Global Digital 100 List. It is a proud moment for us to see Tech Mahindra emerge as a digital thought leader taking the world into the connected future and living up to its promise of connected solutions and connected services and I do believe the recognition is also reflected in the company’s digital revenue share which you would recall was 28% in Q1, has gone up to 31% in Q2, roughly a growth of 10% QoQ. Regarding the Q2 revenue, we clocked $1218.2 million and in rupee terms we are up 13.5% YoY and 4.3% QoQ. But clearly in terms of revenue growth, I would consider that performance as tepid and that is this basically because of little volatility in our Healthcare business, nothing seasonal, it is more of projects coming to a close in three or four large hospitals. And then the growth of the commentary you would realize that company had always committed that we will work on our operating margins, the company has committed that we would work on shifting the revenue towards digital and the company has committed on the Communications division growth and the company has committed on overall good performance. If I take away the HCI business, the company has grown well both in Communications sector as well as in the Enterprise sector. In constant currency, Enterprise growth has been 3.5%, Communications business saw a strong growth; 5% QoQ in constant currency, and frankly I am so happy because it is almost a good growth after a span of 15-quarters.

The other thing is that it is a record for us is that we signed $550 million worth of deals this quarter, which is a record for us. This makes me feel very happy.

Last but not the least, operating margins we are all on a weighing scale and this is clearly an increase of 240 basis points and even if I take out a few fluctuations which are the currency and the visa cost, I think the company’s operations have done very-very well.

In general, your company continues to have new customers, your company continues to invest in technology, your company continues to invest in some of the big bets like 5G, Blockchain and Cyber Security. We continue to invest in innovation, we continue to invest in platforms, I think exciting times await us. I would let Manoj Bhat who is our CFO and L. Ravi who is our Chief Operating Officer to share a little more details with you but

I can only say is that yes, we could have done better but overall it has been a great quarter. Thank you. Manoj, do you want to take over?

Manoj Bhat: Yes, thank you, C.P. So, I think C.P. has articulated the broad brush of the quarter. Going a bit into detail, if I look at constant currency revenue growth, it was about 0.4% and within this clearly there was a negative in excess of 40 million coming from our Healthcare business and without that I think we grew about 4.2% in CC terms. I think in terms of the margin, it improved about 240 basis points. Just a quick high-level breakup: Absence of visa cost which was about 60bps and currency impact was about 80 bps, about 140 bps was operational efficiencies at business mix and then we had wage hikes for a portion of our workforce, negative of about 40 bps. So, I think that is a journey from 16.4 to 18.8.

I think the other thing during the quarter was that other income was about $25 million compared to $16 million in Q1, almost all of it was because of the translation gain because the rupee has moved quite a lot during the quarter. From profit after tax it was about $149.4 million vs $131 million and in INR terms it was Rs.1064 crores.

Coming to cash flow metrics, CFO or cash flow from operations was about 141 million which is 94% of PAT and compared to last quarter that is 109, so there has been a substantial increase in CFO. Free cash flow was also up to 120 million which is about 80% of PAT versus about 81 million in Q1. Overall, cash and cash equivalents were down on account of dividend pay out of about 220-odd million, I think that has come down a bit. Hedge book was about 1.6 billion versus 1.45 billion in Q1. So, it has gone up and that is in line with our policy.

I think overall if I step back it has been a satisfactory quarter on the margin front, I think a lot of our metrics around deal wins, around digital growth are quite robust and we look forward to continuing this journey.

With this, I will throw the floor open for questions and move forward with the call. Thank you.

Moderator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. We will take the first question from the line of Sandeep Agarwal from Edelweiss. Please go ahead.

Sandeep Agarwal: I have two questions: C.P., one what is the change in environment you are seeing versus what you have seen earlier – are we consistently seeing upbeat in the mood from the client perspective, are they open to giving more deals and the size of deals are increasing and if yes, where we are seeing big positive surprises coming in? Secondly, can we confidently say that we are past the telecom pain which we have witnessed over last so many quarters? And then a follow up for Manoj, can we take this quarter’s margin as a base margin now ex

of wage hike going forward because I think we lost lot of margin last several quarters and last four, five quarters we have started regaining our margin, so still do you see ex of currency there is some more positive surprises coming or you think that you will pause here and try to grow more fast?

C.P. Gurnani: So, let us address the two questions on environment and the telecom spend. I think on the environment, it continues to be a mixed bag, US economy you all know that the positive velocity, China or Japan or Europe, there are changes happening in their economic structure, Middle East continues to have pleasant side as well as few difficulties. So, overall I would say economic climate since our business is 48% US and 52% rest of the world, I would say that to us there is a greater sovereigns and flexibility to compensate for some of the swings.

Right now, yes, there is a demand for the digital, yes, some of our tool sets, so I will give you example, in my BPS business we have added about 5,000 employees, BPS business is because your customer experience management is taking a higher priority despite of much higher level of automation, much higher level of productivity but just that customer intimacy is becoming so much more important. So, that is one part that I would like to say. Telecoms in general know that they need to equip themselves to become better players in the market. The fact is that the growth is coming in data communications and to be able to leverage the growth in data communications the CAPEX spending has increased. #2 is some of the systems of the past need to be modernized. So, the basic philosophy that we followed across our customer base which is run the operations better, change or grow the business together, I think it worked out well, there is no new wave that has come in, we are all working towards the new wave which is the 5G but at this stage, I think it is more of operational efficiency improvement of our customer and being able to work better and being able to sign large deals. Manish, if you are on the call, do you want to add anything on the telecom side?

Manish Vyas: No-no, C.P., I think you have articulated it quite well, I think it is indeed like you said telecom industry is continuing to go through the process of transforming itself and there are multiple players out there. We have always maintained that we have put the strategy together to keep a multi-dimensional, very diversified portfolio that helps the service providers to improve their operations, be ready for the future and then eventually take advantage of the opportunities that come forward. So, all the action that we have including some of the deal wins are all very-very aligned to the strategic bets that we have taken. So, we will see how it goes from here on.

Manoj Bhat: On the margin, I think your question is 18.8 new base line and do we see margins improve from here ex of currency. So, to me clearly I think this is a journey and we have talked about this in the past and we had set certain goals for six quarters till March 2019 and we are progressing very well on the journey, I think margins will go up albeit, the pace of margin improvement has been quite fast but we will see gradual margin improvements is what I would build in as a base case from here over the next two quarters. I do not think we have commented going into FY20 and beyond. But at least in the next two quarters, our goal would be to do gradual margin improvement from here.

Moderator: Thank you. We will take the next question from the line of Viju George from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.

Viju George: I had a question on HCI. It is pretty sharp drop out there. I am just curious as to what kind of a business it can be if revenues drop more than 50% in a quarter’s time? Secondly, therefore do you see new wins out there which can also bring about a kind of wish up back revival?

Manoj Bhat: Viju, this is Manoj. I think it is a good question and let me explain the business a bit and what was playing out and this is not something new we had pointed this out that there is implementation revenue in there which could potentially drop off and we have said that in Q4 as well as Q1. Even very aware of the cycle of implementation and then new orders coming in and new implementations in this business. So, if I look at the entire provider space that what HCI does, they do implementation, training and go-live support right. And the moment it goes live, I think the revenue drops off very-very sharply. From that perspective, there was a big wave where I think there were six or seven hospitals and providers who were going through this phase and HCI was in a position where it was won all of those deals and that is where the ramp-ups were very-very steep over the last four quarters. It so happened and coincidentally all the implementations ended probably in a span of one or two months at the end of Q1 and going into Q2. Of course the new order book is building up and this is going to be a little bit of year-on-year picture of HCI. I think on year-on-year basis the business will show growth. I think their target would be to go in excess of 10% and that is something which I think they feel pretty confident in terms of the management team. So, that is the way to look at it. A little bit of this business is going to be like this. To your second question, “Is it more in the nature of staffing?” I think ultimately if I look at the model of resourcing, there is always going to be a core group of employees who offer the services within HCI but obviously with the steep increases and decreases we do also depend on a lot of temporary employees because that is the nature of the business. To that extent, yes, there is going to be external thing up and down but if I look at the core group of people who offer these services, who think through these programs and to offer this kind of support, I think that continues to remain as HCI is the core offering. I do not know whether I answered the question.

Viju George: Sure. But Manoj, just taking this forward, the revenues are more than halved, so while you did point out that you would see some impact in this quarter, I reckon that the actual decline must have been sharper than what you expected or estimated. That said do you think that there is a potential for this business to get back to the revenue base that it saw and what is it take to get there and how you are tracking against that?

Manoj Bhat: So, the nature of this business is it is very difficult to predict because also towards the end of the cycle it is a bit need based, so, it is very difficult to estimate what the exact drop can be. So, to that extent, maybe your impression might be right that it maybe a few million dollars more than what we thought but the broader point is I think more orders will come in and I think we will see revenue growth coming back going forward.

All we can do is this is the business, if it moves up sharply, we will come back and tell you that this is another implementation cycle starting and the other strategy we are using is winning synergy deals which then kind of balance out the revenue streams on QoQ basis so that the perspective in terms of how to model it QoQ I think it becomes a little bit easier, that is the effort we are doing to balance this kind of implementation cycle curves out.

Viju George: Obviously, this has been a very strong driver of the growth in Enterprise side of the piece over the last four, five quarters. Looking forward, if we take this out, given that it is inherently unpredictable, so while the worst maybe over, you do not know what nature of the upside will be, do you think the rest of the portfolio can grow sufficiently stronger than in the past to get the same kind of growth going forward on Enterprise side?

Manoj Bhat: Viju, I think the way this is phased out, right, it is across two years. So, even if I do ex this growth, right, whether last year or going into this year projections, I think the impact is not so severe, #1, right. #2, I think from a perspective of overall Enterprise, I would like Manoj to add to that question, because it is a question of broader Enterprise and Manoj, maybe you can talk us through how do you see broader Enterprise growth?

Manoj Chugh: Thank you very much, Manoj. So, Viju, in terms of the overall Enterprise business, despite the challenge that we have had this quarter on account of the HCI business, still if you look in constant currency terms, the overall Enterprise business has grown by 9.2% and we have been maintaining that our business will grow 8- 10%, so clearly we are on track in terms of whatever we have been articulating. Again, I think our diversified portfolio plays to that advantage and you would see that if I keep the HCI business aside, in constant currency terms, even this quarter the Enterprise business has grown by 3.5%. Clearly, some verticals will do better than others in each quarter and we have been saying this and we have been maintained this that it is not that you are going to see every vertical grow substantially every quarter, there will be some verticals which will do better than others. So, for example in this quarter, the Retail vertical has done well for us. So, I think we will continue to see consistent constant growth in the Enterprise business, it may come in from different verticals at different points in time and clearly, the number speak louder than words. So, we continue to maintain our stance around the overall broad-based growth 8% to 10% in terms of constant currency across our portfolio.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Divya Nagarajan from UBS. Please go ahead.

Divya Nagarajan: Just following up on the Enterprise statistics question, what do you see as the overall growth for Healthcare given that the HCI acquisition is currently looking at some amount of replenishment there, so for the next couple of quarters what are we looking at in terms of growth? Secondly, I am sorry if I missed earlier, you seem to have had very strong contracts in this quarter. So, did it run through the mix across Telecom and Enterprise segments in terms of the contracts?

Manoj Chugh: Divya, I think maybe Healthcare perspective is better appreciated on a full year basis right, so I believe there will be quarter-on- quarter growth right, going into next quarters, but overall I think if I look at, whether it is HCI or our other Healthcare business, so I would say, our target would be like double-digit growth and that is what we are going to try and achieve. Moving on to your other question, out of the 550 million of deal wins, roughly 300 million is Communications and 250 million is Enterprise. If I look at the deal win composition, if I look at the Enterprise side, the whole customer experience management, the whole integration of some of our platforms to deliver solutions in the customer experience area, that has been a big component of deal wins. There have been many interesting wins on some of the transformation programs and infrastructure and so on and so forth. On the Communications side I think clearly first of all, it is geographically dispersed, and I think it is pretty much all the way from ANZ to US, so it is across multiple areas. So, to me the way I look it is these are typically four to five year kind of deals and some of them might be shorter cycles where there is just a transformation, but that is the way I would credit. Does that answer your question, Divya?

Divya Nagarajan: Sure. Just a follow-up, on HCI, there is a slowdown or lack of interpretation pick up, how long do you expect this to last and when will we see replenishment of those contracts? The last follow-up is on margins. We have kind of reached around the target margins that you are talking about for the year. How should we think about where margins are likely to head from here on, what is the target now?

Manoj Bhat: On HCI, I do not have a number for you in terms of what could be the growth and so on and so forth, my sense is it will gradually build up going into Q3 and Q4. I think today I have no full visibility to full replenishment, but partial replenishment will happen as the deal wins translate into revenue. So, that is on the HCI question. On the margin question, clearly, our internal targets were always higher, and we were goaled to a higher number. What has happened is of course that there are two things playing out right, so as the digital revenue acceleration is happening and as we substitute somewhere low yield revenues with the higher yield revenue streams, I think there is an inherent margin lever which is coming and then of course there is automation, AI, and all the other initiatives which we spoke about. I do not think I have a new target or new aspiration which we have disclosed, but as I said there will be gradual margin improvement over the next two quarters is what we believe.

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Pankaj Kapoor from JM Financial. Please go ahead.

Pankaj Kapoor: Sir, my first question is on the revenue growth, if I look at last quarter obviously we had a seasonal impact and this quarter again we had HCI impact which was probably higher than what was initially anticipated. But if I look at as a portfolio, the growth in the first half would be significantly lower than what some of the peers have reported. So, A), how do you look at this whole portfolio going forward improving in the second half or even from a longer-term perspective, by when you think that we should be getting our growth rate move closer to the industry?

Manoj Bhat: Pankaj, that is a good question that if I look at it from a headline number, right, but as we mentioned that overall and some of this is CC terms into 10% was our goal in Enterprise, I think we will hit that. On the Coms side, clearly after Q1 we were talking about growth over three quarters which is also happening, and the deal wins are reflecting the core health of the business. So, I do take your point on the first half, obviously, there is no piece of the business we can exclude in terms of the portfolio, but what we were trying to do is kind of point out that various pieces of the business are moving differently and that is the reality of the business. So, to me I think over the next two quarters, we do see growth coming in the overall business and that is something which historically also the second half for us has been usually better than the first half and I think that trend will continue, and as we look forward I think there are opportunities which will be there both on the Communications side and the Enterprise side and as and when the quarters go we will talk more about it. So, that is a quick view on how we are thinking about growth and there is no denying, your point is valid that net-net if I take the top line I think whether it is currency, whether it is some seasonality, growth has been lower than where it was may be some time back.

Pankaj Kapoor: In terms of the deal wins, of course, this was probably one of the best quarters you have had. Can you give a sense like whether this was all net new or was there any renewals also in this?

Manoj Bhat: So, if I include renewals, the number is bigger. So, what we do is if there is a renewal with an increased volume, we only report the net increase as the deal win.

Pankaj Kapoor: So, I can take this as probably net new excluding any renewal? Okay. Manoj, lastly on the margins, is there a kind of a level which you have in mind where beyond which you would like to invest the incremental efficiency gain or even the currency gain back into the business to probably target a higher growth rate, I mean, if I go back into the history we had been may be three, four or five years back in the range of around 20%, 21%, so is that the kind of level one should be looking at and beyond which you would like to probably invest the efficiency and the currency gain back on to the business to strive for a higher growth at a top line, do you have some of those targets in mind, if you could share that?

Manoj Bhat: Pankaj, so a couple of points I would like make, right: So, first is it is not that we are not investing. So, we have had a quarter excluding HCI of 4.3% in constant currency growth which is obviously at the top end of growth for I think whichever is large, you take right. So, clearly a lot of the business, things are working, so I do not want you to take away that we are not investing and hence the results are not coming, because there is a lot of investment going on, whether it is the tech bets, whether it is in terms of re-skilling, whether it is in terms of partnerships, so that is something which I think we are adding front-end sales people, we are looking to add specific capabilities onsite. All of that is happening within the numbers. In terms of the margin, at what point will we say that this is something which is an optimum margin, I do not think we have any such definition in mind today. So, I think we are going to work towards both revenue growth and margin improvement to the extent possible. But at this point, I do not think we feel that we are constrained by margin improvement, and that is not a reason for the perceived lack of headline growth, because if I dive deeper into the number there is growth coming in most of the pockets of the business.

Pankaj Kapoor: And if I can just ask one last question on the DSOs which have been going up every quarter. So, what is our thought process on that, which obviously is impacting our impacting our cash conversion as well? Thank you.

Manoj Bhat: First of all, it is not impacting our cash conversion. Obviously, we can do better. But if I look at the metrics, they are in and about where they were. Secondly, I think the DSO this time, I think about two-odd days have been added just because of the currency movement because we convert all the AR into rupees at the quarter end rate and the revenues are generally converted at the quarter average rate. So, there is a difference of about 2% odd, which makes a difference of about 2 - 2.5 days roughly. So, part of that is there. But your point is taken, I think this is an area where we are stepping up our efforts and hopefully we should see reductions going into Q3 and Q4.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jiten Doshi from Enam Asset Management. Please go ahead.

Jiten Doshi: Congratulations, CP, on a good set of numbers and the entire team. But my observation is, every time we have these negative surprises, it’s there only from these acquisitions. I think last time also our margins were in excess of 20% and then suddenly I think we need to get into the right acquisitions. As shareholders we are feeling somehow that this strategy is not working optimally. That is my first point. And second is, somehow or the other our margins are getting diluted due to acquisitions. So, unless it is extremely strategic, and if it is strategic it should be margin enhancing. What is your view on this really?

Manoj Bhat: So, I think fair point. So, if we look at one our initiatives was that if we look at our entire set of portfolio companies, we identified it as an opportunity where we significantly need to improve our performance. And if I look at four quarters I think there have been significant improvements. But I would still say there is a huge opportunity there in terms of improving margins. So, our margins are continuously improving over every quarter. Our synergy revenues are starting to kick in in some or the later acquisitions. And we are far better aligned on operations. So, I think all of those are happening. I think to your broader question, currently most of these acquisitions are clearly more on-site centric. So, as a rule they are probably lower margin. And also, a lot of the synergy revenue which already exists, for example, let me give you the example of SOFGEN. While SOFGEN acts as a front-end entity, but I think the synergy revenues are delivered from the offshore entity. So, clearly, the margins and the revenues will flow through into the offshore entity. So, the numbers reported, per say, might not be a true reflection of the success or failure. On the broad acquisition philosophy, you know we made a change in that in term of how we think of these acquisitions. And I have started pursuing acquisitions which will potentially be margin accretive. And the second thing we did is, obviously, go in for small acquisitions. So, some of those changes we have already made. So, I think I personally view it as an opportunity set again for the next four quarters to work on this and improve it. And your points on that they are dragging margins is still true. So, I think we will have to work with them and work with the management teams there to improve margins and improve revenue growth.

Jiten Doshi: So, this question is for CP. CP, I think in last 18 months there is a particular momentum in the company and there is a ray of hope and optimism, and we have seen very good things happening in your company. Now, in the midst of this momentum we should not take large acquisitions which again drag us down. I have no doubt in my mind that this company can deliver a 20% EBIT margin, if you do not do it over the next 18 months I would be very-very surprised. Because I think that most of the top-notch companies are delivering that and I do not consider you as any company less than the top-notch companies. So, I think our focus should be on bringing back a 20% EBIT margin in the business. And our focus should be on keeping this momentum alive. I can see that there is clear direction, momentum, and everybody is quite upbeat. In the midst of that if we do a large acquisition which will be dilutive to our margins, earnings or which will not be integrating quickly, I think we will hamper this whole process and once again we will go back to 2016, 2017, where the whole company really suffered. So, this is my observation and I would request that you please consider this.

Manoj Bhat: Jiten, I think CP's line has got dropped, I will convey it to him.

Jiten Doshi: Yes, but I think this is for all you, please. Because there is a good momentum, there is a good traction, everything is upbeat. I think now if you go and do another billion dollar acquisition and drag the whole thing down, I think it will put the whole firm down again. There is no doubt in my mind, would you rule out a 20% EBIT margin probably as a company coming back to that level?

Manoj Bhat: Jiten, I do not think we give guidance. So, there is nothing we are ruling out right now. So, as I answered Pankaj also in the question before, there is a set of initiatives that we are going to let it run. And of course, the pace of results from those initiatives is obviously far more accelerated than we thought. But as I said, we are not stopping because of that, we are continuing on this journey. And I do not think we have a number in mind saying we will stop here or we will stop there. So, that is might short answer. I know you are looking for a more specific number.

Jiten Doshi: No, I have only one suggestion to your entire company, that please consolidat what you have taken on hand, please take the margin to 18%, 20% EBIT margin which is higher in terms of EBITDA, please stabilize whatever you have on hand, come back to where you were. When I am talking about 20% EBIT, you have done it in the past. So, I am saying, come back to where you are. And once you come back then take a relook at all of that.

So, you cannot ride so many horses because last time that the company went absolutely off-track was during the time when they made these big acquisitions, which did not work well for the company. We do not want to go back in that stage for sure. Everything is upbeat, there is a momentum and we need to be cautious. And I think there are a lot of tail winds we are enjoying, why don’t you ride all of them. And don’t think of any acquisitions at this moment till you stabilize the base, that is all my observation and suggestion to you.

Manoj Bhat: Yes, sir, taken on board.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mukul Garg from Haitong Securities. Please go ahead.

Mukul Garg: I just wanted to dig a bit deeper into the communications vertical which performed quite well this quarter. Can you help us break this into impact which came from the deal wins which you have done in last couple of quarters, and the structural change which is happening in this sector? And if it is the later than basically what has changed in communications compared to the last couple of years, which are the areas where you guys are winning more, is it more in the distance space or is it more a rebound which is happening in the larger client base of yours?

Manoj Bhat: I will request Manish, if you can cover your perspective on that question.

Manish Vyas: So, Mukul, thank you so much. The good news is that almost all the wins that we have had, the larger ones as well as the small and medium ones that we have closed, all of them have a very large element of digital and transformation to that. The one that we have done in Asia is putting a new digital platform for both customer management as well as the downstream business management systems. And the underlying driver for putting that whole transformation program together is to get this service provider ready for helping them play into a more digital services going forward, which will start in their world with, once they get ready for 4.5G and 5G and beyond. So, in many ways it is not a network deal, that particular one, it is a digital transformation deal, but it has got 5G written all over it.

The another deal that we have done is a very operations transformation deal. But a big shift that has happened is it is not a lift and shift type of a deal, it is a deal that is built on lot of autonomics, lot of digital platforms that we have put together to help predict the customer engagement, customer responses with service assurance, the new service delivery. And that is also in the enterprise space of a service provider so that they can be ready to start demanding more business from their enterprise customers as they deploy new network and new assets together. So, in many ways these deals that we have done, that also figure prominently in our pipeline as we speak, is all in the transformation in the digital and in the new telco of the future, network of the future type models. And when I say all, I mean, some of these transformation deals that we are currently fighting are in that category. I wouldn’t attribute these deal wins to any one particular factor, whether it is a structural change or anything else, I think it is a journey that we are on which is powered by a strong need for the service providers to continue to reinvent themselves. And for us to continue to deliver on the investments that we have continued to make. In an earlier question Manoj was saying, which is absolutely correct, we have continue to invest, we have not taken our eyes off the ball from the future as we have continued to correct our current operating metrics, which also applies to the telecom business as well. So, I hope I could answer your question, Mukul.

Mukul Garg: So, Manish, do you think that you guys are more prepared now versus earlier to offer these services to your telco clients going forward as well, or do you think it is still a bit dynamic scenario where things will things will keep on moving up and down as far as spending is concerned? We clearly understand that pure 5G spending has still not started, but the whole shift spend towards digital is that pick sustainable over next maybe year or so.

Manish Vyas: Please don’t get me wrong when I say this, Mukul, I do not believe and I have always maintained that we have always been better positioned in the industry to take advantage of the opportunities as they come, because we have been consistently staying invested and focused on our strategy, our portfolio, and the market. We definitely did go wrong in our execution in one or two of the acquisitions and couple of initiatives, but even those have allowed us to play very prominently now in the areas where the focus and the growth will be. So, I think we remain focused and I believe that your company continues to remain very well positioned to take advantage of the holistic opportunity that will come up as things evolve in the telecom and the media space.

Mukul Garg: My second question was for Manoj, if we look at the other enterprise business, excluding the HCI, there are a few verticals which have been relatively weaker over last couple of quarters. And that trend has been quite stark compared to what the rest of the industry is talking about, especially if I look at the BFSI space, after many quarters of good growth when the whole industry was delivering weak performance, last four quarters have been quite weak for you, whereas the commentary from others have been improving. So, can you help us understand how we should look at these areas like manufacturing and BFSI going forward?

Manoj Chugh: So, first of all on manufacturing, as I said, we have shown good growth over the last many quarters, I am sure you will agree with me. This quarter is benign on a quarter-on-quarter basis but if you look at the numbers on a year-on-year basis our business has drawn 11%. So, I think that is decent performance. Coming to financial services, you have rightly said that in the past when everyone was challenged our business did grow well. So, in fact, last year you would perhaps remember that our BFSI business grew by 18%. So, clearly, to some extent there is a base effect. My belief is that our pipeline on BFSI is strong and you should see growth coming in from this sector going forward in the future. So, I would say, what you have seen in the last couple of quarters is more a result of a much higher base as compared to what we have traditionally had. And our pipelines are building up well, so hopefully we should see the results.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sumit Jain from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Sumeet Jain: Firstly, wanted to just understand on the telecom vertical side, I remember Manoj, you gave a guidance of probably low single-digit what you can achieve for the full year, given we had a significant decline on the first quarter. So, are we still looking at that kind of a growth for the full year, given the kind of deal wins you already have? And also that implies a close to 5% to 6% CQGR ask for the remaining two quarters.

Manoj Bhat: So, every quarter we have cross currency impact, so I have to keep reworking the numbers. But suffice it to say that I think there is momentum in the business and I think what we said is that every quarter we will grow.

Now, CQGR 4%, 5%, 3% is a different matter, you know historically second half is stronger for us in the coms vertical specifically. So, I think that is where we stand today. And I think the momentum is there, the deal wins are there. And you heard Manish, and Manish if you want to add anything to the commentary there?

Manish Vyas: Not anything on the numbers, Manoj, you have answered it. All I would just say and reiterate that we continue to remain very busy with the kind of opportunities that we have closed. There are similar patterns. And the good news is, at this point, I think Manoj had alluded to this earlier I believe, that the growth is pretty comprehensive in terms of even a regional mix. So, we are seeing pretty good traction across almost all the markets that we are operating in. And we continue to remain hopeful that we will maintain. Of course, that is subject to several other variables, some of them are not in our control. But we continue to strive hard for what we said that we want to continue to do.

Sumeet Jain: And secondly, I can see your SG&A expense levels were a bit elevated this quarter, so from the forecasting standpoint how should one look at it going forward?

Manoj Bhat: I think from an SG&A perspective you should expect it to moderate back over a period of time. So, there were certain expenses which we made which are in the nature of an investment over a shorter period of time. So, as those kind of go through the system and as we get revenue in return, some of those will moderate back to the older levels I would say.

Sumeet Jain: And lastly on the tax rate, again, it was a bit high, so any guidance for the full year?

Manoj Bhat: So, I think our guidance remains about 24%, 25%. This time I think there was kind of a one-time tax of about 4 million. So, if I remove that I think we will be in that range and that is the range we are consistently going to be in on an average.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Parag Gupta from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Parag Gupta: I had two questions, both on the communications vertical. So, the first question is, you had some really good momentum and deal wins in the telecom vertical in the second quarter. Could you give us some sense on the visibility or the pipeline and how that is building up? So, can we see the same momentum continue going forward as well? And the second question is, we have heard some of the larger peers talking about getting interested in the telecom vertical, especially given their eyes on 5G as it starts rolling out globally. So, the question is, are you seeing any increase in competitive intensity or do you think it is more or less similar to what it used to be in the past? Thank you.

Manish Vyas: So, Parag, I think the deal momentum is good. It is very consistent not only with the deals that we have announced, we have similar deals in the funnel right now. I just cannot predict when do we close those. But they are also very consistent with our credentials and our portfolio and the kind of business that we have been saying that we are investing in across the run, change and group portfolio, and across the bets that we have taken between network, software, managed services and customer experience transformation. So, all of that remains, we know where we are playing. More importantly, I am sure you like when I say this that we have also decided many areas that we will not play any more in so that we have a more predictable and a better chance of succeeding going forward from an execution standpoint. So, that was the first part of your question. What was your second one?

Parag Gupta: Are you seeing any increase in competitive intensity in the telecom vertical?

Manish Vyas: Well, I think I wouldn’t say it is more or less, it is always high. There are more people who are always excited about anything that is high on the hype cycle. But there is a greater degree of maturity in the industry right now in terms of knowing the people who have deep and deep routed expertise. And also the ability to transform versus people who are building the capabilities up-fresh. One thing that we have always said, we have consistently maintained that in each of these areas in telecom, particularly in the network business, theentry barriers are very-very high, because the skill levels that are needed are pretty complicated and very diverse. So, I wouldn’t say that we are overtly worried, but the fact is that the kind of business we are building in telecom we do not really have one dimensional competition, it is always very different type of people that we compete with. In some cases, we do not even compete with the other peer group that you all compare us with, we compete with a very different type of company. So, it is always exciting, it is always challenging, and these are the people who keep us honest to our capabilities and commitments. I wouldn’t say it is anything different than it was in the past.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from CGS CIMB Securities. Please go ahead.

Sandeep Shah: Just a question, again, follow-up on the telecom side. Manish, just wanted to understand that suddenly there is a big momentum which is building up in terms of deal pipeline and you eluded that it is coming across various markets and it is not skewed to few accounts. So, what has led to this, is it also a factor of vendor consolidation which is helping you? Because we get to hear that the balance sheets of major telcos are actually under stress. So, what has led to this kind of decision making which is getting accelerated for the large deal awards as a whole? And when you say that they are getting ready for 4.5G to 5G, is it fair to say that now the timing of the 5G related demand is more visible for you to target? Or still you believe that we do not have a color on the same?

Manish Vyas: So, Sandeep, first question, the deals are both of consolidating and transforming the existing spend on the OPEX side, the deals are never, let me not say never but are seldom created for consolidating vendors. The deal wins that we have had, one of the largest we have had last quarter is built around transforming the existing operations by leveraging digital and automation. In the process we have ended up consolidating a whole host of vendors, mini vendors, and some of them are large companies, some of them are small companies. So, that is always part of the feature. So, it, in many ways, is not a new dollar, it is the same dollar but that is getting repurposed for helping the service provider become better at what they do. And then the other kind of deals that we have one, including the one I was alluding to earlier in Asia, which is a new CAPEX dollar that we are enjoying being part of, which is helping them put a completely new digital platform together so that they can do their transactions and their customer integrations on a new platform, which will enable them to provide products and services in a very digital, web-scale type fashion. Now, that is a new spend, that is a new budget that they have allocated in this space. So, we are seeing a pattern of both, you are absolutely right that the rate at which the data is growing in the industry which is very high, is not commensurate with the rate of revenue growth at this point in time. So, the service providers are continuously exploring possibilities and opportunities to remodel their business plans, which hopefully will happen with 5G and beyond. But at this point in time we are there because our relationship with the accounts continue to remain very-very deep.

On your second question, look, I still think two quarters ago if you recall CP had said that 5G is not going to be like 4G or 3G, it is going to be very non-uniform. We continue to see that pattern, and within markets different operators will take different approaches. And that story has still not been completed, it is still getting evolved. So, I do not believe that we really know all the answers to how the revenues will shape up in that business, we will still need a couple of quarters to get a better definitive idea on that.

Sandeep Shah: Just follow-up, Manish, as you said that the funnel is also similar to what you have seen in the order book, is it fair to say that the YoY growth in the order book in telecom is actually likely to improve and continue to inch up going forward? And for you to have a growth momentum continue may not be just in the near-term but may also over a medium to longer-term, because these are transformational changes which are coming in. Is it a fair way of looking at it in terms of communication, growth visibility for Tech Mahindra?

Manish Vyas: All I can say, Sandeep, it is a fair way to set that expectation off us. And I can assure you that we are going to strive for that.

Sandeep Shah: Just last thing, Manoj, last time we said that we will achieve flat to low single-digit kind of a growth in the telecom as a whole. So, even at a current run rate that may require close to a 4% compounded QonQ growth rate. So, we are still at the lower end flat growth kind of an estimate is still visible for you?

Manoj Bhat: No, I just answered that question, so we are seeing growth, now whether it is 3%, 4%, 5% is a different matter.

And I think the range of possibilities includes flat to low single-digit growth even now. So, I think we will have to see. As Manish also mentioned in his answer, there are some external factors in terms of how these deals convert into revenue and how does the funnel convert in revenue or deals. We will have to see how it goes, because I think if I look at the funnel, if I look at everything else that is going very well today.

Sandeep Shah: And just last, Manoj, on the margins on the gross level, at 34% gross margin it is at a multi-quarter high. So, do you believe that these kind of gross margins are sustainable ex of currency going forward looking at some of the supply side issues which are coming? And we also have a bit of a client concentration where a bit of a deal renewal leads to a dampener in terms of a gross margin. So, how well prepared we are in terms of maintaining or defending such kind of gross margin level? Because that will help you in terms of margin consistency going forward.

Manoj Bhat: So, I would like to restrict my answer to EBITDA. And as I mentioned before, we do see gradual increase in EBITDA. Obviously, there are risk to this as with everything else, and we will monitor the situation. But if I look at the combination of our investment and return on investments as well as our overall efficiency in terms of SG&A as well as the gross margins, and as our digital business is increasing I think there are pulls and pressures. But I think our broader view is that EBITDA margins will gradually improve at least over the next two quarters and then we will see as time goes along.

Moderator: Thank you. We will take the last question from the line of Rishi Jhunjhunwala from IIFL. Please go ahead.

Rishi Jhunjhunwala: Just a quick question, again, on HFCI. So, basically, what was the impact on the margins from this $40 million revenue decline that we saw? And also, is it the bottom in terms of the revenue level that we could possibly see on an annualized basis? And would there be a sequential pickup as a result?

Manoj Bhat: I think this is the bottom, is what we believe. Second, in terms of margin impact, see most of these were flexi staffing or flexi employees. And obviously the system there works that it is proactively managing those. So, the margin impact has not been very severe. And also, it has been cushioned by the replacement of that revenue with higher margin revenue, which is also including offshore revenue. So, that is the way to look at margins without going into the specifics of HCI quarter-on-quarter margin movement.

Rishi Jhunjhunwala: The reason I ask that is because if we really look at your difference between consol and standalone in terms of margins, EBITDA margins have been going down for the past two quarters whereas on consol level it has been expanding. So, just wondering if profitability of your subsidiaries is worsening in the past two quarters?

Manoj Bhat: This quarter if you look at subsidiary versus consol difference, I think that is because of certain dividends paid out during the quarter, I thought, because there is a large number in the subsidiary column.

Rishi Jhunjhunwala: That comes under EBITDA?

Manoj Bhat: Yes. Where you referring this from, sorry, maybe I am looking at the wrong number?

Rishi Jhunjhunwala: It is just the difference between your consol and standalone numbers, so subsidiary financials give EBITDA margin decline.

Manoj Bhat: Standalone and the impact of dividend income.

Rishi Jhunjhunwala: On EBITDA margin side?

Manoj Bhat: How are you calculating that? Actually, why don’t we connect offline, because I think let’s talk through it. See, broadly, the way I look at it is that I think if I take a longer term picture I think both margins have improved both standalone as well as subsidiary margins. I think quarter-on-quarter there might be fluctuations here or there.

Rishi Jhunjhunwala: So, let me just rephrase, do you have headroom on improving your subsidiaries profitability as well in a meaningful way? Because it has been quite weaker in the past two years.

Manoj Bhat: That is what I was answering in response to a previous question, that I do believe there is still an opportunity which will play out in terms of overall subsidiary margins going up.

Moderator: Thank you. That was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Manoj Bhat for closing comments.

Manoj Bhat: Thank you, everyone, for joining our call. I know that there are some people in the queue who could not ask questions. So, if you could email it across to us, we will try and get them answered. Thank you so much for joining.

Moderator: Thank you. Ladies & gentlemen, on behalf of Tech Mahindra Limited, that concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining us. And you may now disconnect your lines.",9461,0.48905157461398985

The debate is on and there is no easy answer to the questions – ‘where should you place your bets?' Should one invest in large, mid or smallcaps?

Going by the statistical data for 2018, S&P BSE Sensex outperformed the broader market. The S&P BSE Sensex rose 3 percent compared to 25 percent fall in the S&P BSE Small-cap index, and 16 percent downward move in the S&P BSE Mid-cap index. S&P BSE Largecap index also recorded flat-to-negative returns in 2018, so far.

Investment in any asset class should be determined by your risk profile. Data suggests that largecaps have been more stable, while volatility has been seen in the mid- and small-cap indices.

The broader market has been weighed down by a host of issues starting with SEBI reclassification of MF schemes, governance issues, fall in crude oil, mixed results from India Inc., and high valuations. But, is it the right time to buy into small or midcaps?

However, some stocks, especially from the small-cap space, outperformed and more than doubled investor wealth this year. The list includes Excel Industries, DIL, Responsive Industries, Merck, Generic Engineering & Construction and National Peroxide.

Many experts feel that large-cap stocks will offer a better value, and that is what has happened in 2018 also. However, some experts say that there is value in the broader market but the key is stock selection.

“We continue to like broader market over the largecaps. We also note that the market is witnessing a strong divide in valuations across quality and ordinary businesses notwithstanding market capitalisation which warrants that investors should be stock-specific now,” Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICIdirect.com told Moneycontrol.

“Emphasis should always be on buying a business which are run"" in a capital efficient way and possess sustainable growth prospects,” he said.

Shibani Kurian, Sr. Vice President and Head of Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company is of the view that large caps will still offer stability in a portfolio.

“However, after the sharp correction in midcaps, their valuations are now converging towards large caps and many of the excesses of the past have been erased. In this environment, with a 3-5 year view, certain midcaps, which have a strong growth outlook, sound management, strong capital allocation policies and have superior return ratios do provide an investment opportunity,” she said.

In the S&P BSE largecap index, as many as 21 stocks rose 10-20 percent in 2018, including Axis Bank, Marico, Infosys, Dabur India, Nestle India, Bajaj Finance, TCS and Tech Mahindra.

In the S&P BSE Mid-cap space, as many as 12 stocks rose 10-40 percent, including Havells India, JSW Steel, Berger Paints, Mphasis and Divi’s Laboratories.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services is of the view that largecaps provide a better chance of investment in the long term given a healthier risk-reward ratio. Whereas, mid and small caps have a higher risk of a downgrade in earnings and valuation in the future.

“The short term is looking positive whereas, in the medium term, the intrinsic value of equity as an investment asset is under evolution. In the very near term, this rally can get volatile but can get positive in the long term as downtrend in crude prices is maintained. India earnings downgrade is over and valuation has become bit more rationale,” he said.",563,0.7406072244048119

The company has set up a strategic business unit that has led to significant growth in the last two quarters for the firm.

Moneycontrol caught up with Sujit Baksi, India business head and Puneet Gupta, sales head, at Tech Mahindra, to talk about the company's domestic market focus and why they see India as a huge opportunity.

Edited excerpts:

Q: What is driving your India focus as a company?

Puneet: The market in India is extremely strong and there has never been a dull moment. Everybody is investing in India, including global companies. It is growing at 8-9 per cent (according to Nasscom estimates).

There are sectors that are doing well- banking, enterprise, government, telecom. The nature of work has changed in the last few years for IT companies and we are doing pretty well.

Sujit: The India focus was more tactical earlier. We started this India business because we saw a lot of business coming from India and are also seeing a lot of transparency here. Utilities are a big focus area and we saw a large opportunity in enterprise side where they have to rehash their IT systems,

We also saw a huge opportunity in the customer experience digital journey. Most of the e-commerce business is born digital. If you look at the large e-commerce companies (in India), we work with all of them.

In telecom, we saw the big merger that happened, and the disruptive new player. We already have significant share in customer experience in one and IT transformation work with the other. We see huge opportunities in these areas.

Q: What about payments with India government business? Late and deferred payments have always been a concern with IT players.

Sujit: We work with the party while the request for proposal is being made. We ensure that payment terms are favorable to us or any other vendors.

Puneet: The whole payments story is how well you keep communication going between both sides.

Q: On the telecom side, you have been very vocal on 5G technology. What is the scenario for 5G like in the India market? Are you talking to customers?

Sujit: We are far ahead from competition in terms of readiness for 5G. It is huge transformation and investment is huge. It is not a quarter based thing.

Puneet: We are having a lot of conversations with clients. From a firm story perspective it is a little early. Every person associated with the sector has a lot of interest, including the government.

Pilots are being spoken about, solutions around 5G are being spoken about. In my view the whole ecosystem is coming together. We are a services company, not a product company. We are looking at getting like minded people together and address that opportunity.

Q: Are you looking at partnerships with academic institutions like Bharti's telecom school in IIT Delhi?

Puneet: We have a full college inside our campus in Hyderabad and that's on similar lines. There is also an academy that Tech Mahindra has for training on 5G at a global level.

Q: What are the challenges in the Indian market?

Puneet: Whenever there is a business unit, the focus is on how you scale. That's what we have done in the last 20 months. As we win more and more (contracts), there is need for scaling. It is also about building the right partnerships. We are also working with startups and getting like-minded people to come together.",614,0.5879566252231598

IT company Tech Mahindra on Tuesday said it has bagged Rs 270 crore project from Coal India to deploy modern technologies in the state-owned company.

""We have bagged a Rs 270 crore project from Coal India. It will span over period of five years,"" Tech Mahindra Sales Head for India Puneet Gupta told reporters here.

The implementation of the project would be done in phases.

The phase 1 of the project includes ERP software implementation in Coal India and its two subsidiaries -- Mahanadi Coalfields and Western Coalfields, Gupta said.

The deal also includes supply and implementation of Hospital Information Management System, across all eight subsidiaries of Coal India covering 21 hospitals, he said.

""We will bring the depth of our digital experience into this engagement and deliver connected experience to Coal India,"" Tech Mahindra President, India Business and Corporate Affairs Sujit Baksi said.

He said that the company has also won a five-year project to modernise six Indian ports in September and has started implementation of IT solutions including ERP system, network solution and data centres.",187,

Fifth biggest domestic tech company Tech Mahindra is looking at upcoming 5G rollouts in global markets as a big opportunity and is on the right trajectory in its communications vertical to achieve 'gradual growth' from now on, a top official has said.

In the recent past, communications, which has traditionally been the mainstay for the company, had delivered mixed results due to difficulties faced by the sector around the world, but the company surprised with a 4 per cent growth in revenue in the September quarter compared to the preceding three months.

""On the telecom side, our visibility is that it will show a gradual growth from now on, the trajectory is right and we should be able to sustain it,"" chief executive and managing director C P Gurnani told PTI recently.

He, however, made it clear that achieving 4 percent growth quarter-on-quarter is not possible.

The communication vertical accounted for 41.5 percent of its Rs 8,629 crore revenue in the September quarter. The revenue share of the segment had stood at 45.2 percent in Q1FY18, which had steadily declined to 39.6 percent by Q1FY19 before going up.

Gurnani singled out the upcoming 5G technologies as an opportunity for the company to grow, saying many countries have allocated spectrum in the newest technology to telcos.

He said the ability to offer virtualisation is a strength that TechM has in the segment and it will be bidding for upcoming contracts.

When asked about the domestic telecom business, Gurnani said all the companies have invested in spectrum and will be looking at monetising their investments at some point of time, but declined to specify an outlook.

Even though he did not wish to give a guidance on revenue growth, Gurnani said the company is committed to grow at 8-10 percent per year.

Chief operating officer L Ravichandran said hiring has not grown in proportion to the revenue growth due to greater automation and added that a bulk of the recent hiring has been of freshers.

The company has hired 3,000 in the first half of the fiscal, including 2,200 in the first quarter, he said, adding it is looking to hire more people.

The company is working on ways to up the margins, including automation, increasing utilisation, more efforts on training so that employees can start working on projects quickly and pursuing the right business mix, he said.",406,0.5005956366658211

The last week was about earnings and acquisitions.

During the week, two large technology services companies -- Tech Mahindra and Cognizant reported results, marking the near-end of IT earnings for the second quarter.

The week also saw Tata Consultancy Services make its first acquisition in four years, and IBM made its biggest acquisition ever- that of open source software company Red Hat.

TCS bought London-based W12 Studios for an undisclosed amount, an acquisition, experts feel, will give the company an edge in competing with larger rivals Accenture, IBM and Cognizant in the design/marketing space.

Tech Mahindra and Cognizant, both reported results on October 30. Tech Mahindra beat analysts' average expectations backed by a strong pipeline and recovery in its communications vertical.

However, there was some unexpected weakness in the healthcare business as some projects came to a closure.

The same day, US-based IT services major Cognizant reported September quarter revenue of $4.08 billion, up 1.74 percent from the previous three month period.

The company also recorded a $28-million loss accrual related to its India bribery discussions with US regulators. While not entirely unexpected, the amount was a little higher than what the market was prepared for.

On October 28, IBM said it was buying open source company Red Hat for $34 billion, an acquisition that is likely to have some impact on India where both companies have a huge presence.

It is interesting how open source has been adopted by mainstream technology companies over the years. Champions of proprietary software such as Microsoft and IBM have embraced open source in a big way, with Microsoft becoming one of the lead contributors to the open source community after buying GitHub earlier this year.

Amid all these global developments, India earned a not-so-pleasant distinction as well- that of being the country with the highest number of Internet shutdowns- over a 100 in just 2018 alone.

The annual Freedom on the Net report looks at Internet freedom in 65 countries and measures Internet freedom score based on three parameters -- obstacles to access, limits on content and violations of user rights.

Tech Mahindra on October 30 reported second quarter results that beat analysts' average estimates, helped by strong deal wins, even though it said there was some weakness in its healthcare business.

The Mumbai-based IT services firm reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,064 crore for the September quarter, a rise of 19 percent quarter on quarter from Rs 898 crore.

The revenues rose 4 percent at Rs 8,630 crore against Rs 8,276 crore during the previous quarter.

Analysts polled by Reuters, on average, expected revenue of Rs 8,605.8 crore and profit of Rs 1,003.7 crore.

""As expected, Telecom (about 42 percent of sales in Q2FY19) saw growth revival and grew 4.3 percent quarter-on-quarter in USD terms in Q2YF19. However, higher than expected de-growth in enterprise business (about 58% of sales; down about 4 percent quarter-on-quarter in USD terms) led to lower than expected growth in overall revenues,"" said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a note.

He also said Tech Mahindra signed deals worth over $550 million this quarter, its highest ever.

The consolidated EBIT margin rose to 15.3 percent a rise of over 2 percentage points from 13 percent quarter on quarter.

""The company is focused on how we accelerate digital growth,"" Manoj Bhat, Chief Financial Officer, Tech Mahindra, told Moneycontrol.

The margin had an 80 basis point impact from rupee depreciation against the US dollar.

“Our strong deal wins especially in the Communication vertical coupled with our 10% plus sequential growth in digital revenues are a validation of our Run, Change and Grow strategy. Barring declines in our implementation business in our healthcare vertical, we have clocked a good quarter in terms of both revenue growth and EB/DTA margin improvement,"" said Gurnani in a statement to exchanges.

Tech Mahindra, which will announce its September quarter performance on October 30, is expected to report a steady set of numbers with revenues rising on the back of a weaker rupee and absence of visa costs. The profit could range between Rs 940 crore and Rs 990 crore.

Here’s a gist of what brokerages are pricing in for the September quarter.

Brokerage: Axis Capital | PAT: Rs 950 crore

The brokerage house believes that revenue growth could be driven by strong momentum in telecom despite impact of project closure in enterprise segment.

It sees margin headwinds in wage hike, while cost rationalisation, rupee depreciation and improving profitability of subsidiary, among others, as tailwinds for better rupee.

Brokerage: Emkay | PAT: Rs 989.7 crore

Emkay said it expects 1.5 percent constant currency growth driven by positive deal traction in the communications business. However, 150 bps of cross currency headwind will lead to flat revenues in dollar terms in Q2FY19.

Rupee depreciation along with absence of impact of wage/visa/Comviva would drive 110 bps operating margins gains in the quarter.

Reported PAT likely to grow by 10 percent QoQ due to strong operating gains.

Key things to watch out for (1) outlook on growth in the Communications vertical specifically on 5G, (2) Further potential in terms of OPM gains and levers to drive them in light of lowered growth rate

Brokerage: ICICI Securities | PAT: Rs 947.3

ICICI Securities expects dollar revenues to increase 0.3 percent QoQ to $1,227.9 million on account of recent deal wins in communications segment partly countered by muted performance in enterprise segment.

Rupee revenues may grow 3.9 percent QoQ to Rs 8,603 crore. EBITDA margins may expand 90 bps QoQ to 17.3 percent owing to currency benefit partly countered by a partial wage hike.

Brokerage: Motilal Oswal | PAT: Rs 930 crore

The brokerage expect PAT to decline by 24 percent QoQ, led by operational weakness and lower other income. Revenue is expected to decline by 1.2 percent sequentially on a constant currency basis (-2.5 percent QoQ in USD terms).

Key issues to watch for

-Traction in enterprise and deal wins

-Expectations around a 5G-led pick-up in Telecom

Brokerage: Prabhudas Lilladher

Leakage in enterprise vertical owing to softness in HCI business would be negated by strong recovery in communication vertical which is likely to start showing recovery from hereon which is trigger, the brokerage house said.

We expect Tech Mahindra to deliver 0.7 percent constant currency revenue growth and Cross currency would be a headwind of 100bps for the quarter. Hence, dollar revenues would decline by 0.3 percent QoQ owing to cross currency headwinds.",446,0.46527153650919595

On the business side, even as the rupee continued its free fall this week, it turned out that the 'obvious' benefit to Indian IT firms that primarily do business with US was not so obvious after all.

Given that the rupee has not fallen as much against other currencies that form a large part of the Indian IT industry's client base, and clients now have more mature spending models, the impact is not expected to be material for the industry as a whole.

After almost exactly a week of his first tweet on the issue, the person he accused was sacked from the IT firm.

Interestingly, all of this played out on microblogging platform Twitter, which underscores the importance of social media in our lives.

While Infosys could be the big gainer from the ongoing currency fluctuations, Tech Mahindra could end up as the biggest loser, say analysts tracking the Indian IT sector.

Overall though, IT services firm may not benefit as much as one would have thought, given that the rupee fell to its lowest ever against the dollar. And that's because of more practical client spending patterns and relatively lower impact from other currency fluctuations.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, in a note on Monday, upgraded the industry's expected earnings per share for 2019-21 by 0-7 percent based on their revision of the rupee versus dollar rate to Rs 70-72 from Rs 68.50-70 earlier.

Analysts at Motilal Oswal said in 2018 so far the rupee has depreciated 10 percent versus the dollar, but fell 4 percent versus the pound and 1 percent against the euro.

The United Kingdom and Europe are the largest markets for Indian IT industry after the United States.

""Had the weakening been comparable across currencies, the impact of a depreciating INR would have been felt on majority of revenues. However, due to lesser weakening against other currencies, it becomes pertinent to check the percentage of revenue bookings in dollars, which varies across the sector,"" the analysts said in a note on Tuesday.

Analysts see Infosys as the big gainer from ongoing currency fluctuations and Tech Mahindra as the biggest loser.

Among mid-size IT companies, Mindtree stands to gain the most and L&T Infotech stands to lose the most.

""We also cut our dollar revenue growth assumption due to cross-currency challenges. Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Mindtree do not have meaningful cash flow hedges and will benefit immediately from depreciation in the dollar-rupee. L&T Infotech, Tech Mahindra and Mphasis are aggressively hedged and will not derive meaningful near term upside,"" the Kotak analysts wrote in the note.

Analysts at Kotak said companies that have higher sensitivity to currency are the ones that have higher offshore leverage, lower margin and smaller India-centric revenues.



Impact on deals

Some also feel that there will be no meaningful impact from the ongoing currency fluctuations on IT services firms.

""The market is mature and clients, by and large, will not change their spending patterns because of small currency fluctuations,"" said Phil Fersht, CEO at research firm HfS Research, adding: ""The bigger impact will be felt for Indian firms eyeing US-based acquisitions as this will impact those investments more significantly as they are large cash outlays.""

Another impact might be on deal signings. ""There may be more incentive for a few clients to hasten large renewals/close deals faster to take advantage of the low dollar-rupee, especially in the financial services sector which is under real pressure,"" Fersht added.",466,-0.21094166381018503

Tech Mahindra and Microsoft have partnered to develop blockchain based technology to curb pesky calls and SMS as recommended by telecom regulator Trai.

""Tech Mahindra announced today its collaboration with Microsoft to create a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based solution to build a robust ecosystem in line with the regulations issued by Trai,"" a joint statement by the two companies said.

Based on blockchain technology and built on Microsoft Azure, the solution aims at mitigating the issue of unsolicited commercial communication (UCC) in the country, it said.

According to Trai's new rules to quell pesky calls, telecom operators are required to deploy blockchain-based technology to prevent unauthorised access of subscribers data, make system non-repudiative and enhance confidentiality.

This is apparently first of its kind technology in the world to be deployed to prevent leakages of consumer information from unauthorised telemarketers.

Blockchain as a technology is a powerful tool to combat the issue of spam calls and fraud risks, to protect user information, as well as the integrity of the telecom sector.

""This DLT-based solution will enable enterprises to stop financial frauds and perpetration of misleading financial information by unregistered telecom marketers who rampantly use the SMS service of telcos,"" Rajesh Dhuddu, Global Practice Leader, Blockchain, Tech Mahindra said.

Trai's new rules aim to ensure that subscribers' data is not visible to person operating the system in clear text or any application ""other than the application performing the delegated functions"".

The regulator has stated that UCC or spam calls are a major nuisance to telecom subscribers and has been working with stakeholders to curb this menace.

Trai had established a ""Do Not Disturb"" (DND) registry in 2010. However, while the registry has more than 23 crore subscribers, unregistered telemarketers continue to spam customers, obtaining their consent through fraudulent tactics.

""Tech Mahindra and Microsoft have been jointly working with Trai on this issue since the time this regulation was being formally structured,"" the statement said.

Any changes made in a blockchain-based system gets reflected across all the system or computers linked to it and it can be easily tracked when and where the changes were made.

The blockchain-based solution will enable telcos and registered telemarketers to take care of preference registration, consent acquisition, dynamic preference setting, stakeholder onboarding, header registration, template registration, scrubbing service, and complaint handling and tracking, the statement said.

The solution will be a shared, secured ledger of UCCs distributed across a network of computers, which will ensure a transparent and verifiable system to help companies mitigate UCC on their networks.",433,0.9278030594189962

JM Financial's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TECHM) reported 1QFY19 a tad above our estimates; management’s comments indicate strong deal wins in telecom in 2QFY19 that could drive revenue growth momentum from 3QFY19 onwards, in our view; margin focus remains. Thus, while consensus earnings upgrade cycle could take time to pick up pace, we expect the stock could quickly trace back the 11% valuation correction over the last one month on back of near-term growth concerns and kick-off of 5G related capex by global telecom services providers (potentially over 2HFY19, in our view) could sustain that.

Outlook

We maintain BUY and raise PT to INR 810 (INR 790 earlier); changes to our EPS forecasts are minor (c.1% each for FY19/FY20).

Tech Mahindra indicated at hiring around 4,000 freshers over the next three quarters as the IT services major focuses more on ""demand-based"" hiring instead of creating an inventory. The company has already hired about 1,800 fresh graduates in the first quarter of the ongoing fiscal, Tech Mahindra Chief Financial Officer Manoj Bhat said in a recent investor call.

""I think over the next three quarters, I do not have a ready number, but our estimate would be about 4,000 people roughly, but it could vary a bit so do not take that as a number, but it is just an indicative view,"" he said.

The Mumbai-based company had a total headcount of 1,13,552 people at the end of June 2018 quarter, an addition of 745 people over the preceding quarter.

The software headcount was 72,462 people, while those in BPO were 34,700 and 6,390 people in sales and support function in the said quarter.

Tech Mahindra CEO and MD C P Gurnani said trends suggest that hiring is no longer linear to the growth of companies.

Also, fresher hiring is distributed ie a centre in Plano, Munich or the UK is just as important for hiring as the Indian market is.

""...the focus is more on demand-based hiring instead of creating an inventory,"" he explained.

Talking about high attrition rates at the firm, Bhat said the company is concerned about attrition of key talent, but is it something that wouldn't impact its ability to execute.

""As of now it is still probably under control and we will continue to monitor it closely,"" he added.

Tech Mahindra reported attrition at 19 per cent (last 12 month basis), while utilisation levels were at 81 per cent (including trainees).

Tech Mahindra COO L Ravichandran said the company is looking at different kinds of training and very specific online-based training, so that the trainees can become billable very quick.

""...so you are not going to see huge number of headcount increase and we continuously hire some specific skills both in India and overseas... I do not want it (hiring) to become linear and we want to push ourselves to deliver more with less number of people,"" he added.",374,-0.9939250349998474

HDFC Securities's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra delivered poor revenue growth in 1QFY19 while margin performance was better than expected. Revenue stood at USD 1,224mn (-1.6% QoQ, +0.3% CC), vs our estimate of USD 1,228mn. Enterprise (+1.8%, +3.8% CC QoQ) continue to drive growth led by traction in Manufacturing (+2.5% QoQ) and BFSI (+2.9%). Digital (27% of rev, +30% YoY) is growing in-line with industry average and is driving enterprise growth. Telecom (39.6% of rev, -6.3% QoQ) is dragging overall revenue growth; however management sees it as a seasonal blip and expect recovery form 2QFY19E based on deal wins at the end of the quarter. Deal TCV stands at USD 260mn, out of which ~50% is Telecom.

Outlook

We’ve factored USD revenue growth of 7.6/10.6% for FY19/20E, implying revenue CQGR of 3.2/2.2% for FY19/20E and factored EBITDA% at 16.7/17.1%. Maintain BUY with a TP of Rs 740 based on 15x FY20E EPS.

Tech Mahindra posted results below analyst expectations on July 30, but Chief Financial Officer Manoj Bhat said that he was confident of growth in the company's telecommunications business.

The Mumbai-headquartered firm posted a consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 898 crore, a 26.5 percent sequential fall in the first-quarter was against analysts' average estimate of Rs 912.6 crore. PAT in the previous quarter was Rs 1,222 crore.

The IT services giant reported 2.8 percent quarter-on-quarter growth in revenue at Rs 8,276 crore in rupee terms compared to Rs 8,054.5 crore in the previous quarter. Revenue grew 12.8 percent YoY.

Analysts polled by Reuters, on average, expected Rs 8,185.7 crore in revenue.

The company also announced that its Vice-Chairman Vineet Nayyar has decided to retire.

CP Gurnani, , Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Tech Mahindra said: “Although Vineet has decided to retire, he will continue to be our guiding force.""

He added, “I would also like to welcome on – board our new Chief People Officer Harshvendra Soin.""

It reported a dollar revenue of $1,224.1 million, up 7.5% on-year basis and down 1.6% sequentially.

""The overall business growth trajectory for FY19 is on track. While business seasonality has affected the current quarter, our Run Change Grow Strategy with strong focus on digital transformation is keeping the business buoyant. The changing demand landscape for next generation technologies is going to fuel the digital business further,"" said Gurnani.

The first quarter is seasonally weak for Tech Mahindra because of weakness in its Comviva business, which also drags down margins, analysts at Kotak Institutional Securities said in a pre-earnings note.

Bhat agreed that the results were affected by seasonality, but said the enterprise and communications verticals were doing better.

The company reported 39.6 percent revenue from its largest vertical- communications.

""In telecom, we have gone through a period where we will re-look our business lines and service offerings. We did prune down our business but our...run-change-grow strategy is working. There is a bit of a lag effect, but we remain confident that telecom will grow,"" he said.

EBIT margin in the first quarter was 13 percent 80 bps lower than 13.8 percent in the previous quarter.

Bhat said margin was also likely to improve during the year on the back of digital revenue growth. While the company did not disclose revenue from digital, Bhat said Tech Mahindra was on track to achieve 40 percent revenues from digital by next year.

EBIT margin was impacted for most large players this quarter because of wage hikes and visa costs, partially offset by a strong US dollar.

IT attrition at the end of June was at 19 percent as against 18 percent in the last quarter.

Tech Mahindra, the country's fifth-largest information technology services company, will report its earnings for the quarter ended June on Monday, July 30.

Analysts polled by Reuters, on average, expect the company to report revenue of Rs 8,185.7 crore for the quarter under review, and a net profit of Rs 912.6 crore.

The Mumbai-based IT services company reported revenue of Rs 8,054.5 crore in the March quarter, and a dollar revenue of over $1.24 billion. Its net for the quarter was Rs 1,222 crore.

Market participants will keep a weather eye open for any cues in the company's commentary on the following:

Revenue:

June is a seasonally weak quarter for Tech Mahindra, in Comviva revenue, which is its value-added services business for mobile operators. So any commentary about Comviva will be key, according to Kotak Institutional Equities.

Profit:

Analysts at Motilal Oswal expect the company's net profit to decline 24 percent quarter on quarter to Rs 930 crore, primarily due to weak operational performance and lower other income.

Margins:

Tech Mahindra's margins are expected to be impacted by visa costs and wage hikes, partially offset by the weakness in the rupee. However, analysts at Dolat Analysis and Research see better scope for margin improvement because of better utilization and a change in business mix.

The company's operating profit margin for the previous quarter was 13.8 percent, the lowest among large-cap IT services providers.

Telecom business:

Tech Mahindra's strongest suit has been its telecom business, but the company has witnessed a drop in revenue from its top client in the sector.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities will keep an eye out for the copmany's outlook on demand, especially for the telecom vertical.

Analysts at Motilal Oswal said they would also watch for any comments about expectations of a 5G-led pick up in telecom.

Digital business:

Market participants will watch out for commentary on the company's digital business.

In the March quarter, the segment accounted for over 26 percent of the company's overall revenue, and Tech Mahindra has said it is on track to achieve its long-term goal of bringing in half its total revenue from the digital business.",366,-0.27728251616160077

Last week, Nifty witnessed a fall of 107 points (down 1 percent) at 10,714.3 and the Sensex was down 266.12 points (0.74 percent) at 35,423.48. India's volatility index (India VIX) rose 7.6 percent last week, while BSE Smallcap index declined 3 percent, BSE Midcap down 2.4 percent, and the largecap index shed 1 percent.

The Indian markets on Friday jumped most in a month, mirroring a bounce in global equities as investor sentiment improved after two days of turbulent selling. The risk-off bets eased after the dollar weakened and China relaxed restrictions on foreign investments.

The rupee rebounded 0.5 percent, the most since June 2, to end at 68.45 against the dollar. A day earlier the rupee had touched a lifetime low of 69.09 amid a spike in global crude prices. Finance Minister Piyush Goyal sought to calm frayed nerves, saying there was no need for any ‘knee-jerk reaction’ to deal with the fall in the rupee.

Brent crude traded around $78 per barrel levels, after gaining over 5 percent during the week. Oil prices dipped on Friday amid escalating trade friction between the United States and other major economies, although crude markets remain tight due to supply disruptions and generally high demand.

Ajcon’s viewTrade wars have impacted global markets, with $1.7 trillion of market capitalisation getting wiped out since June 12. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold shares worth Rs 157 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) pumped in Rs 2,260 crore.

The rupee has touched its all-time low against the dollar last week. It has been one of the worst performing currencies among peers. Against the dollar, it has depreciated 7.1 percent since January. Historically, market returns have been poor in a year when the Indian currency has depreciated against the dollar and vice versa.

We believe most quality names are available in the largecap space at a good valuation. After the massive destruction in midcaps and smallcaps, one can consider companies where FY18 earnings have been strong, backed by an ethical management. Many of these smaller companies are expected to perform better in FY19.

Here is the list of three stocks that can give 11-30 percent return by FY19:

Mahanagar Gas (MGL): Buy | Target - Rs 1,076 | Return - 30%

Mahanagar Gas's long-term city gas distribution (CGD) business outlook looks very positive in view of the following factors: Favorable regulatory environment addressing previous bidding round impediments with forward looking and investor friendly reforms.

Likely surge in the natural gas demand due to increased awareness about pollution and commitment of the Government of India at COP21. Rising population and rapid urbanisation, strong policy framework and guidelines in terms of CGD footprint expansion, mission PNG, smart cities, green corridors, etc., and the developments of CGD network in over 326 cities by 2022 and the ninth round of CGD bidding round called by PNGRB offering 86 new geographical areas in 174 districts, which will cover almost 29 percent of India’s population.

Our conviction on the company stems from the fact that CNG is most preferred fuel by auto consumers as it is priced around 60 percent discount to petrol and 45 percent discount to diesel.

We like the company considering its Monopoly status in CNG space – Mumbai and adjoining areas, extensive supply network built over 20 years, infrastructure exclusivity Mumbai – upto 2020, adjoining areas – upto 2030, Raigad – upto – 2040 underpenetrated market with significant potential for expansion, robust infrastructure in place to support future growth, favourable regulatory environment, focused growth strategy in place, significant entry barriers for competitors to enter into its area of operation such as infrastructure exclusivity, requirement of large investments to establish a natural gas distribution network, lead time in allocation of domestic natural gas and obtaining the required regulatory approvals.

Natural gas penetration in Maharashtra is around 30 percent implying huge growth potential. Given the rising awareness of CNG and PNG’s benefits over alternative fuels, we believe MGL’s volume outlook remains optimistic. During FY18, MGL was able to add an additional 20 CNG stations and upgraded 14 stations, the capacity of which went up. With this, MGL added almost 3.44 lakhs kgs per day of compression capacities and its cumulative compression capacity stands at 30.80 lakh kg/day. At present, MGL operates 223 CNG stations, supplying CNG to more than 609000 vehicles with a steel pipeline network of 5,042 kms as of now.To tap the big opportunity presented in this sector, the Company is aggressively looking to increase its CNG stations by 20 in FY19E.

In the Piped Natural Gas (PNG) space, the Company added around 1.6 lakh domestic consumers in FY18 taking the tally to around 10.3 lakh customers. The Company has added over 440 industrial and commercial consumers and has over 3,600 industrial and commercial consumers as of now. Going forward, MGL plans to only add to its current rate of household additions per year under its domestic PNG segment. The Government of India recently came out with auctions for 86 new geographical areas under the PNGRB bidding for which MGL has been one of the key bidders targeting ~20 cities.

We expect the Company to post strong volume growth going ahead led by increase in CNG consumption both in auto and PNG space. Geographical expansion to Raigad & Karjat and Government’s push for PNG’s domestic connections will support volume growth. The Company has also recently hiked CNG prices which would help its operating margins to improve and which would be evident in FY19.

Post significant correction witnessed owing to concerns like stake sale by BG Asia Pacific Holding Private Limited ultimately owned by Royal Dutch Shell, higher raw material cost and rupee depreciation, the Company at CMP of Rs. 828 (Face Value: Rs. 10), is attractively valued at 17x at reported FY18 EPS of R. 48.38. The Company enjoys decent return ratios (ROE: 22.8 percent and ROCE of 31.9 percent) with equity capital of Rs. 98.8 crores.

Aegis Logistics: Buy | Target - Rs 270 | Return - 27%

The company is a leading LPG sourcing player and is a robust play on LPG import market as it is capturing complete value chain of Logistics right from gas sourcing, shipping, terminalling, distribution to industrial, commercial and auto gas stations. LPG demand in the country is expected to rise owing to the Upsurge in gas connections under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Scheme by the government. According to PPAC, consumption of LPG in India stood at 21,537,000 MT in FY17 whereas imports of LPG in India stood at 11,026,000 MT. The incremental demand in LPG is met through imports. Increasing LPG imports will require new terminal capacity which augurs well for Aegis Logistics.

Aegis has entered into a Joint Venture for its Singapore based LPG sourcing and supply business with ITOCHU Petroleum Co., (Singapore) Pte Ltd. Aegis Logistics Ltd. sold 40 percent of its equity ownership in its wholly owned subsidiary, Aegis Group International Pte. Ltd. Singapore, to ITOCHU Petroleum Co., (Singapore) Pte Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of ITOCHU Corporation for a total consideration of $ 5.85 mn. With this JV, the Company attained cost leadership in the LPG import market.

The Company has recently completed implementation of two fully refrigerated tanks of static storage capacity of 25,000 MT with a throughput capacity of 2.5 mn MT and a LPG bottling plant at Haldia at a Project cost of Rs. 250 crores and Rs. 25 crores respectively financed through internal accruals completed in Q3FY18. The Company has signed 20 years of MOU with a large PSU as the anchor customer at the current market throughput rates for use of this terminal. In Q3FY18, the Company has completed debottlenecking of Mumbai LPG terminals with static capacity of 20,000 MT and throughput capacity of 1.1m MT (incremental 0.4m MT) at a cost of Rs 15 crs financed through internal accruals. Brownfield Capacity expansion at Pipavav has been completed too in Q3FY18 with a static capacity of 10,200 MT and throughput capacity of 0.8mn MT at full utilization at a project cost of Rs. 75 crores financed by internal accruals. Throughput volumes for LPG handled in Pipavav expected to grow through existing and new customer relationships. LPG capacity, post-expansion, static capacity for FY18 stands at 63,300MT and throughput capacity stands at 5,000,000MT.

The total revenues for FY18 stood at Rs. 4,791 crores versus Rs. 3,939 crores year earlier that is a rise of 22 percent for consolidated Aegis group revenues. EBITDA rose by 24 percent on yoy basis to touch Rs. Rs. 306 crores in FY18. Profit after tax witnessed a growth of 57 perxent to Rs. 214 crores in FY18.

As far as the Gas Terminal division is concerned, the topline increased by 22 .4 percent to Rs. 4,622 crores in FY18. FY18 EBITDA for the division grew by 30 percent to Rs. 203 crores. The most important segment in the LPG volumes is obviously the LPG throughput terminal logistics volumes. For the year, the Company clocked a growth of 29 percent to 1,742,467 metric tonnes volumes of LPG handled at 3 terminals in Mumbai, Haldia and Pipavav. LPG sourcing volumes for the year were 1,176,598 metric tonnes versus year earlier 1,043,067 metric tonnes, a rise of 13 percent. The Packed LPG Commercial Cylinder business saw a yoy growth of 8 percent to 13,504 metric tonnes. Bulk industrial distribution sales of LPG witnessed a yoy growth of 71 percent to 40,232 metric tonnes as it signed up new customers. Autogas volumes stood at 24,150 metric tonnes for the year versus 23,217 metric tonnes year earlier, a rise of 4 percent. The key driver of rising LPG profit in the division was the LPG terminal logistics volumes which increased by 29 percent for the year. The Management expects a major boost to the LPG terminal volumes in FY 2019 because of full year operations of the Haldia terminal. This Haldia terminal was commissioned only in Q3 of FY 2018. But in FY 2019, the Company will see the full year benefit of the Haldia sales volumes.

With regards to Liquid division, the revenues registered a growth of 9 percent on yoy basis to Rs. 168 crores. EBITDA for liquid division saw a growth of 13 percent to Rs. 103 crores. The future growth will depend on new capacity, in Kandla, Haldia, and Mangalore, which is coming up.

At CMP of Rs. 213 (Face value: Re. 1), the stock trades at a P/E of 33x at FY18 EPS of Rs. 6.38. We expect an upside of 27 percent with a target price of Rs. 270 (30x at estimated FY19 EPS of Rs. 9).

Tech Mahindra: Buy | Target - Rs 730 | Return - 11%

Tech Mahindra registered growth of 5.6 percent on yoy basis in FY18 R.s 307.73 billion while EBIDTA for FY18 grew by 12.6 per cent with EBIDTA margins touching 15.3 per cent. “It’s been a great year of execution despite volatilities in the market place. Our customer accolades and various recognitions for sustainability reflect well on our long term strategy for growth,” said Vineet Nayyar, Vice Chairman, Tech Mahindra. The Company’s growth was mainly led by enterprise business in Q4FY18. In Q4FY18, the Company witnessed excellent set of numbers . Revenues registered an increase of 3.6 percent on qoq basis. Revenue in Dollar terms grew by 2.9 percent qoq to USD1,244.3 mn. EBITDA witnessed a qoq growth of 11.7 percent to Rs. 1,412 crs. EBITDA margin expanded by 120bps qoq to 17.5 percent in Q4FY18. PAT increased by 29.6 percent qoq to Rs. 1,222 crores. Going ahead, Enterprise is expected to drive growth of the company in the year ahead. Growth in communication segment is likely to be subdued in FY19 while it may improve in FY20E on the back of rollout & increasing spend on 5G. Commenting on the Q4 performance, CP Gurnani, Managing Director& CEO of Tech Mahindra said “Continued focus on operational metrics has led to improved performance though the year. Growth in digital areas is particularly encouraging. We remain focused on delivering value to our customers, while helping our employees FUTURise with constant innovation in the digital world.”

The Company witnessed a reduction in its overall headcount in FY18 and pushed for higher utilization. Its overall headcount (software plus BPO business) declined by 4,886 over the previous fiscal. Employee headcount stood at 112,807 in FY18 vs. 117,693 in FY17, a decline of 4886 employees. IT Attrition (LTM) increased 100 bps to 18 percent QoQ while utilisation (excluding trainees) improved 100 bps sequentially to 84 percent The most noticeable difference in headcount is in the software arm which shed the size by 9,966 employees to touch 72,437 employees in FY18 as against 82,403 employees in FY17. The reduced headcount helped the company improve utilisation by 70 basis points to an all-time high of 84 per cent in Q4 of FY18 when compared with the corresponding quarter in FY17. Interestingly, the company’s utilisation including trainees also stood at the same level as trainees were absorbed into projects rapidly. During this period, attrition on last twelve months (LTM) basis, has only increased from 17 per cent to 18 per cent. In FY18, other IT peers namely- Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, and HCL Technologies – though saw a moderate headcount growth, had together added 13,972 employees (taking into consideration the number of people exited in the year) to their workforce, compared to 59,427 in the previous fiscal. Apart from Tech Mahindra, Bengaluru-headquartered Wipro also witnessed a reduction in its headcount by 1654 employees in the fiscal.

“Earlier, revenue (growth) was proportional to manpower but today the nature of the business will be cyclical when it comes to manpower. It doesn’t mean that jobs are not being created. If we are doing more digital transformation deals, then the headcount will vary,” CP Gurnani, CEO & MD of Tech Mahindra said post the company’s Q4 results. While he did not give a projection on headcount, he said the manpower requirement would continue tapering as system operations move from initial development stage to more stable phases. The management has however said that fresher hiring will continue. Going ahead, the Management is confident of improvement in EBIT margin in FY19.

With the tailwind of Rupee depreciation, the company is also expected to face some headwinds owing to rolling out of phased wage hikes to employees over the first two quarters. However, the company is expected to mitigate some of these impacts with increased automation and an optimal mix of offshoring, outsourcing and near-shoring.

With regards to its clients, after four consecutive quarters of de-growth, revenues from top five customers (23.2 percent of revenue) grew 2.9 percent QoQ. Top 11-20 customers registered decent growth of 13.4 percent in Q4FY18. Non-top 20 accounts grew 1.6 percent sequentially. The management alluded that top five/10 accounts, which witnessed de-growth in FY18, could perform better in FY19E. From a client metrics view, it was steady during the quarter with active clients increasing by 10 sequentially to 913. Cash & cash eq. stood at Rs. 7,774 crore as of March 31, 2018.

At CMP of Rs. 655 (Face Value: Rs. 5), the stock trades at a P/E of 15x on FY18 EPS of Rs. 42.7. We expect a target price of Rs. 730 by FY19 end (15x on estimated FY19 EPS OF Rs. 49) implying an upside of 11 percent).

Technology stocks rallied smartly on Wednesday, with the IT index gaining over a percent after the rupee touched fresh 19-month low of 68.54 against the dollar.

Tech Mahindra was the biggest gainer among IT stocks, rising more than 2 percent while KPIT Technologies, TCS and HCL Technologies rallied over a percent. Infosys was up 0.8 percent.

These software companies earned major revenues through exports, so the weaker rupee is always favourable for them.

The Indian currency plunged as much as 30 paise in the morning on strong month-end dollar demand from importers and banks amid sustained foreign capital outflows.

A year after it drew flak on social media for the callous sacking of an employee, Tech Mahindra has again been accused of unfairly terminating the services of some of its employees.

Last week, the Chennai-based IT employees wing of labour union New Democratic Labour Front posted a release on its website claiming that 1,500 employees were laid off at Tech Mahindra, without due processes being followed.

A Tech Mahindra spokesperson denied the developments related to layoffs.

""Tech Mahindra has added 1700 associates in the ongoing quarter. Our endeavour is to build a digital workforce of the future. We will continue to focus on reskilling and right skilling our employees to keep pace with the changing technologies and dynamic market needs. As a policy driven company, we adhere to global standards and processes pertaining to our human resource,” the company said in an e-mail response to Moneycontrol’s queries.

Moneycontrol spoke to several of these employees to hear their version of the events.

Most of them had a similar story to tell. With work experience ranging from seven to 15 years, these Pune-based employees say they were wrongfully given low ratings, not given a hearing and asked to quit after signing a separation agreement and two months full salary.

“The management has created fake performance issues. We had mid-term appraisals where positive feedback was given. Now in the annual appraisal, all that has turned negative and we have been handed an “L” rating,” said an employee.

Tech Mahindra’s rating system follows an “XCEL” model, where X is the best or extraordinary performance rating, while L is the lowest. Last year, the ""X"" was scrapped as the company moved away from the bell-curve model.

All the employees Moneycontrol spoke to said they were referred to a “grievance panel” that was tasked with giving the employees a chance to explain why they feel they were unfairly treated.

“It was just a formality. They answered none of our questions and gave us little clarity about how and why we were given L ratings,” said another employee.

Some employees complained of having a positive track record and learning ability but were still given the lowest rating.

“My immediate manager called and told me he had given me a “C”, which is the average performance rating. He also had no clarity on how and why that was changed to L. The appraisal process is very opaque,” said another employee who had been with the company for over six years.

Some are delaying meeting their human resource managers because they know what the meeting will end in signing the separation agreement and quitting on the spot.

“If you do not sign the separation papers, they call the guards, take your badge and you have to leave there and then. You won’t be given any salary as full and final settlement either,” said another of the employees.

The separation agreement, a copy of which was seen by Moneycontrol, says that “it has been mutually agreed that the Associate shall cease to be in employment of the Company with immediate effect i.e. from the date of signing of this agreement” subject to some terms laid out by Tech Mahindra.

The agreement says the employee will be paid 70 percent of their two months’ salary and 30 percent subject to tax obligations at the time of full and final settlement.

“That (the severance pay) is a good thing at least,” said one of the employees who was asked to sign one such contract.

Ordinarily, employees with a low performance rating have the option of being put on a performance improvement plan (PIP).

Tech Mahindra has a detailed PIP, a copy of which was seen by Moneycontrol.

According to the policy, employees on contractual rolls and those on “business wait and awaiting project placement” are not eligible for PIP.

Most of the employees who have been asked to leave were on either business wait or bench.

“I was put on bench in February because my previous manager said it was “too easy” for me. I was interviewed by more than three project managers who were interested in taking me on, but the HR blocked my profile for 45 days, and refused to unblock me despite my repeated emails and reminders. Around 15 May, I saw my status in the system had changed to audit and review,” said one of the employees quoted above.

The NDLF, which first wrote about the issue, said they had been contacted by 30 employees about such unfair layoffs so far.

“We advise them about legal rights of employees and ask them to resist forced resignations. Those who are already out of company to file petition under section 2A of Industrial Disputes Act. And those who are still in the company to form a group and file grievance petition under section 2K of Industrial Disputes Act,” said NDLF IT Employees Wing secretary Sugendiran.

The association feels the real reason for these “forced resignations” is a drive to cut costs by sacking employees.

“The IT industry has been struggling, and employees are only told what they need to know. Mostly, only the non-performers and non-adapters are asked to leave, but for every genuine case, there are a few unfair ones as well,” said a legal expert in IT related labour law cases on the condition of anonymity.

The IT industry has been grappling with a difficult business environment for many quarters now. Revenues from its traditional outsourcing business has been declining, while only a few companies have been able to grow their digital business revenues meaningfully, so far.

According to a recent report by professional investment information and credit rating agency ICRA, the aggregate growth of Indian IT Services companies (13 sample companies) was at 3.9 percent during the fourth quarter of the last fiscal, compared to compounded annual growth rate of 17.1 percent in the four year period between FY2013-2017 and a 4.2 percent growth in last fiscal year.

The industry has been impacted by factors including the macro-economic environment, lower deal sizes in digital technologies, cloud adoption and high competitive intensity from local as well as international players, according to ICRA.

The legal expert added that labour laws in India are a state subject- every state has its own rules- but overall, they are quite employee friendly.

However, given the way IT companies are structured, getting embroiled with the Labour authorities will impact their business in terms of time and effort.

“The situation is further complicated by the fact that IT companies in India have offices across States, and if a number of people from a project are asked to leave across five locations, they will have to deal with five different Labour authorities,” she said.

The companies are usually accommodating- they will increase the notice period or pay a little more as part of separation agreements, but employees cannot be asked to quit immediately, she added.

Meanwhile, a company spokesperson said: ""At Tech Mahindra we are deeply concerned with attempts at speculation and misrepresentation of facts in the media relating to our employees. Tech Mahindra has zero tolerance policy on such matters, we are cognizant of our responsibilities and pledge to continue to create awareness among the masses regarding such falsehoods.""",1216,-0.7681245870060391

KR Choksey's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra reported good set of numbers in Q4 FY18, which were above our estimates in terms of revenue as well as margins. Dollar revenue was reported at $1,244 Mn (+2.9% QoQ) that is above our estimate of $1,233 Mn. EBIT margin reported at 13.8% (+108 bps QoQ) driven by improvement in operational levers: improved utilization 84% (100 bps QoQ), increase in realization from IT services (+3.8% QoQ) and controlled employee expenditure.

Outlook

We have estimated the company's top-line to grow by 10.1%/8.3% in FY19E/FY20E. At a CMP of 703, the company is trading at a P/E of 16.8x and 15.1x in FY19E and FY20E respectively. We recommend a ”BUY” rating to the stock and assign a multiple of 17.5x to its FY20E EPS of INR 46.7 to come up at a target price of 817, an upside of 16% against CMP.

ICICI Direct's research report on Tech Mahindra

US$ revenues grew 2.9% QoQ to $1244.3 million, broadly in line with our expectation of 2.5% growth and $1,239 million estimate Rupee revenues grew 3.6% QoQ to Rs 8,054.5 crore, above our Rs 7,973.4 crore estimate At 17.5%, EBITDA margins expanded 120 bps QoQ, way above our estimate of 16.7% and 40 bps expansion. Higher-than-expected margin expansion was mainly on account of a reduction in employee cost as a percentage of revenue (down 110 bps QoQ at 68.1%) Reported PAT of Rs 1,222 crore was way above our Rs 874.5 crore estimate led by better-than-expected margin and lower tax rate (18.6% in Q4FY18 vs. 21.8% in Q3FY18) The board has proposed a dividend of Rs 14 per share.

Outlook

Tech Mahindra (TechM) reported its Q4FY18 earnings wherein dollar revenue growth was broadly in line with our estimates while EBITDA margins were way ahead of our expectation. Enterprise continues to drive growth for TechM (19% YoY in FY18) while communication business softness still persists (-0.6% YoY in FY18). Going ahead, Tech Mahindra’s margin trajectory may improve from FY18 levels owing to employee pyramid, turnaround in performance of subsidiaries along with cost productivity enhancements. However, positives seem to be priced in the current price (~48% run up in the last six months). Also, the softness in communication continues to persist Hence, we maintain our HOLD rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 735 (15x FY20E EPS).For all recommendations report, click here

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra delivered a strong set of results for 4QFY18 with revenue, EBIDTA margin and PAT above our estimates. Revenues at USD1244 mn were up 2.9% QoQ and above our ests (PLe: USD1240mn). Constant currency growth for the quarter stood at 1.7% QoQ. Telecom vertical (41.6% of total revenues) remained flat QoQ while Enterprise vertical (58.4% of total revenues) grew by 4.9% QoQ. EBIDTA margin at 17.5% was up 128bps QoQ and 550bps YoY and above our ests (PLe: 16.7%). PAT at Rs 12,220mn was 25% above our estimates. Strong PAT beat was also led by higher other income (led by one-off exceptional income from sale of land and higher forex gains) as well as lower tax rate for the quarter. Company continues to trim Employee count. Total Headcount came at 112,807 employees which is net reduction of 2,434 employees QoQ. IT service headcount came at 72,437 employees for 4QFY18 which is down 12% YoY. We believe that Headcount reduction and improvement in margins of subsidiaries (LCC and Comviva) have aided turnaround in margin trajectory in FY18.

Outlook

Tech M delivered 9.6% USD revenue growth in FY18 (5.7% organic growth and rest owing to acquisitions). Organic constant currency growth for FY18 would be 3.9% YoY owing to softness in telecom vertical led by pruning LCC business. We expect Tech M to deliver 9.5/9.7% USD revenue growth for FY19/FY20E (vs 9.7/9.9% modeled earlier). Led by 4Q margin beat and currency reset (USD vs INR) to lower levels, we upgrade EBIDTA margin assumptions to 16.9/17.3% for FY19E/FY20E (vs 15.5/16% modeled earlier). Our EPS estimates are upped by 11.6/8% for FY19/FY20E to Rs 46.5/51/sh predominately led by margin upgrade. Stock trades at 13.8x FY20E EPS. TP raised by 12% to Rs760/sh (15x FY20E EPS vs 14.5x FY20E EPS earlier). Tech M stock has delivered strong return of 63% over the past one year predominantly led by margin recovery which drove earnings upgrade. With 4QFY18 EBIDTA margin at 17.5%, we believe margin expansion has reached fag end. Recovery in growth in Telecom vertical is key from hereon. Retain BUY.

Global brokerage firms such as Goldman Sachs, CLSA, and Morgan Stanley raised their 12-month target price for Tech Mahindra post Q4 results, after its net profit grew by 29.6 percent to Rs 1,222 crore compared to Rs 943.1 crore in the last quarter.

The Mumbai-based IT services firm reported 3.6 percent growth in revenue at Rs 8,054.5 crore in rupee terms as against Rs 7,776 crore (QoQ). It reported a dollar revenue of USD 1,244.3 million.

The most aggressive 12-month target for Tech Mahindra was set up by Goldman Sachs of 880 which translates into a gain/upside of 23 percent from Friday’s closing price of Rs 714 on the BSE.

Analysts polled by Reuters, on average, had expected Rs 79,928 crore in revenue and profit of Rs 9,408 crore.

The company also said Milind Kulkarni, the Chief financial officer will retire as the CFO on 31 May 2018. Manoj Bhat will take over as the CFO from June 1. And, the board recommended a dividend of Rs 14 per share on par value of Rs 5 (280%) for the financial year ended March 31, 2018.

We have collated views from different brokerage firms on Tech Mahindra post Q4 results:

Goldman Sachs: Buy| Target raised to Rs 880 from Rs 824 earlier.

Goldman Sachs maintains a buy rating on Tech Mahindra post Q4 results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 880 from Rs 824 earlier.

The Q4 results were above expectations on continued margin beat. The entire topline growth was led by enterprise business in Q4. Going forward, 5G remains a key structural growth opportunity for Tech Mahindra, said the report.

Macquarie: Neutral| Target Rs 670

Macquarie maintains a neutral rating on Tech Mahindra post Q4 results with a target price of Rs 670. The Q4 profits were above estimates due to forex gains and profit on the sale of land.

The global investment bank expects the EBIT margin normalisation to continue. The outlook for the telecom business remains muted and 5G spends are at least a year away.

CLSA: SELL| Raise target price to Rs 600 from Rs 540 earlier

CLSA maintains a sell rating on Tech Mahindra but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 600 from Rs 540 earlier. The global investment bank maintains sell largely on growth concerns.

The Q4 saw in-line revenue despite the telecom drag. Stellar margin expansion continued which helped Tech Mahindra post good results. However, CLSA expects it to lag the growth recovery in FY19-20. It lifted its target multiple to 13.5x 1-year forward.

Morgan Stanley (MS): Overweight| Raise target to Rs 800 from Rs 675

Morgan Stanley maintains an overweight rating on Tech Mahindra post Q4 results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 800 from Rs 675 earlier.

The March quarter results were good and the momentum building for FY19 is likely to continue as the worst in communication vertical is behind us, said the note.

Tech Mahindra saw a strong momentum in enterprise vertical to continue. Morgan Stanley expects margin to improve to 16.8 percent in FY19 and expects EBITDA CAGR of 17 percent over FY18-20.

Benchmark indices declined for a fourth straight session on Friday, amid developments in the US-China trade negotiations and firm crude prices. The Sensex ended at 34,848, down 301 points. The broader Nifty index settled at 10,605, down 78 points. Among sectoral indices, the Nifty Bank index fell as much as 0.6 percent, extending its drop into the third session.

ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank declined 2.9 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. The Nifty PSU Bank index also shed 1.6 percent, its fourth consecutive session of fall, on continued concerns about disappointing quarterly results due to a jump in bad loan provisions.

In the global markets, Asian stocks were steady on Friday, while the dollar is perched near its five month peak after the benchmark US Treasury yield hit its highest in seven years.

Technical outlook

Nifty

The Nifty opened flat to negative and continued its down move, closing lower. It has closed below its short-term 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). It is heading towards 10,530 zones which might work as immediate demand zones. On the weekly chart, the relative strength index (RSI) (14) has given a negative crossover around 65 zones which is a bearish sign. Range expansion indicator is trading at 96 levels, thus suggesting that Nifty may enter into a consolidation phase.

Bank Nifty

The Nifty Bank has formed a kind of bullish hammer pattern around its short-term 20 EMA, which stands around the 25,800 zone: its immediate support zone. Decisive trade below this may drag the index lower till 25,450. On the weekly chart, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is on the verge of a negative crossover and RSI (14) is in bearish mode. According to Relative Comparative chart, the index should outperform benchmarks in the near-term.

Below are top five stocks that can return up to 5% in the near-term:

Karnataka Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 125, stop loss: Rs 117, Return: 4%

The Nifty ended Wednesday 0.41 percent lower at 10,570.55. For the third consecutive session, it continued to oscillate below 10,640 levels. Ending the session with a bearish body candle stands invalid as long as it remains stuck in the price band of 10,640 to 10,530. Hence, buying on dips around 10,530 and 10,480 can again be seen. On the flipside, 10,640 on the upside still remains the critical hurdle before a rise towards 10,670 levels.

On the Nifty hourly chart, negative divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still intact, which may continue to building selling pressure on a rise around 10,640 levels. Downside supports for the index are placed around 10,530 and 10,480 levels.

Nifty patterns on multiple timeframes shows that it continues to oscillate below 10,640 levels. Rangebound movement with a positive bias may not be that encouraging for the bulls. Hence, cautious trading is advised. However, sector and stock specific volatility is going to be the dominant feature ahead of today’s April series futures and options (F&O) expiry.

The Bank Nifty on Wednesday ended 0.91 percent lower at 24,814.40 levels. Immediate pivotal support is placed around 24,700and 24,550 levels, while the upside resistance stands around 24,900 and 25,100 mark.

Nifty monthly expiry outlook

Nifty April futures ended at Rs 10,569.05, a 1.5 points discount against spot Nifty (CMP: Rs 10,570.55). Huge long open interest (OI) in 10,550CE followed by minor long OI in 10,600CE and 10,650CE against short OI in 10,600PE and long OI in 10,650PE ahead of today’s expiry suggests that Nifty futures may remain subdued around 10,550 levels. Also, immediate resistance for Nifty futures is placed around 10,650 and is going to be a critical factor.

Nifty futures may see intraday buying on dips around 10,550 levels and continues to face resistance on a rise around 10,600 and 10,650 levels. On a similar note, the intraday trend is expected to remain positive within the broader trading band of 10,550 to 10,650. This view is subject to change if and only if it starts moving decisively below 10,550 levels.

Bank Nifty monthly expiry outlook

Bank Nifty futures ended Wednesday at Rs 24,779.95, a 34 points discount against spot Bank Nifty (CMP: Rs 24,814.4). Huge long OI build up in 24,700CE and 24,800CE followed by 24,900CE against minor long OI build up in 25,000CE and 25,100CE ahead of today’s expiry suggests that index future is likely to hold downside support placed around 24,700 levels.

Bank Nifty futures may see intraday buying on dips around 24,700 levels and continues to face resistance on a rise around 25,000 and 25,100 levels. On a similar note, the intraday trend is expected to remain positive within the broader trading band of 24,700 to 25,100 levels. This view changes if the Bank Nifty future starts moving decisively below 24,700 levels.

Based on thorough technical study, the research firm recommends Tech Mahindra which can offer up to five percent return in the near short-term.

Tech Mahindra | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 725 | Stop loss: Rs 665 | Return: 5%

The stock ended Wednesday just above its short-term upward trend line support placed around Rs 680 levels. The broader uptrend is still very much intact. Any occasional correction towards critical supports should be used as a buying opportunity. Rising positive OI in tandem with a rising trend makes the bull case even stronger. Based on above mentioned observations, we recommend Tech Mahindra as a buy on dips for the short-term, with an upside target of Rs 725 per share.

Q) The Nifty50 rose over 1.4% for the week ended 13 April 2018 despite wild movements in either side. How do you see markets panning out in the coming week?

A) The near-term trend for the Nifty is still positive, and the index which is still sustaining above the hurdle of 10,450-480 levels for this week is likely to have a positive impact for next week. Hence, one may expect upside levels of 10,650 by next week.

Q) Nifty flirted closed above its 200-DMA, and 100-DMA in this past week, but there are plenty of stocks which are trading above their long-term average. Are these stocks a value buy at current levels?

A) We have witnessed a sharp upside bounce in Nifty in the last three weeks, and this has given a space for beaten down sectors to outperform.

This is going to be a temporary trading bounce, and there is a possibility of weakness in the market/broader market from the higher levels. Hence, outperformance in the stocks can be used for creating trading long positions by placing strict stop losses.

Q) What is your call on smallcap and midcap stocks? Should investors stay away or just book profits on rallies?

A) The main trend of mid and small cap sector is down, and the current upside bounce is expected to halt at the higher levels. An investor should stick to profit booking from the long trading positions at regular intervals

Q) What should be the ideal strategy of investors in April series – buy on dips or sell on rallies?

A) The near-term trend of Nifty is positive, and there is no indication of any exhaustion of current upside bounce in the market. One may continue with trading long positions in the index/stocks and ride a trend. Place strict stop loss.

Edelweiss Financial Services estimates the top five IT players—Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra to clock 1.1-2.2 percent QoQ constant currency revenue growth in Q4FY18. It is of the view that this will get a further 100-120bps cross-currency tailwind boost as major global currencies—GBP, EUR, AUD—appreciated versus USD QoQ.

While rupee appreciated a marginal 0.5 percent against USD, it depreciated vis-à-vis other global currencies and is likely to lead to 30-50bps margin tailwinds. Margins are expected to remain steady QoQ (up 20-50bps QoQ for top-5 players). While Edelweiss expects HCL Tech to lead the pack with 2.2 percent QoQ USD revenue growth (60bps inorganic), Infosys, Tech Mahindra, TCS and Wipro are estimated to clock 1.4 percent, 1.3 percent, 1.1 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.

Cross-currency tailwinds; BFSI and Europe under scanner

With pound, euro and Australian dollar appreciating 4.8 percent, 4.3 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, QoQ against US dollar, Edelweiss perceives cross-currency tailwinds of 100-120bps for top-five IT companies. While the research firm foresees growth uptick in BFSI for majority companies (except TCS), it expects commentary to be incrementally positive (especially by TCS) going forward.

With rising outsourcing in Europe, Edelweiss expects the geography to sustain its outperformance over North America and also expects FY19 revenue guidance for Infosys and HCLT at 6.5-8.5 percent and 8-10 percent, respectively. While Infosys is expected to maintain a conservative stance on guidance, it expect HCL Tech’s guidance to include inorganic portion of ~150bps.

Margins expected to remain steady

While closing rates indicate that rupee has depreciated 2 percent QoQ versus the US dollar, the quarterly average rate has appreciated 0.5 percent. But rupeee has depreciated 4.1 percent and 3.7 percent versus GBP and EUR, respectively, QoQ. Hence, the firm foresees positive 30-50bps margin movement for IT companies.

However, Edelweiss do not foresee pricing or cost pressures in existing or new deals. Accordingly, it estimates margins to remain broadly stable as automation and pyramid rationalisation efficiencies will be offset by higher onshore hiring.

Outlook: Revenue acceleration in FY19 on the cards

With improving economic outlook in US, higher adoption of outsourcing in Europe and digital services gaining scale, revenue acceleration looks certain for Indian IT companies. Also, Retail and Energy & Utility verticals have turned around and growth revival in BFSI fuels strong prospects for IT industry.

While mid caps are expected to outpace large peers during current quarter, Edelweiss perceives positive bias to large caps in the medium-to-long run as digital gains scale on account of execution capabilities. The house has maintained ‘BUY’ on Infosys, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra and ‘HOLD’ on TCS and Wipro.",449,0.963173660365018

“We estimate the top-5 IT players—Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra —to clock 1.1-2.2 percent quarter-on-quarter constant currency revenue growth in fourth quarter of full year 2018,” said Edelweiss analysts in a report.

The top four have posted between 1-2.5 percent sequential growth in the past quarter. Industry body Nasscom expects the IT industry to close the year with 7-8 percent growth for the financial year 2017-18.

The street will also look out for commentary on large banking and financial services deals, given the weakness in the sector in the last year or so, greater clarity on the traction in digital services and outsourcing exposure to Europe.

“IT spending of large banks is robust but is not translating into demand for Indian IT due to captive shift and insourcing. TCS, courtesy its large exposure, has been hit the most due to the change in sourcing strategy of banking clients,” noted analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities.

BFSI accounts for 34 percent of TCS' overall revenue, its largest vertical.

All eyes will also be on Infosys, whose CEO Salil Parekh is expected to announce the IT giant’s strategy in the fourth quarter results. After the tumultuous exit of the first non co-founder Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka, this will be the first quarter when his successor Parekh will talk about strategic options, which is much awaited and keenly watched out for.

“We expect Infosys to start the year by guiding for 6-8% growth in constant currency (which will be higher in reported dollar), and are currently pegging our estimate at the higher end of that band,” said analysts at Motilal Oswal in a note to clients.

Kotak Institutional Equities analysts said they expect the large companies to start off on a conservative note for revenue growth guidance for the coming year (FY 2019).

Analysts at Kotak also expect mid-tier companies such as Mindtree and L&T Infotech revenue to grow in the range of 2-3 percent in constant currency terms, led by share gains in existing large clients and benefits of large deals signed in the past 6-9 months.

In the December quarter, it became apparent that the midcaps were posting better growth than their larger peers as their investments in digital technologies begin to pay off. They also flagged the commentary on the allocation of budgets to projects, which normally picks pace in March and April as something to watch out for.

On the daily candlestick charts, it made a ‘Hammer’ like the pattern.

A Hammer is a bullish reversal pattern. It consists of no upper shadow, a small body, and long lower shadow which suggests that bulls pushed the index towards its opening levels towards the close of the trade.

The long lower shadow of the Hammer signifies that it tested its support where demand was located and then bounced back. The Nifty tested its 5-DEMA placed around 10,372.

As long as Nifty trades above 10,300 levels on closing basis, bulls have nothing to fear. Hence, for all the long positions, traders should keep a trailing stop loss of 10,300.

India VIX fell down marginally by 0.69 percent at 14.36. The volatility should decline below 13-13.50 to extend its recent bounce back move.

The Nifty closed at 10,410.9 on Wednesday. According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,358.03, followed by 10,305.17. If the index starts to move higher, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,442.03 and 10,473.17.

The Nifty Bank closed at 24,851.7 on Wednesday. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 24,594.37, followed by 24,337.03. On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 25,001.67, followed by 25,151.63.

The Nifty futures on the Singaporean stock exchange were trading lower by around 24.5 points at 10,405, a fall of around 0.23 percent. This indicates that the domestic market is likely to open on a flat to negative note.

By Rajesh Agarwal AUM Capital

Benchmark indices trimmed losses and closed marginally lower on Wednesday after banking stocks recovered. Shares fell for a second straight day following a weak trend in Asian equities after US stocks declined as President Donald Trump replaced his secretary of state.

In key economic data released on Wednesday, India's annual wholesale price inflation eased to 2.48 percent in February for the third straight month after touching an eight-month high in November, helped by a softer rise in food and fuel prices.

Technical Outlook

Nifty

Nifty has formed 'Hanging Man' followed by 'Shooting Star' candlestick pattern around supply zone of 10450-10490 levels on daily scale. It opened with gap-down but recovered from day's low and closed with loss of 15.95 points.

The index has to cross 10490 levels decisively to move higher and if it fails to cross this level, weakness could be seen towards 10290 and 10150 levels. Furthermore, RSI (14) has given a positive crossover which is a bullish sign.

Nifty Bank

The index has outperformed benchmarks led by strong short covering rally in PSU & Private banks after-market anticipated that RBI might cut key policy rates by 25 bps in August, which will lead to lending rate cuts, and in turn support growth.

It has formed Bullish candle and closed marginally above its 200 SMA of 24807 levels signifying a rally to continue in near term. But strong hurdle seen around 25100. It has to cross this level decisively to move further higher.

Below are the 5 stocks which can give up to 5% return in the near term:

Tech Mahindra | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 652, stop loss: Rs 628 | Return: 2%

Canara Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 272, stop loss: Rs 250 | Return: 5%

The Nifty ended 0.15 percent lower at 10,226.85 on the last trading session of the previous week. Early morning pullback found resistance around 10,300, day’s high was 10,296.70, followed by sell off in the later half towards making session lows.

Nifty failing to hold above the critical resistance of 10,280 followed by follow through selling led to a bearish candle at the end of session. However, the Index pull back towards 10,340 is likely as long as dual support zone of 10,140 and 10,100 is intact. Next critical resistance is placed around 10,400.

On the Nifty hourly chart, double bottom formation backed by recovery in RSI from its oversold zone is pointing towards continuation of this pullback towards 10,340. On a similar note, we don’t rule out the possibility of extension of this counter pullback touching 100 hourly EMA placed around 10,400.

Nifty patterns on multiple time frames show, this pullback towards 10,340, 10,400 in an extreme case, may again find sellers. Hence, staying cautious on rise is advised.

Last Friday, Bank Nifty ended at 24296.45 (down 0.74 percent). The levels of 24,600 and 24,850 are the next resistances. 200 daily EMA is placed around 24,480 which is the major support.

Based on thorough technical study, the stock below can give up to 8 percent return in the near-term:

Tech Mahindra: Rating Buy on dips around Rs 615 | (CMP- Rs 619.20) | Target: Rs 665 | Stop loss: Rs 590 | Return: 8%

Bullish flag pattern breakout followed by sustained consolidation above Rs 600 is an early indication of next leg of up-move towards higher resistances. The 30-daily EMA is placed around Rs 597 which may now act as the immediate pivotal support.

Trend following indicators like MACD and ADX on the weekly chart suggest that the stock is getting ready for the next leg of up-move towards Rs 665. Based on the above mentioned observations, we recommend Tech Mahindra as a strong buy on dips for the near-term upside target of Rs 665.

For the first time in history an Indian brand will appear on the Ferrari F1 car next season. The deal was made possible because of this companies association with the latter’s parent company in India. Which company?

Italian automotive design firm Pininfarina is eyeing USD 1 billion in revenues, in partnership with Tech Mahindra's engineering division, over the next 3-5 years.

The two companies together generate around USD 500 million a year from their design and engineering business.

Pininfarina CEO Silvio Pietro Angori expects the venture to grow to USD 1 billion in 3-5 years. ""When I say USD 1 billion, it is combining the engineering services of Tech Mahindra with our own business. So that is feasible,"" he told PTI on the sidelines of Geneva Motor Show.

Tech Mahindra currently owns around 76 percent stake in the Turin-based firm which is known for design work for iconic brands such as Ferrari, Maserati and Rolls-Royce.

At present, Pininfarina generates around 10 percent of the revenues from Italy, 30 percent from Europe, and the remaining 60 percent from rest of the world.

In India, the company is working with ""no more than two clients"" currently, Angori said.

Pininfarina, which became a part of the Mahindra group in late 2015, has been able to regain financial stability and is now looking to strengthen its non-automotive businesses as well.

In India, it is eyeing opportunities in sectors like railways, real estate and infrastructure development, Angori said.

When asked about Pininfarina's over two-year association with Mahindra group, Angori said the Indian firm has helped the company regain financial stability besides helping it to reach out to clients which were earlier out of reach.

""Mahindra group has given us financial stability and it has led us to unlock so much of the potential we had,"" Angori said.

Both the companies have the same values and founding principles and this has helped Pininfarina flourish, he added.

""We have around 110 clients and that number has increased in the last two years by about 20 percent,"" Angori said.

Commenting on the synergies with Tech Mahindra, he said that while Pininfarina does the physical design, the digital part of the job is taken care by the Tech Mahindra.

""No other company in the world has the capability like us,"" Angori said.

Mahindra group had announced the acquisition of Pininfarina in late 2015 for an overall outgo of over EUR 50 million after months of negotiations.",425,0.9999579668045044

India IT sector has emerged as an outperforming sector in the recent correction. The S&P BSE IT index rose nearly 10 percent compared to 1 percent fall seen in the S&P BSE Sensex so far in the year 2018.

Most experts are turning favourable towards the India IT sector in the near-term as they see the pain in the sector is priced in and with expectations of some more rupee depreciations, the sector is likely to hog some limelight.

""The association of Indian IT companies are expecting a strong growth in the fiscal year 2019 as most of the companies are able to adapt to the new age digital technologies and are also strengthening in the automation segments which could make the space as one of the strong sectors for the year 2018,"" JK Jain, Head of Equity Research at Karvy Stock Broking told Moneycontrol.

""Even the tailwind of weakness in rupee against the dollar over last few weeks is also likely to add to their top line numbers. Hence select largecap and midcap IT stocks have much more potential to outperform in the coming quarters,"" he said.

The calendar year 2018 is likely to be better than 2017 which could drive re-rating. However, the magnitude of acceleration will determine stock returns from here, suggest experts.

A 2-3 percent higher growth in FY2019 is already baked into the stock prices. The path to the higher acceleration of 4-5 percent can lead to further upsides, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.

“It is easier to predict the direction of growth than the magnitude of acceleration in our view. We prefer Infosys and Tech Mahindra as expectations embedded in the current valuations are low,” it said.

Kotak Institutional Equities has an ADD rating on Infosys, L&T Infotech, Mindtree and Tech Mahindra.

Indian IT companies expressed hopes of a better FY2019 led by – (1) a better macro environment across key goes, especially North America, (2) better deal flow for some, (3) pipeline of projects and deals and (4) increasing digital deal sizes, companies said on the sidelines of a conference organised by Kotak.

Companies did not quantify the magnitude of improvement although they were optimistic across verticals except in banking and retail where commentary differed.

Nearly all IT companies indicated that simplification and digital transformation of the core will drive up digital deal sizes. “Companies expressed confidence of maintaining margins in a guided band (TCS and Infosys) or improving it (Wipro in the medium term and Tech Mahindra in FY2019),” said the Kotak note.

The note further added that confidence in margin performance emanates from the pricing environment that has not thrown any unexpected surprises, benefits of automation and deriving leverage from investments already made in digital services.

Key takeaways from individual companies from Kotak Institutional Equities annual conference:

Infosys:

Infosys believes that increase in interest rates in the US, tax cuts that can potentially prop spending and a strong macro environment bode well for growth in FY2019. A positive macro can translate into better growth in FY2019 although the company believes it is too early to quantify the magnitude.

Traditional levers such as utilization are maxed out. The onsite mix can reduce and help margins. In addition, L1 and L2 automation can be adopted across a wider range of offerings.

Finally, the share of new services (10 percent of overall revenues) that are in an investment phase, can start contributing to margins after they achieve a particular scale. KIE view is that margins will move in a narrow band in the foreseeable future.

Tech Mahindra:

FY2018 has seen the rationalization of clients and unprofitable portfolio of business leading to impact on growth rates; communication practice will see negligible growth or even decline. Without this rationalization, FY2018 telecom revenue growth would have ranged 5-6 percent.

None of the large clients had a renegotiation in rates/pricing setting the platform for a return to growth in FY2019. Without factoring upside from 5G, mid-single digit revenue growth is possible in communications in FY2019.

Tech Mahindra believes that capex cycle and investments in IT are closely linked. Investments in 5G capex would spur IT spending, per the management.

L&T Infotech:

L&T Infotech’s management has guided for mid-teen growth in FY2018E and is optimistic about continued momentum in FY2019E led by (1) market share gains in top accounts, (2) solid deal wins in the recent past (one USD 100 million+, four USD30-100 million and five USD10-30 million deals), (3) an improving deal pipeline, and (4) addition of new logos—82 new logos added in the past 12 months and 3 of the top 10 deal wins are from new logos.

Growth in FY2019 will be powered by top-20 accounts as well as new logos. From a vertical standpoint, BFS, media and hi-tech and retail CPG verticals will growth faster than the company.

On the services front, analytics, enterprise integration, and mobility, ES and IMS will drive growth. The management expects the growth momentum to continue in CBDT project.

Mindtree:

Mindtree is seeing healthy demand across RTB (run-the-business) and digital portfolios. On RTB front, TCV growth is healthy, pricing is stable and large projects have stabilised after ramp-up.

On the digital front, Mindtree is witnessing benefits of an increase in average deal sizes. The management indicated the deal pipeline is improving and Mindtree’s deal win rate has improved to 34 percent from 22 percent (deals won out of the total deals tracked by Mindtree internally).

It is winning more deals through the advisory channel. Improving deal wins rate should reflect on TCVs in the coming quarters.

Mindtree has retained its sequential revenue growth guidance in dollar terms in Q4FY18 to be broadly similar to Q2 (3 percent) and Q3 (3.9 percent). The management expects EBITDA margin to be flat sequentially at about 15.1 percent.",976,0.8033446357363746

Stewart & Mackertich's Technical Outlook

Taking global cues, Nifty is expected to open flat to negative around 10,460 and likely to remain stuck in the price band 10410 to 10540. The Nifty yesterday ended 0.58 percent down at 10,492.85. Gap down opening followed by sharp pull back led aggressive bears to be persuaded into entering short sell.

From technical perspective, Nifty just filled up early morning gap down and retraced back towards ending the session with a Doji candle. Doji candle on daily chart implies indecision among traders. Hence, as the chart pattern suggests, it may remain stuck in the price band of 10,410-10,540.

On the Nifty hourly chart; it remained subdued for the entire session below the 100 hourly EMA placed around 10,520. Short-term chart pattern suggests, it may continue to trade on the weaker side as long as it trades below crucial moving averages.

Nifty patterns on multiple time frames show, sustained closing below 10,580 might again initiate selling spree that may take the Nifty towards 10460 and 10410. Further, we prefer sector and stock specific trading strategies rather Index based ones as far as short-term trading is concerned. Market is likely to manifest uneven volatility due to unpredictable domestic cues.

Yesterday, Bank Nifty ended at 25,107.40 (down 1.09 percent). Upside major resistances are placed around 25,200 and 25,350. Downside support is placed around 24,800.

Nifty crucial supports and resistances for the day:

Supports: 10460, 10410

Resistances- 10540, 10580

Below are the stocks which are good buys today:

Buy Tech Mahindra on dips around Rs 610-608 for target of Rs 630 and stop loss below Rs 598

Buy Infosys on dips in the price range of Rs 1165-1163 for target of Rs 1178 and Rs 1193 and stop loss below Rs 1148

Tech Mahindra has set up a lab in Bengaluru in association with US chipmaker Intel as part of its preparedness for 5G services expected to be rolled out by 2019, said a top executive of the IT firm.

The Department of Telecom (DoT) expects to finalise a road map for the services by June this year.

CP Gurnani, CEO and Managing Director of Tech Mahindra, said the company has already re-skilled about 30,000 of its employees in handling emerging technologies.

The remaining 75,000 employees will be re-skilled by the end of the current calendar year, he said.

""In our case, the key drivers (for future growth) are clearly 5G roll out if it happens in 2019. We will see better capex spending in telecom,"" he said.

""We have set up a lab with Intel in Bengaluru. We have set up labs with other companies also. You don't learn swimming by practicing on the beach. So we are working on software-defined networks.

""We are getting ready for the (5G) roll out,"" Gurnani told PTI on the sidelines of the just concluded World Congress of Information Technology 2018 here.

According to him, the company employees are in the process of acquiring required skill sets and getting ready for pilot phases to be rolled out soon.

""A large delegation of Tech Mahindra is going to the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona (staring from February 26) and intense discussions have been planned around 5G roll out,"" he said, without elaborating on the time-frame for pilot projects on the new mobile phone technology.

""It (re-skilling of employees) will remain a big focused area. I am already done with 30 per cent to 35 per cent (of the employees), (but) there is a lot more to be done.

""Within this calendar year (2018), the remaining (70 per cent) will be done,"" he added.

Declining to reveal specific recruitment plans, the TechM CEO said the IT industry may witness 4 per cent growth in hiring if the industry expands at 8 per cent per annum for the next two years.

Dolat Capital's research report on Tech Mahindra

USD rev. grew 2.5% QoQ to USD 1,209mn above our estimates helped by better performance of Manufacturing and Technology vertical. INR revenue improved 2.2% QoQ to ` 77.8bn (DCMe: ` 77.1 bn). EBIT margin improved 169bps QoQ to 12.7% (DCMe: 11.8%) led by improved utilization, better business mix and improved performance of its subsidiaries. PAT improved 12.8% QoQ to ` 9.4bn (DCMe: ` 8.7bn) helped by better margins and lower tax rate (22%) despite lower forex gain. Revenue from US/Europe improved 6.2%/1.9% QoQ, whereas, ROW underperformed with a decline of 3.3% QoQ in USD terms. Manufacturing/Tech/Retail grew 3.1%/13%/1.1% QoQ, respectively while Communication witness muted growth of 0.4% QoQ due to lower growth in VAS business. BFSI vertical declined 3.3% QoQ in USD terms. TechM sold Pakistan operation of LCC business for USD 1.4mn; which was included in miscellaneous income. LLC business has turned from loss making to single digit margin and company expects low single digit margin in LCC to be sustainable. Utilisation (83%) is almost at lifetime high levels, however mgmt. believes that this will sustain between 80-85%. TechM is estimated to report revenue USD revenue CAGR of 9% (FY18-20E) higher than most other large cap IT peers; this will primarily be driven by growth in key verticals (manufacturing, retail and BFSI) as telecom remains muted; however, within telecom, VAS is expected to report strong growth in Q4FY18 led by seasonality TechM has reported healthy EBIT margin improvement over the last two quarters (330 bps improvement); we expect margin to sustain in a narrow band of 11.5%-12.5% over the next two years, however, headwinds persist in the form of salary hike in H1FY19, investment in high skill hiring and limited levers for an improved utilization. Further, margin in the LCC segment, which have been a major driver for overall EBIT margin does not offer any scope of improvement from here on.

Outlook

TechM has moved up by 25% over the last three months and is now trading at fair valuations of 14.7x/13.2x FY19E/FY20E. We believe healthy revenue growth coupled with minor improvement in margin on a YoY basis for FY19/FY20 may drive share price performance in the near term. We upgrade our estimates factoring better EBIT margin and upgrade TechM to an ACCUMULATE rating; rollover to a Mar’19 TP of ` 670 based on 14.5x one-year fwd. PER.

IT major Tech Mahindra on Monday said it has partnered with Israeli firm ContextSpace Solutions to develop the world's first global software privacy ecosystem, MyData Shield.

Besides, it has also launched 'Tech Mahindra NxT' to power start-ups in Israel, under which it will engage with 20 firms.

The announcement coincides with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to India.

Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani said the company has been in Israel for a long time and has leveraged acquisitions and alliances to strengthen its operations there.

""Now what we are focussing on is a programme called Tech Mahindra NxT where we are going to partner with about 20 companies in Israel,"" he told PTI.

Tel Aviv, Israel's financial and technological hub, will be the nerve centre for the programme and will focus on creating collaborative solutions across cyber security, fintech, mobility, artificial intelligence and data analytics.

Besides, the initiative will also mentor and help accelerate growth for start-ups by availing ready infrastructure and market know-how.

Currently, Tech Mahindra NxT is active in Silicon Valley, California with active collaborations with nine start-ups.

Talking about the 'MyData Shield' — a cloud-based privacy protection solution, Tech Mahindra Senior VP(Global), Cybersecurity Business, Rajiv Singh said the offering will address security and personal data protection concerns of enterprises.

With countries moving towards stronger privacy regulations, organisations too are increasingly concerned about personal data protection and regulatory compliance, Singh added.",244,0.3334559400876363

Even as the fallout of the Satyam scam continues to make headlines nearly a decade later, employees of the software firm seem to have moved on to other problems, and were largely unperturbed by the ban on Satyam’s audit firm last week.

On Wednesday, Sebi found Price Waterhouse guilty in the multi-crore Satyam scam, and barred its network entities from issuing audit certificates to any listed company in India for two years.

Employees are not just worried about their future, but also present prospects. “It feels like the crisis never ends- first it was the Satyam scam, then changing and upgrading technologies and now we’re not even sure if we will have a job in spite of making all the right moves,” said another Tech Mahindra employee who joined Satyam in 2007, fresh out of college.

Satyam founder Raju confessed to a Rs 7,136 crore fraud on January 7, 2009, sparking a series of events that led to his prosecution and the company's takeover by Tech Mahindra. In 2015, a Special Court convicted Raju and nine others of criminal conspiracy, cheating, and criminal breach of trust, among other crimes, sentencing him to seven years in jail, with a fine of Rs 5 crore.

“There was disbelief then, all those years ago, and we went through some tough times- job uncertainties, banks refusing to give Satyam employees loans, the incessant hounding by the media- but now we’ve moved on,” said another Pune-based former Satyam employee.

Transition

Tech Mahindra was credited with a smooth transition by most employees and several stuck on for years after the transition. “What happened with PwC, I don’t have much of an opinion on that but what I do care about is holding on to my job and hoping I get a decent appraisal, if at all, this year,” said a Hyderabad- based employee who did not wish to be named.

“How does this impact any of us?” asked a Tech Mahindra employee based in Noida, even as he reminisced about the tough times he and his colleagues went through when the scam came to light in 2008.

In spite of its good financial performance, Tech Mahindra has, in the past year, been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Last June, an audio clip of an HR executive of Tech Mahindra firing an employee was made public, leading to much furore and a call for a more human approach to dealing with layoffs.

Last February, the company also suspended the appraisal cycle for employees with over six years of work experience, pending a management review.

The Indian IT industry is facing multi-pronged challenges as automation takes hold, growth slows, clients tighten their IT budgets and protectionist sentiment in the Indian IT industry’s largest markets causes a re-look at existing business models.

“This (Satyam) was my first job, and I would be happy for this to be my last, except that now we don’t know what constitutes career growth any more,” he smirks.",531,-0.7381605042351617

Edelweiss' research report on Tech Mahindra

We recently met management of Tech Mahindra (TECHM). Key takeaways are: 1) Major headwinds in telecom are behind and expects revival hereon; 2) Robust revenue momentum in non-telecom business to continue; and 3) Margin revival (expanded 250bps in past 2 quarters) to persist; and 4) Successful implementation of cost rationalisation measures. We believe the worst is behind for TECHM in terms of both revenue and margins as LCC stabilises and Comviva bottoms out. While the stock has run-up a bit in the past quarter, we believe there is scope for further upside as the key deterrents of growth have faded with high possibility of positive surprises in telecom revenues.

Outlook

We expect TECHM to post revenue/EPS CAGR of 9.7%/10.6% over FY17-19. Return of telecom spends from top telcos could also surprise positively. At CMP, the stock trades at 12.5x FY19E EPS. We retain ‘BUY/SP’ with TP of INR546 (14x FY19E EPS).

Axis Direct's research report on Tech Mahindra

TechM reported revenue growth of 3.6% QoQ (Organic: +2.4%, CJS: ~USD 14 mn, CC: 2.3% QoQ) to USD 1,179 mn (AxisCapE/Cons.: USD 1,165 mn/USD 1,172 mn). EBITDA margin up 180 bps QoQ at 14.5% led by utilization uptick, lower headcount, and absorption of visa costs. Reported EPS grew 4.7% QoQ to Rs 9.4 (AxisCapE/Cons.: Rs 7.02/ Rs 8.27), led by higher EBITDA. TCV win of USD 340 mn+ in Q2FY18 led by 1 large deal win in each Telecom and Enterprise.

Outlook

We believe low running expectation for revenue growth and margin improvement leaves room for positive surprise. We have a BUY rating and target price of Rs 550 (14x FY19E EPS). At the CMP of Rs 489, the stock trades at 13x/ 12x FY18E/FY19E.

Tech Mahindra will train an additional 10,000 employees on automation this year as the country's fifth largest IT firm expands its focus on new technologies to become more competitive.

Automation is an area where Tech Mahindra is heavily focused on with an aim of making company competitive, Tech Mahindra Vice Chairman Vineet Nayyar said on an investor call.

""...so far around 11,000 employees have been training in automation technologies while company intends to train an additional 10,000 associates during the year,"" he added.

Nayyar said during the first two quarters, Tech Mahindra generated ""productivity worth over 3,200 persons in different projects"", encompassing close to half of the employees based in IT.

At the end of September 2017 quarter, Tech Mahindra had a total headcount of 1,17,225 people. Of these, 75,587 people were in software business, while 35,287 were part of BPO operations.

The company had said at the end of September quarter, close to 70 per cent of the total employees -- starting from delivery to sales and support -- have completed training in different modules of digital technologies like Big Data/ analytics, cloud, mobility, Internet of Things (IoT), AR-VR, machine learning, robotics and Bitcoin.

By end of FY18, the company intends to take the number to close to 80 per cent.

IT companies -- big and small -- are betting big on new technologies like automation and artificial intelligence to drive productivity and efficiency.

While automation is expected to bring in cost benefits for clients, there are also concerns that increasing automation could lead to job losses.

Earlier in the year, there were reports that thousands of people could be laid off this year from companies like Wipro, Infosys and Cognizant.

The reports were refuted by industry body Nasscom that said the industry will hire about 1.5 lakh people this year on ""net"" basis although techies will have to re-skill themselves to stay relevant.

It had also pointed out that new opportunities are emerging in areas like tech start-ups, e-commerce, Digital India and digital payments and as many as 3 million new jobs are expected to be created by 2025.",361,0.3294517199198405

Tech Mahindra scrip price dropped 5.6 percent intraday Thursday despite better-than-expected earnings in September quarter, as majority of analysts retained sell call on the stock.

CLSA has a sell call on Tech Mahindra with increased target price at Rs 450 from Rs 380 per share, citing uncertain long-term growth prospects, risks from M&A and likely exhaustion of margin momentum.

Margin improvement for September quarter was strong, but levers are likely to get tougher, it feels. Continued margin recovery remained the highlight of the last six months, it said.

Strong execution in Q2 led CLSA to upgrade margin assumptions by 80-90 bps for FY18-19, driving 8-10 percent upgrades in earnings per share during the period.

""Tech Mahindra needs to institutionalise several processes that appear to be centrally imposed on resource management,"" CLSA said.

UBS also assigned sell rating to the stock with a target of Rs 365 per share. In dollar terms, US growth was sluggish at 3.1 percent and top 5 clients’ revenue declined 4.3 percent YoY.

Maintaining the current trend will be key to upside, the research house said.

While retaining sell call on Tech Mahindra with increased target price at Rs 420 (from Rs 405), Citi said it remained cautious on the sector.

The software firm's second quarter earnings beat analyst expectations on Wednesday as profit grew by 4.7 percent sequentially (up 29.7 percent year-on-year) to Rs 836 crore despite fall in other income and forex gain, backed by operational performance.

Rupee revenue during the quarter grew by 3.7 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs Rs 7,606 crore and dollar revenue increased 3.6 percent to USD 1,179.2 million, which were far ahead of analyst estimates.

Numbers were ahead of estimates as profit was expected at Rs 740 crore on revenue of Rs 7,551 crore and dollar revenue at USD 1,173 million for the quarter, according to average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) shot up 22.2 percent sequentially to Rs 840 crore and margin expanded by 160 basis points to 11 percent for the quarter ended September 2017, which too were ahead of CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of Rs 793 crore and 10.5 percent, respectively.

With neutral call, Macquarie raised target price on the stock to Rs 440 from Rs 410 per share following increase in EPS estimates by 6-8 percent for FY18-20 as earnings beat was driven by margin normalisation & high other income.

Credit Suisse, however, has maintained its outperform rating on the stock and also hiked price target to Rs 550 from Rs 520 as it feels the margin trajectory is shaping up well.

""Valuations remain attractive with our estimated compound annual growth rate of 18 percent EBIT over the two financial years till March 2020,"" the research house said.

Axis Capital, which has buy call on the stock with target price at Rs 550 per share, said margin improvement would drive earnings momentum for the next few quarters

The research house expects EBITDA margin to witness improvement to mid-teens in Q4FY19 and revenue trajectory to witness slow & steady recovery going ahead.

Pritesh Mehta IIFL Private Wealth

The dismal action atop mount 10K in the past few sessions ended in rather dramatic fashion as volatility made its presence felt on Thursday. BankNifty was the prime architect of the market downfall in the first half of Thursday’s trade.

However, a comeback by defensives (pharma and select IT names) along with strength in HDFC provided some respite. Despite the first half's sharp sell-off, bulls defended the support zone of 10029, the peak marked on gann anniversary period and 10038 (derived by multiplication of 270 degrees by applying a square of 9 from the recent low of 9,740).

The Nifty ended lower for the third consecutive session on Thursday, although the appearance of a large lower shadow in Thursday’s trade indicates renewed buying interest at lower levels.

The Nifty breadth remained mildly negative with 33 of Nifty50 constituents settling lower. Moreover, Nifty filled its upward gap at 10,115 formed on 18th September.

Violation of gapping support with sharp downticks usually indicates changed market sentiment due to overhead resistance at higher levels. Seemingly, the range-bound action between 10200-10000 band would continue to digest the recent sharp up moves.

Here is a list of top five trading ideas which could give a return of up to 11% in the short term:

Ajanta Pharma: BUY| Target Rs1360| Stop Loss 1230| Return 8%

Ajanta Pharma went through a sharp phase of correction after making a high of Rs1,135 in October 2016. Recent low of Rs1,135 (made in August 2017) provided respite to the stock.

An appearance of ‘Hammer’ candlestick pattern on the weekly chart restricted the selling pressure and the stock began a process of bottoming out.

It is a process, in which the stock moved around in a narrow range, doing nothing spectacular. Ajanta Pharma for the last four weeks was stuck between the Rs1,175-1,240 range.

In Thursday’s trade, it confirmed a breakout from the base building process, suggesting a fresh move on the upside in the near-term.

Also, the stock managed to breakout above a new orbit which indicates strength in the current move. As per above mentioned technical parameters, we recommend a buy on Ajanta Pharma above Rs1,260 with a stop loss of Rs1,230 for a target of Rs1,360.

Hindalco Industries: SELL| Target Rs217| Stop Loss Rs243| Return 11%

Hindalco had a swift rally of 50 percent in 2017 and surged to Rs250 odd levels. However, momentum stalled there and the stock made a fairly bearish pattern. It is now giving a strong topping out pattern.

Clear signs of distribution are visible and short-term moving averages have given a negative crossover. Whenever momentum stocks start falling down and makes a distribution pattern, it is an indication that decline could be big.

It has also given a breakdown from the upward sloping channel. It has reversed from the midpoint of current gann channel and a fall below Rs225 would accentuate the fall.

Based on above parameters we recommend creating Hindalco September shorts positions around Rs235 with a stop loss of Rs243 for a target of 217.

Havells India: SELL| Target Rs465| Stop Loss Rs515| Return 8.8%

The stock had been moving higher since August 2017 in an up trending channel. It had rallied from a low of Rs453 to a high of Rs521. It completed the 270-degree move on the upside.

Once the up trending cycle came to an end, the stock failed to sustain at the top. Also, it failed to clear the upper-end of the recent gann channel which resulted in a sharp decline.

In the process, the stock broke down below the rising channel pattern. The risk-reward ratio of creating shorts is now ideal with limited upside likely in the near term.

A breakdown on multiple counts suggests weakness. We recommend a short on Havells Sep Fut around Rs500 with a stop loss of Rs515 for a target of Rs465.

Tech Mahindra: BUY| Target Rs480| Stop Loss Rs440| Return 4%

The stock is going through a phase of consolidation after a sharp decline which suggests exhaustion of selling pressure. Back in April 2017, it had made a peak of Rs402 and went through a sharp correction, unable to sustain above the midpoint of gann channel.

However, it took support at its 48-weekly EMA and began a process of consolidation. Following a phase of base-building at the bottom, the stock staged a breakout above the downward sloping trendline.

The pattern of consecutive higher highs and higher lows on the weekly time frame above the midpoint of current gann channel suggests a reversal.

Keeping in mind, above-mentioned parameters, we recommend a buy on Tech Mahindra between Rs450 – Rs455 with a stop loss of Rs440 and a target of Rs480.

Mahindra Holidays & Resorts India Ltd (MHRIL): BUY| Target Rs385| Stop Loss Rs350| Return 7%

The stock has found support at the point of polarity placed near the three-digit gann channel of 361. In fact, the stock is consolidating at the bottom for last five weeks after a sharp corrective move from Rs490, which has led to exhaustion of selling pressure.

The phase of consolidation near the critical gann number & point of polarity support suggests resumption of the previous up move. Moreover, the support of 25-weekly moving average also came to the rescue of the stock.

Historically, this moving average has provided multiple buying opportunities on declines. A move above Rs361 would confirm a breakout from recent phase of base building. Buy MHRIL above Rs361 with a stop loss of Rs350 for a target of Rs385.

After entering into ‘five digit’ club last month, the Nifty50 begun the August series with low open interest. Except for a sharp decline in the second week of the expiry, the market traded in a narrow range for the most part of the series.

The Nifty50 close the series with a loss of little over 1 percent and traders carried forward fewer derivatives bets to September on expiry of August monthly contracts.

Analysts said rollover to Nifty September futures and their open interest are the lowest in 2017. Fewer rollovers suggest that the aggression is missing amid concerns of a delay in recovery in corporate earnings as well persistent selling by foreign investors.

The Nifty rollovers stood at 58 percent, significantly lower than last three months' average of 72 percent. The roll cost was under pressure at 37 basis points compared to around 40 bps on Monday.

“In August series, we witnessed decent amount open interest addition in Nifty; wherein, most of them were on the short side. Rollover in Nifty (57.96%) is much lower than its quarterly average of 66.45%, indicates that the short positions formed in August series are not rolled to the upcoming month,” Jay Purohit, Technical & Derivatives Analyst at Centrum Broking Limited told Moneycontrol.

Also, in BankNifty, rollovers (68.26%) are on the lower side in both percentages and open interest terms. At present, positions in Nifty is quite light as the open interest in Nifty is at the lowest level since the start of the calendar year 2017.

Open interest in Nifty September futures stood at Rs16,300 crore compared to Rs17,300 crore at the beginning of the August series.

The Nifty future closed negative by around 1 percent at 9917.90 on expiry to expiry basis compared to July settlement of 10,020.55.

“The Nifty futures settled near to its series VWAP of 9928 zones means bulls and bears both were at comfort zones but low rollover comparatively suggests that aggression is missing in the market by bulls post its pause in upside momentum,” Chandan Taparia, Derivatives, and Technical Analyst at Motilal Oswal Securities told Moneycontrol.

“India VIX fell down by 7.27 percent at 11.95 and a decline in volatility has supported the index to get a stable move with follow up buying interest. Now VIX has to hold below 12.50 to get a smooth ride in next coming sessions,” he said.

Considering the overall derivative data, the Nifty expected to remain in a range of 9700 – 10000 in near term. Traders should focus more on stock specific moves as it may fetch better returns in upcoming sessions, suggest experts.

Stocks, where long positions got rolled to September series are Tech Mahindra, Container Corp, BPCL, Ujjivan, Torrent Power, Tata Global Beverages, Chennai Petro.

While short positions got rolled in Apollo Hospital, Sun Pharma, Repco Home Finance, Glenmark and Bank Of Baroda.

Edelweiss' research report on Tech Mahindra

We recently met management of Tech Mahindra (TECHM; Mr. Manoj Bhat, Deputy CFO, and Mr. Vikas Jadhav, Head, Investor Relations) to get an update on the company’s growth and margin strategy. Management reiterated that: 1) Telecom, including LCC, will grow at 2-5% and >7% ex LCC; 2) Non-telecom is set to grow by 8-10%; and 3) margin pressures would ease hereon, ex-currency impact. They emphasised their confidence in the measures initiated to control costs, streamline LCC business and swift recovery in margins along with revival of telecom capex. We believe TECHM will be a major beneficiary of revival in telecom spends. In our view, revenue/EPS CAGR of 9.4%/10.6% over FY17-19E along with undemanding valuation of 10.9x FY19E, implies favourable risk reward. Maintain ‘BUY’ with a target price of INR546.

Outlook

We believe our revenue/EPS CAGR of 9.4%/10.6% over FY17-19E is highly achievable and TECHM could spring a positive surprise. We believe management’s strong focus on margin improvement is a step in right direction and boost investors’ confidence to a large extent. At CMP, the stock quotes at undemanding valuation of 10.9x FY19E EPS. We reiterate ‘BUY/SP’ with a target price of INR546 (14x FY19E EPS), implying 28.6% upside.

The events of last two weeks had left the bulls gasping as Nifty fell sharply to mark a low of 9,685. But, market strength is always judged on corrections.

And it didn’t disappoint on that count as Nifty defended the confluence of support around 9,700 (i.e. Point of polarity support around 9,700 and multiple gann numbers).

From gann perspective, whenever a confluence of support is defended, the pullback tends to be excessive. A rally of 2 percent in this truncated week’s trade clearly outlines the structural strength of the index.

After all the ups and downs, Nifty is back around 9,900. Back in July, this was the breakout point, from where Nifty had ascended towards 10,138.

It's also placed around the three-digit gann number of 993(0). Moreover, 61.8% retracement of the entire down move is placed around 9,960. So, it's essential for the index to surpass the congestion zone of 9,930-9,960 to sustain the recent pullback.

While BankNifty was the architect of wonderful Wednesday, it was at its volatile best in Thursday’s trade, declining by 200 points to restrict the index momentum.

The Nifty made a high of 9,948 but failed to sustain at the top and eventually closed flat at 9,904. Lack of positive follow-up in BankNifty (inability to surpass the 50% retracement mark of the recent decline) contributed to intra-day reversal.

Here is a list of top five trading ideas which can give up to 9% return in short term:

KEC: BUY| Target Rs325| Stop Loss 289| Return 6%

After being in a phase of consolidation at the top of its rally, it finally attempted a breakout on the upside in this week’s trade. It is showing the trait of a stock which is in a strong uptrend since November 2016.

A move prior to recent breakout could be termed as flag pattern. Flags are considered to be a continuation pattern in nature; we expect the stock to replicate the momentum it had since first two weeks of July.

Every consolidation or a decline in this up trending counters has provided a buying opportunity. The decline seen in previous week’s trade, brought the stock back to the peak of June 2017 and thereafter it quickly regained control above the gann number of 289.

Breakout from flag consolidation is likely to ignite buying momentum once again. Traders are advised to buy KEC above Rs300 with a stop loss of Rs289 for a target of Rs325.

Canara Bank: BUY| Target Rs365| Stop Loss Rs320| Return 9%

Since the third week of July, Canara Bank had witnessed sharp correction from the peak of Rs375 to a low of Rs321. However, the stock is attempting to find a base around the point of polarity support zone around Rs320.

It is the breakout point of the previous rally seen in April 2017. The daily chart offers an escape from the chaos of last few weeks. Analyzing the chart from a broader perspective, Canara Bank is carving out a Bullish Bat pattern that began from last week of June 2017.

Bat pattern reached to its completion stage after it hit a low of Rs320 and thereby retracing ~88.6% of the XA leg. PRZ tends to provide a temporary support for the pattern.

So, traders are advised to follow the levels vigilantly. Traders are advised to buy Canara Bank above Rs333 with a stop loss of Rs320 for a target of Rs365.

Hexaware: BUY| Target Rs300| Stop Loss Rs267| Return 7.9%

A rally of 9% in this week’s trade has ensured that the price managed to close above the resistance area of Rs265, thus signaling bullish breakout from the Flag pattern. Since the second week of May 2017, the stock had been trading in a narrow band at the top.

However, despite sideways movement, it continued to trade above its 21-weekly EMA. This week’s breakout has paved the way for smart up move in the medium term.

Earlier in April 2017, the stock had provided a strong rally from the support of its 200-Weekly Moving Average, which suggests that the stock is in a strong uptrend. Every consolidation or a decline is providing a buying opportunity.

Breakout from flag consolidation is likely to ignite buying momentum once again. Traders are advised to buy Hexaware above Rs278 with a stop loss of Rs267 for a target of Rs300.

Tech Mahindra: BUY| Target Rs460| Stop Loss Rs408| Return 8%

The phase of consolidation after a sharp decline suggests exhaustion of selling pressure in Tech Mahindra. Moreover, it has reversed from PRZ of ABCD pattern, indicating an end of the corrective phase.

Also in the process, the stock took support around the three-digit gann number of 361 before gradually moving higher. Ratio chart of NiftyIT index vs Nifty shows significant underperformance of IT stocks since 2014 and during this period, ratio corrected from 1.65 to 1.05 (down by ~35%).

However, recent price structure shows that ratio has been hovering near 61.8% retracement level of the entire up move of 2009 to 2014. Positive divergence is also seen in the weekly RSI. Ratio price is attempting to breakout from downward sloping trendline.

We expect the stock to build on this week’s 5% move and attempt a rally towards Rs460. Maintain stop loss of Rs408.

Bharat Financial: BUY| Target Rs910| Stop Loss 820| Return 7%

Bharat Finance is breaking out after a long period of sideways correction. In the month of May 2017, the stock made a low of Rs651 but managed to defend the multiple gann support points and ensured a change in trend.

Despite going through a phase of correction at the top, it continued to trade above its 100-weekly EMA. Since it is an up trending stock, traders should always use any phase of consolidation and breakout from the same to build longs.

In this week’s trade, it managed to stage a breakout from the downward sloping trendline which warrants positive outlook for the stock. In the first week of August, it had staged a false breakout from the same pattern but it turned out to be a false move.

However, correction turned out to be short-lived and the stock recouped the lost ground. Based on above parameters, we recommend a buy on Bharat Finance above Rs845 with a stop loss of Rs820 for a target of Rs910.

By Pritesh Mehta IIFL Private Wealth

The writing on the wall was clear since long. The tell-tale signs - lack of positive breadth (around the all-time high), weakness in BankNifty, and the presence of multiple gann points and lucas series number - ultimately caused the current predicament.

The orbit shift of Wednesday’s trade (decline below 9,930) took a mere two sessions to mark a low of 9,776, placed near three-digit gann number of 977(0). This, in consequence, completed the cycle of the impending downside move.

Thursday’s low coincides with 50 percent end to end retracement of the up move - from the low of 9449 to the all-time high of 10,138.

Also, 50-EMA support on daily charts came to the rescue even as markets managed a sharp pullback from the day’s low.

It's pertinent to note that in the case of the June 2017 decline, Nifty had sought support near the same EMA levels, before resuming a voyage towards a record high.

Going forward, the three-digit gann number of 977(0) would be an immediate support point, which is why sustenance above 9,770 could provide a relief rally en route 9,900-9,930 levels.

Here is a list of top five stocks which could give up to 9% return in short term:

BHEL: SELL| Target Rs114| Stop Loss Rs132| Return 9%

BHEL had failed to participate in the bull market of 2017. YTD returns of 5 percent in 2017 show the inability of this stock to sustain at higher levels and implies the underperformance against the benchmark index.

Back in April, the stock had recorded a high of Rs179, which coincided with its 187-weekly moving average. The appearance of an engulfing top resulted in a sharp reversal. In the ensuing decline, the stock also gave a breakdown from a rising channel pattern on the weekly chart.

Selling pressure likely to escalate on a move below Rs125. Risk reward ratio is ideal to create short positions. Based on above rationale, we recommend short on BHEL Aug Futs below Rs126 with a stop loss of Rs132 for a target of Rs114.

Ambuja Cements: SELL| Target Rs250| Stop Loss Rs275| Return 6%

The presence of multiple tops around Rs280 and failure to break past the gann number of 289 led to a reversal. In this weeks’ trade, the stock lost 4% after it gave a breakdown below the support of rising trendline.

Clear signs of distribution are visible and short-term moving averages have given a negative crossover. Whenever momentum stocks start falling down and makes a distribution pattern, it is an indication that decline could be big.

The daily RSI has given a negative crossover which could provide an immediate trigger for the down fall. Keeping in mind the above-mentioned observations, we recommend traders to short Ambuja Cements Aug Futs below Rs267 with a stop loss of Rs275 for a target of Rs250.

Bank of India: SELL| Target Rs135| Stop Loss Rs153| Return 8%

Bank of India has recently signaled trend reversal below Rs152 with a broader pattern indicating breakdown from a bearish Head 7 shoulders pattern.

Based on pattern observations, the stock could be drifting below Rs137 in the medium term.

The inability of stock to conquer ground around its recent top of Rs167, which is placed near the three-digit gann number of 169, reinforced the negative trend in the counter.

The daily RSI too has retreated lower and has a good cushion to decline, before entering into oversold terrain. A fall below Rs145 would result in a break below the midpoint of the current gann channel.

Traders are advised to create shorts on Bank of India Aug Futs below Rs147 with a stop loss of Rs153 for a target of Rs135.

Tech Mahindra: BUY| Target Rs436| Stop Loss Rs390| Return 7%

Ratio chart of NiftyIT index vs Nifty shows significant underperformance of IT stocks since 2014 and during this period, ratio corrected from 1.65 to 1.05 (down by 35 percent). However, recent price structure shows that ratio has been hovering near 61.8% retracement level of the entire up move of 2009 to 2014.

Positive divergence is seen in the weekly RSI. Ratio price is attempting to breakout from downward sloping trendline. Within the IT basket, Tech Mahindra is relatively holding ground, hence could attract bull’s interest.

The stock created strong base around three-digit gann number of 361 before going through a phase of consolidation at the bottom. In Thursday’s trade, it attempted a breakout from the above-mentioned consolidation.

We expect the stock to witness follow-up buying post the recent underperformance. We recommend traders to buy Tech Mahindra above Rs404 with a stop loss of Rs390 for a target of Rs436.

L&T Finance Holdings: SELL| Target Rs152| Stop loss Rs 174| Return 7%

On the weekly chart, L&T FH has reversed after making a top of Rs179, eventually failing to sustain above the three-digit gann number of 169, suggesting that the likelihood of further upside over the short-term has diminished.

For now, the risk/return of establishing long positions is less than ideal. Moreover, the stock has broken below the small consolidation pattern between Rs175-167. It presents a great opportunity for the traders to jump in on the downtrend.

An occurrence of this event indicates further selling and continuation of the downtrend. An Appearance of engulfing bearish line on the weekly chart indicates a possible end to the current sideways trend.

The above candlestick pattern creates a potential short-term reversal. We recommend traders to short L&T FH below Rs167 with a stop loss of Rs174 for a target of Rs152.

The latest such petition is one filed by a group of IT professionals in Kolkata addressed to Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra, asking for greater clarity in the confusion over IT giant Tech Mahindra shutting down its IT services operations in the city.

An online petition titled “Tech Mahindra IT winding up Kolkata Operations. Time to intervene and save jobs” has been put up on change.org, a popular portal for starting online campaigns and taking up issues with different authorities and organisations.

In the two days since it was put up, the petition has got support from nearly 1,300 people.

“The reason we filed this petition was that we want clarity. We are also planning to petition the CM of West Bengal through change.org. There is a fear among Tech Mahindra employees that the entire unit is being shut down, since the past two or three weeks. We don't want industry to move out of the State,” said Sayantan Das, convener of the Information Technology and Services Employees' Forum, which has filed the petition.

On July 28, a local Bengali daily had said that Tech Mahindra was looking to wind up operations in West Bengal. This was followed by Tech Mahindra CP Gurnani tweeting an article on August 3 that spoke about the company being bullish on Bengal and going on a major expansion drive in the State.



The #CityOfJoy #Kolkata holds a special place in our hearts & we remain committed to hiring & nurturing talent for the future @tech_mahindra pic.twitter.com/xwTDDUrvF9

— CP Gurnani (@C_P_Gurnani) August 3, 2017

Moneycontrol learns, however, that the tweet did little to assuage existing employees, especially in the IT services operations in the city.

Several of them said one of the teams in Kolkata got an email saying IT operations will be moved to a different location and asked for their flexibility in moving to a different location. This sparked off concerns about the future of other teams in Kolkata too.

“We have been asked to be ready to relocate within two months, else we will be released from our projects. CP's tweet and the stories only mention ramping up BPO operations, nothing on IT services,” said an employee who works at the Kolkata office, on the condition of anonymity.

A Tech Mahindra spokesperson, in response to an email query from Moneycontrol regarding the change.org petition, said: “We deny the speculation as reported in a recent Media article, making it amply clear that there is no plan to close our operations in Kolkata. On the contrary, we are fully committed to the City of Joy, as we are growing our customer-centric projects in the state and our forthcoming Center of Excellence for Customer Service & Experience standing as testimony to our objectives.”

Petitions becoming more common in the IT sector

This is not the first time employees have taken to change.org to air their grievances. Three weeks ago, a group called IT Industry Lucknow put up a petition to the Prime Minister of India and the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh to prevent job losses through the shutdown of Tata Consultancy Services’ Lucknow operations.

The petition has 5,228 signatures till date, and the forum has a target of reaching 7,500 signatures.

In January this year, an individual called Latif Bansal had petitioned the Labour Ministry to “Stop Indian IT companies from forcefully holding employees with 3 months' notice period”, which till date has support from nearly 65,000 people, just 10,000 short of its target number of signatures.

There is no clarity on what happens to these petitions once they reach their target signatures, but the amount of support they receive is certainly an indicator of the kind of causes people and I this case, IT employees, care about.",663,-0.5277712106704712

TechM reported USD revenue growth of 0.6% QoQ despite decline in the telco. vertical (1.8% QoQ). EBIT margin improved 120bps QoQ to 9.4% largely led by operating efficiencies. TechM has won TCV of USD 325mn in this quarter and mgmt. indicated of no further negative impact on rev./margin going ahead due to LCC, as its restructuring is complete. The stock has corrected ~10% over last three months and we believe current valuations appear inexpensive which may help TechM may outperform vs

peers; however, consistency on EBITDA margin is the key to drive up grades in near term.

Outlook

We upgrade TechM to an Accumulate rating (Reduce earlier) with a Jun’18 TP of Rs 425 (12x fwd. PER.). We believe better revenue growth prospects in H2FY18 led by seasonality may help the stock outperform versus peers.

Tech Mahindra’s results in Q1 FY18 was a mixed bag with revenue marginally below our estimates whereas profitability was a beat. Dollar revenue was reported at $1,138 Mn, 0.6% up qoq, a meager 0.6% below our estimate of $1,145 Mn, while EBIT margins stood at 9.4%, 53 bps above our estimates. By Geography: N.

Outlook

We believe that 3 main triggers for Communications space over the next few years are Higher video/content streaming over various distribution channels, IoT and 5G rollout and will serve to be major growth drivers for TechM going ahead. Restructuring in Network Services business is largely complete. Hence, we are expecting the recovery process to continue through FY18E. We believe that the management’s stance on aggressively pursuing Digital, Automation, Innovation and Disruption is a right one and will drive revenue growth along with profitability.

Tech Mahindra has managed to beat the market’s estimates by a long shot in the first quarter of FY18. And while the market is building in lower growth than guided by the industry body Nasscom, Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani is confident about meeting the forecast if not beating it. In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Gurnani said his confidence stems from the fact that the foundation has been laid for re-optimisation of the business.

Is the worst over for the industry?

As I said during our discussion, we had worked on reoptimisation and restructuring and our belief is that the building blocks for the same has been completed. Hence, there is only one way to go. We will see a slow and gradual growth in margins and revenues. We have done the restructuring and we are saying slow and gradual growth.

Do you expect to meet Nasscom’s 7-8% growth guidance?

Our goal is to beat Nasscom’s guidance. If I look at the rhythm and momentum, we believe we can meet the guidance. We would meet the Nasscom guidance. We feel confident that we will be within the guidance.

If you weed out the healthcare acquisition which added USD 17 million to your topline, there is no growth? Is that a cause of concern?

Yes, it has been a flat quarter. Despite of this my next three quarters will show growth.

Your acquisition of LCC has not worked. Is that a trend because some of your peers have also seen some of their acquisitions go awry?

I think I have done it three times correct, after having gone wrong with LCC. All other acquisitions have been correct. I hope you will forgive me for LCC. We will be doing it again. I am supremely confident about the other acquisitions.

The market is worried about telecom, which accounts for 46 percent of revenues. What is happening there?

Yes, every business goes through its corrections and consolidation. You’ve seen consolidation happening in our market and every other part of the world. The reason I am confident of this business is because our IT Minister talks about a USD 1 trillion digital economy. We are now talking about billions of connected devices and smart cities. Ultimately, you cannot operate without a network. At the end of the day, if it is essential part of business, you cannot give it free as they are paying for spectrum. If operators monetise their business, we cannot be left out. I believe we are in the right industry.

What about returning cash to investors?

The board has to decide what the capital allocation policy is. We believe that we are utilising the capital well. Why don’t you want us to have a consistent dividend policy? And second, M&A is a part of our strategy. I strongly believe that this may be a good question to ask other players because cash as a percentage of our revenues is the least.

What about your headcount? Are you likely to bring that down further?

I think we need to bring it down a little bit more. As I said this is a continuous exercise for reskilling, skilling, managing a geographical mix of employees and optimising our workforce. I cannot give any guidance. The workforce will be optimised to deliver the work we are doing.",601,-0.14120428902762278

Tech Mahindra shares rallied as much as 7.4 percent Tuesday as analysts retained positive stance, expecting up to 31 percent upside in the stock after Q1 earnings beat expectations.

""The IT firm reported Q1FY18 revenues of USD 1.1 billion, up 0.6 percent QoQ, which was 2 percent above our estimates,"" Goldman Sachs said while reiterating buy rating on the stock.

Motilal Oswal said constant currency revenue declined around 2.1 percent QoQ, but was ahead of its estimate of a 3.4 percent decline, led by stabilisation of LCC revenues and above-estimate BFSI performance.

Including revenues from HCI (two months), constant currency revenue declined 0.6 percent, which was also ahead of its estimate of 2.2 percent decline, it added.

Goldman said the key driver of the positive surprise was an EBIT margin of 9.4 percent, up 120 basis points QoQ and 40/60bps above its estimates, as headwinds like forex, visa charges and more onsite presence during Q1 were offset by lower losses at subsidiary LCC and net headcount reduction.

The research house feels margins look set to improve further in Q2 given most of the headcount reduction happened towards the end of Q1, with benefits in employee costs/utilisation to emerge more in Q2.

Tech Mahindra saw a 4.1 percent QoQ reduction in software professionals headcount (3,407 employees) Utilisation at 77 percent including trainees was flat for the third quarter and down 100bp YoY, and remains a few points below management's target.

Profit in Q1 grew sharply by 36 percent sequentially to Rs 799 crore, driven by operational performance as well as other income. Revenue from operations declined 2.12 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 7,336.1 crore.

""Despite all headwinds in a seasonally weak quarter, digital business is growing ahead of our expectations backed by solid execution as we realign focus from Run side of the business opportunities to Change and Grow,"" CP Gurnani, MD & CEO said.

Digital deals are now 2.5 times the number Tech Mahindra was involved with in the same quarter last year.

Geography wise, Goldman believes European Union will be the key growth frontier for the company in near term with North America largely stable during Q1 despite headwinds.

Management on the earnings call was confident LCC restructuring is now behind with the number of deals under LCC now growing.

Since LCC’s acquisition in 2014, when it had an annual revenue run rate of USD 430 million, Tech Mahindra has been consistently restructuring this business, with a current annual run rate of USD 200 million

Tech Mahindra defended its growth in communications versus peers, highlighting that it has not lost any business to competitors, Motilal Oswal said.

What to do with the stock

Goldman Sachs increased its FY18-20 EPS estimates by 4/7/8 percent led by higher revenue/margin assumptions and lower depreciation & amortisation expense.

As a result 12-month target price raised to Rs 505 (from Rs 483 earlier), it said.

The research house has reiterated its buy rating given margin trajectory seems to be improving from current levels with the majority of LCC restructuring over and multiple margin levers like utilisation, offshoring and integration of recent acquisitions.

Increasing visibility on 5G capex globally would also drive telecom vertical growth, Goldman feels.

Motilal Oswal also increased its earnings estimates for FY18/19 by 9.5/1.6 percent. The significant FY18 upgrade comes on the back of combined effect from forex gains and revenue beat, it said.

The research house further said, ""Tech Mahindra trades at 11.4x/10.6x FY18/19 earnings. There remains some tailwinds to improve profitability in the near term, which will feed positively into valuation multiple. Improvement in Communications revenue growth is an option value over and above the same.""

Motilal Oswal has maintained buy rating on the stock, with a target price of 490, implying an upside of 26 percent.

The Mahindra Group will invest USD one billion across various sectors, including in the IT field, in the US over the next five years, doubling its overall investment as part of its ""very aggressive"" business plans.

Tech Mahindra will also double its local hiring in the country. IT major Tech Mahindra plans to hire around 2,200 people in the US this year, same as last year.

He said the group has so far invested USD one billion across sectors in the US and in the next five years the diversified Indian group will double that investment, adding a billion dollars to its various businesses.

Mahindra and Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka also announced that the Mahindra Group plans to invest USD one billion across sectors in the US in the next five years, doubling its overall investment in the country so far.

""Our future plans in the US continue to be very aggressive. Over the next five years we hope to double our investment we have in the US,"" Goenka said.

Goenka also touched upon the H1-B visa issue.

Tech Mahindra has been in the news in the US quite a bit lately over the H1-B visa issue. It is perhaps a little misunderstood on what the Indian IT companies mean for the US, Goenka said.

""Lots of people see it as taking away US jobs. The Indian IT companies and Tech Mahindra are creating US jobs and not taking away US jobs,"" Goenka told a group of reporters here yesterday.

Tech Mahindra President - Strategic Verticals Lakshmanan Chidambaram said the Indian IT company has had a presence in the US for over a decade, with two billion dollars in revenues and 6,000 employees in the US.

""We are also hiring from 25 US institutions with whom we have a very strong relationship. This hiring has been happening over a period of fours years now. We bring in fresh graduates, train them and bring them in the workforce in the US,"" Chidambaram said.

Responding to a question by PTI on whether the company is realigning its policies amid the Donald Trump administration's tough stance on immigration and H1B work visas, Chidambaram said certain bills for reforming the H1B visa progarmme are being introduced in the US, but ""they will have to go through the whole process"".

A bill that was introduced never came out the way it was introduced.

He added that at the moment, Tech Mahindra's focus has been on investing in its development centers.

""More than the H-1B, the focus is what is happening with the whole digital revolution that is taking place,"" Chidambaram said, adding that the IT platforms are forcing the companies to think in a different way.

""Certain situations bring the best out in people,"" he said.

Goenka added that the projected investment amount could go up significantly if the company is able to win a contract it is bidding for with the US Postal Service for replacing its fleet of postal vehicles.

""One big ticket item if that happens this number will go up. We are bidding for a contract with the US Postal Service for replacing its fleet of postal vehicles,"" he said.

On the employment front, Goenka said the company currently employs 3,000 local people in the US and it is estimated that this number will grow up to 7,000 in the next five years.

The IT major currently employs 2300 people in the US and this number will go up to 5000 in the next five years.

The company said the local hiring in the US will be separate from the H1B visa holder that it employs for technology work in the country.

Goenka underscored that the hiring plans are in place not due to the recent policy announcements in the Donald Trump administration but that the company had planned to increase local hiring even before the new US administration's plans.

""We hope to double the local employment that we have in the US, increase our presence through more development centers and manufacturing locations and build our brand,"" he said.

The Mahindra brand is reasonably well known in the US ""but we need to do a lot more work and focus a lot on building the brand over the years,"" he said adding that the US is a very important market for the company, the second largest after India.

The company has a revenue of about USD 2.6 billion out of US which is more than 10 per cent of Mahindra's global revenue.",762,0.5152450402577718

Diversified Mahindra group plans to invest USD 1 billion across business verticals in the US over the next five years as it aims to double revenues from the American market to USD 5 billion.

The Mumbai-headquartered group, which currently employs around 3,000 people in the country, also plans to double the headcount over the next five years as it looks to expand operations.

""We have so far invested around USD 1 billion in the US among all the businesses and we should invest another billion over the next five years,"" Mahindra & Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka told PTI here in an interview.

The quantum of investment, however, would depend on various factors like market conditions and success of various projects that are currently underway in the US, he added.

Elaborating on various strategic projects, Goenka said the company has bid for a US postal service contract and if it comes through it would help the company grow exponentially in the country.

When asked about the group's ambitions in terms of revenues in the US, Goenka said: ""In the next five years, we are targeting doubling revenue to about USD 5 billion.""

The USD 19 billion group currently generates around USD 2.5 billion from its seven business verticals in the US. The major group firms active in the country include IT major tech Mahindra and Mahindra USA which sells tractors and utility vehicles in the country.

When asked to elaborate on the factors that would help the company achieve desired results, Goenka said the growth would be led by various factors like the launch of a new off road vehicle by its arm Mahindra North America Technical Centre (MNATC) besides other group entities.

""The growth will be led by Mahindra USA where we intend to double revenues from USD 500 million to USD 1 billion in next five years and then there is Tech Mahindra,"" he added.

Mahindra is also looking at doubling its manpower in the country over the next five years.

""Mahindra currently employs more than 3,000 locals in the US and as things are going we are going to double that over the next 4-5 years,"" Goenka said.

He said success of Mahindra brand in the US is very important as accomplishment in the country would mean recognition in various other geographies.

""Building the Mahindra brand in the US is very important for us because it is the place everyone looks up to. The brand which gets successful in this market gets automatic recognition in so many places,"" he said.

While confirming that Tech Mahindra is facing visa issues, he said the IT major is working on resolving the matter.

""Other than IT business where... there are both locals and people brought in from India, none of our other businesses have huge number of Indians (brought) to the US for work,"" Goenka said.

He further added: ""The company's objective has never been to bring in people from India. We have invested here we have employed people here and thus we are not really been impacted by the new polices.""

After being nudged by the Trump Administration, the IT major Tech Mahindra now has been focusing on local hiring. It has been recruiting from colleges in the US and this year it plans to add around 2,200 people in the country, which remains its biggest single market in the world.

When asked if the company is facing any discrimination in the US, Goenka said: ""There is no discrimination I can think of in conducting business in the US...laws, taxes are same for everyone. I don't see any kind if disadvantage for Indian multinationals here.""

Besides, MNATC, Tech Mahindra and Mahindra USA, the group is also present across various other verticals including aviation, electric two wheelers and supply chain.",640,0.9817637205123901

The High Court of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh on Monday admitted a writ petition from sacked employees of Tech Mahindra, who took the company and the Telangana government to court for asking them to quit unceremoniously.

The writ petition came after four retrenched employees claimed they were terminated unlawfully as they were in mediation with the company and labour commissioner over the manner of retrenchment.

According to the Forum of IT Professionals (ForIT), an organisation working for the welfare of IT professional since 2007 in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Justice MS Ramachandra Rao admitted the writ petition filed by four retrenched employees.

Moneycontrol has seen a copy of the writ petition.

Justice Rao on Monday issued notices to Principal Secretary, Labour and Employment Department, Government of Telangana, Joint Commissioner of Labour, and Tech Mahindra, directing them to give their responses within three weeks.

He also permitted the petitioners to serve personal notices to Tech Mahindra in this regard.

Tech Mahindra could not be immediately reached for comment.

Senior Counsel A Satyaprasad, who represented the four petitioners, informed the Court that Tech Mahindra was resorting to large scale illegal retrenchment of employees in Hyderabad, pointing out that the human resources department of the company was pressurising the employees to put in their resignations and leave the company.

Moneycontrol was the first to report last week the story of a 6:45-minute long audio clip uploaded by a Tech Mahindra employee, where an HR executive was heard asking him put in his papers by 10 am the next day or his services at the company would be terminated.

The report led to apologies from Mahindra Group’s executive chairman Anand Mahindra and CEO CP Gurnani on Friday over the manner of sacking.

In this case, the four petitioners had complained to the Joint Commissioner of Labour of Telangana, Ranga Reddy, against the “high handed illegal methods” being adopted by the company, according to ForIT.

Even as Reddy initiated conciliation proceedings to resolve this issue, Tech Mahindra handed out termination letters to the four employees.

This action, according to the Counsel Satyaprasad, violates Section 47(2) of Telangana Shops and Establishments Act. According to the prevailing law (Telangana Shops and Establishments Act, 1988), no employee can be terminated if there is a pending petition with the Labour Commissioner.

According to ForIT, more than 80 petitions have been filed with the Labour Commissioner’s office and with the Development Commissioner’s office, Special Economic Zone, by employees laid off from various IT companies.

In this case, two conciliatory meetings were held between the retrenched employees and Tach Mahindra on June 12 and June 30. A third meeting was to take place on July 7 but has been postponed to July 14.

“ForIT expresses its happiness that the High Court has taken cognizance of the IT retrenchments by admitting this writ petition. Issuing notices to Tech Mahindra is a positive development. We, the IT employees, need to realise that there are laws that protect our livelihoods, and we should fight to retain those rights,” the Forum said in a statement.",587,0.00029402971267700195

The unceremonious sacking of a Tech Mahindra employee has created buzz on social media. While Tech Mahindra's Chief Executive Officer CP Gurnani. Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra as well as Tech Mahindra Vice-chairman Vineet Nayyar apologised on Friday for the manner in which the individual was asked to leave, the incident serves as a reminder that employees do have a right to move court to question a termination decision.

In 2016, a Chennai court had said set aside the dismissal of an employee at an IT company, terming it unlawful. This ruling has implications for IT companies as well as a few thousand employees who have been recently fired en masse on grounds of non-performance.

The earlier order was given on an industrial dispute plea filed by K Ramesha, who was dismissed as Senior Service Programmer while working for HCL Technologies.

Ramesha was fired in 2013, with the management citing poor performance as the reason. Ramesha filed a case against the company in Chennai’s Labor Court for wrongful termination.

HCL had argued that as Ramesha was a ‘supervisor’, the labour rules covering ‘workman’ under the Industrial Disputes Act did not apply to him. But the court ruled that the job of an engineer in a software company involved skills and technical knowledge, and so Ramesha was a ‘workman.’

More importantly, the court also said that HCL Technologies could not produce any evidence to show that failure to improve performance or failure to measure up to the expectations or standing orders of the company would amount to an act of misconduct.

HCL Tech had to reinstate Ramesha and pay full back wages and all other benefits from the date of dismissal to the date of reinstatement.

Leading IT companies have sacked a few thousand people between them over the last month. But in the majority of the cases, the employees were forced to resign so that the companies did not have pay severance packages.

In the recent Tech Mahindra case, the lady official during the course of the conversation (which was recorded and shared by the employee on social media), mentions that cost optimisation is the reason why the termination decision has been taken. She also added that there will not be any review of this decision.

The Industrial Disputes Act clearly spells out conditions of retrenchment of employees in an organisation and also says that ‘last in, first out’ policy is to be followed in terms of retrenchment.

The Act requires the employer to pay severance and notify the labour authorities of a retrenchment. In cases of industrial establishments having atleast 100 (300 in select states) workmen, there is a requirement to obtain prior permission of the government to terminate workmen.

Vikram Shroff, Head, Employment and HR Law at Nishith Desai Associates explained that termination for reasons of non-performance or under-performance can become highly subjective on depend on fact-specific situations.

He also said that labour departments and courts in India receive several claims of unlawful or illegal termination, where employees demand reinstatement with back wages and continuity. The employer may be required to demonstrate that there was reasonable cause for termination and that proper processes were followed.

In the recent firings at IT firms, many employees were told that their performance was not up to the mark, and so they would have to resign.

While court cases may take time to be resolved, the petitioners stand a better chance of a favourable ruling if they move the courts in groups. Here, not only can the decision to terminate one or group of employees can be challenged, but a better severance pay can also be sought.

In the backdrop of the Indian IT industry continuing to deny reports of mass layoffs, an employee of a tech firm has circulated a recording of his sacking, in which he was allegedly told to put in his papers as part of the company's ""restructuring plans"".

In the recording, a human resources executive can be heard asking the employee to resign as part of a “corporate decision”.

In the 6:45-minute long audio clip, the HR executive is asking the employee to put in his papers by 10 am the next day or his services at the company will be terminated.

Listen to the audio clip here:

“Cost optimisation is happening at the company and your name is part of that list. If you can put in papers we will be treating it as a normal exit with June 15 as last working day, if not, we will be sending you a termination letter,” the HR executive said.

This is followed by a few minutes of the employee trying to reason with the HR about such a short notice, his good performance in the past and lack of clarity and options in front of him.

She tells him that as part of the offer letter signed by all employees at the time of joining, the company reserves all rights to let the associates go whenever it wants, with the basic salary.

After some more haggling, and a round of “please understand my situation”, the conversation ends with the employee saying: “That’s very unfortunate madam.”

A screenshot of the LinkedIn profile of the HR manager, purportedly from Tech Mahindra, in the audio clip is also being circulated along with the recording.

When checked, the said profile was found to be unavailable on LinkedIn. However, one of the two managers named in the conversation was found to be a Bengaluru-based Tech Mahindra employee. But Moneycontrol could not locate the profile of the second manager mentioned in the footage.

Tech Mahindra did not reply to Moneycontrol’s email seeking comment on the authenticity of the tape.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the authenticity or timeline of the recording.

A Tech Mahindra employee who did not wish to be named said that the perception of people being laid off is weighing on employees’ minds within the company, but was unaware of any mass firing.

“But one thing is for sure — all bench people are getting laid off at most of the locations. Earlier people on bench used to get 60 days to find a project, but now we hear that time has been reduced to 20 days only,” the employee added.

The news of mass layoffs in the Indian IT industry has been doing the rounds for a few months now. While the industry and individual companies have consistently denied reports of mass layoffs, industry experts have conceded that there is a move to reduce the number of people on bench.

“Bench” is a layer of employees who are not assigned to projects, and kept ready for upcoming projects. As cost pressures increase, companies are looking at “just-in-time” hiring.

This is not the first time an employee has recorded an exit-related conversation. In January 2015, recording of a Chennai-based female employee of Tata Consultancy Services during her exit interview had surfaced.

Similarly, a Capgemini employee based in Gurgaon had recorded her exit interview and uploaded it on YouTube in May, where she can be heard having an argument with two company executives.

According to an industry expert who did not wish to be identified, IT companies are looking to let go of people on bench, those who have generic skills and those on projects where the company may not have visibility on getting more business from clients. Most of this exercise was carried out by companies in the April-June period.

“Legally, there is nothing the employees can do since they get paid basic salary for one, two or three months as per contract,” said this person.

The only option for them is to either identify newer skills or compromise on salary or job quality for the next job.

It is time to be stock specific, maybe that’s the approach mutual fund managers are taking right now at a time when the market trades near record highs. The Nifty50 which has come off slightly from its record high but has gained over 17 percent so far in the year 2017.

Fund managers remained selective when they shopped for stocks in the month of May. They remained net buyers in 65 percent of the Nifty50 stocks, Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Stocks in which funds have more than 2 percent stake include names like Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Power Grid, Infosys, TCS, L&T, State Bank of India, ITC, M&M, ICICI Bank, Eicher Motors etc. among others.

Among the Nifty50 names, highest net buying in the month of May on a month-on-month (MoM) basis was witnessed in Vedanta (up 27 percent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 17 percent) and Tech Mahindra (up 17 percent).

The Equity asset under management (AUM) rose for the sixth consecutive month in May to scale a new high of Rs 5.2 trillion, highlighted the report.

In the month of May, MFs showed interest in private banks, metals, consumer, technology, auto and infrastructure — these sectors saw a MoM increase in weights.

Among the Nifty50 names, top conviction buys include names like HDFC Bank where almost 19 funds have more than 2 percent exposure, followed by ICICI Bank with 16 funds having an exposure of 2 percent and 12 funds have exposure to State Bank of India.

Almost 5 funds have exposure in both Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC while 4 funds have exposure in Yes Bank and 3 funds have holdings in Axis Bank.

Rate sensitive stocks have been fund managers’ darling in the last few months especially private sector banks. Private Banks sectoral weight rose 17.3 percent which as the top sector holding in May, followed by Auto (10.7 percent), Capital Goods (8.7 percent) and NBFC (7 percent).

“Since banks are a play on the economy, they can sustain earnings growth for a long time. Particularly, ICICI Bank is attractively valued while HDFC and Kotak are high-quality stocks that have a track record of delivering superior returns,” Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

Among the IT or technology sector names Infosys remained in the spotlight. Despite global headwinds which have contracted margin for some of the top IT companies, almost 11 funds have holdings of more than 2 percent in Infosys while for TCS it is just 1 fund.

Mutual funds are betting on stocks which have good earnings visibility are stocks from sectors like IT and pharma which are facing some headwinds are valued very low.

Some quality names in both these segments are available at attractive valuations which are attracting smart money into these stocks.

“Clarity from Managements of IT majors on underperformance has helped to rope in some Bargain Hunters into the sector,” Rajesh Shanbhag, Advisory Head – Alternate Channels, Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

Even as the news of mass layoffs in the information technology sector continues to add to the worry of workers, large employers are looking at ways to speak to them and allay fears about job losses.

“There is greater focus by IT companies to send effective internal communications- more townhalls, greater focus on talking about reskilling. Every company has some sort of internal reskilling platform going on,” said Sangeeta Gupta, Senior Vice President at industry body National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom).

According to Nasscom, India’s USD 155 billion IT industry added 1.7 lakh new jobs in the last fiscal, with a total employee base of about 39 lakh.

There have been reports of over 50,000 people in the industry being laid off this year at some of India’s biggest IT companies such as Infosys, Cognizant, and Tech Mahindra. As a result, employees have hit a panic mode.

Benching could mean a layoff

Indian IT companies have consistently denied mass layoffs, but reports of employees being asked to leave is impacting optimism.

“The experience of living with the possibility of redundancy, insecurity of job and watching others leave, has become part of the working experience of many employees which is definitely impacting the employee morale,” said Alka Dhingra, general manager at IT staffing firm TeamLease Limited.

Some employees Moneycontrol spoke to echoed similar sentiments. “People are scared, the market is bad, and nobody is asking to be released from ongoing projects, which was common practice earlier. We’re afraid release from a project as it could mean being laid off,” said an employee at Tech Mahindra, who did not wish to be identified.

The company has also made its employee rating standards stricter, and plans to lay off the employees with lowest rating, said another employee at the company.

An employee at HCL Technologies said the company is looking to reduce its bench strength.

Organisations are looking to nearly eliminate “bench”, or a layer of employees who are not assigned to projects, and kept ready for upcoming projects. “Just-In-Time hiring is becoming the norm now,” said TeamLease’s Dhingra.

Indian IT firms are facing the slowest growth in a decade due to headwinds from increasing automation, changing technology and slowdown in client spending. Protectionist policies in some of the IT sector’s largest markets such as the US, UK, Singapore and Australia have affected the offshore model.

The US and UK account for over 60 percent of the Indian IT services revenues.

All major IT companies have denied reports of mass layoffs, and continue to say whatever dismissals happen are business as usual.

“TCS is not doing any mass layoffs so no such concerns have come up,” a TCS spokesperson told Moneycontrol, when asked about the steps being taken to mitigate employee concerns.

Infosys' Chief Operating Officer UB Pravin Rao told Moneycontrol last week that there were no mass layoffs at Infosys. Tech Mahindra has also denied any mass layoffs in the past.

Wipro and HCL Technologies did not respond to a request seeking comment for this story.

'IT cos need to be open with employees'

According to Ganesh Natarajan, former chief executive officer at Pune-based software company Zensar Technologies, there is a need for IT organisations to accept that there is a real issue in the industry.

“The technology is changing, the growth is low, there is tremendous amount of automation, artificial intelligence etc…so there will be some churning…[but] employers should tell employees that anyone who is willing to reskill themselves, are willing, and accept the pain that is required to learn new technologies, will remain relevant,” he told Moneycontrol.

The key for companies, according to Natarajan, is to “be very open, try not to react through press interviews, and be more open with their employees. They should have a conversation about what are the areas where they see more business happening”.

According to some estimates, about 3 lakh engineers graduate in India each year. According to an Aspiring Minds study, only about 14.67 percent engineers are employable for an IT services company.

“The clear message is that if you have the right skills, there are enough and more jobs for you,” said Nasscom’s Gupta.

Teamlease’s Dhingra said the most impacted by this cycle of churn would be low skill level IT employees. “Skills like cybersecurity, data analytics, software-as-a-service, artificial intelligence, full stack, robotics, cloud, mobility solutions and digital technologies are the major areas of job creation in future,” she added.

In the last two days at least 25 new startups graduated from two Bangalore-based corporate accelerators - Microsoft and Bosch. Joining the bandwagon, cloud infrastructure provider NetApp too launched its own equity-free accelerator program on Wednesday in the city.

Then there are existing accelerators operated by large global IT companies such as Cisco and Oracle which back startups providing innovative solutions. Moneycontrol goes behind the business of accelerators and why corporates are running after incubating startups in their premises.

“It is a good way for the IT companies to inject a new DNA and skills into their existing structure. Entering new markets such as machine learning and artificial intelligence becomes easier if they engage with startups, as building such products in-house from scratch can be a mammoth task,” Ravi Gururaj, Founder & CEO at QikPod and President at TiE says.

It is also a way for the companies to track the disruptive ideas that can educate the top management, which eventually percolates down to the tech teams, he adds.

From fin-tech to retail to ed-tech, a majority of Indian IT companies are tracking startups closely today.

These companies are investing startups that offer technical expertise, hand hold them in creating the go to-the-market strategy, and in turn get their hands on some of the most coveted innovations.

While some, like Infosys and Wipro, have set up dedicated startup funds, others are tracking disruptive technologies in their own sectors.

Microsoft, for instance, gives a chance to the incubated startups to work closely with its Indian partners such as Wipro and TCS. The IT giant also encourages the startups to adopt their cloud platform Azure, creating a cross-selling model.

“It is a win-win proposition for us as well as the startups to work together. The clients are also demanding integration of advanced technologies available today. It is a cross partnership and we definitely want these startups to generate revenues for us,” Ravi Narayan, Global Director for Microsoft Accelerator says.

Also Watch: How GST Will Impact Indian Startups?

The company was also one of the earliest startup accelerators in India - Microsoft accelerator was established around 2012.

Technology giant Google has also shortlisted six Indian startups this year for the fourth batch of its accelerator programme, to be conducted at its Developers Launchpad in San Francisco.

The startups will receive equity-free support and credits for Google products. Technology major Oracle also kicked off its first startup accelerator program recently.

According to a report by Nasscom and Zinnov, India now has the third-highest number of startup incubators and accelerators in the world after China and the US.

Although, India still has a wide gap to fill compared to 2,400 accelerators in China and about 1,500 in the US, the report states. India has about 150.

For their own benefit

Why are these big IT companies vying for startups? The heads of accelerator programs at Microsoft, Wipro, and NetApp feel it is imperative to work with startups at a time when impending automation is threatening to make several job functions outdated.

“Working with startups definitely opens up the innovation logjam. We are looking at unique ideas that address specific problems. These innovations will be absorbed in the larger market that will drive adoption of new technologies,” Ajeya Motaganahalli, Director of NetApp India says.

Moreover, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the big IT companies to attract the best technology talent, which is forcing them to back startups, in order to fill the talent gap. Also, the products and services offered by such companies are becoming irrelevant at a faster pace than we can think.

Explainer: Why are Indian Startups Stumbling?

To keep pace with the latest advances the easiest way for big corporate is to tap startups.

“The average lifespan of a company on the S&P 500 has decreased from 90 years in 1935 to 18 years today. For several organisations, growing in size and becoming process-heavy has resulted in an innovation bottleneck that needs to be addressed. Innovation has become a cornerstone for organisations of tomorrow, with the landscape evolving into a disrupt-or-be-disrupted mode,” Zinnov says in its report.

Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy also recently indicated that the IT manpower needs to be re-skilled instead of laying off staff, to tackle the threat of automation.

Tech Mahindra and MindTree have set up startup segments within the organisations to encourage employees to work on disruptive technologies.

Wipro and Microsoft are also encouraging their existing employees to look at new technology avenues through hackathons and fun training modules.

“The need for re-skilling talent is a reality that we have to address. To keep up in a fast-evolving technology environment, the IT industry must reinvent itself by re-skilling its employees in new and upcoming technologies,” R Chandrashekhar, President, NASSCOM, said.

The industry body also announced the launch of its future skills work group that is working in partnership with big IT companies on a two-pronged approach to enhance the skills ecosystem - Skills vs ‘Job-specific’ Curriculum and Tech enabled Learning Ecosystem. The initiative is aimed towards skilling/reskilling 1.5-2 million people - both aspirants and current employees - over the next 4-5 years.

With large corporations acknowledging this trend and bolstering themselves for the future by investing in innovation, startup accelerators are emerging as the most preferred engagement model.

Pure business

The Startup India guidelines by the government of India also recognise contributions made towards startup incubators as part of Corporate Social Responsibility.

“Contributions or funds provided to technology incubators located within academic institutions which are approved by the Central Government” will be part of mandatory CSR contribution, the guidelines state.

In 2014, the government made it mandatory for big corporate to allocate at least 2 percent of average profits towards CSR. Post that companies like SAP, Tata Motors, and Bajaj Electricals are reported to have invested in such accelerators that are set up in top institutions such as the IIMs and the IITs.

However, the startup incubators set up by the large tech companies are not part of the CSR initiative.

“We don’t look at it as charity. It’s a strategic decision which is in favour of our own company as well as in favour of the startups. The idea is to create an ecosystem of innovation and learning. If we don’t work together with the ecosystem as a whole will not grow,” K R Sanjiv, chief technology officer of Wipro says.

Axis Direct's research report on Tech Mahindra

TechM reported in-line revenue in Q4FY17 (up 1% QoQ in cc terms). EBITDA margin at 12% (370 bps QoQ decline) was much below our estimates due to exit of loss-making contracts (180 bps impact, one off), re-alignment of legacy business (140 bps impact; will recover in 2-3 quarters) and INR appreciation (40 bps impact). Resultant PAT at Rs 5.9 bn was down 31% QoQ.

Outlook

We expect FY18/19 revenue of USD 4.7 bn/5.2 bn. incorporating higher than expected decline in margin and INR appreciation, our FY18E/ FY19E EPS stand at Rs 32/39 (FY18E YoY growth in low single digit of 3%). We rollover our target price to FY19E and value the company at Rs 431 (11x FY19E). With limited upside, we rate the company as HOLD. The stock trades at 13x/11x FY18/19.

KR Choksey's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra underperformed the estimates due to non-recurring charges related to restructuring of non-performing contracts. However, we believe that the company would revive growth with its aggressive move to penetrate emerging markets. The company is expected to complete LCC restructuring by H2FY18.

Outlook

We believe that the management’s stance on aggressively pursuing Digital, Automation, Innovation and Disruption is a right one and will drive revenue growth along with profitability. We have a “Buy” rating on the stock as we assign a multiple of 12.5x to its FY19E EPS to arrive at a price target of INR 473.

FITE has requested the Maharashtra Labour Commissioner to order Tech Mahindra to stop illegal removals of IT employees immediately, and establish conciliation between the management and staff.

""On behalf of Forum for IT employees (FITE), we request you (Labour Commissioner) to intervene and order Tech Mahindra authority to stop such illegal removals forthwith...,"" Elavarasan Raja of FITE of Pune Chapter said in a petition written to the Labour Commissioner.

However, Tech Mahindra has denied the claims of layoffs saying, ""We continue to implement strategies to meet the changing demands of business in the current global economic environment. As a performance driven organisation, we assess employee performance on a regular basis and take necessary actions wherever necessary"".

Raja said the restructuring activity has not been done on performance basis, and thousands of employees who are being terminated are actually good performers as they were rated good in appraisals earlier and also were appreciated and awarded for their work from both the client and the company.

Bell-curve-evaluation appraisal process is not transparent and it is irrespective of the performance of the employees, Raja said.

Edelweiss' research report on Tech Mahindra

Excluding network services, telecom business grew 7.0% for FY17, while enterprise business jumped 12.0%. This implies that all businesses have started recovering, although not enough to absorb LCC impact and drag in Comviva business, which management expects to reverse soon. We believe, LCC, after almost 50% decline, will stabilise now, although it will impact FY18 growth.

Outlook

We believe, excluding LCC, business is gaining traction and margin will also improve hereon spurred by higher utilisation, automation and nonrecurrence of LCC related expenses. We revise down FY18/19E EPS 10.0%/12.9% due to weak Q4FY17 margin and change in USD/INR assumption. Maintain ‘BUY’ with revised TP of INR 563 (INR 642 earlier).

Tech Mahindra lost nearly 17 percent intraday on Monday as investors reacted negatively to the company’s results. The stock was at its 43-month low

The IT services major posted a consolidated net profit for the March quarter at Rs 589.7 crore, a fall of 30.2 percent against Rs 845 crore quarter on quarter.

A poll of analysts by CNBC-TV18 had pegged the net profit at Rs 788 crore.

The company’s consolidated rupee revenue came in around a percent lower at Rs 7,495 crore against Rs 7,557.5 crore QoQ.

Meanwhile, its dollar revenue came in higher by over a percent at USD 1,131.2 million against USD 1,116.1 million posted during the previous quarter.

The stock has shown weak movements, falling 15 percent in the past one month, while its three-day loss was seen at 13 percent. At 09:19 hrs Tech Mahindra was quoting at Rs 364.20, down Rs 65.15, or 15.17 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week low of Rs 363.10.

Brokerages too had a negative outlook on the stock. A look at what top analysts are talking about the stock.

JPMorgan said that the company’s near term outlook on margins seems uncertain and any sign of improvement in it will be evident only in second half of this fiscal. Further, it added that there is a need to see how the firm plans to address its profitability.

Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Equalweight | Target: Rs 455

The global investment bank believes that a margin miss in the fourth quarter is driving the sharp cut in earnings per share (EPS) estimates.

Amid fears that Indian IT has not kept pace with rapidly evolving technologies, executive search firm Head Hunters today expressed optimism that top firms like TCS and Infosys will lead the digital segment.

However, it will be a long-drawn battle as global players like IBM and Accenture, which had invested very early in digital capabilities, command a lion's share of the market, according to Head Hunters India Founder and MD Kris Lakshmikanth.

""Amidst fears that Indian tech companies haven’t kept pace to make the shift from traditional to cutting-edge technologies to meet customer demands, I firmly believe that our top companies including TCS and Infosys, just as they made India the outsourcing global giant, will lead India in the digital business too,"" Lakshmikanth told PTI in an interview here.

He added that industry captains like TCS' N Chandrasekaran, Infosys' Vishal Sikka and Tech Mahindra's C P Gurnani had clearly understood this dramatic change and the challenges of going digital more than two years back.

He also said Indian IT companies have increasingly been shifting their focus from labour-intensive projects to more hi-tech virtual needs like cloud computing, automation and artificial intelligence.

Though he pinned hope on Indian giants succeeding with their deep pockets, Lakshmikanth said it would be a long-drawn battle.

Giving reasons, Lakshmikanth, quoting from HfS Research data, said of the 371 deals of IT companies that the firm tracked in 2015, 137 were digital deals and over half were clinched by global IT service providers, including IBM (45 deals) and Accenture (16).

India-centric service provider Cognizant clinched eight deals, followed by Infosys (5), TCS (4) and Wipro (4).

""This trend has remained the same in 2017 too, where IBM and Accenture continue to win most deals. They invested very early in digital capabilities and have been able to take the lead,"" Lakshmikanth said.

To grow the digital business, Indian companies will have to look at not only building that vision organically, but also through non-organic opportunities to allow them to scale, he said.

Indian IT giants should be interested in acquiring companies that have customers in the US and are focused on new knowhow, he added.

On the other hand, though they have been sitting on piles of cash, they have not been open to digital acquisitions like Accenture, which made significant acquisitions in digital space -- Karmarama and Mobgen in 2016, Lakshmikanth said.

To win digital deals, Indian companies also need to invest in business consultancy to build a consulting brand for themselves, he said.

""Our consulting business is nowhere close to that of IBM or Accenture. These companies have traditionally advised their clients on technology, on business - an advantage which we don't have,"" Lakshmikanth said.

Infosys had acquired Lodestone, a management consultancy firm, in 2012. But it was only in 2015 that the company decided to merge Lodestone with its own small consultancy business and bring more focus to the consulting practice, analysts say.

Lakshmikanth said Infosys, which has decided to hire 10,000 Americans in the next two years, would deploy human resources skilled in digital and business consultancy space.

""I expect Infosys doing this, because it makes business sense. Because, local professionals will have better understanding of customers' digital and consultancy demands,"" he said.",550,0.27284094095230105

Reports of upcoming massive layoffs at India’s biggest IT companies such as Infosys, Cognizant, and Tech Mahindra is adding to the panic among techies in country’s tech hub.

Industry body Nasscom’s confirmation that hiring will continue to be slow throughout the year has further added fuel to the fire.

According to Nasscom, over 50,000 techies may find themselves without a job in coming months.

“Layoffs in IT and BPO sectors are expected to continue this year with the pace of job creation slowing down,” Nasscom cautioned industry in a statement.

The industry body has indicated that more job cuts will follow as companies are gradually moving towards automation and are looking at hiring skilled staff.

“This time, the middle management is also getting affected because of automation. My estimate is that in next one year, at least one lakh jobs will become irrelevant,” Kris Lakshmikanth, CEO of Headhunters said.

According to estimates, Infosys and Wipro are likely to shed about 2,000 jobs, Tech Mahindra is expected to lay off about 1,500 employees, this year.

Deepak an employee of Tech Mahindra is thankful that he has been spared the guillotine of layoffs. But the sense of security is fleeting.

“I thought of looking for a new job, but after these layoffs I have no way to shift. My team members are also nervous about these reports,” he tells Moneycontrol on condition of last name anonymity.

Bopanna, another Bangalore-based techie working with one of the biggest IT hardware company in the city says we have been getting internal e-mails about layoffs in small tranches.

“People in my team are staying put, preparing for the worse. Although no major layoffs have been announced, people who are on bench or on long leaves are being asked to leave,” he says.

Industry is going through automation

Why this sudden flux in layoffs in the IT industry? Roydon Gonsalves, Director, CXO Practice, Ray & Berndtson HR practices, is of the view that IT industry is in a stage of transformation.

Big players such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, and Cognizant have been servicing segments that require human intervention.

“They have not been able to keep pace with this change. The transformation to a new skill set should have been a gradual one. But now that automation is a reality, these companies are rushing to hire talent with new skill sets,” he said.

Although the process of layoffs is a routine process, the quantum of it this time is huge, even when we compare the massive layoffs undertaken by TCS last year.

How benching is used a pretext to layoffs

Every year, companies conduct performance based appraisals and about 2 percent of the workforce is sacked.

According to industry sources, IT companies are deliberately evaluating employees to the lowest rating, and putting them on bench to cut workforce. This practice portrays layoffs as a routine process inside companies.

A source in the higher management of Wipro also said that the practice of shedding off benchers and contractors is underway. He did not want to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media.

One can read between the lines in official company statements on layoffs.

“We conduct regular performance reviews to ensure we have the right employee skill sets necessary to meet client needs and achieve our goals. This process results in changes, including some employees transitioning out of the company,” Cognizant said in an official statement.

Re-skill is the need of the hour

Naresh Krishna, managing an IT project for Ernst & Young says that as an employee, layoffs and hiring freeze is depressing. “But as a manager, I can tell you that hiring people with new skill sets is imperative. There is no other way to go,” he says.

Organizations are gradually doing away with basic coding jobs and other positions in the low-skilled category that is set to become outdated because of automation.

“Employees will have to re-invent themselves with new skill sets to make them useful in an automated work environment. If that doesn’t happen people will lose jobs,” says Srikanth Srinivasan, regional director at Nasscom.

The change in focus of the IT companies towards new technologies is another reason why IT companies are looking at renewing their workforce.

“I am a trained software engineer. But Now I find myself completely at loss because my company wants me to work on AI, BI, or cloud. I will have to go back to the school to acquire these skills,” Mohit Wadhwa, a Bangalore-based techie working with Wipro says.

Mohit is instead contemplating changing his line of profession and jump to smartphone engineering or teaching.

In the recent past, big IT companies have faced competition from emerging technologies such as big data, data analytics and so on. IT firms are now investing heavily on developing capabilities around these emerging technologies. “This will render a lot of mundane jobs irrelevant and create job opportunities for people with a niche skill set,"" Gonsalves said.

H-1B troubles to complicate matters

But the reasons behind troubles in IT sector are not all domestic. The tightening of H-1B visa regime in the United States has also forced IT giants to create fundamental changes in their hiring strategy. The restrictions have forced the IT companies to maintain a workforce which is highly skilled.

""Indian IT companies are bound to face disruptions by way of higher costs and even some laying off work force back home, because of US visa rules,"" industry body Assocham said in a report.

The US visa rules have narrowed the scope of IT firms to export talent for projects bagged overseas. The lottery-based system of awarding H1B Visa was dominated by Indian IT companies with over 80 percent approval rate.

Under the new visa rules spearheaded by President Donald Trump, H-1B will be given to the most skilled and highest-paid applicants.

""Nearly 86 per cent of the H-1B visas are issued to Indian IT workers. This figure will narrow down to about 60 percent or less,” Assocham said in a paper. Plus the requirement of paying Indian IT workers in US at par with the American counterparts will further shoot up the cost.

Kris of Headhunters says that IT companies this year have applied 50 percent less H1B visas this year, which reduces their need for workforce. “The deal size from US clients has also gone down,” he said.

Although the techies in Bangalore we spoke to welcome this move of salary at par, the IT companies will have to streamline their costs to safeguard their revenues.

“I went to Germany for a project with Tech Mahindra. The romance of working in a foreign country is overrated if you go on an onsite, because the expenses and allowances are a huge mismatch. If salaries are paid at par, it is good for us,” Deepak says.

Kris Lakshmikanth, CEO of Headhunters also says that the IT companies have no choice but to reduce their workforce here because projects abroad are drying up. “They are unable to place as many workforce for US projects as they did before, which is eating up their revenues.”

“Hiring one person abroad would mean firing 4 here, to offset the cost of employing local talent in US. Even if they send someone from here, the cost of acquiring an employee will go up. That will be balanced here via layoffs,” he adds.",1318,-0.8242330465997968

The rupee hit a nearly 1-1/2 year high against the dollar on Monday, tracking gains in Asian currencies after U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to pass a healthcare reform bill raised concerns about the chances of a US fiscal stimulus.

The Reserve Bank of India stepped in to cap broader gains in the rupee, traders said, adding that some of the gains were also due to the strong $6.1-billion foreign investment into debt and equities this month.

The gains in the local unit spurred by strong dollar inflows helped spark a rally in bond markets, sending the benchmark 10-year bond yield down as much as 12 basis points to 6.71 percent, the lowest since February 8 when the central bank unexpectedly changed its monetary policy stance to ""neutral"" from ""accommodative.""

However, shares fell as software services exporters and drug makers were hit by worries about the impact of a stronger rupee. The broader Nifty was down 0.75 percent at 9,039.60 by 0635 GMT, while the benchmark Sensex was 0.69 percent lower at 29,218.19.

Movements in India broadly tracked regional markets after Trump's inability to get enough support from his own Republican Party to reform healthcare was seen raising questions about his ability to push the rest of his agenda.

""Both global and domestic factors are riding the market today,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.

At 0656 GMT, the rupee was trading at 65.0575 after earlier strengthening to as much as 65.01 per dollar, the strongest level since October 2015.

The rally in the rupee sent IT shares lower, with Tech Mahindra Ltd down 2.2 percent and HCL Technologies Ltd down 1.9 percent.

Drug makers also fell, with Lupin Ltd and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd falling 2 percent and 1.8 percent respectively.

Among other decliners, Reliance Industries Ltd fell as much as 2.42 percent after the Securities and Exchange Board of India accused the company of having committed a ""fraud"" in taking a short trading position at the time of selling a stake in a unit 10 years ago.

Reliance strongly denied the ruling and said it would appeal.

The future is clearly digital. Companies will increasingly have to rely on digital tools to remain relevant and profitable. Tech Mahindra announced on Tuesday that it had set up a state-of-the-art lab that would showcase technologies and their use to improve productivity on factory shop floors.

Known as the “Factory of the Future” lab, the new centre will showcase assets and solutions in the areas of digital manufacturing, connected machines, additive manufacturing, robotics & automation, artificial intelligence & analytics, and augmented reality & virtual reality. These technologies have the ability to amplify productivity with minimal human intervention.

Manufacturing or industrial segment is the one, where the impact of technology is much more visible than others. From being a mostly people or labour-intensive model in the late 80s, to adopting automation tools, software and platforms, manufacturing at presently is a greatly transformed segment. The industry is now at a cusp of embracing the next generation of automation wherein robots will work alongside humans in a connected factory floor that is powered by technologies such as AI, robotic & automation, machine learning amplified by increasing use of big data and analytics in decision-making.

Edelweiss' report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TECHM) announced acquisition of CJS Solutions (CJS, d.b.a. HCI group), an IT and consulting services company for healthcare players based in the US and UK. The acquisition will open cross-selling opportunities for TECHM and strengthen its prowess in the fast growing healthcare & life sciences vertical, which currently contributes sub-5% to the company’s revenue.

Outlook

We believe, valuation at 1.0x EV/sales for TTM September 2016 is reasonable considering TECHM’s focus on enhancing presence in the fast-growing healthcare space. We have not factored impact of the acquisition as we await regulatory approval (likely by Q1FY18). Maintain ‘BUY’ with INR 642 target price.

Tech Mahindra

Bank of America Merrill Lynch says acquisition of US-based CJS Group provides Tech Mahindra with an entry in the healthcare vertical. Business exposure of CJS is mainly to clients in US & UK.

Acquisition transaction is likely to be mildly earnings accretive and deal valuation at USD 110 million appears to be in-line with industry trend, the brokerage house feels.

Tech Mahindra is likely to use existing cash for CJS' acquisition. BoAML sees a contingent mull of USD 130.5 million based on 2017-19 revenue and EBITDA targets.

The brokerage house has maintained underperform rating on sensitivity w.r.t H-1B visa program in the US. Every 10 percent increase in H-1B wages may hurt earnings by 11 percent, on gross basis, BoAML feels.

However, Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock as it finds CJS acquisition attractive on reasonable valuations.

CJS' large US-employee base should provide company with better employee mix, it believes. Based on current revenue & margin, Credit Suisse believes acquisition to be earnings-neutral.

Bharat Financial

Kotak Institutional Equities cautioned the street of higher-than-expected stress in Bharat Financial's portfolio. It has retained reduce call with a target price of Rs 730.

While maintaining neutral rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 720, Credit Suisse says there has been no sharp recovery in collections and over 4.4 percent portfolio remained overdue for more than two months.

It feels, shortfall in collections in off-book remains significant.

Bajaj Finserv

Goldman Sachs has revised its target upwards on Bajaj Finserv to Rs 3,220 from Rs 2,960 as it incorporated updated valuation. Demonetisation impact faded but earnings headwinds remain, it feels.

The brokerage house is continued to apply a 10 percent conglomerate discount on the company. Securing major bancassurance partner and better-than-expected margin are key risks.

ACC

CLSA says it has reiterated sell call on ACC as company's internal & external pressures impacted 2016 performance and lack of growth focus drove market share losses again.

It believes new unit in East India should help volumes in the medium-term. CLSA still see company as a key beneficiary in an upcycle.

Potential merger with Ambuja Cements could help drive synergy benefits, it feels.

Tata Power

Goldman Sachs has retained neutral rating on Tata Power as it factored in the Welspun acquisition in estimates.

The research firm has increased target price to Rs 81 from Rs 79, though FY17-19 topline estimates declined by 12-19 percent & profit by 3-12 percent.

Axis Bank

Goldman Sachs has maintained sell rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 398 on weak fundamentals in the near-medium term.

The stock is trading at 2.6x book adjusted for 70 percent provision coverage, it says.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank, with a target price at Rs 925.

Jindal Steel

Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock, with increased target price at Rs 150 from Rs 110. It feels operational recovery will continue as volumes ramped up.

Higher steel prices/coal output resulted in 3-7 percent higher EBITDA. Any favourable outcome of the pending cases could be an added plus, Credit Suisse feels.

Media

Nomura says it feels new tariff order by TRAI for broadcast & cable services is positive for media industry. According to the brokerage house, cost per pay channel is likely to go up, especially for MSOs (multiple system operators).

It says there is no clarity over how TRAI’s order will be implemented in analogue areas. Uniform pricing formula favours DTH & broadcasters, but may be negative for MSOs, it feels.

Nomura believes large broadcasters such as Zee Entertainment will be less affected on strong demand. Operators such as Dish TV may benefit from higher carriage costs and better ARPUs, it feels.

Digitisation & better monetisation will be key medium-term drivers, Nomura says.",648,0.14488498653684342

Investors cheered Tech Mahindra 's latest acquisition as the stock rose over 2 percent intraday. The IT giant announced the purchase of US-based CJS Solutions Group at an enterprise value of USD 110 million. CJS Solutions conducts business as The HCI Group. The company will provide IT services to the healthcare provider. The deal is likely to be closed by April 2017. As part of it, Tech Mahindra will be paying USD 89.5 million upfront for 84.7 percent stake in the firm. The remainder stake will be purchased over the next three years. Additionally, there is a contingent consideration of USD 130.5 million that is payable over three years. On financial front, HCI Group has a TTM revenue of USD 114 million as of September 2016 with high single digit margins. Analysts have given the deal a thumbs up, citing appropriate valuations as one of the reasons.The research firm feels that the buyout will help the IT giant scale up its healthcare vertical and there could be cross-selling synergies. This should help it improve the local US employee mix as well, which currently stands at 35 percent. Morgan Stanley also concurs with the view on cross-selling.

Software services industry lobby Nasscom today said it expects the sector to grow at 8-10 percent next financial year but added that a clearer picture will emerge only over the next two to three months.

""We gave the projection to media last November. Now between November and February...now March, not much has changed that I can change my projection. So, I have given the projection on behalf of Nasscom that the growth will be 8 to 10 percent,"" Nasscom chairman CP Gurnani told reporters.

""All I am saying is that we will wait till the fourth quarter results, after which we will have a better understanding of primary data. As soon as we get that, we compile it and will comeback to you in May with our forecast,"" the Tech Mahindra chief executive said.

It can be noted that Nasscom had revised down its fiscal 2017 revenue growth target to 8-10 percent from an initial 10-12 percent as the headwinds from the US, which is the single largest revenue source for the industry, started emerging following the election of Donald Trump.

At the Nasscom leadership forum in the middle of last month, where the industry traditionally used to give out its growth forecast, the industry lobby delayed its estimate to May citing the many emerging headwinds.

According to Gurnani, many domestic IT companies may change their business strategies and regroup themselves owing to newer trends such as increasing automation artificial intelligence, digital data and digital disruption.

""At the same time, there is a feeling within Nasscom that the industry is going to change. It is going to change because of automation, artificial intelligence, digital data and digital disruption. So, many companies will regroup themselves and re-architect their journey forward,"" he said.

When asked about the developments in the US regarding immigration rules, he said, ""if we start getting ahead of ourselves, we will be getting unnecessarily worried. The US needs us as much as we need them"".

On the falling hiring trends, he said the current trend suggests that job accretion will be at best half of its growth in recent years.",362,-0.4966515451669693

Pushed into a corner due to a potentially poor salary increase and slower job growth, India’s IT sector professionals have knocked on the government’s door seeking a respite from tough exit clauses. Over 28,000 IT employees have signed an online petition asking the Labour Ministry to stop IT companies from holding them to a three-month non-negotiable notice period, The Economic Times reported Thursday.

“It is unrealistic for anyone to plan that far ahead for their future actions and resign in advance not knowing state of the issue in next three months” the petition said. Employees at IT biggies such as TCS, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, HCL Technologies, Capgemini, Accenture and IBM have to serve three-month-long notice period before joining other companies.

The 3.9-million-strong IT sector expects a low single-digit wage increase for FY18. Also, industry experts view three-month notice period as a measure to fight attrition and employee-retention tool. Long notice period also can dissuade IT employers to wait for prospective employees.

Besides, IT services sector sees employees as billable resources. Thus, company may lose money if a suitable replacement is not found in time, which forces employers to resort to various measures to retain employees.

Tech Mahindra has halted the salary revision process for employees with more than six years of experience, subject to a management review. IT industry body, National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) had postponed setting a target for industry growth until May in view of slowing growth and regulatory hurdles in the United States for H1B visas.

Human resource experts said the three-month notice period is being used as a tool by IT companies to combat high attrition rates. While these rates vary, most Indian IT firms face attrition rates of between 13% and 20%, according to industry estimates.

TCS, Tech Mahindra and Capgemini did not reply to ET’s email queries, while a NASSCOM spokesperson said notice period was a company-level decision and that there was no collective industry view on the issue.",339,-0.6041740924119949

Lupin

With assigning underperform rating on Lupin and target price of Rs 1,350, Credit Suisse says surprising approval of generic Suprep Bowel Prep Kit could add 5 percent to its FY18 EPS. It could record revenue of USD 40 million for Lupin and competition will be high post exclusivity, it feels.

Lupin has received approval for Suprep Bowel Prep Kit and is eligible for six months sole exclusivity. It has lost the case at the district court and patent expiry for Suprep is later in 2023. Lupin settled on the product in Aug-2016 but the settlement terms were not known, Credit Suisse says.

Nomura also says it may see USD 40 million in revenue during the exclusivity period from this drug. Settlement allows company to launch gSuprep in FY18 with 180-day exclusivity.

With maintaining neutral rating on the stock and target price of Rs 1,626, Nomura says it projects earnings CAGR of 12 percent over FY17-19 despite a large base.

Morgan Stanley has maintained overweight rating on Lupin, with a price target of Rs 1,846.

Tata Motors

CIMB has a reduce call on Tata Motors and lowered target price to Rs 339 from Rs 352.

After Q3 JLR EBITDA margin collapsed due to poor product mix, high ASP discounts, the brokerage house cut its FY17-19 consolidated EPS forecasts by 17-50 percent.

Profitability due to success of new Land Rover product is a key upside risk, it says.

Cement sector

CLSA says cement sector in FY17 is likely to report a YoY decline, the first in 15 years. The brokerage house turned cautious due to concerns on volumes & margins.

UltraTech Cement is its relative pick in the sector.

Goldman Sachs forecasts flat cement demand growth for FY17 and sees 8-9 percent demand decline for March quarter.

It also remained cautious on near-term cement demand. It believes demand will continue to be affected in near-term due to note ban.

Cement demand remained weak in January, registering 13 percent decline. Prices are better but sustainability of price increase remained under pressure.

In fact, the company is now more competitive because it has access to a wider range of world-class skills at lower costs, he added.

""To our respective existing customer pools we can offer fully comprehensive design and engineering services. Further, we see synergies with Tech Mahindra enabling us to compete with more traditional players in the domain of electric and hybrid platforms, autonomous driving and connected cars,"" Angori said.

Tech Mahindra sees the proposed merger of Vodafone and Idea as a ""seismic"" event that will impact the IT sector, but asserted that it will benefit from such a deal.

The software firm derives over half of its revenue from servicing communication companies.

""It is a big market where these people are merging together. In my world, it is a seismic change. It is not an ordinary change. Clearly, it means that certain part of the IT spend will either come down or get re-directed,"" Tech Mahindra MD and CEO CP Gurnani told PTI here over the weekend.

However, he said that rather than being affected, Tech Mahindra may benefit from such a merger. ""The reason it may not have any impact on us, as a matter of fact it will get better for us, because for both the companies our primary focus is on customer service management."" He said the vendor servicing of both the company's traditional information technology needs will be impacted because of the merger, but sought to distinguish Tech Mahindra from it because of nature of the job it does.

""I do project work for both the companies, and I don't do the main or traditional IT work. Since I am working more on change and customer experience management, my pie should grow,"" Gurnani said.

He also said that over 50 per cent of his revenue of his company, which was formerly Mahindra British Telecom, come from the communication segment, and the company is trying to balance it out by growing faster in other segments.

Vodafone and Idea Cellular, the second and third biggest telcos in the country, have confirmed last month that they are in talks to create a telecom giant which will take on Reliance Jio, the aggressive new entrant flush with cash, and the entrenched leader Bharati Airtel.

Investors wondering what to do with the Infosys stock should go by the company’s fundamentals rather be distracted by the ongoing row, feels Gautam Duggad, Head of Research-Institutional Equities at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

So far, the Infosys stock price has been resilient to the war of words between the company’s founders and the board.

""The noise will settle down; what is relevant for Infosys and IT companies is the way things are shaping up in the technology world,” Duggad said in a free-wheeling chat with Moneycontrol.

The rapid changes in the technology sector is threatening the business models of most Indian IT companies. Duggad, however feels Infosys can weather the storm.

""This is at the bottom end of the P/E(price to earning) range it has traded at in the last ten years,"" Duggad said, adding, ""We are quite positive on Infosys; they are best placed in terms of maneuvering the transformation in the business model and reacting to bigger shifts underway.""

In the pecking order, Duggad likes Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra. However, he is bearish on midcap IT stocks, though both large cap and midcap IT companies are trading cheaper than long term averages.

""We feel that the ability of large cap players to handle the whole transformation and the shift that is happening with digital and automation is superior than in the case of midcap companies,” Duggad said.

In general, Duggad is wary of investing in midcap stocks at current prices.

""The premium of mid cap over large caps was 3 percent in December; that has now risen to 12 percent,” Duggad said, adding expected returns did not justify the risk of investing in these stocks.

Given where the valuations are today, Duggad prefers large caps over mid-caps.

Duggad is a follower of the bottom up approach to investing in which the investor focusses on the individual stock rather than the industry or the economy as a whole.

""Over the last few years a top down theme for lot of sectors like FMCG, banks, autos and NBFC worked on account of a fall in interest rates and commodity prices, but by and large we think that it’s a bottom up approach which works better in markets like India,"" he said.

An avid follower of cricket and politics, Duggad is bullish on the market and confident of a pick up on corporate earnings. He expects interest rate-sensitive sectors such as automobiles, banks, and infrastructure will get a boost from lower interest rates.

There are additional tailwinds in the form of fairly robust macroeconomic indicators and a continued thrust on reforms across sectors.

Duggad finds the Budget estimates quite credible but added that government needs to drive capex in the absence of investments by corporates.

He sees corporate spending picking up only when overall capacity utilization exceeds 80 percent. Currently, the economy is operating at roughly 70 percent of its capacity.

Duggad feels balance sheets of banks in general are far from healthy because of bad loan problems. Adding to the problem is the tepid demand for loans as companies are trying to reduce the debt on their own balance sheet.

Duggad is upbeat on oil & gas, IT, select auto, PSU banks and metal stocks.

""Among retail private banks we like HDFC Bank, YES Bank and RBL, in corporate banks we like ICICI and within PSUs we like SBI,” said Duggad.

He advises investors to pick up 3 or 4 good funds which have delivered good returns over different time periods with lesser volatility and invest systematically.

Duggad likes reading investment books and is currently reading a book named ‘Value Migration: How to Think Several Moves Ahead of the Competition’ by Adrian Slywotzky.(Disclaimer: Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL) and its associates have a financial interest in the securities mentioned above however they do not have actual/ beneficial ownership of 1% or more securities of the subject to the company at the end of Jan 2015.)",674,0.5510759711265564

Axis Direct's research report on Tech Mahindra

Q3FY17revenue at USD 1,116mn was higher (ours: USD 1,101 mn) driven by higher growth in BFSI (up 19% QoQ, 13% share) and Retail (up 16% QoQ, 8% share) among verticals and Rest of World (up 13% QoQ, 24% share) among geographies. Q2 had absorbed one-time restructuring; hence, Q3 margin is lower on a like-to-like basis. PAT was higher due to lower tax (prior period adjustment of Rs 900mn).

OutlookWe expect TechM to deliver 9% revenue CAGR over FY16-18 with EBITDA margin of 15/16% in FY17/18.Our FY17E/ FY18E EPS stands at Rs 33/ Rs 43. Our TP at Rs 472 (11x FY18E) implies limited upside from CMP of Rs 472. Maintain HOLD. The stock trades at 14x/11x FY17/18.

Moneycontrol BureauTech Mahindra has halted its appraisal for employees with over six years of experience as the industry grapples with both global and domestic challenges. The suspension decision is pending a management review, according to a report on The Economic Times.The senior level employees will have to wait for another two quarters or so before any final decision on wage hike comes through. Other employees will get their appraisal letters in March, but the hike will be applicable from July. The media report says that the company informed its decision to the employees via a webinar chaired by L Ravichandran, chief operating officer of the company. Confirming the news to ET, Tech Mahindra’s management said that wage hikes have not been postponed indefinitely and a management review is awaited before any decision on the subject is made. Mahindra’s management also said that the decision to suspend hikes has nothing to do with its third quarter numbers. In Q3, the company reported 4 percent sequential rise in revenue to USD 1.12 billion while the profit rose 30.8 percent to USD 126.3 million. In the same sector, Infosys is looking to end the practice of giving revenue forecast on back of issues while estimating spend of its US clients, says a report in today’s Livemint. The company has already stopped giving quarterly guidance in 2012 and is now contemplating halting its year guidance as well. Another IT major, TCS does not give guidance while Wipro only gives quarterly guidance. Changing technology, uncertain political conditions as well as shift from time and labour to market innovation are the current bumps for these companies.",280,

ICICI Direct's research report on Tech Mahindra

TechM revenues grew 4.1% in dollar terms and 5.4% in CC terms. The key highlight for Q3FY17 was enterprise segment (52.7% of revenue), up 6.3% QoQ (vs. 5.6% QoQ growth in Q2FY17) and communication segment (47.3% of revenue), up 1.7% QoQ (vs. 2.3% QoQ growth in Q2FY17). Top five client (27.8% of revenue) revenues also continued its momentum by growing 1.5% QoQ.

OutlookWe believe TechM could witness a gradual uptick in communication vertical post its completion of restructuring activity and continued momentum for enterprise vertical (16% growth in 9MFY17 over 9MFY16). We anticipate TechM will report rupee revenue, PAT CAGR of 11.1%, 7.3%, respectively, in FY16-18E (average 15.5% EBITDA margins in FY17-18E), driven by strong order bookings and large deal ramp-ups. We maintain our BUY recommendation on TechM with a target price of Rs 525 based on FY18E EPS of Rs 40.4.

OutlookTechM reported a solid set of numbers in Q3 and displayed sustainable growth in Telecom business along with continuous improvement in deal wins. Management confidence on win rates, engagements and market opportunities is noteworthy as Tier I peers struggle to maintain growth momentum and consistency. We are also optimistic about portfolio restructuring initiatives in LCC business and expect recovery process to continue through FY18E. We believe that the management’s stance on aggressively pursuing Digital, Automation, Innovation and Disruption is a right one and will drive revenue growth along with profitability.

Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol ResearchUS President Donald Trump is living up to his promises – or threats, depending on where you stand. In a first direct hit on the Indian software sector, Trump has introduced a bill to increase the stipulated salary of H-1B visa holders from USD 60,000 per annum to USD 130,000 per annum.

IT stocks have taken a beating on the bourses since the news was flashed with the NSE IT index falling by 2.83 percent at 2.00 pm. TCS is the biggest loser with a fall of 4.05 percent followed by Tech Mahindra with a drop of 3.58 percent.

Analysts expected Trump to make such a move but their expectation was a rise to USD100,000 per annum. Nearly doubling of H-1B salaries is expected to severely impact companies with a high dependency on such employees.

The United States accounts for nearly 65 percent of all software exports from India; however, revenue generated by the companies through H-1B visa employees is much smaller. Around 15 percent of headcount is made up of H-1B visa employees.

However, the impact is expected to be big. In FY15, the year for which the latest figuers are available, the number of H-1B visas issued stood at 172,748.

Take the case of TCS, its average salary level for H-1B is USD 69,648 per annum for its employees, 15 percent above the minimum level as per the Kotak Securities report. There are 16,553 H-1B employees sponsored by TCS. The hike to USD 130,000 will thus add nearly USD 1 billion in incremental costs for TCS per annum, that is, nearly one-fourth of its FY17 profit.

For Infosys the impact is higher. It has a higher average salary of USD 79,201 but also employs nearly twice as many on the H-1B at 33,289. The employee cost for Infosys is expected to increase by USD 1.69 billion per annum. The table below shows the impact on top IT companies in India.

It needs to be seen how much of the wage hike will be passed on to the US customers.

According to Kotak Securities, payment of minimum wages is optional provided an H-1B dependent employer provides additional attestations that they have taken steps in good faith to recruit US locals, using procedures that meet industry-wise standards. Also, if the employer ensures that they will not displace any US employee that is similarly situated as the H-1B worker for 90 days before and 90 days after the H-1B petition is filed. But Kotak Securities is not sure if Indian companies will choose this route to avoid minimum wages.

Software industry body Nasscom, however, feels there is still some time before the bill is implemented.",456,-0.9996566772460938

Moneycontrol Bureau Shares of Tech Mahindra slumped 10 percent as minimum salary of H-1B visa holders is proposed to be more than double. A legislation has been introduced in the US House of Representatives which among other things calls for more than doubling the minimum salary of H-1B visa holders to USD 130,000, making it difficult for firms to use the programme to replace American employees with foreign workers, including from India.

Analysts feel that as compared to IT peers, Tech Mahindra stands at a higher risk of losing revenue if higher minimum wage for H1-B is fixed. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch every 10 percent hike in H-1B wages can hurt earnings is an earnings risk of 4-11 percent. Tech Mahindra has earnings negative impact of 11 percent due to 10 percent hike in wage bill.

Tech Mahindra’s dependence on visas is high for core IT services. The acquisition of LCC (has improved the local mix.

Shares of technology stocks tanked, dragging the index around 4 percent on visa concerns. Stocks like TCS, Infosys and Wipro fell 3-5 percent while Tech Mahindra tanked 10 percent intraday Tuesday as minimum salary of H-1B visa holders is proposed to be more than double. A legislation has been introduced in the US House of Representatives which among other things calls for more than doubling the minimum salary of H-1B visa holders to USD 130,000, making it difficult for firms to use the programme to replace American employees with foreign workers, including from India.How the number stack up?

Infosys had 14,659 employees on H-1B visas and 1364 employees on L-1 visas in the US at end-FY2016. So as per calculations, H-1B ratio would be 30:70. A look at FY2016 H-1B filings data indicates that Infosys has the highest per-capita onsite wage in the peer group.

TCS historically had high dependence on visa but it would have reduced in the past three years given that the company has stepped up local hiring. As per H-1B filings data, TCS’ onsite compensation is on the lower side in the peer group.

Wipro’s last disclosed local headcount was 40 percent in the US. The ratio between visa holders and locals would have remained steady or increased marginally in favor of locals since then. Additionally, acquisition of Appirio and HPS provides additional 3000 local headcount in the US.

HCL Tech has 65 percent locals in its US workforce and its wages are also at the top end among Indian IT. Accordingly, it is likely to be the least impacted.

Tech Mahindra’s dependence on visas is high for core IT services. The acquisition of LCC (has improved the local mix. It has 9,000 people including LCC headcount in US of which about 5000 are on visas (45 percent locals).According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, every 10 percent hike in H-1B wages can hurt earnings of Tech Mahindra by 4-11 percent. Tech Mahindra has earnings negative impact of 11 percent due to 10 percent hike in wage bill.The legislation proposalThe High-Skilled Integrity and Fairness Act of 2017 introduced by California Congressman Zoe Lofgren prioritises market based allocation of visas to those companies willing to pay 200 percent of a wage calculated by survey, eliminates the category of lowest pay, and raises the salary level at which H-1B dependent employer are exempt from non displacement and recruitment attestation requirements to greater than USD 130,000.

This is more than double of the current H-1B minimum wage of USD 60,000 which was established in 1989 and since then has remained unchanged.

It raises the salary level at which H-1B dependent employer are exempt from attestation requirements to a new required wage level of 35 percentile points above the median national annual wage for Computer and Mathematical Occupations published by the Department of Labour Occupational Employment Statistics (roughly USD132,000), which would be adjusted in the future without the need for new legislation, and eliminates the Master’s Degree exemption for dependent employers. The legislation sets aside 20 percent of the annually allocated H-1B visas for small and start-up employers (50 or fewer employers) to ensure small businesses have an opportunity to compete for high-skilled workers, while still protecting against outsourcing.

It among other things removes visa hurdles for students and other temporary visa holders by building a bridge from F-1 student status to Lawful Permanent Residence and removes paperwork burdens by streamlining H-1B filing requirements and reducing administrative costs.The legislation tightens employee protection by stipulating that employers may not reduce beneficiary wages, regardless of whether the deduction is in accordance with a voluntary authorisation by the employee.

India Post has received payments bank licence from the Reserve Bank of India to start rollout of banking operations commercially under the permit.

""India Post has received payments bank licence. The service will be launched as per schedule,"" a Department of Posts official said.

India Post Payments Bank is the third entity to receive payments bank permit after Bharti Airtel and Paytm.

Payments banks can accept deposits up to Rs 1 lakh per account from individuals and small businesses.

The new model of banking allows mobile firms, supermarket chains and others to cater to banking requirements of individuals and small businesses. It will be set up as a differentiated bank and will confine its activities to acceptance of demand deposits, remittance services, Internet banking and other specified services.

In 2015, RBI had granted 'in-principle' approval to 11 entities, including Department of Posts, to set up payments banks and proposed to give such licences 'on tap' basis in future.

However, Tech Mahindra, a consortium of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd promoter Dilip Shanghvi, IDFC Bank Ltd and Telenor Financial Services and Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. backed have dropped their plan to roll out payments bank.

Out of eight companies in fray -- Airtel has launched its commercial operation across India with an investment of Rs 3,000 crore offering interest rate of 7.25 per cent on deposits, free money transfer from Airtel to Airtel numbers within Airtel Bank, money transfer to any bank account in the country.

Paytm, promoted by Vijay Shekhar Sharma and backed by Chinese e-commerce major Alibaba, plans to roll out payments bank within initial investment of about Rs 400 crore.

Others are -- Aditya Birla Nuvo, Fino PayTech, National Securities Depository, Reliance Industries Ltd nd Vodafone m-pesa.

Bullish on prospects of new innovations like automation and artificial intelligence, industry leader C P Gurnani today said the Indian IT sector should see them as opportunities, but the challenge is to create new skill sets for these areas.

Gurnani said artificial intelligence is here to stay and if one does not adopt it, the person is ""not intelligent"".

He also dismissed suggestions that automation and new innovations would hurt the job market and asserted that these new things will require new skill sets.

Gurnani, the CEO of leading IT firm Tech Mahindra, said opportunities are still there and the industry would also need to partner in creating new skills.

""Skills required for tomorrow are very different and it can be an opportunity. But if we don't adopt and change, every opportunity can be a threat, too. We will have to change, otherwise we won't be ready with right skills,"" he told PTI in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting.

Asked what are the main expectations of Indian leaders and especially the IT sector from the WEF summit this year, Gurnani said, ""To say that there are really some expectations will be a difficult statement because clearly the world in 2017 is trying to get some amount of stability and direction.

""All said and done, there are challenges before the world and they are only going to become interesting. Clearly, Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit and his stance on various issues is going to be very important because China has emerged as a major world force and how they view Brexit and the changes that Trump Presidency would bring in are going to be critical."" He said Jinping's views will certainly bring in some amount of direction to the way the world is going to shape out.

""Clearly, some of the challenges that we are seeing whether about Syria etc are critical,"" he said, adding that elections in some European countries like France and Germany are also going to be important.

""Clearly, the world around us is changing and we need to get some direction,"" he added.

Gurnani, who is also the Vice-President of IT industry body Nasscom and works closely with technology-related groupings at WEF, said other key issues likely to be discussed at the summit will be digital disruptions and new opportunities.

Asked whether de-globalisation is a potential risk the world and the IT industry is looking at, he said: ""The fact is till the time you get some direction, everything is open.

Instead of predicting, I'm looking for the direction."" ""Good news is technology is making all the disruptions and there are not enough skills available today to meet all the demand. It will always be a demand-supply scenario and I'll see it as an opportunity,"" he said.

Gurnani also said the world and the sector should not be seen as software-hardware and it should be seen as a ""connected world"".

""In my opinion, barriers for IT are not globalisation or de-globalisation today. These are irrelevant because you can't put any barrier on software,"" he said.",525,-0.32665420571962994

Aurobindo PharmaTarget Price: Rs 921Upside: 33 percentReasons: Faster approvals and market share gains in recently launched products will drive US business growth of 17 percent CAGR over FY16-18.

Expect valuation discount to converge on back of healthy earnings growth of 21 percent CAGR over FY16-18E driven by improving product mix in US and EU margin expansion.

Any delays in USFDA approvals of key ANDAs filed or any delays in EU site transfer of products could cap margin expansion.

BPCL

Target Price: Rs 710Upside: 7 percentReasons: Estimate BPCL’s refining segment EBITDA to increase by 40% over FY16-18E driven by higher refining margins and throughput post Kochi capacity expansion.

Expect net auto fuel marketing margin to improve over the next 12 months by over 10 percent – every Rs 0.5/litre increase in margin improves BPCL’s FY17 EPS by 13 percent.

Forecast EBITDA/ net profit growth of 13 percent/ 14 percent CAGR over FY16-18

Maruti

Target Price: Rs 200Upside: 10 percent Reasons: The company will likely be the key beneficiary when the demand recovery in P/V resumes after the initial shock.

Our preference for Maruti is based on the company’s model pipeline (the strongest in recent history), which should result in resilient market share and improved pricing power.

NTPC

Target Price: Rs 200 Upside: 22 percentReasons: The company is reducing its costs and gaining market share in a weak market and is better prepared when the market picks up.

With Coal India – the agreement to supply higher domestic coal, eliminate costlier imports and improved coal quality is a positive – leading to a cut in fuel cost over the last year, despite price rise.

Shree Cement

Target Price: Rs 18450 Upside:29 percentReasons: It remains the cost leader in the Indian cement industry by a large margin (15 percent lower than the nearest competitor).

The valuation on current production does not appear to build in any upside from the company's strong operating leverage (given capacity utilization of around 62 percent in FY18) or any major upside from an upcycle.

State Bank of India

Target Price: Rs 315 Upside: 28 percentReasons: SBI is likely to be key beneficiary of demonetisation. It is a leader in credit cards, debit cards, digital products and has a disproportionate share in rural lending and government business.

Worst of NPL recognition and credit costs are behind – slippages were at 3.4 percent and credit costs at 2.1 percent in 2QFY17, and should gradually decline

Tata Motors

Target Price: Rs 575Upside: 15 percentReasons: Global luxury volumes are expected to improve over the next three to six months, driven by new launches in the SUV portfolio.

Expect the GBP depreciation to start positively affecting margins from Q4FY17 onwards. A 10 percent depreciation in the GBP/USD leads to a 15-20 percent increase in TAMO’s EPS after a lag of three to four quarters.

TCS Target Price: Rs 2900Upside: 27 percentReasons: Rupee depreciation should further air revenue growth and margins

TCS may deliver sector-leading USD revenue CAGR of 12.6 percent in FY17-19.

Tech Mahindra

Target Price: Rs 680 Upside: 45 percentReasons: Backed by improvement in deal wins – particularly in the hitherto underperforming telecom vertical, the company is poised to deliver a strong performance in 2HFY17.

Vedanta

Target Price: Rs 277Upside: 20 percentReasons: Improving visibility on the Cairn-Vedanta merger, which should help resolve the long-pending cash fungibility issues for Vedanta Ltd, support deleveraging and also simplify the corporate structure.

Merger with Cairn India should help improve capital allocation efficiency across the various group entities, with better alignment of the promoter interest with that of the minorities.

YES Bank

Target: Rs 1450

Upside: 16 percent

Reasons: It is the biggest beneficiary of an easy liquidity environment; we expect Yes to be amongst the very few banks wherein NIMs would improve.

Loan growth at 38 percent remains much higher than the industry average. This will moderate but will still remain strong at 25 percent",659,0.8261418420335521

But it is not easy to identify and buy such stocks at right time and exit at right time. Timing is most crucial element in investing or trading. This timing can be known through Financial Astrology. Astrology is only science which can predict future correctly & guide us about sectors which have to outperform.

Every year with commencement of new Samvat (Hindu New Year), astrologically, based on planetary position, certain new sectors start getting strong astrological support & start outperforming, while some others sectors which were performing earlier start underperforming. Some sectors/stocks remains laggards. Based on our experience of over 16 years as Financial Astrologer, stocks of astrological supported sectors outperform resulting in exorbitant gains irrespective of market behavior, either bull market or bear market.

During last Samavat 2072 among other sectors – SUGAR & PAPER sectors were predicted by us, received strong astrological support & out performed. Many stocks from Sugar sector appreciated by 600-900 percent. It should be recalled that sugar sector, despite strong remained laggard for many years and started performing only after astrological support came.

Sectors which get very strong astrologicalsupport are not normally affected by downfall in the market.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/astrologers on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Sebi has settled a case involving a former Tech Mahindra official L Murali Madhvan, who allegedly violated insider trading norms with respect to sale of the company's shares, after he agreed to pay Rs 4.23 lakh as settlement fee.

It was alleged that Madhvan violated Sebi's (Prohibition of Insider Trading) norms by making delayed disclosure regarding change in shareholding in IT firm Tech Mahindra.

After finding that Madhvan violated norms by making delayed disclosure regarding change in his shareholding at the company, Sebi had initiated adjudication proceedings in February this year.

While further proceedings were underway, Madhvan proposed to settle the proceedings through the settlement mechanism upon payment of Rs 4,23,750 as settlement fee.

Thereafter, Sebi's High Powered Advisory Committee (HPAC) recommended that the matter may be settled on the payment of the amount offered. This was also approved by the panel of whole-time members of Sebi, following which Madhvan remitted the amount in October.

In a settlement order passed today, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) decided to dispose of the adjudication proceedings initiated against the him.

Sebi said that enforcement actions, including commencing or reopening of the proceedings, could be initiated if any representation made by Madhvan is found to be untrue.

Through a separate order, the watchdog settled a case with Primera Partners Pte Ltd in a matter related to alleged violation of Sebi (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) norms and insider trading regulations.

The case was settled upon payment of Rs 5,78,348 by Primera Partners Pte towards settlement charges.

Under the settlement mechanism, entities can seek to settle cases with the regulator after payment of certain charges and other expenses.",286,-0.7622654438018799

Paytm today said it has received final approval of the Reserve Bank to formally launch its payments bank and it expects to start operations next month.

Payments banks can accept deposits from individuals and small businesses up to Rs 1 lakh per account.

""Today, Reserve Bank of India gave permission to formally launch Paytm Payments Bank. We can't wait to bring it in front of you,"" Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of One97 Communications, said in a blogpost.

""No other role or responsibility means as much to me as the privilege of building Paytm Payments Bank, and I intend to take a full-time executive role in the Bank,"" Sharma said further.

He added that at Paytm Payments Bank, the aim is to build a new business model in banking industry, focussed on bringing financial services to hundreds of millions of unserved or underserved Indians.

When contacted, a Paytm spokesperson said the company hopes to launch operations in February with the first branch coming up in Noida, Uttar Pradesh.

Paytm was earlier slated to begin operations around Diwali last year. In 2015, RBI had awarded 'in-principle' approval to Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of One97 Communications, to set up a Payments Bank along with 10 others.

With the objective of deepening financial inclusion, RBI kicked off an era of differentiated banking by allowing SFBs (small finance banks) and PBs (payments banks) to start services. A total of 21 entities were given in-principle nod last year, including 11 for payments banks.

Later, three entities -- Tech Mahindra, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company and a consortium of Dilip Shanghvi, IDFC Bank and Telenor Financial Services -- backed out of the payments bank licensing.

Currently, Airtel is the only player that has commenced Payments Bank operations. Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank is expected to launch services in the first half of 2017.

Sharma will hold the majority share in Paytm Payments Bank, with the rest being held by One97 Communications.

Last month, One97 Communications had restructured its business ahead of the launch of the Payments Bank, merging the wallet business with payments bank operation.

Alibaba Group and its affiliate Ant Financial pumped in USD 680 million into Paytm's parent One97 Communications last year, taking its total shareholding to over 40 percent in the country's largest mobile wallet operator, Paytm.

However, the Chinese entity will not have a direct shareholding in the payments bank.",408,

Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol ResearchWith Nifty a whisker away from its lifetime high and valuation touching 21X FY17P and 18X FY18P earnings, the Street looks cautious. Is it time to take money off the table? Or, is it time to be ready with the shopping list and wait patiently for buying opportunities as markets gyrate amid headwinds of state election results and US Fed’s interest rate action? Our analysis suggests that while Nifty may be on cloud 9, some stocks haven’t yet exhibited similar exuberance. They still possess sound long-term potential.1) Although Larsen & Toubro had given a downward revision for growth (for revenue and order inflows), we do see a few tailwinds for the engineering major over the coming two-three years driven by government-driven expenditure in areas like port-connectivity, railways, smart cities, metros and downstream oil etc. Stability in oil prices should augur well for the international business and the defence opportunity could turn out to be an icing on the cake. With an expected earnings CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 29 percent, the valuation at 19X FY18P earnings for the company deserves a closer look.2) ITC hasn’t disappointed investors in the past one year. While government is unlikely to show any sympathy to cigarette manufacturers, implementation of GST will lead to some medium-term clarity on taxation. The company continues to build a high quality franchise in other businesses beyond cigarettes. We are comforted by the relative value that the stock offers - 27X FY18 P earnings, at 25 percent discount to the FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) universe.3) Dr Reddy has significantly under-performed the market in the past one year, courtesy the warning letter by US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) for three of its facilities. A successful resolution (inspection is due shortly) should pave the way for approvals and earnings growth. Dr Reddy, in our opinion, is well suited to adapt to the transition from low-risk pure generics to an innovation-led model and valuation at 23X FY18 earnings provides the requisite margin of safety.4) Over the past five years, Aurobindo Pharma has transformed from an API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) maker to a formulation company, but its valuation hasn’t caught up yet. The company has lined up a strong launch pipeline in the US, sufficient to offset competitive pressures on existing portfolio. The acquisition of Actavis’ EU business has provided the company with the scale in the EU business and its biosimilar acquisition should help close the gap with competition. Finally, the stock is still available at 14.3X FY18P earnings.5) Delay in resolution at its key facility in Halol by US FDA and heightened price erosion in Taro (Sun’s US subsidiary) have resulted in significant under performance of Sun Pharma. While the management doesn’t foresee immediate resolution of US FDA issues, stabilization of India (highly profitable) and emerging market business, material progress in its speciality strategy (using part of the Ranbaxy synergies in investment for Specialty build out) points to earnings growth post a successful resolution. The transition from pure generics to speciality should deserve attention and the undemanding valuation (22X FY18P earnings) and near-term weakness could provide an entry opportunity.6) ICICI Bank has lagged its private sector peers on account of asset quality woes. While there hasn’t been any remarkable changes in the picture, in the latest quarter, slippages were primarily from the ‘below investment grade’ book. A couple of quarters of pain notwithstanding, we expect slippages to peak out. The bank’s strong retail franchise, multi-channel distribution network, wide product range, strong brand and avenues to raise resources through dilution in established subsidiaries make us positive at the current valuation of 1.8x FY18P adjusted book.7) State Bank of India has one of the best provision covers amongst public sector banks. With a gradual incremental decline in slippage, we feel the worst is behind with respect to asset quality woes. Through SBI, investors get to participate in a well-capitalised banking leader, highly geared to economic upcycle with a strong retail franchise at an undemanding valuation of 1.3X FY18P adjusted book.8) Amid structural issues and external risks, we still pin hopes on a few information technology stocks like Tech Mahindra that is showing traction in its key vertical telecom, reporting deal wins in its enterprise segment and quotes at an attractive valuation of 13X FY18P earnings.9) Finally, Mahindra & Mahindra hasn’t quite found favour with the bourses in the past one year, thanks to the hyper competition from rivals and its late entry into the compact SUV (sport utility vehicle) space alongside regulatory concerns pertaining to diesel vehicles. However, the more profitable farm equipment (tractor) business (44 percent market share) is showing decent traction and should maintain momentum given the encouraging reports of crop sowing so far. Valuation at 14.6X FY18P core earnings lends comfort.",805,0.0

After Airtel, Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank is set to launch its services in the first half of 2017.

Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank is a 51:49 joint venture between Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd (ABNL) and telecom major Idea Cellular, respectively.

""The first half of 2017 will also see the launch of Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank,"" Idea Cellular Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Rajat Mukarji said.

In November, Airtel Payments Bank became the first payments bank to go live in the country with the rollout of its banking services in Rajasthan. Since then, it has expanded services to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as well.

Airtel had said the pilot rollout in Rajasthan saw over one lakh customers opening savings accounts in less than two weeks of commencement of services.

After Rajasthan, Airtel Payments Bank has now rolled out pilot services in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

""In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, Airtel Payments Bank is rolling out pilot services across 8,000 Airtel retail outlets in Andhra Pradesh and 7,000 outlets in Telangana, which also acts as banking points,"" it said in a statement.

This follows the pilot rollout in Rajasthan, where over 1 lakh customers opened savings accounts in less than two weeks of commencement of services, it added.

Airtel Payments Bank is the first payments bank in India to go live.

Customers opening a savings account with Airtel Payments Bank will get one minute of Airtel mobile talk time for every rupee deposited.

For example, if a customer opens an account with a deposit of Rs 500, then he/she will get 500 minutes of free talk time for calls to anywhere in India on his/her Airtel mobile number.

""We are pleased to rollout our pilot services in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and look forward to serving customers and contributing the financial inclusion vision of the two states,"" Airtel Payments Bank MD and CEO Shashi Arora said.

Airtel Payments Bank plans to develop a nationwide merchant ecosystem of over three million partners that will include small kirana stores, small shops and restaurants.

These merchant partners will accept digital payments for goods and services from Airtel Payments Bank customers over mobile phones.

Airtel Payments Bank said it will not charge any processing fee from merchants and this facility would be free for customers as well as merchants.

Beaten down technology stocks, which were reeling under Brexit woes and Donald Trump win in the US, saw a new lease of life this week as rupee plunged to a new low on November 24. BSE IT index climbed around 7 percent in the week starting November 18 while both the benchmark indices were marginally up 0.6 percent. Demonetisation leading to shortarge of cash in the country is slowing down business and trade volume on Dalal Street is also severely affected.Meanwhile, rupee fell to a record low of 68.85 per dollar as foreign institutional investors withdrew from emerging markets. And that's what brought much needed relief to the technology companies as depreciating rupee drives more revenue for export oriented firms. Gaining momentum from rupee's weakness, Infosys, TCS and Wipro rose 6.2 percent, 8.4 percent and 6.4 percent respectively in the week. These companies, however, have been dealing with a lot of trouble and cut guidance for FY17 on growth slowdown especially due to softness in Banking, Financial services and Insurance (BFSI) sector. After Q2 results, Infosys reduced FY17 revenue guidance for the second consecutive quarter and had already warned of risks to guidance from RBS contract cancelation and tepid business in banking, manufacturing & retail segments. The country's second largest IT company slashed its revenue guidance for FY17 to 8-9 percent from 10.5-12 percent earlier in constant currency terms after considering performance of H2FY17 and near-term uncertain business outlook.That had lead to a lot of selling in IT stocks this year. In November itself, BSE IT index is down 6 percent while Sensex and Nifty lost around 7 percent in this period. In year-to-date, both BSE IT index and Nifty IT fell 15 percent whereas Sensex was down 1 percent and Nifty was up 0.2 percent. Though analysts are cautious about the sector but feel that valuations are rather tempting after price corrections. Credit Suisse says that larger IT firms' price to earnings (PE) have contracted by 10-30 percent in the last one year due to concerns on structural factors and cyclical reasons and stocks are also trading well below their 3-year average PE and close to their 3-year lows. It says that Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric and recent comments could pose uncertainty and worst-case outcome could create 200 basis points margin pressure. ""We have cut target multiples for our universe, which reduces target prices by 4-10 percent. We believe that HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra are better positioned with low downside risk— business momentum is good, valuations attractive and any immigration impact would be relatively low. And they will benefit from any pick-up in discretionary spending as well,"" the brokerage firm says in a note. Also, the sector is at a risk of further pressure post Q3 results as generally this quarter is weak due to less number of working days due to US holidays.(Infograph by Ritiesh Presswala)Follow @NasrinzStory",489,0.0

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra’s (TECHM’s) Q2FY17 revenues and margins were ahead of estimates. Revenues grew 5% QoQ in CC terms and organic growth was 2.5%. Revenue growth was aided by recovery in Telecom vertical which grew 2.4%QoQ after a weak performance in the past few quarters. EBIT margins were largely inline with estimates. Company took a one‐time, restructuring charge of US$13m in the quarter which impacted margins by 120bps.

Management has indicated improved outlook in Telecom business and Enterprise business remains steady. TECHM signed three large deals in the quarter. We expect gradual recovery in the business, going forward. Stock is inexpensive at 11.5x FY18 EPS and improvement in performance should drive stock returns. Retain “BUY” with a TP of Rs525.

Dolat Capital's research report on Tech Mahindra

TechM reported a healthy Q2FY17 with USD revenue growth of 4% QoQ (5% CC terms) led by better performance of telecom (+2.3% QoQ USD terms). EBIT margin dipped 50bps QoQ to 11.5% due to one time impact of non-recurring cost and adverse currency impact. We expect EBIT margin to remain in a narrow band of 12.5-13%. We believe a consistent outperformance on growth in telecom vertical will drive upgrades for the stock. We pare our earnings estimate by 6%/5.2% for FY18/FY19 on back of lower revenue/treasury income. We maintain Buy and rollover to Sep’17 target price of Rs 525 (Rs 590 earlier) based on 13x one-yr. fwd. PER.

Telecom vertical has reported a positive surprise (+3.4% QoQ CC) and we believe a seasonally strong H2 will support growth rates. Despite this beat Tech M will lag peers as we estimate a 5% YoY CC organic growth in FY17 which is lower than peers (7%-9% YoY). TechM is trading at inexpensive valuations of 10.8x/9.8x based on FY18/FY19. We pare our FY18/FY19 earnings estimates by 6%/5.2% factoring tad lower revenue/treasury income; Maintain BUY with a Sep’17 TP of Rs 525 based on 13x one yr. fwd. PER.

Abhay Laijawala of Deutsche Bank says he has been cautious on the market since late June fearing global macro uncertainties. Some of these partially materialised in October 2016 as sovereign bond yields in the developed market hardened significantly.

In addition, the global political calendar is filled with risk events over the next year and this he believes will continue to be an overhang for financial markets.

He continues to suggest a cautious stance. He raises IT services to neutral, lower healthcare to underweight, raise overweight on energy further.

Reliance Industries, Maruti, Tech Mahindra, Shree Cement and HDFC are now top picks, Laijawala says. (Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com)

Meanwhile, Mahesh Nandurkar of CLSA says with another important step taken on November 3, India moves a step closer to GST implementation.

The GST council has agreed on a five-slab structure. This is a huge simplification from the nearly 100+ tax rates that exist today, he feels.

He says the council has moved product categories to the nearest tax slabs and hence the positive and negative impact will likely be limited to 3-4 percent.

According to him, GST implementation by April-July 2017 appears more certain now.

Nandurkar says on the basis of limited information released by the Government, preliminary analysis suggests that consumer staples such as HUL and Colgate, consumer durables like Havells and Crompton and multiplex players should benefit. Services like airlines, telecom, insurance; textiles and Titan should be negatively impacted. ITC could see a relief rally.",260,-0.9997409731149673

Yes Securities's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech Mahindra (TECHM) has reported a growth of 4% QoQ (+6.1% YoY) in US dollar denominated revenues. On a constant currency basis, growth came in at 5% QoQ. The growth was supported by acquisitions. On an organic basis, growth was 2.5% QoQ. Although decision cycles continue to remain elongated, the management is optimistic of a recovery in the communications vertical based on its deal pipeline and discussions with the clients. In addition to this, it also expects the enterprise segment to grow at a steady pace. While the opportunity in communications still continues to be huge; however elongated decision cycles in lieu of ongoing M&A in the sector for the communications business has been an overhang on the stock. Recovery in the communications segment, continued growth on the enterprise side as well as margin expansion on the back of multiple levers including favorable employee pyramid, increasing utilization, etc. make the long term story for TECHM attractive. Post the recent correction, the valuations too are attractive. We revise our view to ACCUMULATE with a TP of 520.

TechM has been able to retain its leadership in telecom which will help drive traction in communications business. In addition to this, it has made significant investments on the digital side should start yielding results in the form of a healthy traction for its enterprise vertical. Improvement in margins and improvement in performance of acquisitions will drive earnings growth in the long term. Delay in decision making on account of M&A in the communication sector had led to a subdued performance by the company for the past few quarters. However recovery in the same would help drive growth going forward. We revise our view to ACCUMULATE on the stock with a TP of INR 520.

Centrum's research report on Tech Mahindra

Tech M’s results were a mixed bag, with revenue beat negated by EBIDTA margins. Higher depreciation and tax rate weighed on PAT which was 13% below our estimates. We note that management has already guided that 2QFY17 margins were impacted by one-off restructuring costs. We expect Tech M to deliver 7.2% USD revenue growth for FY17E .Our USD revenue growth assumption implies organic growth of 4% and rest owing to full impact of acquisitions (Pininfarina, Target and Bio-agency). We have already trimmed our EBIDTA margin assumptions post 2QFY17E preview communication. Post the results, we now marginally reset margins to 15.3%/16.2% for FY17/18 (vs 15.4%/16.1% modelled earlier). We cut our EPS estimates by 5%/2% for FY17/18E. Valuations remain attractive (10.7x FY18E EPS) and risk return remains favourable. Our TP is trimmed by 4% to Rs 530/sh (13.5x FY18E EPS). Maintain BUY.

We model USD revenue growth of 7.2%/10.2% for FY17/18E. We note that Tech M’s organic growth would be 4% for FY17E which is in the midrange of peers. Organic USD revenue growth of peers TCS/Infosys/Wipro/HCL Tech would be 7.1/8.4/1.5/8.8% for FY17E. We believe valuations at 10.7 x FY18E remain favourable. Scope for higher margin improvement in FY18 led by completion of restructuring in LCC could be an additional catalyst. Retain BUY.

Moneycontrol Bureau The new year Samvat 2073 is likely to see good growth as analysts are bullish on the market. Motilal Oswal says strong pick-up in earnings and return to double digit growth in revenue is crucial for the market to move up on a sustainable basis. The brokerage firm is betting on Indian market and expects Sensex earnings per share (EPS) to grow at 17 percent CAGR over FY16-18 as compared to 6 percent CAGR witnessed during FY08-16.

ICICI Direct sees Sensex EPS to grow 16.4 percent YoY to Rs 1600 in FY17 and then witness growth of 17.5 percent YoY in FY18 to Rs 1880. It has set a one year forward target of 31000 for the Sensex and 9400 for the Nifty.

Reliance Securities believes that large caps will outperform from current levels because the valuation gap between Nifty and Small Cap Indices are at all time high.

So, as Diwali glitters shine on Dalal Street here are stocks that you can bet on

HDFC Bank

Motilal Oswal has set a target of Rs 1500 per share, indicating 18 percent upside. It says strong fundamentals and near-nil stressloans would enable the bank to gain market share. Further, continued strong investment in people and branches indicating management positiveoutlook on business. Return on equity (RoEs) are expected to be the best amongst private banks at 20 percent.

LIC Housing Finance

Motilal Oswal thinks the stock can give 24 percent upside at Rs 600 per share. It feels the NBCC company will be the biggest beneficiary of falling GSec yields as more than 80 percent of borrowings come from capital markets. Since the RBI started open market operations 10 months back, GSec yields have declined more than 100 basis points from 7.8 percent to 6.7 percent.

Tech Mahindra

ICICIDirect.com prefers Tech Mahindra due to its lesser exposure in Banking, Financial services and Insurance (BFSI) which is currently facing macro headwinds. Currently BFSI vertical contributes only 11 percent to revenue versus 35-40 percent among other IT peers.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

HDFC Securities is betting on it with target at Rs 854 per share. It says with the e-VYSB integration nearing completion (costs and management bandwidth), and a gradual uptick in macros, it foresees core improvement led by loan growth, improving operating leverage and LLP reverting to normalised levels.

Ashok Leyland

Geojit BNP Paribas sees 32 percent upside in the stock. It expects valuation to improve ahead due to better earnings outlook in the second half of FY17. It has set a target price of Rs 116 per share.

Hero MotoCorp

Geojit BNP Paribas expects the stock to maintain leadership position with a domestic market share of 40 percent in FY18 on capacity expansion and new launches.

It forecasts return on equity (RoE) and RoCE at 24 percent and 26 percent respectively by FY18. It has a target price of Rs 981.

L&T

Centrum Wealth believes L&T is one of the best positioned companies to capitalise on investments and reforms in the infrastructure sector. The company aims to achieve revenue of Rs 2 lakh crore and order inflow in excess of Rs 2.5 lakh crore per annum by 2021, without compromising on margins.

Sun Pharma

Centrum is betting on Sun Pharma as it finds the company to be best placed to navigate the slowdown in the US generic business. However, it says key risks are lower revenues from US Markets, delay in resolution of USFDA warning letter for Halol plant and regulatory risk for its manufacturing facilities catering to global market.

M&M

Kotak Securities sees 16.1 percent upside in the stock. It says profit margin for M&M's auto segment is likely to stay subdued. However, tractor business is expected to witness strong margins due tohealthy demand recovery. Overall, increased share of tractor revenues will be positive for overall EBITDA margins.",680,0.6944812994736892

Kotak Securities has come out with its second quarter (July-September) earnings estimates for the Technology sector. The brokerage house expects has come out with its second quarter (July-September) earnings estimates for the Technology sector. The brokerage house expects Tech Mahindra to report net profit at Rs 679.9 crore, down 9.3 percent quarter-on-quarter.

Net Sales are expected to increase by 2 percent Q-o-Q (up 6.7 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 7060.7 crore, according to Kotak Securities.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are likely to rise by 1.8 percent Q-o-Q (down 4.9 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 1047.5 crore.

We expect c/c revenue growth of 3.2% and cross-currency headwind of 90 bps. Growth will be aided by acquisitions (incremental US$10 mn from full quarter consolidation of Pininfarina acquisition + US$4 mn from The BIO agency acquisition for the entire quarter + US$7 mn for one month of Target). Organic growth will be 0.3% qoq in US$ terms and about 1.2% in c/c terms.

We expect EBIT margin to decline 60 bps qoq due to (1) cross-currency headwind, (2) full quarter impact of Pininfarina acquisition, and (3) one-time restructuring costs. These headwinds will be partly offset by operational efficiencies and lower visa costs.

Domestic IT sector is likely to see its weakest September quarter in the past 8 years due to broad based slowdown in BFSI and healthcare as well as delays in projects across many clients, says a report.

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, the largest IT players are expected to see revenue growth rate at 0.5-3 percent during July-September quarter of 2016-17 compared to preceding quarter.

""Second quarter for the current fiscal will be the weakest September quarter for Indian IT in the past 8 years,"" the report said.

""Growth will be impacted by broad based weakness in BFSI (Banking, Financial services and Insurance), weak healthcare and delays in projects across many clients,"" it added.

As per the report estimates, Infosys is expected to see the most revenue growth at 3 percent followed by HCLT (2.6 percent) TCS (2.4 percent) and Wipro (0.5 percent).

""Infosys is our top pick in the sector while we like Tech Mahindra for inexpensive valuations. We are cautious on other names,"" it said.

Further, Kotak has estimated cross currency headwind of 50-100 basis points for Indian IT corporates due to depreciation of British pounds partly offset by appreciation of JPY (Japanese yen), AUD (Australian dollar) and EUR (Euro) against USD (US Dollar).

""Growth verticals will vary across players and will largely be an imprint of recent deals wins/wallet share gain,"" the report said.

The report said Infosys will lead the pack given it is gaining share in large deals and wallets of large clients, and is well positioned to capture discretionary spends.",266,-0.42909214326313566

Technology stocks are returning to buyers' radar after bout of panic selling post few company's earnings red alert. The IT index which lost over 2 percent on Thursday is seeing buying today with the index in green on a day when the benchmark indices are down almost 1 percent intraday. TCS which lost 5 percent yesterday, climbed 1 percent intraday on Friday.

However, things are not rosy for the IT sector and analysts warn that pain is going to linger. Stating that 9 of 11 companies have moderated growth outlook, Nomura says demand slowdown is broad-based and distributed across verticals, with concerns related to macro, uncertainty due to Brexit and discretionary pullbacks being commonly cited.

Sample this, BSE IT index lost 8 percent in year-to-date when the Sensex and Nifty gained 11-12 percent. In a month period, BSE IT was down 7.5 percent when both the benchmark indices gained 3 percent each. Bruise on the IT stocks intensified after Britain voted to exit European Union on June 23. From June 23, IT index fell 12 percent while both Sensex and Nifty were up around 8 percent.

After TCS indicated caution about its Q2, top three IT companies lost around Rs 30804 crore market cap. Out of the total, around Rs 24797.8 crore was knocked in a day’s trade on Thursday.

Nomura says that Banking and Financial Services Solution (BFSI) in particular has issues with pricing pressure, delays in decision making and discretionary pullbacks while healthcare demand is impacted due to ongoing large payer M&A and election-related uncertainty. It warns that large clients common to tier 1 IT companies are seeing growth issues.

Last week, Mindtree issued Q2 guidance warning stating that revenue decline is expected due to cross-currency movements, project cancellations and slower ramp-ups in a few large clients across different verticals and continued weakness in its UK-based subsidiary Bluefin. Mindtree is also cautious that its Q2 margins are going to be lower than planned with a decline in EBITDA margins in Q2 FY17 compared to Q1 FY17. Cognizant, too, slashed its full-year revenue forecast for the second consecutive quarter.

Historically, Q2 is a seasonally strong quarter for industry but with caution in spending, revenue growth would decelerate in constant currency terms.

Stock picking

Nomura has a buy rating on HCL Technologies and neutral on Infosys, Tech Mahindra, TCS and Wipro.

CLSA expects near-term softness to impact most firms and shave USD revenue growth by 1-2 percent and earnings by 2-7 percent for FY17-19. It has buy rating on HCL Technologies and TCS, outperform on Wipro and Infosys but downgraded Tech Mahindra to sell. “Indian IT firms now trade at 2SD below their three-year average, more than adequately pricing in the near-term softness and suggesting they have bottomed out in an otherwise rising market,” it says in a note.

Morgan Stanley thinks TCS to be an expensive stock even after retracing 16 percent since its peak in last three months. It expects USD revenue growth of 1.8 percent quarter-on-quarter for TCS in Q2 andmargins to show a 20 basis points (bps) uptick.

Morgan Stanley has lowered USD revenue by 2–4 percent, EBIT margins by 30-40 bps, and earnings by 3–5 percent.

With a slowing growth trajectory, it adds that it would be difficult for the company's margins to recover to over 26 percent levels over the coming quarters. ICICI Securities has a add rating with a revised target price of Rs 2516 per share.

Bright spots

CLSA expects demand to recover in early FY18, washing out FY17 growth rates. It adds that pace of the spending pullback has surprised several firms with customer caution before the US elections and a lower interest rate environment as the commonly cited reasons.

Betting on the brighter side, the brokerage firm thinks that an increase in interest rates or a more hawkish environment triggered by the US Fed could drive a recovery in spending by US banks. Also it states that a Democratic victory in the US presidential elections (on 8 November) should see a quicker end to US elections-led caution than a Republican victory. ""Either event could drive pent-up spending from deferred projects,"" it says in a note.Follow @NasrinzStory",706,-0.18434417645136517

However, it could face resistance around the 8750 mark and trade in a range of 8300-8750 in the short-term.The house is long emerging market equities as against developed markets, said Balanco.

The portfolio will be transferred to Lupin on December 31, subject to regulatory approvals and certain closing conditions, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.

The acquisition, which will be done by Lupin's Japanese generic drug unit Kyowa Pharmaceutical Industry Co Ltd, will give Lupin access to Japanese branded pharmaceutical market and strengthen its speciality business portfolio, they said.

Even the August in terms of foreign money inflow started on a positive note as they bought more than Rs 700 crore worth of shares (as per provisional data available on the exchange).

Ajay Kapur of Bank of America Merrill Lynch said fundamental work re-affirms bullish view on Asia.

While explaining about his bullish stance, he said while Asia ex-Japan is up 21 percent from January's lows, emerging markets (EMs) are up 27 percent. This compares with 17 percent for the developed markets from their 2016 lows.

He thinks investors (currently underweight) should be double weighted in Asia ex-Japan/EMs in their benchmarks.

Markets regulator Sebi has initiated the first phase of its new enterprise portal to facilitate accurate and timely dissemination of information to the watchdog's internal and external stakeholders.

The new portal, which would replace the regulator's existing portal in a phased manner, went live on July 29 and is being developed by IT major Tech Mahindra.

The first phase of the project provides the employees of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and some of its market intermediaries with an interactive portal.

""Sebi started with development of its portal solution as a digital transformation program to exploit the potential of automation, rationalise its application landscape and simplify its technology infrastructure,"" Tech Mahindra said in a statement.

The portal provides an e-Platform to registered and prospective intermediaries to communicate in secure, simplified, transparent and paperless way with Sebi.

""The portal also provides refreshing UI (user interface) experience and a secure role based access and navigation to its Sebi staff across various departments,"" Tech Mahindra said.

""Thus it will enable significant collaborative and efficient communications between Sebi's internal and external stakeholders alike,"" it added.

The new portal would help create positive consumer experience as it aligns itself with emerging digital trends, Tech Mahindra, which had begun implementation of the project in December 2014, noted.

Sebi in early 2014 had invited proposal for supply, installation, design, development and implementation of Enterprise Portal Solution which included business Process Management (BPM), custom applications development, enterprise search engine, business intelligence and analytics, among other necessary IT infrastructure.

IT industry body Nasscom today chose to downplay the need for companies seeking SEZ status to start operations in the country.

""Two years ago, it was very very important. But things have changed now. The more important things are like clearing hurdles and creating centres of excellence,"" Nasscom chairman C P Gurnani told reporters on the sidelines of 'Nasscom Product Conclave' here today.

It may be noted that Infosys has been holding back its first development centre at Rajarhat as the West Bengal government, under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, is politically opposed to grant Special Economic Zone (SEZ) status. Wipro too is on the same page with its second campus, also in Rajarhat.

Gurnani, CEO and MD of Tech Mahindra, said that people are talking of automation now. ""Export benefits and STPI benefits are clearly important,"" Gurnani said.",151,0.6641950011253357

Motilal Oswal has come out with its first quarter (April-June) earnings estimates for the technology sector. The brokerage house expects Tech Mahindra to report a 22.8 percent degrowth quarter-on-quarter (growth of 2.4 percent year-on-year) in net profit at Rs 692.5 crore

Sales are expected to increase by 1.2 percent Q-o-Q (up 10.7 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 6964.6 crore, according to Motilal Oswal

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are likely to fall by 4.5 percent Q-o-Q (up 17.4 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 1108.8 crore.

Motilal Oswal's report on Tech Mahindra

We expect 1.2 percent Q-o-Q CC growth in TECHM’s revenue. In USD terms, we expect TECHM’s revenue to grow by 1.8 percent Q-o-Q – 60bp positive impact of cross-currency movement. In Telecom, 1Q is expected to be under pressure because of the absence of seasonal strength in Comviva and consolidation of revenue in LCC.

Related stories

In Enterprise, growth is expected to continue showing strong momentum. Revenue will also is also likely to include one-month integration of Pininfarina (USD5-6m). We expect EBITDA margin to decline by 100bp to 15.9 percent. Margins are expected to be weighed upon by seasonal weakness in Comviva, visa expenses and the integration of low-margin Pininfarina. Consequently, we expect PAT to decline 22.8 percent Q-o-Q, to Rs 6.9b in 1QFY17.

Though Communication revenues are getting impacted by weak Comviva seasonality and probable modest degrowth in LCC revenues, we would expect the core-Communication revenues (ex Comviva and LCC) to grow by nearly 2 percent Q-o-Q as they had in Q4FY16. One-month integration of Pininfarina should add nearly 0.5 percent to growth with cross currency likely to be a benefit of 30bps.We expect overall revenues to grow by 0.2 percent Q-o-Q to USD 1,025 million.Weak Comviva seasonality (margin drag of 150bps), visa costs (drag of 100bps), ESOP expensing (drag of 20bps) and Pininfarina integration (drag of 7bps) are the key headwinds for Tech Mahindra in Q1FY17. However, operational efficiencies should be a partial offset and we are modeling a margin decline of160bps Q-o-Q for the quarter.We expect overall new-deal intake to remain healthy in the USD 250million-300million range with the intake equally dispersed across Enterprise and Communication segments.We are projecting an EPS of Rs8.4 for Q1FY17 – a Q-o-Q decline of 17 percent.Revenue growth at the top-5 clients, deal intake, commentary on core communication revenues and margin expansion will be closely watched for Tech Mahindra.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Surendra Goyal of Citi says he expects some surprises in earnings as companies started reporting Q1FY17, based on Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), although it is too early to figure out the quantum.He feels some companies that may see negative Q1FY17 earnings are Zee Entertainment due to interest on redeemable preference shares, and Tech Mahindra, Eicher Motors & Info Edge due to ESOP (employee stock option) cost.

According to him, PSU earnings may benefit on reported employee costs & some corporates like Maruti Suzuki & Hero MotoCorp may gain due to higher interest income.

He remains constructive as better-than-expected Q4FY16 earnings (ex-financials) raises confidence in bottom-up forecast of 14 percent earnings growth in FY17.

As Britain has decided to break the European Union further de-valuing pound analysts are concerned that Indian technology companies will feel the heat. Few analysts are even warning of a recession in the European region. The UK accounts for 9-15 percent of revenues for Indian IT firms, with the highest exposure at TCS and the lowest at Infosys. IT stocks are reeling under pressure on Monday with TCS, Infosys, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra losing around 1 percent each.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch feels that Indian IT companies' earnings may be hurt due to weakening of GBP and euro versus Indian rupee, partially offset by stronger USD and growth slowdown in UK. It says that IT companies with financial services vertical are more likely at risk. According to the brokerage firm, Infosys will fare better than TCS stating that besides 14 percent revenue exposure to UK, TCS also has highest exposure to financial services. Though it believes that TCS remains the best-in-class IT asset on delivery, leadership, breadthof offerings and that the multiple cut is purely driven by increased macro-led uncertainty, BoAML feels TCS could see sharper near-term erosion in price to equity multiple. It has lowered target price on TCS to Rs 2450, cutting FY16-18 earnings per share (EPS) by 3-4 percent.The brokerage has cut target of Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro and Tech Mahindra. Despite the uncertainity, BoAML sees upside potential in Infosys given its low direct exposure to the UK and better near-term visibility from uptick in deal wins. It is also positive on HCL Tech given its benign valuation relative to peers and company’s higher exposure to annuity IT spends (infrastructure services, engineering services).

Despite the uncertainty, BoAML sees upside potential in Infosys given its low direct exposure to the UK and better near-term visibility from uptick in deal wins. It is also positive on HCL Tech given its benign valuation relative to peers and company’s higher exposure to annuity IT spends (infrastructure services, engineering services).

CLSA also agrees that with 7-13 percent of their revenues GBP denominated, a 10 percent decline in GBP/USD can push back USD-revenue growth by 60-130 basis points (bps) and earnings by 1-2 percent. ""A softer INR could limit the earnings impact in FY17 based on current FX levels. However, in the midterm, UK-based customers potentially slowing down spending to assess changes could impact 9-15 percent of the business. A slowdown in spending spreading to the rest of Europe remains a risk,"" CLSA says in a report. However, on a positive note it feels that volatility may create buying opportunities in TCS, HCL Tech and Infosys.

Citi thinks that prolonged period of uncertainty could impact decision making and demand for IT services in the UK (estimate 10-15 percent hit). It adds that sharp moves may result in profitability challenges in certain contracts unless they are renegotiated – could be margin headwinds.

However, Deutsche Bank thinks a ‘leave’ vote will be a long-term positive, in the nearer term it expects Brexit to moderate IT spending in Europe and adverse cross currency movements to pressure earnings.

""Most top-tier Indian IT service companies derive 23-29 percent of revenue from Europe. Tech Mahindra (Europe makes 29 percent of revenue) HCL Tech (28 percent) and TCS (27 percent) will be the most affected with Infosys (23 percent) the most defensive,"" it says.

However, it feels that Brexit may affect Infosys FY17 guidance negatively and states that10 percent depreciation in the GBP and the EUR vs the USD could impact the FY17 earnings of top-tier Indian IT service companies by 2.7-3.7 percent, with TCS the most affected. The brokerage does not expect the appreciation of the INR to have a meaningful long-term impact on the competitiveness of the Indian IT service industry.Follow @NasrinzStory",636,9.32614008585612e-05

Indian technology stocks are knocked off on Dalal Street as Britain marches off the European Union. Most Indian IT companies have major business coming from the Europe especially UK. Europe is the second largest market for the Indian IT-BPM industry, constituting almost 30 percent of the industry’s export revenue of about USD 100 billion. As Britain has decided to leave the union, it may spell trouble for IT companies which have high exposure to EU. IT index is down around 3 percent with the benchmark indices losing over 3 percent in afternoon trade as British pound suffered biggest one-day loss today. The currency fell sharply by 10 percent. Shares of TCS lost 5 percent, Infosys fell 4 percent while Wipro were down 3 percent intraday, on Friday.

The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) termed the Brexit announcement as a phase of uncertainty in the near term but a mix of challenges and opportunities in the longer term.

According to Nasscom, decline British pound may render many existing contracts losing propositions unless they are renegotiated. ""The uncertainty surrounding protracted negotiations on the terms of exit and/or future engagement with EU could impact decision making for large projects. Indian IT companies may need to establish separate headquarters/ operations for EU, may lead to some disinvestment from UK. Skilled labour mobility across EU and UK could be impacted.Changes in the financial system, banks and impact on currency could ensue,"" it says in a statement.

In an earlier report, Bank of America Merrill Lynch had warned that Brexit may create recession risks that could hurt IT demand further hurting 10-14 percent revenue growth for the UK businesses of the Indian IT companies in FY17.

The brokerage firm had said there could be a 3-8 percent hit to FY17 earnings per share (EPS) estimates for five large Indian IT companies in the case of an ‘exit’ vote.

Movement in British currency, growth implications for their UK business and any spill-over implications to Europe and growth in the Euro zone are few factors that may impact Indian IT companies as a reaction to Brexit.

Moneycontrol Bureau If Britain decides to move out of the European Union, Indian technology companies are likely to be hurt with Tech Mahindra being most exposed while Infosys is the least exposed to the region. The Britons will vote to decide if the UK should leave or stay within the 28-member EU trade bloc on June 28.Bank of America Merrill Lynch feels that Brexit may create recession risks that could hurt IT demand further hurting 10-14 percent revenue growth for the UK businesses of the Indian IT companies in FY17. The brokerage firm says there could be a 3-8 percent hit to FY17 earnings per share (EPS) estimates for five large Indian IT companies in the case of an ‘exit’ vote. ""The benefit to FY17 EPS estimates is relatively lower (2-5 percent) in the case of a 'remain' vote,"" it says in a report. This looks likely as several weekend polls showed the 'remain' camp regained momentum ahead of a referendum vote to decide the UK's future within the European Union (EU). The brokerage firm adds that movement in British currency, growth implications for their UK business and any spill-over implications to Europe and growth in the Euro zone are few factors that may impact Indian IT companies as a reaction to Brexit. Five large Indian IT companies have a 6.6-14 percent revenue exposure to the GBP and bulk of this is unhedged. According to it, a 10 percent swing is likely to be seen on a Brexit decision implying a 1.7 percent (Infosys) and 5.1 percent (Tech Mahindra) earnings benefit/impact for FY17.As per BoAML, Infosys may be see a -3.1 percent, Wipro may see -5.5 percent and TCS may feel -5.7 percent total impact to respective FY17 EPS from an exit vote. An exit vote may errode -7.7 percent from Tech Mahindra's FY17 EPS. As the same time, if Britain decides to remain in the union Infosys will gain 1.7 percent, Wipro will see 3.6 percent benefit and TCS will see gain of 3.7 percent to potential FY17 EPS.

Days after it announced takeover of UK-based Target Group for 120 million pounds, the country's fifth biggest software exporter Tech Mahindra today said it will continue to scout for companies and listed out digital technologies as a key focus area.

""Mergers and acquisitions are a critical part of our strategy, and both our shareholders and directors have encouraged us to look at acquisitions, as long as it is a technology and market strategy fit and adds value to to our service offerings,"" Tech Mahindra's Managing Director and Chief Executive C P Gurnani told PTI on the sidelines of a conference here.

He added that digital technologies, platforms, product as a service, and software as a service will be the key focus areas, adding that the company wants to grow both organically and inorganically.

Tech Mahindra has been very busy on the M&A front. In the last few quarters, its performance was impacted because of acquired companies, but it has communicated optimism on turning things around and showed some positive signs in the March quarter numbers.

Gurnani said after the acquisition of Italian automotive and industrial design company Pininfarina last year in a Rs 370 crore deal, the company is seeing good business interest from the engineering practice.

""We are also seeing good business opportunities in the digital world, automation and virtual reality,"" he said.

Its last acquisition was Target Group, which is aimed at strengthening its capabilities of serving the banking, financial services and insurance segments.

Speaking about the company's collaborations with startups, Gurnani pointed out that it took the lead by investing in companies like Mobomoney, Comviva, Saral Rozgar, and Fixstream which is in the US.

""We are continuing to look at gamification, virtual reality integration, and Internet of Things,"" he added.

When asked whether Brexit will affect business for technology service providers, Gurnani, who is also the chairman for IT industry body Nasscom, said despite several geopolitical and economic challenges, it could be business as usual.

""We are a lag industry, in the sense that all decisions are discussed in the boardrooms after there is an immediate impact. I would like to believe it'll be business as usual,"" he said.

Tech Mahindra will continue to focus on the Americas, and Europe, he said. Presently, over 50 percent of its revenues come from the US, and around 25 percent each from Europe and rest of the world.

""I think we will continue with same geographic focus,"" he said.

Backing the firm's decision not to pursue its payment bank plans, he said while it is an excellent proposal from the RBI to bring more unbanked citizens into the system, for Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Finance it was purely a business decision because the funding requirement was for the next 5-6 years.

Three entities -- Tech Mahindra, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company and a consortium of Dilip Shanghvi, IDFC Bank and Telenor Financial Services -- have decided to back out of the Payments Bank licencing.

""We are not overly perturbed that some people decided after analysis that they would not go forward. In fact it suggests that licencing has been adequately liberal and that we have a variety of players coming in,"" he said at a press conference after announcing the second bi-monthly monetary policy for the current fiscal.

Last August, RBI gave in-principle approval to 11 applicants including Department of Posts, Aditya Birla Nuvo, Airtel M Commerce Services, Fino PayTech, National Securities Depository, Reliance Industries, Tech Mahindra and Vodafone m-pesa for setting up payments banks.

Rajan said: ""We gave out licences to anybody we thought have the appropriate qualifications to run a Payments Bank. We presume that they also analysed potential business prospects.

After doing further analysis and seeing the other players who are coming in, some of them decided to back off.

""My sense is that the Payment Bank works particularly well for those who have base of operations and many contact points and therefore can built upon that and the classic example is somebody affiliated with mobile company with many kiosk through which you can do cash in cash out."" He said however that there is a cost in scrutinising licence applications as lot of information is sought and various government agencies are involved.

""People will decide they will come in or not. People should also acknowledge the fact that it imposes some cost on assessors to go through the application. We ask a lot of information from various government agencies,"" he said.

So, going forward, ""we have to find some way that people devote adequate time to understanding whether in fact they should apply or not. The days where licences were rationed and therefore you had to get the licences otherwise you would not get down the line we hope is in the passe"", he added.

He cautioned that people should not go in for licences just because it is a valuable property but must have intention of doing the business.

""Don't just go in for licence because it's a valuable property to have but instead do the due diligence on your own.

And when you apply, it should be with the intent of fully carrying out...we not overly perturbed by some people decided to back out,"" he added.",457,

The acquisition was carried out through a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Last year the company had said that Tech Mahindra and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) will own 60 per cent and 40 per cent respectively in the automotive and industrial design firm.

""That the transaction has closed, the SPV has acquired 76.06 per cent stake in Pininfarina and as part of the overall transaction, the company has also entered into a brand license agreement with Pininfarina for use of trademarks owned by the Pininfarina group including licensing of brand Pininfarina for automotive products of the company,"" Mahindra & Mahindra said in a regulatory filing.

Moneycontrol Bureau Most analysts are upbeat on Tech Mahindra and believe worst is over for the IT company with telecom business stabilising soon. Its fourth quarter consolidated profit increased 18.2 percent sequentially to Rs 897 crore, driven by other income, forex gain and lower tax cost. Revenue rose 2.7 percent to Rs 6,883.7 crore and dollar revenue was up 0.75 percent at USD 1,022.6 million compared to preceding quarter. After hitting high of 14 percent, the stock ended with 10 percent gains on Wednesday. Credit Suisse maintains outperform rating as it is positive on cash flows (a problem area) which has shown good improvement in FY16. The management expects a flatter employee pyramid, automation and improvement in some low-margin businesses as drivers in the future.Deutsche Bank has a buy rating, anticipating a 50 percent upside post Q4 numbers. It expects Tech Mahindra to deliver 9 percent (YoY) USD revenue growth in FY17, with operating margin (EBIT) expanding 190 basis points (bps) and earnings growth of 25 percent. ""With growth back in place, the stock should steadily rebuild the valuation multiple that we believe its enhanced scale and breadth of operations deserve,"" it says in a report. Jefferies also has a buy rating with an increased target of Rs 580 per share. Morgan Stanley has upgraded the stock to equal weight from neutral. It has a target price of Rs 530 per share as outlook for telecom business is improving, and worst in earnings downgrade cycle appears to have passed. However, the brokerage has cut FY17-18 revenue and EBIT estimates by 1 percent on reduced estimates for LCC (a company acquired recently), but due to better other income and lower tax rate, it has increased earnings forecast by 3-4 percent. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a neutral rating stating that valuation is undemanding but lacks catalyst. It agrees that telecom vertical finally appears to be stabilising but uptick in spends is likely to be slow. It has lowered target price to Rs 515 per share. Telecom vertical benefitted from seasonal uptick in Comviva asset while pruning of lowend businesses in the LCC asset impacted negatively. It continues to expect a protracted margin recovery as improving offshore revenue mix, employee pyramid and payoff from automation efforts is likely to be gradual in a scenario of modest revenue growth.Macquarie has a neutral rating on the stock with a target of Rs 530 per share. According to it, Tech Mahindra has the right credentials to deliver growth, but believes management will need to get telecom growth and margins on track to fully regain investor confidence. ""Management sounded more optimistic about its telecom business going into FY17. As per Tech Mahindra, there are signs that stability is returning in its telecom business. While traditional telecom spends have been declining, new areas like digital enablement and enterprise are growing well within telecom,"" it says in a report. However, Citi suggests selling the stock as Tech Mahindra's organic revenue growth remains well below peers given the headwinds in its communications business and the headcount decline in this context does not inspire much confidence. ""Flattish gross margins despite 8 percent rupee depreciation and 6 percent improvement in utilisation highlights the challenges to profitable growth,"" it says in a report. At 16:00 hrs Tech Mahindra was quoting at Rs 528.55, up Rs 49.30, or 10.29 percent on the BSE.Follow @NasrinzStory",572,0.0

Shreya Sinhamoneycontrol.comBack in August 2015, when the Reserve Bank of India handed out payments bank licences to 11 candidates, little did it know that three will be pulling out within a year. Tech Mahindra is the latest entity to opt out of the race. Two months ago Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co backed out and only last week, a consortium of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries promoter Dilip Shanghvi, IDFC Bank and Telenor Financial Services, called it quits.

The payments bank model, which the RBI envisaged as a way to reach out to the unbanked, may be looking less profitable as a venture.

Can payments banks really be profitable?

The RBI made it clear that payments banks can't lend but can accept deposits up to Rs 1 lakh. They will have to invest 75 percent of their income in government securities. There is no cap on minimum balances in a payment, and no provision for fixed deposits.

Payments banks' deposit rates will have to be atleast 4 percent -- on a par with what a regular bank offers. Inorder to attract more customers, they will find themselves offering a higher deposit rate. Without income from loans, a higher deposit rate will most likely hurt them. The result: the banks will be operating on wafer-thin margins. To tide over, these payments banks will rely on remittances (people sending money home to their family in smaller towns) and cross-selling (banks can offer more than one product or service). Although a minimum balance is a good thing from a customer's point of view, the payments bank will always be scared of customers wiping out their savings in one go.A payments bank is meant to be a slimmed-down version of a regular bank, offering services on a digital platform -- through apps. But normal banks like SBI and a score of private sector banks are already doing it with their in-house apps.

Such competition would eat into the profits of payments banks. Tech Mahindra's MD and CEO CP Gurnani admitted as much: ""The company realised that intense competition would only erode already thin margins.""

When the concept of payment banks was proposed in 2014, many experts said that payments banks could be a major 'disruption' in the banking space. But with 3 entities pulling out, the euphoria is on the wane.

But, more importantly, is the stage cleared of competition. The remaining eight candiates need not be a crowd after all.",415,-0.5790145874023438

The London FTSE index opened up 0.8 percent, the German DAX up 0.8 percent and the French CAC up 0.6 percent.Asia markets traded higher, with several major indexes advancing more than 1 percent each, after encouraging reports on the U.S. housing market on Tuesday propelled gains in US stocks.12:20 pm CLSA on BoI: Brokerage house CLSA has reduced its price target for Bank of India (BoI) to Rs 65 from Rs 70 earlier and maintained its ‘sell' rating after the bank’s fourth quarter earnings.

Public sector lender Bank of India disappointed the Street on Tuesday by reporting a loss of Rs 3,587 crore in Q4 that widened significantly from a loss of Rs 56 crore in year-ago period. This was majorly led by provisions that shot up 52 percent quarter-on-quarter and 142.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 5,470 crore.

Bank’s gross non-performing loans (NPL) rose to 13 percent of loans in the quarter, pushing up credit costs, resulting in a loss of Rs 3,600 crore. The downgrades handed out by the RBI based on the asset quality review of the bank, together with the downturn in steel and infrastructure sectors led to a rise in the bank’s slippages, said the brokerage house.

Although the management aims to lower its gross NPL ratio in FY17 with lower slippages and higher recovery/upgrades, the broking house still remains cautious.Also read - Cipla slips 7% on Q4 shocker; analysts warn margins pressure may persist

IT firm Tech Mahindra on May 24 said it will not pursue its plans to set up payments bank operations in the country, becoming the third player to pull out from the race.

""With reference to the earlier communication dated August 20, 2015, about the in-principle approval granted by RBI for setting up a payments bank, Board of Directors of the company have decided that the company will not pursue this opportunity,"" it said in a filing to the BSE.

Sun Pharma founder Dilip Shanghvi who along with IDFC Bank and Telenor got in-principle approval from the Reserve Bank for payments bank, also pulled out of the race last week. A couple of months back, Cholamandalam group also dropped plans of setting up a payments bank.

""It was a conscious decision that we wanted to be in this business. We still strongly believe that it is a very large unserved market. Over a period of time, we realised amount of aggression that has come to the marketplace which only erodes the margin because it was anyway more about transactions and the volume of transactions with a razor thin margins,"" C P Gurnani, Managing Director and CEO of Tech Mahindra said when asked about the reason for backing out from the race.

""We realised that the business profitability will take a much longer period than what we were willing to invest into and that is the reason,"" he added.

Alibaba-backed Paytm, Reliance Industries and Airtel would have been Tech Mahindra's major competitors.

Last August, RBI gave in-principle approval to 11 applicants including Department of Posts, Aditya Birla Nuvo, Airtel M Commerce Services, Fino PayTech, National Securities Depository, Reliance Industries, Tech Mahindra and Vodafone m-pesa for setting up payments banks.

Gurnani further said both Tech Mahindra and its partner Mahindra Finance had come to the conclusion that ""the payback could be much longer"".

RBI deputy governor S S Mundra had expressed displeasure over in-principle licensees cancelling their plan to set up payments bank.

""We would certainly feel little aggrieved because lot of efforts from the part of RBI go in processing these applications,"" Mundra has said.

Earnings of blue-chips like SBI and Coal India and progress of monsoon will be among the key parameters influencing the stock market this week, which may hit pockets of volatility amid derivatives expiry, feel experts.

""Updates on monsoon progress, sentiment in global markets, macroeconomic data and the next batch of Q4 FY16 earnings will dictate sentiment in the stock market in the near term,"" said Vijay Singhania, founder Director, Trade Smart Online.

Choppiness in markets is expected to remain high as traders roll over positions in the derivative segment, he added. The May derivatives contracts expire on Thursday.

Key corporates, including BPCL, Tata Power, Cipla, Tech Mahindra, Bajaj Auto, GAIL, Tata Steel, Larsen & Toubro, Bharat Heavy Electricals, SBI and Coal India will come out with their March quarterly numbers this week.

""Fundamentally, the result season has been a mixed bag, with large PSU banks delivering a poor set of numbers due to asset quality concerns. SBI's results are yet to be announced and the market will be watching keenly the same,"" Reliance Securities said in a note.

Market analysts said that going forward, over the next few weeks, progress of monsoon will be a key determinant for the economy and the stock market.

""We believe that investors should increase allocations to equity keeping an eye on rains, which are the next big trigger,"" said Motilal Oswal, Chairman and MD, Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL).

Software exporter Tech Mahindra has created a supply chain management system which can reduce food losses and wastage by up to 20 percent.

""The initiative manages the food supply chain, which enables companies to transport farm grown produce and deliver it as fresh as if it were grown locally, and reduces losses and wastage by 15-20 percent,"" Tech Mahindra said in a statement here today.

Multiplicity of players, stringent regulatory compliance norms and lack of end-to-end visibility adds to the supply chain complexities, resulting in high wastage and loss of freshness by the time the produce reaches the consumers, it said.

""The solution, called Fresh Produce End-To-End Digital Supply Chain (FEEDS), has been built in the SAP Co-Innovation Lab,"" said Rudolf Held, Vice President and head of global SAP co-innovation lab network.

The announcement comes at a time when there are concerted efforts under way to improve the food storage and supply, which can ultimately help lower inflation.

Tech Mahindra said the solution is targeted at companies to transport the farm-grown produce.

""The lack of holistic visibility breeds inefficiencies in the complex modern-day food supply chain,"" Senior Vice President (global retail) Rohit Khanna said.",204,0.1986796498298645

Deutsche Bank is betting high on Tech Mahindra as it sees a 56 percent upside in the stock. The brokerage firm recommends buying the stock with a target price of Rs 725 per share, relying on revival in telecom revenue growth to support the company. This has got the stock excited, jumping 2 percent intraday on Thursday. However, trend in the stock performance is weak as Tech Mahindra lost 19.5 percent in 2015 and is down 10.7 percent year-to-date.

The broking firm expects Tech M's enterprise revenue to grow 14 percent (YoY) in FY17, supported by CY15 deal wins and strong business momentum in recent quarters. Overall it sees USD revenues to grow 10 percent (YoY) in FY17.

Deutsche Bank feels weak conditions for Tech Mahindra should reverse in the next six months as demand from telecom customers recovers once M&A is completed and the postponed services contracts are awarded. According to the firm, new order wins for the enterprise division will also feature early in FY17 and drive US dollar revenue growth of 10 percent. With margins expanding 170 basis points (bps), Deutsche Bank estimates earnings per share (EPS) to rise 26 percent.

""Tighter cost controls and better utilisation to drive margin upside driven by operational improvements implemented by management since September 2015. This, alongwith revenue growth revival in the telecom business will drive a 170 bps yoy EBIT margin expansion in FY17 to 15.5 percent,"" it says in a report.

The IT firm's December quarter consolidated profit fell 3.4 percent sequentially to Rs 759 crore, dented by lower other income and slow revenue growth. Revenue increased 1.3 percent to Rs 6,701 crore in quarter ended December 2015 compared to Rs 6,616 crore in preceding quarter. In same period, dollar revenue rose 0.4 percent to USD 1,015 million from USD 1,011 million and 1.2 percent in constant currency. Margin, in Q3, expanded by 71 basis points to 14.36 percent.

At 10:51 hrs Tech Mahindra was quoting at Rs 473.30, up Rs 7.40, or 1.59 percent on the BSE.

Tech Mahindra shares rose over a percent intraday Thursday. Kotak has reiterated its buy rating on the stock as it feels valuations are attractive.

The brokerage says the Mahindra Group company has a strong engineering and research & development (ERD) services practice with a portfolio aligned to growth areas, adding it is well-positioned to gain from potential inflection in ERD outsourcing.

Kotak expects its ERD practice to grow more than 15 percent over the next few years.

Tech Mahindra has signed a few large deals (Comverse) reflecting depth of capabilities. ""Its leadership in telecom, steady traction in enterprise segment and ongoing margin recovery underpin our positive stance,"" the brokerage says.

According to its note, however, delays in deal closures would work against the company in short term.

At 11:02 hours IST, the scrip of Tech Mahindra was quoting at Rs 459.20, up Rs 3.10, or 0.68 percent on the BSE.Posted by Sunil Shankar Matkar",166,0.6001219272613525

Experts expect the market to remain volatile ahead of expiry of February derivative contracts due on Thursday and Union Budget that is scheduled to be on February 29.

Investor concerns currently are veering toward the Budget as there are obvious worries with respect to rumours of the definition of long-term capital gains period being changed, says C Jayaram of Kotak Mahindra Bank.

However, consensus view is that the Budget will be largely positive as expectations are low. Jayaram says, post the Budget, there is a possibility that the market may form a firm bottom on the back of feel-good factor and then move ahead.

Homegrown diversified group Mahindra and its newly-acquired Italian design firm Pininfarina are pitching for six to eight projects globally across different industrial sectors to offer design and business solutions. After the acquisition of 76.06 percent stake in Pininfarina in December last year for nearly Rs 370 crore, Mahindra Group's IT arm Tech Mahindra and the Turin-based firm are now looking to leverage each other's strength to offer complete business solutions to potential clients. ""There are about 6-8 conversations that are at fairly significant discussions across the world that we are doing today jointly with Pininfarina,"" Tech Mahindra Chief Strategy and Marketing Officer Jagdish Mitra told PTI.

He said these discussions cut across transportation sector, including automobiles, and outside of it such as FMCG product companies. When asked about the size of the projects, Mitra said it is difficult to put a number to it as it would depend on what role the two firms play in the overall scheme of things of the potential clients. ""More than the number, it is important to see at what level we will play. Where does the customer put us in his category of vendors and partners, whether it is strategic, whether it is practical? Is it someone you use for volume or someone who use for cost? Where do we fit into the scheme?"" he said. Commenting on what Pininfarina brings on the table, company CEO Silvio Pietro Angori said: ""Yes, we are known for designing Ferraris and Maseratis but we don't just do that for a living. Otherwise we wouldn't be able to live because that's too small. We do much more than that."" He said the company has a strong presence in industrial products with over 400 unique items on its list. ""These days where there is a need for distinctiveness in the market, customers want product unique to their taste, we design unique products. This doesn't mean these are luxurious, but they are distinctive. This is where we offer our customers a customer experience...This is where we come into play of Tech Mahindra,"" Angori added. Elaborating on how acquisition of Pininfarina has changed the scope for Tech Mahindra, Mitra said: ""For us the opportunity is really about upping the game. From our side being an IT software solutions company, providing technology solutions, now we are talking about offering business solutions.

""What Pininfarina allows us to do is to start conversation at products level and in the conceptualisation stage rather than when everything has been designed, which is where typically IT guys come in."" Mahindra group's automotive division has been a client for Pininfarina even before the acquisition. When asked how soon there could be a new Mahindra vehicle with Pininfarina design, Angori didn't share a clear timeline but said a ""typical cycle for (development of) a product in automotive industry is 26-40 months.""",483,0.9999563694000244

The labour ministry on Friday inked agreements with Uber, Quikr, Monster and Tech Mahindra, among others, in a bid to exploit the potential of the National Career Service (NCS) project, a career portal. The ministry inked eight memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with these start-ups and job employment portals to work on providing a transparent and credible platform, which is aimed at saving both employers and job seekers from fraudulent practices. Principal Labour and Employment Advisor and DG (employment) P P Mitra signed the MoUs with leading organisations which are into employment and career-related activity here today in the presence of Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya and Labour Secretary Shankar Aggarwal.

Under the project, the government last year launched an information and communication technology-based platform -- www.ncs.gov.in -- for providing employment. The ministry has now partnered with Uber, Quikr, Monster, Tech Mahindra, Babajobs, India Staffing Federation (ISF), Buzzmatic Ventures and GoldFish for widening the scope and scale of the project. These strategic interventions will enhance career and employment opportunities, offer counselling and guidance for career development, among others, a statement said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated the national career service portal to the nation on July 20 last year. The MoU with ISF will facilitate quality jobs to be made available on NCS from leading private placement organisations. The one with Uber will provide micro-entrepreneurship opportunities to drivers who register on the NCS portal as local service providers.

The agreements with Monster, Quikr, Tech Mahindra would offer jobs opportunities to NCS registered users. The partnership with Buzzmatic Ventures will provide career guidance to youth through multimedia content from industry leaders. GoldFish will cater to the requirements of the industry for retired and experienced professionals who are available for work.

Referring to the MoUs, Dattatreya said this partnership will provide transparent and credible platform to both the employers and the job seekers. The minister said the government has taken this bold new initiative to link all the employment exchanges on a national platform so that more and more jobs can be accessed by the youth. The government is focusing on generating employment opportunities through transforming employment exchanges into career centres to offer counselling and guidance to the youth.

According to Agarwal, this IT-enabled platform will provide credible information on job providers and job-seekers. ""This is the first step in the journey and we look forward to more such strategic partnerships,"" he added.",409,0.9259564280509949
