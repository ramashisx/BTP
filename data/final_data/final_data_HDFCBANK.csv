Banking firms HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank may see minimal impact on their Tier-1 capital levels following the increase in risk weights for unsecured consumer loans by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), thanks to their adequate capital levels and inexpensive valuations, said analysts.

“We believe both HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are well-capitalised currently, with no immediate need to raise capital despite the RBI’s new risk-weight norms. The impact of these regulations is likely to be limited. We estimate just about 55-90 basis points (bps) impact on their CET-1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR),” said Dnyanada Vaidya, Senior Research Analyst – Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), Axis Securities.

HDFC Bank’s CAR stood at 17 percent, while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s CAR stood at 21 percent, suggested data. Both banks’ capital was at healthy levels as per the RBI mandate, which requires private sector lenders to maintain at least 8 percent of CAR levels with the central bank.

On November 17, the RBI revised its risk weight for unsecured consumer loans, encompassing personal loans and credit card loans. Consumer credit, excluding housing, education, vehicle, and jewellery loans, will now attract 125 percent risk-weight assets (RWA). On the other hand, credit cards for banks will see an increase in RWA to 150 percent from 125 percent earlier.

On the overall banking system, VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said that lenders would be able to easily pass on the increased cost to borrowers, without seeing any major drag on their profit pool.

Where do HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank stand against peers?

According to a Jefferies report, HDFC Bank’s exposure to personal loans stood at 8 percent of its total loan book as compared to ICICI Bank’s 9 percent, IDFC First Bank's 19 percent, and State Bank of India's (SBI) 10 percent. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s exposure to personal loans, on the other hand, was the lowest at 5 percent.

On the credit card loan front, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank were at 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Other lenders like ICICI Bank's credit card loan exposure stood at 4 percent, IDFC First Bank at 1 percent, and Axis Bank at 4 percent.

That apart, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank's estimated loans to NBFCs were at 1 percent and 5 percent, respectively. Compared to other lenders, estimated loans to NBFCs for IDFC First Bank was at 3 percent, ICICI Bank at 7 percent, SBI at 8 percent, and Canara Bank at 11 percent.

According to Jefferies report, IDFC First Bank and ICICI Bank may require additional capital consumption of 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, whereas Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank's additional capital consumption would be 0.6 percent post the RBI's new risk-weight norms.

Finally, the revised tier-1 CAR suggested ICICI Bank will take hit of about 74 bps and IDFC First Bank would take a hit of 80 bps, the Jefferies note added. Meanwhile, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank would see a hit of up to 60 bps.

What should investors do?

Following the RBI’s tightening over unsecured retail lending, shares of HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank remained flat in the past two trading sessions. ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and IDFC First Bank, however, declined up to 4 percent during the same period.

Kaitav Shah, lead BFSI analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional Equities, believes that this knee-jerk reaction across banking names is only temporary in nature and investor sentiment is likely to improve over the medium term.

“We maintain a ‘buy’ call on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of Rs 2,095 in the next one year. For HDFC Bank, we call a ‘hold’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,698 per share,” Shah added.

Valuation-wise, HDFC Bank was trading at an attractive 20 times (x) price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, lower than sector’s PE mean of 24x. Kotak Mahindra Bank, too, was inexpensive at a 20x PE ratio.

The heavyweight Bank Nifty index has been languishing since the last two years, inching up merely 3 percent. But, among its constituents, stock prices of large banks and small public sector lenders have shown contrasting performance. To gauge if the outperformance of smaller PSBs versus large banks (PSBs and PVBs - private banks) can sustain, we looked at measures such as returns, operating performance, credit cycle, NPA movement, and provisioning trajectory.

In conclusion, we expect to see derating in smaller PSBs as the surge in other income, the primary driver of superior RoE (return on equity) in FY23 could be transient, while larger banks with better ALM (asset and liability management) positions and underwriting capabilities would outperform.

A peek into the business performance: One, business market shares (deposits + advances) of smaller PSBs declined in FY23 relative to both SBI and larger PVBs, but recovery of written-off loans drove up return ratios of PSBs. Two, large private banks sustained gains in business share (advances & deposits), credit cycle, and better underwriting track record in FY23. RoEs of PSBs rose significantly in FY23 (12 percentage points (pp) and 16.5pp for SBI & BoB, respectively) compared to those of PVBs (ICICI Bank up 4.7pp, HDFC Bank 0.08pp, Axis Bank -0.97pp and Kotak Mahindra Bank 1.38pp).

Markets seem to have reacted differently: Shares of smaller PSBs nearly doubled and valuations surged by 50-60 percent, especially in the last 8-12 months. Amongst all PSBs, Bank of Baroda’s valuations benefitted the most from declining NPAs (correlation coefficient: -0.91). For instance, its business market share/total PSU share fell from 12.52 in FY20 to 10.26 in FY23, but P/B (price-to-book) more than doubled from 0.5x in December 2021 to peak level of 1.1 in December 2022.

Conversely, valuations of PVBs moderated during this period, even though PVBs (increased 0.6pp) scored over PSBs (average of 0.40pp) on NIMs, reflecting relatively better credit cycle. Major banks (SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Axis Bank) saw de-rating during this period, in contrast to the re-rating seen in smaller PSU banks (PSBs). For instance, largecap like State Bank of India (SBI) underperformed and remained stagnant since October 2021; its P/B de-rated from a peak of 1.8x in November 2021 (trailing) to 1.5x currently. Likewise, large private banks too saw muted valuations.

Will the dichotomy sustain? We gather, the valuation differential for smaller PSBs does not appear to be guided by fundamentals of business cycle and market power hypothesis. Rather, the rerating of smaller PSBs appears to be guided by RoE gains. The recovery from written-off loans classified under advance under collection account (AUCA; attributed to the past NPA cycle) was substantial for smaller PSBs in FY23 at 100-200 percent YoY, which contributed disproportionately to its net profits and hence, these banks delivered superior RoEs, notwithstanding their modest NIMs and pre-provisioning profits.

Given that these are legacy factors, they are expected to decline going forward. Small PSBs have risen to peak levels recently but the recent sell offs in small PSU banks appear to be blunting the re-rating momentum in the space in last 8-12 months.

Smaller PSBs at peak valuations: Based on our study, we gather, holding pattern of PSBs (dominated by concentrated bets by certain FIIs) and fundamental factors such as recovery of written-off loans have caused return ratios and valuations of smaller PSBs to shore up. Further, a quarterly series of stock ownership, NPA ratios, yields on advanced, and cost of deposits indicate low contemporaneous correlation between valuations and spreads variables (yields, cost of deposits). There exists an inverse correlation between GNPA (gross non-performing assets) ratios and valuations, especially for Indian Bank (-0.82) and BoB (-0.91); SBI is at -0.54, but for other PSBs, it is less consistent.

Changes in shareholding patterns appear to have influenced the valuations of smaller PSBs. We envisage valuations of smaller PSBs could derate from the current level, as surge in other income, the primary driver of superior RoE for smaller PSBs could be transient, given that it comes from recovery of written-off bad loans. For SBI, it peaked out in FY21 and was down 25 percent in FY23 at Rs 7,692 crore.

Larger banks may outperform: Evolving cyclical factors like sustained tightness in global rates, FII outflows, rising yield curve translating in trading losses, continued pressure on NIMs, and bottoming out of the NPA cycle would determine the performance of lenders, including banks and NBFCs. In this context, we believe larger banks with better ALM positions and underwriting capabilities will outperform. Overall, we maintain our underweight position for the BFSI sector.

Top banking and non-banking finance company stocks including SBI Cards, Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank and declined up to 6 percent on November 17, a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tightened norms for personal loans and credit cards to check the unbridled growth in this segment.

The central bank has raised credit risk weights on unsecured consumer loans by increasing the capital requirements for such loans as concerns have been growing over these borrowings.

Analysts have warned that higher unsecured credit risk would adversely impact capital adequacy ratios (CARs) of lenders, which provides a quick idea of whether a bank has enough funds to cover losses and remain solvent under difficult financial circumstances.

For Bajaj Finance, analysts at CLSA and Citi denoted up to a whopping 230 basis points (bps) impact in CAR (capital adequacy ratio). As for HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI, the rise in credit risk would impact CET-1 by 50 bps, 42 bps, 36 bps, and 27 bps, respectively.

One basis point in one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Analysts at CLSA have pencilled in 40-80 bps reduction in Tier-1 capital for banks and 415 bps for SBI Cards.

CLSA said that the growth rates of fintech intermediaries such as Paytm would also be hit.

Morgan Stanley warned that the RBI action on consumer credit and bank funding would push up borrowing and lending rates.

Housing finance companies may gain

Analysts believe that housing finance stocks could be tactical beneficiaries, as they remain unaffected by new RBI norms.

“We prefer Can Fin Homes, PNB Housing Finance, Aptus, and Home First,” analysts added.

The Reserve Bank of India said the consumer credit exposure for banks and NBFCs, excluding housing, education, vehicle, and gold-backed loans, will attract a risk-weight of 125 percent from 100 percent earlier.

The risk-weight for credit card loans by banks was raised to 150 percent from 125 percent. Those by NBFCs will see a risk-weight of 125 percent, up from 100 percent.

A higher risk implies the bank will have to set aside a higher amount as loan provisioning, which will impact capital ratios of lenders and compel them to increase interest rates on such products to curb impact on return of equity (RoE).

Provision refers to the amount banks need to set aside to cover the losses from a loan account. When an account turns into an NPA, the provisions required will equal the full loan amount.

Banks are at risk of blowing up in 2-3 years as they chase unsecured credit from unbankable segments, says veteran investor Shankar Sharma. Sharma commented that the big banks are at a size where they need to take more risks to grow. “The Non-Performing Asset (NPA) number of HDFC Bank came out a while ago and we know what kind of reaction that elicited,” Sharma added.

HDFC Bank in its Q2 results, saw its GNPA/NNPA ratios increase marginally to 1.3 percent/0.4 percent due to its merger with HDFC.

Sharma pointed out that banks don’t want to lend to corporates making retail segments, the prime target. “Nobody wants to lend to the corporates. None of the private sector banks are interested in that. Everyone is chasing the retail loan segment. In that, the bankable retail loan is probably done and dusted. So you need to go to unbankable or moderately bankable which is the unsecured part and this has become a larger pie of incremental bank lending.”

Unsecured loans refer to credit cards, personal and microfinance loans. UBS Group had recently flagged the increasing risks in retail unsecured loans for banks. UBS analysts said that unsecured retail loans increase default risk for banks by 50-200 bps. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently raised concerns about a surge in unsecured credit growth and asked banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) to enhance their internal surveillance mechanisms.

Sharma said this risk-taking approach makes him uncomfortable as blowups have happened across banks worldwide due to unsecured lending. “We will be no exception. Mark my words. In 2 or 3 years, these same loans will come back to haunt these banks. I will be then around hopefully to pick these banks when the trade is closer to book value,” Sharma added.

Sharma said despite being a fan of the Bajaj Group as they managed an unsecured loan book for a long period, he still has scepticism about how they handle the risk now. “I’ve considered them to be fantastic business people. They are very capital efficient and focused on the bottom line and generating cash flow. That said, when you reach a certain size, you will go off the risk spectrum. Earlier, Bajaj Finance could grow, because the pool of lendable assets was there. Maybe now they are getting close to the ceiling of that. We'll see. I hope they defy my scepticism.” Sharma said.

However, it seems like banks are unfazed by their growing unsecured loans. The largest public bank in India, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Dinesh Khara said they are not concerned with their unsecured loans during their September quarterly result announcement.",480,0.4534553736448288

The Street has turned cautious on shares of HDFC Bank after the lender’s July-September quarter (Q2FY24) scorecard revealed margin concerns post-merger with erstwhile HDFC and fall in earnings per share (EPS) growth for the period.

As per Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for October, analysts did not share maximum optimism with the India’s largest private sector lender. HDFC Bank used to consistently feature among Street’s top 10 favourite picks in the previous months (see table).

Other lenders like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, and State Bank of India, however, continued to dominate analysts’ mind in October.

So, why are analysts growing conservative over HDFC Bank?

Bleak margin outlook

Nuvama Institutional Equities, for instance, believes that there is near-term uncertainty on the banks’ margin trajectory and their ability to deliver consistent deposit growth every quarter.

In Q2FY24, HDFC Bank’s net interest margins (NIMs) contracted to 3.4 percent due to merger management and regulatory impact caused by incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR), which was 5-10 bps for the quarter.

The regulation on ICRR has now been withdrawn, which analysts believe should result in reversing trend from Q3FY24. However, the normalisation of NIM at 3.65 percent is unlikely in the next one or two quarters and may take longer due to high cost of erstwhile HDFC borrowings and loan-to-deposit ratio.

Thus, given margin pressures and lower benefit of cost ratios, analysts at Axis Securities trimmed earnings estimates for HDFC Bank by 2-5 percent over FY24-26E.

Asset quality impacted slightly post amalgamation

HDFC Bank’s gross non-performing loan (NPL) ratio and net NPL ratio saw sequential increase of 10 bps and 20 bps, respectively in the September-ended quarter. This was mainly on account of some slippages in the non-individual loan book from erstwhile HDFC.

The NPLs of combined HDFC and HDFC Bank was Rs 12,500 crore in Q2FY24, higher than Rs 8,950 crore in the year-ago period.

However, the bank has maintained a healthy provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) at 74 percent that would provide comfort in the long-term.

PCR is the percentage of funds that a bank sets aside for losses due to bad debts. A high PCR can prove to be beneficial to banks to buffer themselves against losses if NPAs start to increase at a faster rate. As per RBI guidelines, PCR above 70 percent is considered to be healthy.

The double fall of stock price and EPS

The EPS growth of HDFC Bank fell significantly to 10.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) in Q2FY24 as compared to 20 percent growth seen in the previous quarter.

This fall in EPS growth was reflective on bourses as well. The stock of HDFC Bank slipped 9 percent in three months as against 2 percent drop in the Bank Nifty index.

The sharp correction, analysts said, was first majorly due to uncertainty around the merger and later due to merger math being weaker than initial estimates.

Way forward

That said, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities assume the worst of merger-related news flow would be worked through and the bank may be able to grow with fewer concerns hereon. They expect HDFC Bank’s balance sheet to grow at a marginally faster rate than industry average.

“We maintain ‘buy’ rating for HDFC Bank with target price of Rs 1,800 per share. At our target price, we value the bank 2.6 times (x) book and 17x 2025E EPS for return of equities (ROEs) at 16 percent levels and 15 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR),” the brokerage firm added.

Those at Nuvama believe that a gradual re-rating for HDFC Bank would depend on how consistent the bank is delivering loan and deposit growth. The management is confident of delivering strong and granular loan and deposit growth.

Meanwhile, analysts at Motilal Oswal said that the bank posed a good beginning post-merger but still has a long way to go. “We estimate HDFC Bank to deliver a CAGR of 18/20 percent in loans/deposits and 21 percent CAGR in earnings over FY24-26, translating into RoA/RoE of 2/17.4 percent by FY26E,” they wrote in a post-result review note.

With the non-performing assets wiped out from banks’ balancesheets and the economy looking up, most investors expect bank stocks to be front-runners in the continuing bull run, but which banks could lead the race?

Celebrated fund manager and chief investment officer of ICICI Prudential AMC S Naren feels that there is need to be very selective with banks, be it private or public sector.

Even as some of the ICICI Prudential's leading equity funds are overweight on quality banks like HDFC Bank, Naren told Moneycontrol that quality banks will not be able to reclaim the high valuations they enjoyed earlier as their large base will not allow them to maintain the growth rates of the past without taking on additional risk.

Private sector banking stocks have been underperforming for a year now. HDFC Bank is down 1 percent, Kotak Mahindra Bank is down 7 percent, ICICI Bank is up 4 percent, while Nifty 50 is up 6.8 percent in the year gone by.

“I doubt whether they (quality banks) can go back to the valuations that they were enjoying 10 years ago, simply because many of them are much larger today.” As these banks are much larger than they were 10 years ago, it is hard to justify the high price-to-book multiple they enjoyed in the past, Naren said.

“When you're small, you can have very high price-to-book because they can they can grow at very high pace. Some of these banks were growing at 30-40 percent. It would be almost impossible to do that kind of growth going ahead.” said Naren.

He said quality banks are firmly on a secular growth story in India, which makes a case for investing in them. However, their valuations of the past may not serve as good benchmark. “Can their price to book keep going up? The answer is no. That's the challenge in some of the private banks which have now become very big.” Naren added.

Watch S Naren's full interview on Samvat 2080

As for public-sector banks, he said, across-the-board stocks have seen significant re-rating and are thus expensive. Public-sector banks will have to be evaluated individually for whether they will continue to maintain their asset-quality or fall prey to bad assets yet again.

So again, time to be selective because “There was a superb way in which they brought down their non performing loans. Due to that, they got rerated. From here, you have to look at them individually and see what happens to their net interest margin, and can they continue to maintain the very low level of non-performing loans. Some banks that declared results recently have been able to manage with almost no provisioning because the book is so pristine. Can it remain like this way, even in private sector, it won't,” said Naren.

Picking stocks when they are very cheap is easier, however, in the current markets as stocks have been re-rated substantially, it poses a challenge, he concluded.

Nifty PSU Bank index has advanced over 36 percent in the year gone by, with constituents like Bank of Baroda up 15 percent, Bank of India up 35 percent, and Canara Bank up 24 percent.

Largest private sector lender HDFC Bank on November 7 raised its lending rates by a marginal 0.05 per cent across select loan tenors. The city-headquartered lender's asset liability committee, which met on November 7, decided to hike the marginal cost of funding based lending rates by 0.05 per cent, officials said.

The hike comes even as there has been no rate action by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in five consecutive policy reviews. The bank has reported a narrowing of net interest margins after merging its housing finance subsidiary parent HDFC Ltd into itself.

Banks also have an external benchmark-linked loan product, which reprices basis the movement in the benchmark like the RBI's repo rate calls. Under the revised rate structure, the overnight MCLR has been hiked to 8.65 per cent from the existing 8.60 per cent, while the new three-year MCLR will be 9.30 per cent as against the existing 9.25 per cent, they said.

The time for big-boy IT companies is over and midcap and deeptech companies are going to take the centre stage, said Nilesh Shah, CEO and MD of Envision Capital. In a conversation with CNBC-TV18, Shah explained that large cap IT companies are only going to grow in low single digits going forward unless they reinvent and “encashes on AI”.

Shah specified companies like MapmyIndia that announced a revenue growth of nearly 20 percent YoY and margins expanding to 45 percent in the September quarter which has lots of use cases in many sectors as a company with long term potential. “Look at the use cases they have, it could be ubiquitous. Any sector that you would be dealing with on a daily basis, you would be touching MapmyIndia directly, Shah said.

Speaking about global view on India, Shah said that global investors are waiting to deploy capital in India post the elections when they get more certainty. “It’s going to be wait and watch in the next few months. Price of crude oil is the biggest variable they are looking at. The West Asia situation is the next and the third is our own set of elections happening”, he added.

“Post the election outcome, we have a higher certainty that we are going to see kind of inflows into India which we have not seen in the past that's the kind of money waiting in the wings out there”, Shah said.

Throwing light on HDFC Bank’s recent struggles, Shah pointed out that the Bank is struggling in relative terms of performance and it could perform when the liquidity comes in. “Three years back, it was the only bank which was delivering consistent performance. The rest was still struggling with repair, they were struggling with their asset quality. Today there are lot more banks, NBFCs, specialised lenders who are delivering more growth. They are delivering 20-25 percent growth, increasing RoE and maintaining their asset quality. So HDFC Bank will continue to underperform” Shah said.

The country's largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, on November 1 said that it will bring changes to lounge access within India on Regalia credit card.

The changes will be applicable on Regalia credit card from December 1, 2023, the bank said in an exchange notification.

The bank, in an exchange notification said that lounge access program will be based on the credit card spends.

""On meeting the spends criteria of Rs 1 lakh or more in a calendar year, users can access the lounge facility by visiting the Regalia Smart Buy page,"" the bank said.

Veteran value investor and ex-CIO of HDFC AMC Prashant Jain continues to make contrarian bets, the portfolio of his alternative investment fund 3P Investment Managers reveals. Moneycontrol accessed 3P India Equity Fund's September factsheet to find Jain still betting on NTPC, REC and Coal India.

The fund size is about Rs 5,800 crore with 3.1 percent weightage in NTPC, 3 percent in REC and 0.5 percent in Coal India. Energy and utilities, sectors where Jain sees a steady growth and attractive valuations, make for 13.4 percent of the fund weightage.

Consumer discretionary and industrials/capex are the two sectors Jain's fund is overweight on. For consumer discretionary, his reasoning lies in per capita income rising above $2,000 and, for industrials, it is the supportive government policies.

""The medium to long-term growth outlook of the Indian economy is extremely strong. Everyone is very positive on the India story,"" Jain said in a recent interview to Moneycontrol.

Watch: Have value stocks gone overboard right now? | Prashant Jain of 3P Investment Managers answers

Jain's top bets in these sectors include Mahindra & Mahindra (3 percent), Maruti Suzuki (2 percent), Zomato (2 percent), IndiGo (1.8 percent), Larsen & Toubro (3.7 percent), 3M India (1.5 percent) and Kalpataru Projects (1.1 percent).

Jain has also assigned small weightages to Landmark Cars, Wonderla Holidays, Senco Gold, Anup Engineering, RR Kable, Dynamatic Technologies and Centum Electronics.

Betting on biggies

When it comes to banks, Jain, too, is bullish on the biggest of them all — HDFC Bank. The fund has a 9.3 percent weight assigned to the stock. Jain expects the bank to continue gaining market share though at a somewhat slower pace due to increased competition, but he believes valuations remain reasonable.

Regarding the management changes and the recent merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank, Jain said, ""Management change is inevitable in all companies, and mergers can have a significant impact on near-term results. However, it is well understood by the markets now, and there are several long-term positives in that merger.""

Jain's portfolio also has 8.2 percent weight in ICICI Bank and 7.5 percent in State Bank of India.

Jain is also betting big on his ex-workplace HDFC AMC, with a 2.6 percent weightage. Low penetration of financial products, good growth prospects and reasonable valuations make him bullish on the space. The fund also has an exposure to SBI Life, with 1.3 percent weightage.

In healthcare, the fund is equalweight to the index, with bets in Cipla, Sun Pharma, IPCA Laboratories and Aurobindo Pharma. ""These are good businesses and 10-year underperformance relative to Nifty makes it a ripe time for stock picking,"" Jain said.

Among miscellaneous bets, the 3P India Equity Fund has 0.4 percent allocation to Time Technoplast and 0.1 percent to Vardhaman Textiles.

One of the most crucial campaigns of Alexander the Great was the Battle of Hydaspes in 326 BC, when he went up against King Porus of Punjab. Porus’s mighty army relied heavily on its contingent of war elephants, which struck fear into the hearts of his enemies. However, on the day of the battle, the Macedonian phalanx managed to repulse the giant beasts, which turned around in panic and trampled many of their own soldiers to death.

The episode has played out multiple times in Indian history, and not just in warfare. Size might be a critical advantage in many situations, but it also risks being the biggest drag when the winds turn unfavourable.

Take the current Q2 earnings season, for example.

The country’s biggest IT firm TCS, biggest private sector lender HDFC Bank and largest NBFC Bajaj Finance have for long been benchmarks for Corporate India.

But as their Q2 report card shows, a larger surface area has not only amplified the impact of global and domestic headwinds, but also added to the biggest burden facing any company - the weight of expectations.

Tech Turbulence

TCS kicked off the Q2 results season with a contraction in USD revenues for the first time since the pandemic-hit June 2020 quarter as well as the highest-ever quarterly decline in headcount.

The IT major bore the brunt of the growth pangs in the US and EU, which account for around 68 percent of its topline.

Elevated interest rates and weak consumer sentiment in Western economies have led to a continued slowdown in discretionary spends, leading to delays in decision-making as well as deal conversions.

TCS, Infy, Wipro stocks in red since Q2 results; should you buy IT shares?

“Management highlighted that while the company is able to sign large deals and the new projects are ramping up on time, revenue leakage from existing projects due to deferrals or ramp downs is impacting revenue growth. Furthermore, management highlighted that the demand sentiment has not changed and clients remain cautious,” analysts at Jefferies said.

The silver lining was that deal wins remained strong at $11.2 billion, its second-highest-ever deal total contract value (TCV) and also the third consecutive quarter of deal wins staying above $10 billion - a milestone for India’s $245-billion Indian IT industry.

However, Q2 deal wins were driven by two mega deals with TCV of around $1 billion each from BSNL and JLR. Worryingly, order wins across the key market of North America slumped 13.5 percent QoQ to $4.5 billion.

Needless to say, the Street has taken note of this slowing juggernaut. TCS is the worst performer among the top 3 IT firms for the past month.

Growth Pangs

Probably the most vivid demonstration of ‘big is not always better’ philosophy right now is HDFC Bank, which reported its first quarterly results after it merged with the parent Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC).

While the Q2 numbers are not comparable to the pre-merger period, HDFC Bank’s management had provided proforma numbers for the first quarter to give a sense of how the merged entity would look.

As per an analysis by Jefferies, adjusted for the merger, HDFC Bank’s net profit declined by 2 percent sequentially against the reported 33 percent jump.

The biggest impact was on the net interest margin (NIM), which tumbled by a whopping 70 basis points sequentially to 3.4 percent, as against the 4 percent-level HDFC Bank has traditionally maintained.

HDFC Bank Q2 earnings growth: Is it 50, 10 or 6%? Here is the correct version

NIM - the difference between what banks offer depositors and what they charge for loans – is a key profitability metric for lenders.

One of the major reasons for the deteriorating margins was an increase in liquidity post the merger. When HDFC Bank absorbed HDFC’s loans, it had to increase its liquidity position to meet various regulatory guidelines like cash reserve ratio.

The bank said there was a “debt-funded cost for the additional liquidity and merger management” which was a drag on the NIMs during Q2.

“While we expect NIMs to see sequential improvement going ahead, as the impact of excess liquidity wanes out, it will be difficult to see pre-merger levels as lower-margin home loans of HDFC Ltd gets added to the loan portfolio,” domestic brokerage firm JM Financial said.

Another fallout of the merger was an uptick in its gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio to 1.34 percent from 1.17 percent in Q1 as about Rs 5,000 crore worth of HDFC’s loans were restructured and had to be labelled non-performing on the bank’s balance sheet.

The HDFC Bank stock has been a conspicuous underperformer ever since the merger was announced in April last year, dropping around 7 percent.

Investors, however, can still take heart from the fact that despite its merger-related pain, the analyst view on the company remains overwhelmingly positive.

Hamara Bajaj

Shrinking margins has claimed another high-profile victim this earnings season – Bajaj Finance.

Its net interest income growth of 30 percent lagged AUM expansion of 33 percent due to an 11 bps QoQ compression in NIMs to 10.5 percent.

“Moreover, management guided that margins may see another 25-30 bps compression as funding costs will rise and Bajaj Finance may not like to pass that on to clients. While this will be a drag on top line, Bajaj Finance has levers to slow opex growth… to mitigate impact on profit / ROA,” Jefferies added.

Bajaj Finance: Strong earnings growth, but sustainability is debatable

Other analysts pointed out that its NPA profile will be keenly tracked as it is already one of the most aggressive lenders in the NBFC space today and will have to maintain its scorching pace of growth to sustain its leadership position in the market.

However, as most finance sector professionals know only too well, lending is the easiest part for banks and NBFCs in India. The real challenge is to recover those loans.

Shareholders would be hoping this mad rush for growth does not result in laxity in the company’s credit appraisal process and subsequent deterioration in its asset quality.

Some parts of its book have started throwing up signs of stress.

Bajaj Finance’s gross stage-3 assets (or loans which have been overdue for more than 90 days) increased 5 bps QoQ to 0.9 percent, while the net stage- 3 was largely stable at 0.3 percent.

“Rural B2C exhibited minor stress, and the management has cut incremental business volumes in this segment to mitigate risk. It expects Rural B2C to remain muted until Feb’24 and recover subsequently,” Motilal Oswal said in a note.

Weighed by these lingering concerns, the Bajaj Finance counter closed in the red for two straight sessions after its results announcement.

In a report earlier this year, Elara Securities had described Bajaj Finance as an “elephant that continues to dance”. Investors would be praying it remains that way, because as we have seen, wounded elephants do not paint a pretty picture.

The stock made a fresh 52-week high on Wednesday, after reporting record profits for the September quarter. MD and CEO Ramesh Babu said that there

was pressure on net interest margins as cost of deposits has gone up. But the market appears to be fine with that, as the company looks confident about a 15 percent loan growth for the year. Outlook for the banking sector in general is positive at the moment, but the trouble is that too many people are positive. As ICICI Prudential MF’s S Naren said in an interview to Moneycontrol, a major hurdle to bank stocks’ performance is that too many funds own it.

ICICI Bank vs HDFC Bank

The ICICI Bank may have performed better in recent times, but HDFC Bank could be a better bet at these levels, say the banking analysts at Incred Capital.

Why?

That’s because semi-urban and rural India are the next big growth areas for the Indian banks. Improving ground presence (branches) and faster paced customer acquisition will be key to winning this battle. “We believe that HDFC Bank is relatively better placed on both these formats compared to ICICI Bank, which will ensure granular retail asset growth for the bank, along with consistency in revenues,” said the analyst. Five things that gives Incred the confidence to bank HDFC Bank:

- HDFC Bank has opened more branches in the past three years compared to ICICI Bank

- HDFC Bank has more individual bank branches in various locations compared to ICICI Bank

- Customers acquired, as measured through debit card issuances, remain higher for HDFC Bank

- HDFC Bank has managed its market share dominance in credit card issuances as well as spends

- Cross-selling opportunity to existing HDFC mortgage customers is high for HDFC Bank

Derivatives time bomb

Axis Bank MF Chief Investment Officer Ashish Gupta has warned that the outsized derivatives markets themselves can itself be a source of additional macro and market risk, as has been seen global cases with (collateralised debt securities) and derivatives contracts. This is in the backdrop of the massive surge in equity options trading in India. Black swan events and resultant spike in volatility in particular can drive exaggerated moves in stock prices and result in market dislocation, Gupta writes.

And, exchanges appear to have taken a leaf out of the FMCG book to boost sales through sachets. “The introduction of shorter duration in options has effectively 'sachet-sized' trading, reducing the capital needed to take on similar risks. Weekly options are cheaper compared to monthly contracts, and buyers gain exposure to the full notional value by paying only 0.5-5 percent for the same,” he writes.

China

JP Morgan’s James Sullivan says his firm is 'overweight' on China. That is because corporate earnings revisions are below an 18-year average, indicating this could be an inflection.

Shipping

Goldman Sachs has forecast a lengthier and potentially more severe downturn for the global shipping industry, and has warned that the market was still ‘too complacent on the depth and duration of the coming shipping recession’, reports Zerohedge.com. According to Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Creuset, freight rates and earnings must continue to decline to the point where there was pressure on pressure on shipping companies to phase out expensive tonnage. Shipping companies have been adding capacity even as freight rates continue to slide.

US treasury yields

Borrowing costs for companies in the US may be rising, but consumers don’t seem to be feeling the pinch of higher rates yet. Spending online, at stores and in restaurants rose a stronger-than-expected 0.7 percent in September from a month earlier, according to the latest US retail sales report. Soon after the report, yields on US Treasury bonds jumped around 13 basis points to 4.86 percent. If consumers keep an already robust economy’s engines humming, rates could stay high for longer, and at some point hurt appetite for stocks.

Job openings

On the face of it, the US labour market looks strong, but there may not be as job openings as one would expect. A Gallup report says employers are looking to their current employees to fill in where postings remain open, reports Bloomberg. Almost 60 percent of employees surveyed by Gallup say their organization has recently asked workers to take on additional responsibilities without additional pay.

HDFC Bank shares closed a percent higher on October 17, a day after India’s biggest private lender exceeded analysts’ expectations with a second-quarter net profit of Rs 15,976 crore, though the net interest margin moderated.

This was the first quarterly results for HDFC Bank after it merged with the parent Housing Development Finance Corporation, which means the numbers are not comparable with the previous quarters. Analysts, however, were mostly positive on Q2 performance.

Here are the key factors working in favour of HDFC Bank:

NIMs bottoming out

While the net profit came in above estimates, HDFC Bank disappointed on net interest margins (NIMs), the amount that a bank earns from interest on loans compared to what it is paying in interest on deposits.

Core NIM for the quarter was 3.65 percent on total assets and 3.85 percent on interest earnings assets. HDFC Bank’s NIM stood at 4.1 percent in the previous quarter.

The margins contracted mainly due to surplus liquidity and the impact of the Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR).

Also read: HDFC Bank Q2 earnings growth: 50? 10? 6%? Here is the correct version

On August 10, the Reserve Bank of India asked banks to maintain an I-CRR of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19 and July 28. The move was aimed measure at sucking out the surplus liquidity generated by various factors, including the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system.

Analysts, however, see NIMs bottoming out.

“Impact of ICRR (6-8 bps on NIMs) will go-away from 3Q onwards but overall margins will start showing reasonable impact only from 4Q as the bank may like to carry some buffer liquidity and share of term deposits is still rising,” foreign brokerage firm Jefferies said in a note.

ICICI Securities has a word of caution for investors.

“While the drag from I-CRR has almost ended and thus NIM seems to have bottomed out, we model in only gradual recovery due to heightened competitive intensity and calibrated absorption of excess liquidity,” it said.

Domestic brokerage firm JM Financial echoed the views.

“While we expect NIMs to see sequential improvement going ahead, as the impact of excess liquidity wanes out, it will be difficult to see pre-merger levels as lower-margin home loans of HDFC Ltd gets added to the loan portfolio,” it said.

Strong loan growth

Loan growth was strong at 18 percent YoY and 5.3 percent QoQ, led by robust growth in retail and continued traction in commercial and rural banking. A pick-up was seen in the corporate segment as well.

“HDFC Bank has made a good beginning, and given a huge pace of capacity building, we believe that there are levers in place to sustain this momentum in business growth. Margins are likely to recover gradually, which, along with improved operating leverage, should improve return ratios,” analysts at Motilal Oswal wrote in a note.

They expect HDFC Bank to deliver a CAGR of 18 percent in loans and 21 percent in earnings over FY24-26.

Deposit mobilisation

A major highlight of the Q2 report card was a strong deposit growth of 29.8 percent, as the private lender garnered Rs 1.1 lakh crore of deposits, with 85 percent being retail deposits. The change in the mix toward retail will lead to better margins.

“It was good to see improvement in deposit mobilisation to Rs 1.1 trillion…While the bank is carrying excess liquidity, it is still raising large fresh deposits and securitising loans, we expect these normalize over the next 2-3 quarters with an uptick in loan growth and normalisation of liquidity,” Jefferies added.

Acquisition of deposits remains a key focus area for the bank, JM Financial said, adding it plans to leverage the power of branch banking to source deposits.

Strong retail franchise

The bank added 85 branches during the quarter, taking the count to 7,945. Analysts are enthused by its pace of expansion, especially in rural and semi-urban markets.

HDFC Bank has added 2,213 branches across India in the past two years against 634 branches added by the nearest rival ICICI Bank.

“This will provide the first-mover advantage to HDFC Bank in rural areas. Our analysis suggests that HDFC Bank has significantly improved their presence in eastern and central states of India including UP, Bihar, MP and Northeastern states which are witnessing a sharp surge in organised penetration,” InCred Equities said.

Merger momentum

InCred Equities said its channel checks indicate that while ICICI Bank has been more engaged in mining deeper into the existing customer base, HDFC Bank was more focused on acquiring customers.

“Post recent merger with HDFC Limited, we can visualise large and untapped cross-sell opportunity to existing mortgage customers which can further aid HDFC Bank’s retail growth momentum (especially unsecured) in the near term,” it said.

Stable asset quality

The bank’s accelerated stress recognition from HDFC’s corporate loan portfolio, including construction finance, led to a merged GNPA ratio of 1.3 percent in 2QFY24 (lower than the 1.4 percent as on July 1, post the merger).

However, the bank carries a healthy specific provision coverage ratio (PCR) at 73 percent and has already created a contingent buffer on HDFC loans, pulling up this buffer for the merged entity to 0.7 percent of loans.

PCR refers to the percentage of funds created against NPAs.

“Amid the rising noise around stress build-up in unsecured loans, where the bank has sizable exposure, the higher specific-/contingent-provision buffer provides comfort,” analysts at Emkay Research said.

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank (HDFCB) reported a steady first quarter after the merger, with in-line PPoP and robust business growth (~5% QoQ). PAT grew 33.7% QoQ to INR159.8b in 2QFY24. Deposit growth was particularly strong as the bank garnered INR1.1tn of deposits in 2QFY24 (85% retail deposits). Margins compressed sharply to 3.4%, dragged down by excess liquidity and ICRR impact. However, the bank reported an 8% earnings beat, supported by a lower tax rate. NII came in slightly lower than our estimate, but it was offset by robust other income (buoyed by treasury gains). As a result, revenue stood in line with our estimate. GNPA ratio improved over pro forma 1QFY24 estimates, while PCR was broadly stable at 74%. Fresh slippages stood at INR78b or 1.9% of loans. HDFCB has made a good beginning, and given a huge pace of capacity building, we believe that there are levers in place to sustain this momentum in business growth. Margins are likely to recover gradually, which, along with improved operating leverage, should improve return ratios. We estimate HDFCB to deliver a CAGR of 18%/20% in loans/deposits and a 21% CAGR in earnings over FY24-26, translating into RoA/RoE of 2%/17.4% by FY26E. We reiterate our BUY rating.

Outlook

We estimate HDFCB to deliver a CAGR of 18%/20% in loans/deposits and a 21% CAGR in earnings over FY24-26, translating into RoA/RoE of 2%/17.4% by FY26E. We reiterate our BUY rating with an unchanged TP of INR1,950 (2.7x FY25E ABV + INR209 for subs).

HDFC Bank's first quarterly results post-merger have left analysts and investors scratching their heads. Contrary to the 50 percent profit growth number doing the rounds, HDFC Bank's consolidated PAT growth is far lower, pointed out some analysts.

On October 16, HDFC Bank which has now merged with its parent HDFC Ltd, reported a quarterly consolidated net profit of Rs 16,811 crore, up 51 percent YoY from Rs 11,125 crore in the same period last year. The problem here is the base number or the number for the year-ago quarter does not include the profit reported by HDFC Ltd for that quarter.

The earnings growth of 50 percent thus is grossly exaggerated as it compares the merged entity’s profits with that of the bank only for the prior period.

Breaking down HDFC Ltd's profit in the base quarter

This was called out by CapitalMind’s Deepak Shenoy in his X thread. He corrected the base figure to conclude that the bank reported a 10.2 percent growth in profit. Here is the math.

In Q2 FY23, HDFC Ltd reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 7,042 crore, including the profit share of subsidiaries and associates. Shenoy deducted the HDFC Bank’s share of profits (as it was an associate company where HDFC had a 24 percent stake prior to the merger) from the consolidated number and added the resultant profit number to the prior period profits of HDFC Bank.

HDFC Bank's share in HDFC Ltd’s profit for Q2 FY23 stood at Rs 2,954 crore; deducting this, its bottomline stood at Rs 4,088 crore. Now, adding this number to HDFC Bank's consolidated profit (Rs 11,125 crore) for the same period, throws up Rs 15,213 crore as the prior period profit for the merged entity. Taking this as the base, the net profit growth for Q2 FY24 works out to 10.2 percent.

""HDFC Bank used to easily deliver 15 percent or more (heck, we used to call it the excel sheet results) But hey, it's just merged, so stuff will be tough a little,"" Shenoy said in his X thread.

What if we compare standalone numbers?

That does not seal the growth picture though. There is a chink in this calculation: the base number according to Shenoy takes into consideration the consolidated numbers for HDFC Ltd, including the profits of its subsidiaries.

To get a sense of the lending operations of the business, which is the mainstay for the bank, analysts usually look at standalone numbers. Thus, brokerage firm Jeffries in its report highlighted an even lower growth rate – 6 percent. Here is their math.

In Q2 FY23, HDFC had reported a standalone net profit of Rs 4,454 crore. Now, adding this to HDFC Bank's standalone profit (Rs 10,605 crore) gives Rs 15,054 crore. Taking this as the base, the net profit growth for Q1 FY24 is only 6 percent, at Rs 15,976 crore as reported by the merged entity.

Indeed, this is how the lending business of HDFC-HDFC combined has fared in the past one year. That would qualify as unimpressive performance according to analysts. But the story isn’t over yet.

Standalone or consolidated growth matters?

One question to ask from an investor perspective, which growth numbers are more relevant to look at: standalone or consolidated? Usually, analysts look at standalone numbers to get a sense of how the main-line of business is doing. Otherwise, from an investor perspective, consolidated number should be the defacto standard as that is what gives a complete picture of the company’s overall performance, which is what is relevant to get a view on the stocks’ fair price.

After all, any improvement or deterioration in the subsidiaries does impact the company’s overall net worth. Here, HDFC Life Insurance, HDFC Ergo and HDFC AMC were earlier subsidiaries of HDFC Ltd. Now, they are subsidiaries of HDFC Bank which makes the comparison more complex.

While the 6 percent growth does look anaemic, some analysts feel that the comparison is not appropriate because of the difference in accounting standards. “It’s hard to hazard a guess on what could be the difference in earnings caused by the change in accounting standard,” said an analyst who did not wish to be quoted.

Why such poor growth?

The poor growth seems to be a result of moderation in lending and damage caused by a change in accounting standard.

Notably, HDFC Bank reported a sharp contraction in NIM (net interest margin) at 3.4 percent compared to 4.1 percent YoY. The management in the post-earnings call explained that some adjustments to the NIM were due to the fact that HDFC’s accounting before the merger was as per IndAS. The numbers are now restated according to Indian GAAP, in line with HDFC Bank’s accounting.

Could this make such a large dent in profits? Analysts won’t hazard a guess, but Nikunj Pugalia, deputy group chief financial officer at Neo Group said that IndAS accounting is more intent-based, while IGAAP is an old methodology.

""From FY17, all companies were asked to move to IndAS, based on networth, but this was not applicable for banks,"" he said. ""For instance, in IndAS, when a loan is disbursed, all upfront costs, fees incurred to disburse that loan is amortised over the lifetime of the loan. In GAAP, it is accounted for upfront,"" Pugalia added.

In case of provisioning for bad loans too, IndAS allows for the expected credit loss method while in GAAP, provisions are to be made for loans that have not been repaid 90 days past the due date.

Post-merger, GNPA/NNPA ratios have now increased marginally to 1.3 percent/ 0.4 percent, on the back of a 22 basis point impact from higher NPAs related to HDFC’s non-retail loans. NPA stands for non-performing assets.

The exact impact of accounting change in bottomline is not clear. Moneycontrol has written to HDFC Bank for a clarification on the same and the story will be updated once we get a reply.",1079,-0.7397880792617798

HDFC Bank, India's largest private sector lender, reported mixed results for the first quarter following the merger with HDFC Ltd. Although the bank reported that its net profit surged 50 percent over the last year, its core business growth was weighed down by lower-than-expected net interest margins (NIMs) and net interest income (NII).

Despite the recent underperformance, brokerages remained bullish on the HDFC Bank stock as they expect sequential improvement in core earnings momentum and NIMs recovery. As the impact of ICRR (incremental cash reserve ratio) and surplus liquidity will recede, expansion will be seen from the fourth quarter.

Q2 earnings encouraging

HDFC Bank's growth in net interest income (NII) is expected to reaccelerate from here on, noted Morgan Stanley. The international brokerage issued a 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,100 per share. The lenders' retail deposit accretion at over Rs 90,000 crore is encouraging. However, going forward, sustenance of this momentum will be key.

Foreign research firm HSBC has cut the target price to Rs 1,850, while maintaining its 'buy' call on the HDFC Bank stock. “HDFC bank faces tough deliverables,” it said. Analysts said that most of the low-hanging fruits have been plucked, and only consistent execution can pull it through. Improving NIMs and narrowing its performance gap with ICICI Bank is critical, it added. ""HDFC Bank's risk-to-reward ratio is favourable,” HSBC said.

NIM pressure to persist

Incred Equities expects HDFC Bank to see healthy growth in advances after the merger. It expects margin pressure to persist in the second half of this fiscal on account of excess liquidity and elevated cost of deposits. ""Offsetting lower credit costs amid rapid branch expansion drives growth certainty,"" said Incred, while issuing an 'add' call on the counter with a target price of Rs 2,000 per share.

The current valuation of HDFC Bank adequately captures the merger-related pangs, and should alleviate concerns regarding compression of return on assets (RoA) over the medium-term, according to analysts. As the world's seventh largest bank's liabilities momentum sustains, JM Financial expects the stock to reverse its recent underperformance.

""Current valuations offer attractive risk-reward for a high quality, diversified asset franchise with superior through-cycle asset quality performance,"" the brokerage said, putting a 'buy' tag on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,850.

Valuations reasonable

HDFC Bank's earnings growth is seen in the mid-teens, said Jefferies. It expects return on equity (ROE) at 17 percent from FY25, aided by healthy deposit growth. The brokerage says that the bank’s valuations are reasonable at a price/ adjusted book value of 2.2x on a 12-month forward basis. ""After having emerged as the 7th largest bank in the world HDFC Bank now looks attractive for global portfolios as well,"" it said.

Sharekhan's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank reported PAT at Rs. 15,977 crore on the merged basis beating consensus and our estimates by 9%/8% respectively mainly due to lower tax rate led by one off item i.e. write back of tax provisions amounting to ~Rs. 1,000 crore from a favorable appellate orders. NIMs were lower at ~3.6% based on interest earning assets for the merged entity in Q2FY24 vs ~3.7-3.8% in Q1FY23 based on the proforma disclosed earlier. Excess liquidity built up required for LCR and for incremental CRR led to ~25 bps negative impact on NIMs resulting in NII missing consensus and our estimates by 3%/2% respectively. Management guided that NIMs would normalize gradually over the next few quarters as liquidity was made available through debt funding and it would require time to retire as they are not short term in nature. Despite significant margin pressure, bank reported RoA of ~2.0% led by higher other income, lower credit cost and lower tax expense.

Outlook

The stock trades at 2.2x/2.0x its FY2024E/FY2025E core BV estimates. We maintain our Buy rating with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,900.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB saw good quarter; NIM was 4bps higher to PLe at 3.66% and core PPoP was a 2.9% beat owing to better fees. Loan growth at 5.0% QoQ was broad based led by CRB/agri/retail/corporate. Asset quality was stable with GNPA at 1.34% (-6bps QoQ) and controlled net slippages. While NIM was affected (-37bps QoQ) by surplus liquidity, we believe margins have bottomed out as excess cash has already been drawn down which should normalize NIM in H2FY24E. Moreover, as high cost liabilities of HDFCL are replaced, NIM should enhance over FY24-26E from 3.57% to 3.72%. Due to higher fees/lower taxes we raise FY24E core PAT by ~3%, although FY25/26E earnings remain unchanged. With core RoA of 1.74% and likely core PAT CAGR of ~19% over FY24-26E, HDFCB remains our preferred pick among large-caps.



Outlook

We maintain multiple at 2.8x on Sep’25E core ABV and TP at Rs2,025. Retain ‘BUY’.

HDFC Bank share price rose on October 17, a day after India’s biggest private lender reported weak core operations in the first quarter after it merged with mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation.

In the September quarter of the current financial year, the lender missed analyst estimates on net interest income (NII) and net interest margins (NIM). Its net profit, however, got a boost from higher other income and a lower tax rate.

HDFC Bank's loan growth was healthy in Q2FY24, driven by growth in retail and continued traction in commercial and rural banking. Its asset quality ratios took a hit due to a 22bp impact from HDFC Ltd’s non-retail portfolio. The bank still maintained healthy PCR.

HDFC Bank has made a good beginning and given a huge pace of capacity building, there are levers in place to sustain this momentum, analysts at Motilal Oswal said in a note.

""Margins are likely to recover gradually, which, along with improved operating leverage, should improve return ratios,"" the brokerage said.

Brokerage calls

Motilal Oswal estimates HDFC Bank to deliver a CAGR of 18 percent and 20 percent in loans and deposits respectively, over FY24-26. A 21 percent CAGR in earnings is seen over the same period, translating into RoA, RoE of 2 percent and 17.4 percent respectively by FY26E. The brokerage has a “buy” rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,950 apiece.

Citi analysts said HDFC Bank's deposit accretion and other most watched-out metrics are encouraging. Sustaining the momentum would be the key.

The brokerage, too, has a “buy” call on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,100 a share.

Morgan Stanley has an “overweight” rating on the stock with the same target price. The international brokerage house expects HDFC Bank's NII growth to reaccelerate from here.

On October 16, the stock closed at Rs 1,532 on the National Stock Exchange, down 0.24 percent from the previous close.

Veteran stock market investor Govind Parikh said he is cautious about financial services firms, particularly banks. “We are thinking of paring our positions in financials,” he said.

“We are evaluating what is going to be the impact of Jio Financial coming into the market. Because they have a track record of disrupting any segment they enter, telecom being a classic example,” he said.

Parikh’s view is in contrast with that of some banking analysts who feel Jio Financial may not try to disrupt the NBFC segment given that the dynamics of the lending business are much different from say an industry like telecom or retail.

“Right now Jio is quoting at one time book, which is a huge discount to other players. This gap can be bridged if they decide to do things the usual way. But if Jio decides to adopt a similar strategy that it had in the telecom sector, which is to cut prices sharply, then it is bad news for other players. When market booms, financials do well, but at this point valuations of financial services firms are not exactly cheap” he said.

“You have banks like HDFC Bank and Kotak having net interest margins of anywhere between 3-4 percent. Now it has become easier to raise money from overseas markets cheaply. If you are saying that some of the Indian banks are world class, then their margins too will have to comparable to those of world class companies. Globally NIMs are between 1-1.5. So I think in India too NIMs will contract. The second thing that will happen is that fintech companies and smart NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Chola will take away market share in the small ticket loan segment. Right now the share of financials in the index is 40-45 percent. I think that can come down by a good extent,” he said.

Parikh said the good thing about banks and financial services right now is that the asset quality is much better than what it has been in a long time.

“But at the same time, the market is not factoring in any political risks, and banks are most vulnerable to changes in the political environment. One phone call is enough to create a bad loan,” he said.

Make in India

Parikh is bullish on manufacturing, and because of the trend of lot of manufacturing shifting to India. Like most other sectors, here too investors may have to put up with high valuations for a while, he feels.

“India’s infrastructure is also going to grow in a big way….lot of it is in the price already, I am not saying rush in to buy today,” he said.

“For instance, Timken US has stopped manufacturing two of their products in the US and now producing them in India. If they are happy with the quality and delivery timelines, more products will be made out of India. Lot of companies want to put up plants in India,"" he explained.

Take Sundram Fasteners, for instance. The company has been supplying to electrical vehicle makers over the last many years. Further, if a big EV maker were to put up a plant in India someday, it will source even more from Sundaram.

""None of these stocks are cheap, they are already quoting at 50-plus price-to-earnings ratio which is expensive for manufacturing companies. But if a family office which has the funds, understands the industry well, and is willing to take a long term view, enters the picture, they may decide to deploy a part of their money, and keep scaling that position over time instead of waiting for valuations to correct and risk missing out,"" he said.

HDFC Bank Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Srinivasan Vaidyanathan on October 16 said that the bank has seen a 5-10 basis points (bps) impact of Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR) on their net interest margins in the July-September quarter.

“Impact of I-CRR on NIMs was around 5 to 10 basis points,” Vaidyanathan said during an earnings call.

The reported net interest margins (NIM) of the HDFC Bank was at 3.4 percent on total assets in the July-September quarter.

Core net interest margins of the bank in the reporting quarter were at 3.65 percent on total assets and 3.85 percent on the interest earnings asset, a press release from the company said.

On August 10, the RBI asked scheduled banks to maintain an I-CRR of 10 percent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19 and July 28.

The measure was intended to absorb the surplus liquidity generated by various factors, including the return of Rs 2,000 notes to the banking system.

The central bank, on September 8, took the decision to discontinue the I-CRR in a phased manner, after the review. It added that the amount under I-CRR would be released in stages so that system liquidity is not subjected to sudden shocks and money markets function in an orderly manner.

On September 8, the central bank said that 25 percent of the funds maintained in the I-CRR would be released on September 9 and 25 percent on September 23. The remaining 50 percent will be released on October 7.

Even after the complete reversal of I-CRR, liquidity in the banking system remained tight. This was due to tax outflows such as goods and services tax and advance tax payment.

As of October 15, liquidity in the banking system was in a deficit of over Rs 18,000 crore, as per RBI’s money market data.

Further Vaidyanathan said the bank has taken certain calls on liquidity management for the coming quarters.

India’s largest private bank, HDFC Bank, is set to report strong profits for the September quarter driven by strong loan growth. This will be the first quarterly earnings announcement since group company HDFC was merged into it. Analysts are expecting some pressure on net interest margins (NIM) because of the merger as well as the incremental Cash Reserve ratio (ICRR) stipulations of the RBI.

The bank is set to announce its results on October 16.

Last month, broking firm Nomura had trimmed its NIM forecast for HDFC Bank while downgrading the stock. NIM could see pressure over the next two to three quarters as HDFC’s second quarter opening book NIMs were at 2 percent versus 2.7 percent in Q1. This was mainly on account of excess liquidity being carried post-merger, Nomura said.

According to the average of five brokers’ estimates, HDFC Bank is expected to register a net profit of Rs 14,780 crore rising by 39.4 percent year-on-year (YoY). The bank’s Net Interest Income (NII) is set to touch Rs 28,089.9 crore, a YoY increase of 33.6 percent.

The bank’s merger with HDFC has resulted in strong deposits and loans. In its Q2 business update, HDFC Bank said its deposits grew 29.9 percent YoY to Rs 21,73,000 crore. Its CASA (Current and Savings account) deposits have gone up 7.6 percent YoY to Rs 8,17,500 crore, while CASA ratio has reduced to 37.6 percent from 45.4 percent in the previous year. Its gross advances also grew 57.7 percent to Rs 23,54,500 crore.

The bank’s gross Non Performing Assets (NPA) are set to increase to 1.4 percent in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points (bps) from the previous year, with Net NPA expected to rise to 1.3, a 10 bps hike.

Analysts focus on margins

“We expect the bank to deliver 1.6 percent RoA in Q2, with Q2 NIMs impacted by liquidity reserve requirements and ICRR. We will watch out for trends in its post-merger RoA profile, as well as how much of the impact on its Net Interest Margins (NIM)s are structural vs transient.” said Nomura.

NIM for the quarter is expected to come down to 3.5 percent from 4.1 percent in the previous year. This is also set to affect Return on Asset (RoA) which is expected to decline to 1.6 percent from 2 percent from the previous year.

The downside risks for HDFC Bank, according to analysts, are:

1) Non recovery of the NIM /RoA as estimated, would get the stock to be de-rated as the gap of its operating metrics to the nearest competitor would expand.

2) Loan growth remaining lacklustre

3) Sharper than estimated NIM impact due to repo cuts in FY25e.

In the last month, the Nifty Bank index has given negative returns of 3.51 percent. HDFC Bank’s share price in the same period has lost value by 6.18 percent.

HDFC Bank shares were trading lower on October 13 morning after 46.7 lakh shares, or 0.1 percent stake, worth Rs 720 crore changed hands at Rs 1,540 apiece. The fall in the stock contributed to a drop in the 12-pack Nifty Bank, which was down 313 points or 0.70 percent.

The details of the sellers and buyers were not immediately known.

HDFC Bank stock is in the spotlight as India’s biggest private lender announces its Q2 earnings on October 15. Sequentially, all private banks other than HDFC are expected to see their net interest income (NII) and profit after tax to grow around 1 to 4 percent in the September quarter, ICICI Securities has said in the report.

Domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal expects HDFC Bank to report a net profit of Rs 14,781.1 crore, up 39.4 percent from the year-ago quarter. Net interest income (NII) is expected to increase by 33.6 percent to Rs 28,089.4 crore. Lender's pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) is likely to rise by 31 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 22,788 crore.

In a business update, HDFC Bank reported 57.7 percent YoY growth in its gross advances in the September quarter, while deposits grew about 30 percent. Its gross advances aggregated to approximately Rs 23,54,500 crore as of September-end, a growth of 57.7 percent on a YoY basis.

HDFC Bank, which has lost 5 percent this year, has been one of the worst-performing banking stocks of 2023.

While largecap bank stocks have largely underperformed midcap and smallcap peers, recent updates by Dalal Street's most valued bank on the merged entity's (HDFC Bank-HDFC) net worth, net interest margins (NIM) and return on assets (RoA) weighed on the lender's stock.

CLSA on October 5 added HDFC Bank to its focus portfolio on the back of significant cool-off in relative valuations to peers. With this, CLSA has further raised its overweight stance on banks, investment analyst Vikash Kumar Jain said in a note.

CLSA's India focus portfolio now constitutes: Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, Axis Bank, Sun Pharma, ONGC, SBI Life Insurance, IndusInd Bank, Hindalco, BPCL and GAIL.

Ironically, CLSA's bullish stance on HDFC Bank comes weeks after several other foreign broking firms cut their target price for the stock because of prolonged merger pain.

Analysts expects HDFC Bank to experience a near-term decline in net interest margin (NIM), net worth, and asset quality after merging with parent company Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) due to excess liquidity. The stock has fallen 11.18 percent in the past three months.

CLSA's view on India

Under the macro set-up of a prolonged hawkish rate pause with no imminent growth slowdown, CLSA is now more overweight on banks along with energy and industrials, while IT and consumption remain its key underweights.

Jain noted that Nifty was the fourth best performing market in the world during the quarter ending September 2023, outperforming the MSCI EM and MSCI AxJ benchmarks.

Also Read: Foreign investors continue to reduce stake in HDFC Bank; can stock's weight double on MSCI?

The Nifty's consensus FY24 earnings per share was cut by 0.7 percent but FY25 saw an upgrade of 0.9 percent during the quarter. ""India is expected to deliver the highest two-year EPS growth among the top 19 equity markets in the world with a 17 percent CAGR over FY23-25,"" as per the broking firm.

The Nifty's 12-month forward PE cooled off from 18.8x at the start of the quarter to 18.5x, though it is still at a 16.5 percent premium to its historical average.

The difference between India's 10-year bond yield and 12-month forward consensus earnings yield remained largely unchanged at 1.8 percentage points.

""It is still below the danger zone of 2. Equity valuations versus debt are much more extended in the US, France and the UK, and in EMs such as Thailand and South Africa,"" Jain said.

""Our (CLSA) portfolio has outperformed the Nifty in all 11 quarters since inception in Jan 2021 and delivered a total return of 129 percent - outperforming the Nifty by 83.6 ppts in less than three years,"" the firm said.

Shares of HDFC Bank Ltd gained for the second session after falling over 9 percent in the last three weeks. The stock was under pressure recently amid continuous selling by foreign investors and expectations of a near-term decline in net interest margin (NIM), net worth, and asset quality after merging with parent company Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC).

On Wednesday, the stock closed over 1 percent higher while on Thursday at 9.30am, the stock was trading at Rs 1540 on BSE, up 0.6 percent from its previous close.

Meanwhile after this correction analysts consider it to be trading at attractive valuations and believe it offers a favorable risk-reward for long-term investors.

Read: Foreign investors continue to reduce stake in HDFC Bank; can stock's weight double on MSCI?

In a recent investor call HDFC Bank's CFO, Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, noted a potential 25 basis point NIM contraction due to increased CRR and excess liquidity post-merger. This could result in lower earnings for the bank in the second quarter, with the merged entity's margin estimated at 3.7-3.8% in June 2023, down from the bank's previous standalone margin of 4.1%. Analysts, including Macquarie, suggest this may affect the bank's near-term return on assets (RoA).

The shareholding of foreign investors slipped nearly 130 basis points to 59 percent during the September quarter. This has increased the FII investment legroom in the stock to 20.3 percent of the available limit of 74 percent. A note by Nuvama Alternative said if the FII investment legroom in HDFC Bank increases to 25 percent, the stock's weighting in the MSCI Indices could be doubled. The move could lead to significant inflows from passive trackers.

Bears turned more strong with the Nifty50 breaking below 19,500 on October 4. Hence, below the same, the index can extend downward journey towards August low which comes to around 19,200, but in case, given formation of Doji kind of candlestick pattern at the downtrend, the rebound can be a possibility and if the index sustains above 19,500 then 19,700-19,800 can be key resistance area, experts said.

The Nifty50 fell 93 points to 19,436, and the BSE Sensex dropped 286 points to 65,226, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices plummeted more than 1 percent each on negative breadth.

Among sectors, Bank Nifty also remained under pressure, falling 435 points to 43,964, while the Nifty IT index was the outperformer, rising 94 points to 31,812.

Stocks that traded higher and outperformed benchmark as well as broader markets included Avenue Supermarts, Hindustan Unilever, and HDFC Bank. Avenue Supermarts has seen a breakout of downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of June 19 and September 14 this year, and has formed strong bullish candlestick patttern on the daily timeframe with robust volumes. The stock climbed 4 percent to Rs 3,873.

Hindustan Unilever seems to have bottomed out in September after the correction from its July high. The stock rose 1.6 percent to Rs 2,508 and formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with making higher highs, higher lows formation for second consecutive session.

HDFC Bank has formed Bullish Engulfing pattern on the daily charts, at the downtrend, which is a bullish reversal pattern. The stock gained 1.4 percent at Rs 1,529.55, with above average volumes, but the stock still traded below all key moving averages.

Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Avenue Supermarts

Since the last two trading sessions, DMart has started to gain momentum after consolidating between Rs 3,600 and Rs 3,700. In the previous trading session, it took out its previous swing high of Rs 3,850.

From the indicator front, daily DMIs (directional movement index) have given a positive cross along with RSI (relative strength index) reversing from 40 levels, thus hinting towards a further bullish stance in the counter.

One can buy between Rs 3,825 and Rs 3,850; the upside target is expected near Rs 4,100, and the stop-loss would be Rs 3,700 on a daily close basis.

Hindustan Unilever

After making the high of Rs 2,769 in July 2023, it has been making lower tops and lower lows, which resulted in a 11.73 percent cut in price. At the current juncture, the said counter has halted near its support of Rs 2,440–2,450 since the last 12 trading sessions.

Also, there is bullish divergence spotted near the support zone (refer to the chart). A decisive close above Rs 2,500 will lead to fresh long entries, so one can buy only above Rs 2,500 for a target of Rs 2,650 with a stop-loss of Rs 2,425 on a daily close basis.

HDFC Bank

After making the high of Rs 1,670 on September 15, 2023, it has been making lower tops and lower lows, which resulted in a 11 percent cut in price. At the current juncture, the said counter has halted near its support of Rs 1,485–1,500.

Additionally, in the previous session, it made a Bullish Piercing candlestick pattern (possibly can become Bullish Engulfing) near the support zone, followed by bullish divergence near the support zone (refer to the chart), which is looking lucrative.

So, one can buy only above in the range of Rs 1,510–1,530 for a target of Rs 1,600 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,450 on a daily close basis.

By Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities

The Nifty exhibited volatility throughout the day but managed to recover from the lowest point of the day before closing. The overall market trend remains bearish, with the Nifty trading below critical moving averages.

Looking ahead, the market may continue to follow a bearish trend as long as it remains below 19,500, with initial support likely around 19,330, a fall below the said level might take the Nifty towards 19,250-19,200.

The bears in the Bank Nifty maintained their control, causing the index to break below the support at 44,200. The next immediate support level is positioned at 43,800, and a breach below this level could trigger aggressive selling pressure, potentially leading to a further 2 percent correction in the index.

On the upside, the immediate resistance is in the range of 44,250 to 44,300. A breakout above this range may incite some short-covering moves in the index.

Here are three buy calls for short term:

Suzlon Energy: Buy | LTP: Rs 28.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 27 | Target: Rs 30-32 | Return: 14 percent

Suzlon has experienced upward momentum over the past two days after breaking out of a consolidation phase. Additionally, the stock has remained above a crucial moving average.

The relative strength index (RSI) is currently showing a bullish crossover and is on the rise. The support is established at Rs 27 on the lower end, while resistance is observed in the range of Rs 30 to Rs 32 on the higher end.

Tata Consultancy Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,538 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,430 | Target: Rs 3,800 | Return: 7 percent

TCS exhibited a bullish sentiment as it formed a Bullish Engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily chart, signaling a bullish reversal. Furthermore, the stock managed to close above its 20-day moving average (20DMA), confirming its bullish undertone.

The momentum indicator RSI is poised for a positive crossover, further affirming the presence of strong momentum. The support for TCS is currently at Rs 3,430, with potential upside levels at Rs 3,640 and Rs 3,800.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,529.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,485 | Target: Rs 1,650 | Return: 8 percent

HDFC Bank has shown a strong upward movement, rebounding from the day's low. Multiple swing highs and lows can be observed around Rs 1,515, suggesting that this level is likely to provide support for the stock price.

Additionally, a positive divergence is evident on the daily chart. In the short term, it is anticipated that the stock will advance towards Rs 1,650. On the downside, the support is positioned at Rs 1,485.

Foreign institutional investors currently hold 59 percent stake in HDFC Bank, leaving a headroom of about 20 percent, said Nuvama Institutional Equities after analysing the bank's September quarter shareholding pattern. However, there is still some way to go before the stock's weight can double on MSCI index.

The headroom is up from 18.3 percent in June 2023, when FIIs held 60.3 percent, it added. 'Foreign room' is essentially the proportion of shares still available to foreign investors relative to the maximum allowed. The foreign investment limit in privately held banks is at 74 percent currently.

The higher the headroom or lesser the foreign holding, the greater the chance of increased weightage in MSCI.

According to the current MSCI methodology, a stock's weight can double if the foreign headroom exceeds 25 percent.

""Thus, more selling by FIIs is needed in the next few quarters before MSCI incorporates the merged (HDFC + HDFC Bank) shares with a factor of 1, compared to the 0.5 currently used,"" said Abhilash Pagaria of Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

The country's biggest private lender HDFC Bank had replaced Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC) Ltd, on the MSCI Global Standard indices on July 13, following the merger of the two companies.

While weightage increase in MSCI will be keenly monitored going ahead, FTSE has already announced an increase in weight in three tranches. ""The first tranche has occurred, and the next two rebalances are set for December 2023 and March 2024, bringing in around $500 million each time,"" Pagaria said.

Meanwhile, foreign broking firms believe that merger pain will last a while for HDFC Bank. In September, Nomura downgraded its rating on HDFC Bank to Neutral because the combined entity's book value is now lower than HDFC Bank's standalone book value.

""Downward adjustment to the incoming net worth of HDFC Ltd (largely due to IGAAP accounting and provisioning harmonization) amounts to a book value per share cut of Rs 23 per share for the merged entity,"" said analysts at Nomura.

The broking firm further said that net interest margins (NIM) could see pressure over the next two to three quarters, mainly on account of excess liquidity being carried post-merger.

On the back of this, Nomura has cut its net NIM estimates by 25 basis points in FY24 and 15-20 bps in FY25-26F. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

As per Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for September, more than half of the companies (six out of 10) which shared the maximum optimism with analysts belonged to the BFSI sector.

The long-term growth for banks, said analysts, look good, while peaked out net interest margin (NIM) and higher operating expenditures are expected to curtail profit after tax (PAT) growth in fiscal year 2023-24 (FY24).

“We retain 100 basis points (bps) ‘overweight call on banks, owing to strong credit growth and improving asset quality,” analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher said.

Meanwhile, those at ICICI Securities asserted that SBI was in a sweet spot due to a comfortable asset quality picture, strong visibility of over 15 percent return of equity (RoE), and credit growth.

“We expect SBI’s credit growth to remain healthy at 13-14 percent YoY; deposit growth to be a shade lower and thus a boost to the credit deposit ratio. We maintain a ‘buy’ call on the counter, with an unchanged target price of Rs 730 apiece, valuing the stock at ~1.3x FY25E core banking book and ~Rs 200 per share of subs,” the brokerage firm added.

The provisional figures by banks for the July-September (Q2FY24) quarter reported so far further lend support to analysts’ positive sentiments.

In the case of IndusInd Bank’s Q2 business update, loan growth increased to 4.5 percent sequentially, while deposits witnessed a moderate growth of 3.7 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). This, thereby, resulted in a rise in the credit-to-deposit ratio to 87.5 percent.

India’s largest private sector lender – HDFC Bank, too, reported a 30 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in deposits, as part of its Q2 business update.

At the bourses, shares of SBI, Axis Bank, and IndusInd Bank have gained in the range of 1-5 percent in a month, whereas ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank have dropped by up to 4 percent during the same period.

Capex-driven stocks paint to a bright picture

That apart, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) saw 37 ‘buy’ calls, two ‘sell’ calls and one ‘hold.’

The company emerged as the only bet that investors picked to play in the construction sector amid the government’s strong thrust to infrastructure development and pick-up in private sector capex.

“L&T is well-placed to benefit in the long run given the uptick in domestic private capex, strong tender prospects, better order conversion in domestic markets, significant traction in hydrocarbons, and renewable energy orders from international markets like Saudi Arabia,” wrote analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher in a recent note.

Similarly, mining major Hindalco and power-focused NTPC shared common ‘buy’ calls of 24. The two counters are India’s largest plays in their respective fields.

For Hindalco, analysts were upbeat on the company’s hopes of easing cost of production which would lend sheen to the upcoming quarter.

On the other hand, for NTPC, the company’s aggressive expansion to renewable and hydrogen businesses made it a palpable bet among analysts.

HDFC Bank's stock will remain in focus on October 4 as the bank restructures its top management post a merger with HDFC Ltd in July. This is the second reorganization since Sashidhar Jagdishan took over as managing director and chief executive officer in October 2020, succeeding Aditya Puri.

The bank communicated the changes in a memo to employees on October 1, as per reports. Information technology and digital functions, led by Ramesh Lakshminarayanan, now report directly to CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan as the bank emphasizes on technology for expanded services. Ashish Parthasarthy, a veteran of the bank, will oversee the crucial retail branch business, including deposits and product distribution.

Parthasarthy is restructuring the retail branch business geographically for better expansion and product management. Smita Bhagat and Sampath Kumar will co-lead this effort. Bhagat, a senior leader at the bank, handled government, institutional, ecosystem, inclusive banking, and start-ups. Kumar managed liability products, third-party products, and non-resident business, CNBCTV18 reported.

""This may aim to enhance execution to (1) drive growth in mortgages, where Mr. Arvind Kapil will get exclusive charge and (2) optimise branch ramp-up where responsibilities will be split geographically.

The brokerage house stayed its buy rating on the stock and increased its target price to Rs 2030 a share, up 33 percent from current market price.

HDFC Bank's stock has declined by over 9 percent in the past three weeks following the takeover of HDFC Ltd. However, analysts consider it to be trading at attractive valuations (2.1x Mar’25E ABV and ~13x EPS) and believe it offers a favorable risk-reward for long-term investors. They anticipate that as growth and earnings gradually recover, the stock's performance will improve.

Meanwhile, post merger, analysts expects HDFC Bank to experience a near-term decline in net interest margin (NIM), net worth, and asset quality after merging with parent company HDFC. HDFC Bank's CFO Srinivasan Vaidyanathan noted a potential 25 basis point NIM contraction due to increased CRR and excess liquidity post-merger.

This could result in lower earnings for the bank in the second quarter, with the merged entity's margin estimated at 3.7-3.8 percent in June, down from the bank's previous standalone margin of 4.1 percent. Analysts, including Macquarie, suggest this may affect the bank's near-term return on assets (RoA).

HDFC Bank's share price has fallen more than six percent in the last three sessions since the company’s analyst meet to share the details of the HDFC merger, due to near-term concerns on asset quality, excess liquidity, and net worth. While brokerages largely remain bullish and have favorable calls on HDFC Bank stock, they advise caution in the near term, with some even cutting the target price.

Brokerages highlighted a decline in HDFC Bank's standalone book value due to accounting changes and near-term pressure on net interest margins on the back of a hike in incremental cash reserve ratio to tackle excess liquidity and elevated competition as overhangs for the lenders. On September 22, HDFC Bank stock ended at Rs 1,530, down 1.5 percent from the previous close.

Why brokerages feel near-term pressure on HDFC Bank stock

Asset Quality and Earnings Impact:

Brokerage firms note a potential impact on asset quality metrics, including an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs) from ex-HDFC's real estate portfolio. Earnings estimates and Net Interest Margins (NIMs) are expected to be affected by factors, such as Interest on Cash Reserve Ratio (ICRR) and excess liquidity.

Impact of Merger on Net Worth and Book Value Per Share:

The merger with HDFC is anticipated to result in changes to net worth, with one-time adjustments noted by multiple firms. However, these adjustments are often described as timing differences or transitional. While there may be some weakening of Book Value Per Share (BVPS), most of it is considered non-cash and transitional in nature.

HDFC Bank stock call: Brokerages mostly bullish; check target prices

Kotak Institutional Equities has cut its target on HDFC Bank stock to Rs 1,850 from 1,925 earlier. ""There is a reduction in net worth to account for policy, accounting alignments, and dividend payout. The NPL in the parent entity is higher than expected but further negative surprises should be negligible. Re-rating is some time away as the bank has to work through the net interest margin (NIM) transition and build its thesis of differentiation, which we are still less certain about,"" said Kotak.

""Normal RoA for the merged entity is expected to remain between 1.9-2.0 percent. Marginal worsening of headline asset quality metrics. Expect depressed earnings in the next few quarters due to one-off factors. Re-rating could take a few quarters longer than expected.""

Citigroup has a ‘buy’ rating on HDFC Bank, but the brokerage cut the target price from Rs 2,200 to Rs 2,160 per share in a recent report. “HDFC Bank is paying more attention to making loans for affordable houses and infrastructure projects. They want to have 13,000-14,000 branches in the next 4-5 years. But how well they do each quarter might change, depending on finding good places for branches, signing leases, and hiring staff.”

Goldman Sachs has a ""Buy"" rating on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 2,051 per share. The bank recently decided to gradually withdraw I-CRR, which could have an impact of about Rs 400 crore. However, the bank's market value has dropped by a significant Rs 29,000 crore since the announcement. Now that the uncertainty appears to have waned, the brokerage firm continues to remain positive on HDFC Bank. The firm expects the bank will have the best earnings growth in its sector -- around 17 percent through FY 23-26.

UBS has a 'buy' rating on HDFC Bank stock with a target price of Rs 1,900 per share. The report added: ""Clarity on the merged balance sheet is going to be the key driver for the bank. Q1 net interest margin (NIM) is going to be impacted By ICRR And excess liquidity.""

Jefferies has a 'buy' rating on HDFC Bank stock with a target price of Rs 2,030 per share. ""Impact on net interest margins (NIMs) will be a tad higher than expected due to higher liquidity.""

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB at its analyst meet clarified certain aspects relating to merged financials. While transition to IRAC, credit policy harmonization and creation of DTL reserve would impact BVPS by 5%, gains emanating from stake sale of Credila could cushion capital by 1.2%. Creation of excess liquidity could affect Q2’24 NIM, although margins should bounce back in H2FY24E as credit growth picks up and liquidity is utilized. FY24 NIM could contract YoY from 3.8% to 3.6%, however, as higher cost liabilities of HDFCL are replaced, NIM could enhance over FY24-26E from 3.6% to 3.8%. Merged loans/deposits as at Q1’24 were Rs22.2/20.6trn suggesting a 13%/16% YoY growth. While core earnings growth would be muted for FY24E (5.2% YoY) as NIM and loan growth normalize, core PAT may witness a 19.4% CAGR over FY24-26E.

Outlook

Basis core RoA at 1.75% for FY26E (ICICIB 1.94%) we tweak multiple from 3.0x to 2.8x but roll forward to core Sep’25 ABV. Retain BUY with TP at Rs2,025.

HDFC Bank's book value has taken a hit due to its merger with HDFC Ltd, which has caused brokerages to downgrade their rating and cut target prices, but the stock will re-rate in next 12-18 months, said Nitin Aggarwal of Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Aggarwal said that one cannot question the investment thesis for the stock in the long term as there is visibility for the merged entity to achieve 2 percent Return on Assets (ROA) by FY26. ""There will be gradual improvement in earnings. The liquidity (from HDFC Ltd) is a big monitorable over the coming quarters and can help the business grow,"" he said, adding that HDFC group has sustained on- track execution to deliver returns.

The current multiple of 2.6 times price-to-book value for the bank remains attractive for Aggarwal. However, with the merger being implemented and the entity becoming extremely large, execution remains critical, he said.

Aggarwal highlighted that deposit growth will be the first key metric that investors will be watching out for. This is because the bank experienced a very strong run in Q1, while Q1 was slightly softer. “Going forward, the competition will remain tight, but the performance of the bank on deposits and thereafter even the advances shall be looked at, to evaluate the growth of the merged entity along with the margins” he said.

For the next one quarter, Aggarwal would prefer to wait out and take a breather from the HDFC Bank owing to the excess liquidity built up post merger. The deployment of this liquidity is yet to be seen, said Aggarwal.

On September 21, the benchmark indices extended downtrend for the third consecutive session, with back-to-back gap down moves. The Nifty50 dropped 159 points to 19,742, and the BSE Sensex tanked 571 points to 66,230, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices were down 0.9 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively on weak breadth.

Stocks that fared better than broader markets and equity benchmarks included HDFC Bank, L&T Technology Services, and HPCL. HDFC Bank has formed a Doji or High Wave kind of pattern on the daily timeframe, after significant correction in the previous two sessions, which could possibly indicate oversold levels.

L&T Technology Services rose 1.1 percent to Rs 4,660 and formed decent bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with above average volumes, after weakness in the previous three sessions. The stock still holds the low of September 13, coinciding with the 20-day EMA (exponential moving average), which may act as a support.

HPCL has formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe, with above average volumes, continuing an uptrend for three days in a row, but still within the robust bearish candlestick pattern formed on September 12. The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) showed bullish crossover with above 50 levels. The stock rose 2.2 percent to Rs 263.5.

Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today.

HDFC Bank

On the daily scale, the stock had been in a downtrend. Therefore, it is currently into an oversold territory and available near its demand area. The texture of the chart formation on daily and weekly time frame along with technical indicator RSI (relative strength index) is indicating at pullback rally, which could lead to a new leg of the uptrend from its demand zone.

In the near term, Rs 1,500 would be the immediate support zone for the stock. Above the same, the upward rally could continue towards Rs 1,670 levels.

Hindustan Petroleum Corporation

After sharp decline from the higher levels, the counter is in the accumulation zone where it was trading in a rectangle formation. However, on the daily charts there is a gradual up move in the counter along with incremental volume activity, which suggest a new leg of bullish trend in the near term.

Unless it is trading below Rs 250 positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 280.

L&T Technology Services

The stock has shown a remarkable up move in the last few weeks. The stock is trading in a rising trend continuously and forming the higher lows series. The strong bullish momentum on daily and weekly scale suggest that the counter is likely to maintain bullish continuation chart formation in the coming horizon.

As long as the counter is trading above Rs 4,480 the bullish formation is likely to continue. Above which, the counter could move up to Rs 4,980.

Foreign broking firm Nomura has downgraded its rating on HDFC Bank to Neutral after the country's largest private-sector bank held an analyst call to share particulars of the merged entity. Due to accounting adjustments, the combined entity's book value will be lower than HDFC Bank's standalone book value and that has led to several brokerages cutting their targets on the stock.

Book value is essentially the value of a company's total assets minus its total liabilities. At 9:30 am, HDFC Bank stock was quoting at Rs 1,578.05, down 3.13 percent from previous close.

""Downward adjustment to the incoming net worth of HDFC Ltd (largely due to IGAAP accounting and provisioning harmonization) amounts to a book value per share cut of Rs 23 per share for the merged entity,"" said analysts at Nomura.

They have cut target price for HDFC Bank to Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,920 earlier. The current target price indicates 10 percent upside from HDFC Bank's closing price on September 18.

The broking firm further said that net interest margins (NIM) could see pressure over the next two to three quarters as HDFC Ltd's Q2FY24 opening book NIMs are at 2 percent versus 2.7 percent in Q1. This is mainly on account of excess liquidity being carried post-merger.

On back of this, Nomura has cut its net NIM estimates by 25 basis points in FY24 and 15-20 bps in FY25-26F. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. It has also bumped up a cost-to-income estimate to 40 percent in FY24F versus 36 percent previously.

""Our FY24F earnings per share has been cut 9 percent, with ~5 percent cuts in FY25-26F. Our FY24 return on assets estimate is now at 1.7 percent versus 1.9 percent earlier, gradually improving to 1.8 percent in FY25-26F,"" Nomura said.

It noted that the entity's non-individual NPA (non performing assets) have been reset to 6.7 percent in June from 3.7 percent in March.

Stocks of public sector banks (PSBs) have emerged as the champions of the Indian banking sector in the last one year, leaving private sector counterparts trailing behind and drawing further optimistic forecasts. Analysts are now eyeing continued growth in PSU banks, likely to be propelled by consolidation efforts, credit growth and improving asset quality.

Over the past one year, shares of PSBs such as UCO Bank and Punjab & Sind Bank have given astonishing returns of over 187 percent and 148 percent, respectively. Bank of Maharashtra and Central Bank of India have also gained significantly, rising 126.12 percent and 92.72 percent, respectively.

Amid turbulent market conditions marked by high interest rates and inflation, the Nifty PSU Bank Index tracking the performance of PSBs has surged by a noteworthy 52 percent over the past year. This is far higher than the Nifty Bank Index’ 12 percent gain in the same period.

For the week (September 8-15), Nifty PSU Bank index rose 7.2 percent, while Nifty Private Bank index up nearly 2 percent.

PSB stocks cheer, private bank stocks face challenges

The rebound in the PSB stocks is in stark contrast to the mixed performance in private sector banks. While HDFC Bank posted a respectable 9.28 percent return over the past year, it remained relatively modest compared to PSB counterparts. Kotak Mahindra Bank grappled with challenges, registering a return of -5.93 percent. However, ICICI Bank maintained stability with a return of 7.15 percent. Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank displayed more robust performances, with returns of 23.58 percent and 27.28 percent, respectively.

However, while analysts remain bullish on the banking sector, the implementation of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) guidelines is expected to play a pivotal role, with assessments suggesting a potential impact ranging from 1 to 2.5 percent of loans for PSBs, according to Morgan Stanley.

This has led a few brokerages to become more selective with state-run banks, with Punjab National Bank (PNB) being downgraded to ""underweight"". In contrast, BOB, Bank of India (BOI) and SBI are viewed favorably due to their stronger balance sheets.

Brokerage views on PSBs

Morgan Stanley on SBI, PNB and BOB

Analysts at Morgan Stanley have given SBI an ""equal-weight"" rating with a target price of Rs 670 per share. They highlight SBI's strong performance in the retail and small and medium enterprises (SME) segments. However, domestic loan growth has slowed a bit, leading the bank to focus more on its overseas loan book. SBI has also reiterated its guidance of 12-14 percent loan growth for FY24. The brokerage notes that SBI's management expects some margin moderation as funding costs catch up.

However, in a note, the analysts explained their rationale for being cautious, stating, ""We get more selective on SoE (state-owned enterprise) banks after strong performance over the past month and likely peaking of rates: Banks that face greater impact from ECL norms are likely to see a delay in the re-rating cycle, even as earnings estimate upgrades are set to continue,""

Morgan Stanley on the other hand downgraded PNB from ""equal weight"" to ""underweight"" in a recent report citing a relatively higher potential impact from ECL provisioning. The note mentioned lower coverage ratios, higher gross and net non-performing loans formation and historical credit costs as contributing factors. Comparatively, Bank of India (BOI) and Bank of Baroda (BOB) have better capital and coverage, providing some relative comfort.

BOB received a favorable mention, with the brokerage firm noting its good capital and coverage, as well as a better asset quality track record compared to other banks.

Brokerage Views on private sector banks

Brokerage firm Mirae Asset Securities in a sectoral report on banks released on September 7 stated, “FY24 starts on a good note with healthy earnings performance, albeit minor hiccups in net interest margins (NIM). Overviewing the performance of 10 private banks (from Nifty Private Bank Index) and 12 PSU banks (Nifty PSU Index) for 1QFY24, earnings performance was largely on-track.”

The report added, “The PSU Bank Index continues to outperform (~54 percent) compared to Private Bank Index (14 percent) over the past one year. PSB valuation discount with private banks remains in the range of 60-70 percent. If current earnings trend sustains throughout FY24 along with conducive macro indicators supporting narrowing of the ROA (return on assets) gap, we believe ~50 percent valuation gap is possible for PSBs. We believe for private banks steady performance will ascertain further upside.”

Goldman Sachs on HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank

Goldman Sachs assigned HDFC Bank a ""buy"" rating with a target price of Rs 2,051 per share in a recent report. It discussed the recent decision to withdraw incremental cash reserve ratio (ICRR) in a phased manner, estimating an impact of $48 million or Rs 400 crore. Despite this, however, they note that the bank has lost a significant market capitalization of $3.5 billion or Rs 29,000 crore since the announcement. Goldman Sachs remains positive, as it believes the core thesis remains intact and forecast sector-leading earnings growth of 17 percent in FY23-26.

Top 5 Private Banks Brokerage Estimates

Kotak Mahindra Bank is rated ""equal-weight"" by Morgan Stanley, with a target price of Rs 2,250 per share. The report mentions healthy loan demand in the retail and SME segments, improved margins in FY23 (peaking in Q4FY23), and benign asset quality. Operating costs remain elevated due to higher growth momentum and tech investments.

Morgan Stanley on ICICI Bank

ICICI Bank receives an ""overweight"" rating from Morgan Stanley with a target price of Rs 1,350 per share. The bank's strong loan growth and competitive intensity are noted. Management has reiterated its guidance of maintaining FY24 margins at levels similar to FY23. Over the medium term, the bank expects operating leverage to come into play.

Jefferies on Axis Bank

Axis Bank is given a ""buy"" rating by Jefferies with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share, citing the management's confidence in achieving a sustainable 18 percent return on equity. It also emphasises the bank's focus on improving its funding profile to reduce volatility. Margin stability and attractive valuations make Axis Bank its top pick.

Insurance houses bought Bajaj Finance shares worth Rs 321 crore in the month of August, according to Nuvama Alternative Research, and trimmed stake worth Rs 479 crore in HDFC Bank.

However, HDFC Bank continues to be the top large-cap holding in the portfolios of most insurance houses.

India's life insurance industry, excluding LIC of India, has an aggregate equity AUM (assets under management) of nearly Rs 4.2 lakh crore. According to data compiled by Nuvama's Insurance Portfolio Analyser, the top five players - ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance, HDFC Life Insurance, Tata AIA Life Insurance and Kotak Life Insurance - represent almost 80 percent of this AUM.

In the month gone by, notable additions by these insurance houses included Bajaj Finance, Interglobe Aviation worth Rs 299 crore, Union Bank worth Rs 235 crore and Star Health also worth Rs 235 crore.

Meanwhile, significant reductions were Jio Financial Services worth Rs 558 crore, HDFC Bank worth Rs 479 crore, Mahindra & Mahindra worth Rs 352 crore and Infosys worth Rs 326 crore.

Despite the trimming of stake in M&M, all insurance houses are overweight on the auto sector. On the Nifty 100, the auto sector has weightage of 4.9 percent while in insurance portfolios it is over 6.5 percent.

All the five houses are also overweight on capital goods and pharma & healthcare. On the Nifty 100, capital goods has a weightage of 4.7 percent while insurance portfolios have more than 6 percent. Similarly, pharma has a weightage of 3.4 percent in Nifty 100, while insurance houses have over 3.7 percent.

Surprisingly, except HDFC Life, all other insurance houses are underweight on financial services sector - the darling on investors and analysts.

New additions and exits

As per Nuvama, ICICI Pru Life added K.P.R. Mill, Union Bank and Tata Communications, with no complete exits in the portfolio. HDFC Life included Sun TV and Union Bank as new entrants, while it exited Sundaram Fasteners.

Utkarsh Small Finance Bank and Engineers India were fresh entrants for SBI Life, while Aarti Industries and Can Fin Homes were complete exits. ""They report holdings with a lag of a month, so the data is for July 2023,"" noted Nuvama.

Tata AIA Life introduced Union Bank and K.P.R. Mill to its portfolio, while Canara Bank and Muthoot Finance were complete exits. Kotak Life Insurance freshly added Interglobe Aviation and Natco Pharma, while Navin Fluorine and Balkrishna Industries were chucked out.

Inclusion or increase in weightage of a stock in global indices leads to inflows from passive funds which track that particular index. Conversely, exclusion from FTSE, MSCI and other global indices usually leads to outflows.

IIFL Alternative Research further said that AIA Engineering will see inflows of $30 million and Syngene of $20 million due to their inclusion in the FTSE All World Index.

Stocks set to be included in FTSE All Cap Index include RVNL, NMDC Steel, Data Patterns, Ramkrishna Forgings, Tamilnad Mercantile Bank, Apar Industries and Mazagon Dock.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on HDFC Bank

We expect HDFCB to post moderate growth in the near term, as HDFCL’s loan book decelerates (mainly corporate), while near-term core margins (3.7-3.8% on merged basis vs. standalone 4.1%) contract by 10-15bps due to ICRR+excess liquidity impact. However, growth should accelerate (15% CAGR over FY24-26E), as mortgage engine fires up from the bank’s platform, which along with the gradual replacement of HDFCL’s high-cost borrowings (80-85% to be replaced via retail deposits), as they mature, should lead to margin normalization. We have cut our earnings/BV est. by ~4%/5-6% to reflect the nearterm margin softness, higher opex due to investments in the phygital network, and mergerrelated adjustments. Thus, we revise our TP to Rs2,100 (valuing the core bank at 2.8x its Sep-25E ABV+subs/inv. value at Rs185) from Rs2,150. However, retain BUY, as we believe the merger drag should ease soon, which along with improvement in the bank’s RoA/RoE back to ~2%/16-17% over FY25-26E, benefiting from the merger’s synergies, should be positive. Further, given KMB undergoing mgmt. transition (typically leading to business/valuation softness as seen in HDFCB), HDFCB with stable mgmt., better return profile and valuation (2x vs. 2.1x for KMB) offers a good bet from a medium-long term view. The long-awaited listing of HDB Fin should be another stock catalyst going ahead.

Outlook

We have cut our earnings/ABV est. by ~4%/5-6% to reflect near-term margin softness, higher opex due to investments in the phygital network, and merger-related adjustments. However, we expect the bank’s RoA/RoE to improve from 1.9%/15.6% in FY24E (merged) to ~2%/17% by FY26E, benefiting from better growth/margins and fees, as merger synergies kick in. We retain BUY with a revised TP of Rs2,100 (valuing the core bank at 2.8x Sep-25E ABV + subs/inv. value at Rs185/share).

2023-09-04 06:06:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/uday-kotak-ends-one-brilliant-chapter-at-the-bank-despite-run-ins-with-the-regulator-11300971.html,"Uday Kotak's run-in with the regulator may not be over yet.

Uday Kotak resigns as managing director and chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank after a scintillating two decades. In these 20 years, he has built a solid franchise with a deposit base of nearly Rs 4 lakh crore, making Kotak the eleventh largest lender in the country in terms of deposit size and fourth-largest among private banks.

Kotak's achievements are, of course, not confined to banking. Starting with bill discounting from 1985, he has built a clutch of financial institutions including a mutual fund, a life insurance, a general insurance company, a couple of NBFCs and a securities company.

The banking licence was awarded to Uday Kotak in 2003 and, for a while, the bank grew largely by providing support to its investment banking and securities companies. The lender took a leap in size and reach when it acquired ING Vysya Bank in 2014.

To Kotak's credit, his has been a near flawless record in terms of quality of the bank's asset book. Even at the height of the asset quality crises that roiled the banking sector in the middle of the last decade, when even large private lenders like ICICI Bank and Axis Bank grappled with soaring non-performing assets (NPA), Kotak Bank, like HDFC Bank, remained largely unscathed.

Not surprising, while it may rank eleventh in deposit size, it features within the top three or four in terms of market cap, thanks to high returns to shareholders. That indeed may also be Uday Kotak's weakness. Probably because of his large shareholding in the bank, he remained a very cautious banker, growing his book by no more than 15-16 percent a year. In contrast, HDFC Bank grew by nearly 25 percent in the 2000s and averaged a growth rate of 20-21 percent in the 2010s. Although Kotak Bank is only eight years younger, HDFC Bank is over five times larger in terms of the size of deposits and advances.

The slower pace of growth may be linked to Uday Kotak's large stake in the bank. In the early years, when he held close to 50 percent in it, Kotak employees were aware that in every loan, they were lending 50 percent of his money and only 50 percent of depositors' money. That made for a cautious DNA down the line.

Ironically, while Uday Kotak took very few risks with his lending, he did take regulatory risks. He has been the only banker to have taken the regulator, the Reserve Bank of India, to court on the issue of not bringing down his stake in the bank to 15 percent within the stipulated time. Eventually, the RBI too modified the rules to let promoters keep 26 percent in the banks they founded.

Uday Kotak's run-in with the regulator may not be over yet. The RBI issued guidelines in 2021, capping the term of an MD and CEO of a bank at 15 years after which he will have to take a three-year cooling-off.

""The post of the MD and CEO or WTD cannot be held by the same incumbent for more than 15 years. Thereafter, the individual will be eligible for re-appointment as the MD and CEO or WTD in the same bank, if considered necessary and desirable by the board, after a minimum gap of three years, subject to meeting other conditions. During this three-year cooling-off, the individual shall not be appointed or associated with the bank or its group entities in any capacity, either directly or indirectly,"" the RBI said.

The guidelines are no doubt informed by sound principles of protecting financial stability. The RBI would want to ensure that no untoward actions are undertaken by any individual who leads a bank for a long period. After all, it is the depositors' money at stake. For every Rs 100 loan given by a bank, nearly Rs 90 is depositors' money. The regulator would also not want a large institution to be too dependent on one person.

Despite the guidelines stating that an individual who has been MD for 15 years, should not be associated with bank directly or indirectly for the next three years, Kotak has been selected by the bank's board as a non-executive director. While the RBI has not reacted to this appointment, it remains to be seen if it would want to see the next MD as an outsider who would be less influenced by his presence in the board.

It is important not to treat this resignation as Kotak hangs his boots. Technically, he can even return as the MD after three years, unless the RBI objects, saying he didn't take the three-year cooling.

Even as the non-executive director, he remains an important voice of the banking sector and indeed of the financial sector, whom the government will, no doubt, reach out to in case of crises like IL&FS. The resignation as the Kotak Mahindra Bank MD and CEO only ends one chapter in Kotak's innings. As the famous Hindi movie line goes: Picture abhi baaki hai.",843,-0.16800014972686766

The fundraising underscores an increased appetite for credit in India as real estate firms launch projects to meet demand from customers reviewing their home purchase decisions after the pandemic.

HDFC’s funds typically commit debt to low and mid-income housing projects across the top six metropolitan regions in India, the people said. HDFC Capital, a subsidiary of mortgage financier Housing Development Finance Corp. which merged with HDFC Bank in July, has committed about $3.5 billion to various projects so far, they said.

HDFC Capital declined to comment.

With Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) merging into HDFC Bank, about Rs 1.5 lakh crore of bank limit is now available for other non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) as well as housing financiers, said analysts.

According to the regulatory cap set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banks cannot have an exposure of over 20 percent of their Tier 1 capital in a single NBFC and over 25 percent in one NBFC group.

As at March 31, 2023, HDFC Ltd’s total borrowings stood at $69.14 billion. Of these, term loans from banks made for 23 percent, roughly amounting to $15.9 billion or Rs 1.5 lakh crore. “This exposure of HDFC Ltd to the financial system has moved out of the NBFC/HFC classification,” said analysts.

This does not necessarily mean that the cost of funds will come off, but the quantum of money an NBFC can raise from banks at the same cost is now much higher.

While the entire sector stands to benefit, foreign broking firm Nomura thinks this is a big positive for Bajaj Finance and its housing finance subsidiary Bajaj Housing Finance Ltd, from a ‘liability-garnering and finer-pricing perspective’.

“Bajaj Finance has a well-diversified liability franchise, which, coupled with its AAA rating, strong parentage, prudent asset-liability management, and robust track record, has led to declines in the gap of funding cost with large banks over the past few years,” Nomura analysts Ajit Kumar and Param Subramanian wrote in a note dated August 24.

A veteran banking analyst, who did not wish to be named, agrees. Funds will be easily available to NBFCs that have a proven ownership and track record, he said. “The reason why Indostar Finance may not get money from banks but a Jio Financial Services or a Cholamandalam Finance will is because of ownership,” he said.

“If something goes wrong, a bank needs somebody to catch hold of. Private equity is not considered a very reliable counterparty by banks. They look for solid promoters,” he said.

Currently, bank lines account for 30 percent of Bajaj Finance’s liability mix, 49 percent of Cholamandalam’s and 24 percent of Shriram Finance’s. Meanwhile, non-convertible debentures make up 15 percent of Cholamandalam’s liability mix, 17.7 percent of Shriram Finance and ~35 percent of Bajaj Finance.

According to Gagan Singla, managing director at BlinkX, an initiative by JM Financial, NBFC paper is also an area where demand is in excess of supply and that will be accentuated after the HDFC merger. Commercial papers account for 6-10 percent of borrowings by top NBFCs currently.

“Demand is likely to remain robust as NBFCs offer higher rates of interest for borrowings. Other NBFCs will now get in to fill that space. Both the client base's penetration levels for the home loan product and the degree of distribution leverage are relatively low,” Singla said.

This means subsidiaries like Shriram Housing Finance, Chola Home Loans and Sundaram Home Finance could go aggressively into lending, once their parents get more capital.

Furthermore, Mataprasad Pandey, vice president of Arete Capital Services, believes LIC Housing Finance will also be a major beneficiary in terms of market shares as well as increased borrowing limit as it is owned by LIC.

Outlook for NBFCs

Axis Capital anticipates that the impact of peaking interest rates will fully manifest in FY24, following which NBFCs’ net interest margins (NIMs) are expected to stabilise with a positive bias.

Over the course of the last 15 months, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has implemented rate hikes totalling approximately 250 basis points (bps). This has led to increased funding costs for NBFCs, although the complete impact is yet to be observed due to the lag in the repricing process.

While there are no major challenges on the asset quality side yet, analysts have started becoming wary of the rapid build-up in unsecured loan book which can become problematic, going ahead.

For the time being, most brokerages believe NBFCs’ valuations are comfortable as they increasingly focus on loan book diversification and development of granular businesses supported by digital capabilities.

Shares of HDFC Bank gained over 0.5 percent in early trade on August 28 to Rs 1,571 after Goldman Sachs kept the 'buy' rating on the stock and raised the target price by 33 percent to Rs 2,087 per share.

At 10:20am, the HDFC Bank stock was trading 0.49 percent higher at Rs 1,569 on the NSE.

The Goldman Sachs stock call on HDFC Bank comes amid the recent market challenges faced by the bank due to the implementation of the RBI's I-CRR (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process with Computation of Risk-Weighted Assets) framework. The bank recorded a a decline of $6.8 billion in its market capitalisation as a result.

The implementation of I-CRR brought attention to liquidity shortages and raised concerns about deposit accumulation and Return on Assets (RoA). However, Goldman Sachs believes that worries over tepid deposit growth might be overstated. HDFC Bank managed to accumulate retail deposits worth Rs 66,600 crore in the first quarter.

These deposits are seen as stable and driven by the bank's strong franchise. This development indicates a positive trajectory for the bank, aligning with Goldman Sachs' optimistic stance on the bank's performance.

HDFC Bank Ltd. wants to use home lending as a gateway for the world’s sixth largest lender to capture more consumer finance customers with loans on everything from air conditioners to cars and TVs.

The Mumbai-based bank is converting about 530 offices that previously specialized in mortgages into ones with fully-fledged banking services in the coming months, said Kaizad Bharucha. The HDFC Bank deputy managing director said his firm can now offer home loans at more than three times the locations following its merger with HDFC Ltd. and that’s just the start.

“When he takes a house, he takes a consumer finance loan, which means he’s taking a loan to buy his appliances,” Bharucha said in an interview. “He doesn’t have to go anywhere” else, Bharucha said.

It’s an opportune moment for HDFC Bank as demand from retail customers surges across India, the world’s most populous country. The nation’s banks and shadow lenders have been expanding into consumer finance as demand for loans from retail customers surged 22% over the past year. The intensifying competition has drawn the likes of Jio Financial Services Ltd., a unit of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd., that’s looking to get a slice of the action.

Bharucha added his bank also aims to boost loans for affordable housing and construction finance. The firm, that’s backed by Life Insurance Corp of India and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte., is making decisions on staffing and the technology needed for the ramp up, he said.

About 70% of the erstwhile mortgage lender’s customers did not bank with HDFC Bank and only 2% of the bank’s customers previously sourced their home loans from it, the firm has said.

HDFC’s gross nonperforming assets are among the lowest compared to its private-sector peers and stood at 1.13% as a ratio of customer assets at the end of June.

“We’ve always put guard rails and been selective,” Bharucha said. “There is a way to be prudent and grow — it is not one at the cost of the other. And that is what we’ve demonstrated over the years.”",360,-0.03969910740852356

HDFC Bank chief Sashidhar Jagdishan on Friday flagged funding as a risk for the lender after the successful USD 40 billion amalgamation with its parent.

""As you know, the risks of the merger is the funding part of it,” Jagdishan told shareholders of the largest private sector lender at its maiden annual general meeting after the merger came into effect from July 1. It can be noted that the bank has not been fully successful in getting all the forbearance it had sought from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the liabilities front.

The RBI refused to provide any exemptions on Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirements on the deposits that come from HDFC, which was a deposit-taking entity. Additionally, questions were raised about the likely impact on HDFC Bank with respect to the RBI’s move to put an incremental CRR of 10 per cent on deposit accretions in all the scheduled commercial banks after May. Jagdishan exuded confidence that the bank will be able to surmount the funding challenge, pointing out that the board, senior leadership and staff are cognizant of the work at hand. The Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director said the merger, and the timing, made sense because of the advantages that it offers, and added that the staff is ”excited” to take on the funding challenge. ”I think time will tell but we’re extremely confident at the way that we have grown over the last 10 years, there is no reason why we will not be able to surmount the challenges and even grab the opportunity to grow similarly over the next many years,” he said.

The bank has sought shareholders’ approval to raise up to Rs 50,000 crore from bond issuances going ahead and will be active on this front as part of its liabilities management, Jagdishan said. Merger with HDFC is all set to impact the Net Interest Margins (NIMs) of the bank because of the higher proportion of the low-interest yielding housing loans which get added, Jagdishan said, adding that the same will be visible from the results for the September quarter itself.

However, the housing loans also present advantages in terms of better repayment ratios which lower the credit costs on such advances, Jagdishan said. The bank, which has always reported NIMs between 4-4.4 per cent range, is confident of getting the profitability or the returns back to historical levels in up to 18 months, he said. ”It’s been always a philosophy that we will not compromise growth for profitability,” Jagdishan said. Amid some issues of misbehavior by staff being flagged on social media, including a loud shouting by a senior employee to a subordinate for not meeting business targets, Jagdishan said employees’ satisfaction and organisational culture are priorities for the bank management and the board. He also promised to publish employee satisfaction survey results along with the annual report from next year.

More than 7 per cent of the bank’s overall spending is towards technology, Jagdishan said. He, however, said that more security features may lead to some inconvenience. Meanwhile, the bank’s Non-Executive Chairman Atanu Chakraborty said erstwhile HDFC’s Chairman Deepak Parekh cannot join the board of the bank because of a RBI policy not allowing directors above 75 years of age. Key executives Renu Karnad and Keki Mistry have joined the bank’s board. Jagdishan said a request for approval has been made to the RBI for inducting erstwhile HDFC’s Chief Financial Officer V Srinivasa Ranjan to the board.

The bigger balance sheet of HDFC Bank following its merger with parent Housing Development Financial Corporation (HDFC) will boost fund flow to the affordable housing segment, HDFC Bank chairman Atanu Chakraborty said on August 11.

It will also help the bank to fund agriculture and small and medium-sized business in a better way, he said.

""As a consequence of this merger, the larger balance sheet of the bank would offer to the national economy possibilities of higher credit growth, a larger bouquet of financial products and higher flows into affordable housing, agriculture, MSME etc,"" Chakraborty said while addressing the bank's annual general meeting in Mumbai.

HDFC Bank merged with HDFC on July 1 and the largest merger in India's corporate history made the Mumbai-based private sector lender the world's seventh most valuable bank.

After the merger, the loan book or advances of the merged entity jumped 38.77 percent to Rs 22.21 lakh crore as against 16 lakh crore as on March 31, the bank said in an investor presentation.

The merger gave HDFC Bank entry into India's booming housing loan market, while for HDFC, the decision made sense on account of vanishing regulatory arbitrage available for non-banking finance companies.

The bank will also benefit from the addition of a market-leading home loan product, which can now be directly offered through its large network of branches, helping a greater number of people fulfil their aspirations to be homeowners, Chakraborty said.

The home loan business will also benefit from a low cost of funds that a bank traditionally enjoys, he added.

""It will also enable the bank to offer to its wider customer base a full suite of financial products like life insurance, general insurance, health insurance, and investment products like mutual funds by leveraging the strength of major entities like HDFC Ergo, HDFC Life and HDFC Mutual Fund, which now come into the bank’s fold as a result of the merger,"" Chakraborty said.

He said HDFC Bank is well-placed to capitalise on this opportunity, both for financing private investments and consumer finance, aided by its low cost of funds, wide customer reach and a large and stable balance sheet.

""We feel privileged to be a part of this burgeoning economic environment and India’s growth story,"" Chakraborty said.

On April 4, 2022, HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge. The move came almost seven years after HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.

In his speech, Chakraborty also talked about key changes in the board. Former HDFC CEO Keki Mistry has joined the board as a non-executive director. Executive director Kaizad Bharucha has been redesignated as deputy managing director, while Bhavesh Zaveri has joined as an executive director.

After having burned their fingers in the bad loan crisis that roiled the power sector back in 2017, Indian banks have truly managed to turn a corner. They now record a robust credit growth amid low slippages, while constantly providing for bad loans. However, there might be more than what meets the eye, believes ASV Krishnan of HDFC Securities.

""I feel many banks don’t admit to funding capex anymore. That seems to be a taboo. May be because they feel capital markets will not like it if banks say that they are locking capital for a long duration with a corporate,"" he said in an interview with Moneycontrol.

Krishnan, who has been tracking markets since 2006, has seen some critical ​cycles in the financial sector, from the IL&FS crisis to bad loan pile-up and recently, the robust credit growth cycle.

The credit cycle has been largely driven by retail lending, while corporate book has not taken off in a big way since the Covid lockdowns.

""That's the surprising thing. Inflation was skyrocketing, which simply means demand was overshooting supply. When that happens, entrepreneurs, businessmen typically see the need to build more capacity. They know that capacity utilisation has reached a certain stage and they can incur capex. Strangely, that cycle did not take off from large companies,"" he pointed out.

One of the reasons why banks are staying away from corporate lending is concentration risk. Across multiple capital-guzzling industries, we are entering a scenario where there are a few strong players left, said Krishnan. ""Look at power, telecom and aviation. You have very few players left there. And, everybody wants to lend to them. Such a concentration risk can never be healthy,"" he said.

As lenders continue to expand retail lending, Krishnan sees bad assets building up in the backyard. With competitive intensity high, everybody wants to dole out personal loans, which means risk is not being suitably priced, he said. ""Bad assets are definitely building up, but it will take a while to play out on the balance sheet. This is only the start of the cycle."" Read the full interview here

Since March lows, the Nifty Bank index has gained over 15 percent, despite several banks reporting a decline in net interest margins in Q1 FY24. The lenders are expected to see further contraction in NIMs in FY24 as deposit rate hikes take effect better.

Banking stocks featured prominently in analysts’ buy calls last month as robust credit demand, rising interest income, and stable asset quality boosted their investment profiles.

Domestic banks have posted a strong set of numbers for Q1 FY24, with 30-100 percent growth in net profit, mostly in line with the estimates of brokerage firms.

HDFC Bank, which completed the merger with HDFC last month, had 45 buy calls, one hold and zero sell calls, as per Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for July.

The country's largest private sector bank on July 17 reported a net profit of Rs 11,951 crore for the April-June quarter, a jump of 30 percent from Rs 9,196 crore last year.

Net interest income (NII) - the difference between the interest earned on loans and paid to depositors - grew by 21.1 percent to Rs 23,599 crore from Rs 19,481 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2022. Total deposits stood at Rs 19.13 lakh crore, up 19.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.

“Gross advances and deposits will continue to show robust growth in the foreseeable future, with a focus on higher retail participation. The merger unlocks significant synergies for the merged entity, including, but not limited to, lower cost of funds, access to HDFC’s sturdy housing loan portfolio and possibilities of cross-selling other financial products to its expanded customer base,” analysts at domestic brokerage firm Geojit said.

Winner Takes It All

The country’s largest lender SBI has the maximum ‘buy’ calls on the list at 47, followed by Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.

SBI posted its highest-ever quarterly earnings at Rs 16,884 crore, soaring 178 percent on-year, though net interest income came in below estimates at Rs 38,905 crore.

“Loan growth sustained across segments, led by continued traction in retail assets (especially Xpress Credit book) and the SME portfolio, which benefited from a gradual pick-up in the investment cycle,” HDFC Securities said in a note to clients.

Axis Bank on July 26 reported a net profit of Rs 5,790 crore for the quarter ended April-June FY24, growing by 40 percent from Rs 4,125 crore last year.

The lender's net interest income (NII) grew 27 percent on a year-on-year (YOY) basis to Rs 11,959 crore, while net interest margin (NIM) for the quarter stood at 4.10 percent, up 50 bps YOY.

ICICI Bank reported a 39.7 percent on-year growth in standalone profit at Rs 9,648 crore for the quarter despite elevated provisions and contingencies.

Net interest income increased by 38 percent on-year to Rs 18,227 crore with net interest margin expansion of 77 bps on-year at 4.78 percent, while loan growth was 18.1 percent and deposits grew by 17.9 percent YoY.

Asset quality was stable with gross NPA falling 5 bps sequentially to 2.76 percent and net NPA flat at 0.48 percent for the quarter.

“The bank has the highest earnings certainty over the next three years. Net interest margin (NIM) moderation has been in-line and deposit accretion has picked up pace. Core pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) was reported 37 percent higher YoY and the bank will invest in growth in FY24,” brokerage firm CLSA said.

Margin Pressures

While banks had a standout quarter overall, when looked at sequentially, the numbers reveal some stress on the margins front.

For example, the net interest income for SBI declined 4 percent QoQ, led by a sharp 27 bps QoQ decline in net interest margin to 3.33 percent. Axis Bank’s NIMs moderated 12 bps sequentially.

Analysts say catch-up in funding costs following accelerated funds mobilisation is expected to squeeze margins and weigh on banks’ balance sheets in the near-term.

Banks will have to hike interest rates further to chase depositors, and on the other hand, the loan book has been largely repriced as more than half of it is linked to external benchmark lending rate (EBLR).

On the advances side, while banks are chasing retail borrowers, corporate loan offtake is still subdued.

“Banks saw strong margin delivery in FY23, benefiting from lead/lag of asset-liability re-pricing, consumption of internal liquidity and lower NPA formation. However, we believe that the on-balance-sheet liquidity has been largely consumed, while higher deposit growth coupled with the lagging repricing should catch up, leading to margin softness in FY24 for most banks,” analysts at Emkay Global said.

It believes the rate hike cycle is largely behind, thus, managing the liability cost becomes vital for protecting margins. “That said, a few banks with lower loan-to-deposit ratio (such as SBI) or higher share of MCLR (Indian Bank) to be repriced should be able to protect their margins or witness relatively lesser correction. Also, banks with a higher fixed-rate asset book, coupled with a reasonable CASA base, should see margin expansion, once the rate cycle reverses,” it said.

The revised free float of HDFC Bank, as a consequence of its merger with Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), will be implemented in three tranches starting from September 2023 onwards, FTSE Russell said in a notification issued on August 7.

""FTSE Russell proposes to implement the upweight of HDFC Bank in three tranches in conjunction with the September 2023, December 2023, and March 2024 index reviews, with the December and March tranches contingent on the company’s foreign headroom continuing to satisfy the minimum 10 percent headroom requirement,"" the notification stated.

Currently, the shares in the issue amount to 308.2 crore, with an investability weight of 95.9 percent. The index shares add up to 295.8 crore.

In the first tranche of September, the shares in issue will come in at 754.49 crore, with an investability weight of 74 percent, and the index shares will be numbered at 383.3 crore. The tranching factor at this stage will be 33 percent, as per the details shared by FTSE.

In the second tranche of December 2023, the tranching factor will increase to 66 percent, the shares in issue will be 754.49 crore, the investability weight will be 74 percent and the index shares will add up to 470.8 crore.

In the third tranche of March 2024, the tranching factor will reach the 100 percent-mark, and the index shares will rise to 558.3 crore. The shares in issue will remain the same as 754.49 crore and the investability will continue to be 74 percent.

HDFC Bank's Sashidhar Jagdishan has emerged as the highest-paid bank chief executive in FY23, grossing over Rs 10.55 crore in overall pay.

Jagdishan's colleague Kaizad Bharucha, the deputy managing director of the largest private sector lender, drew Rs 10 crore for the fiscal year and may be the second-highest grossing banker in the country, according to disclosures made in annual reports.

Among the bank CEOs, Axis Bank's Amitabh Chaudhry's Rs 9.75 crore payout was the second biggest and he was closely followed by Sandeep Bakhshi of bigger rival ICICI Bank, who drew Rs 9.60 crore for the fiscal year.

Uday Kotak, who holds over 26 per cent of Kotak Mahindra Bank, continued with his decision to take a token Re 1 as remuneration started in the pandemic, even in FY23.

At a time when the banking sector is grappling with the attrition problem, Kotak Mahindra Bank stood out on the compensation front, reporting a 16.97 per cent increase in the average remuneration to its staffers excluding the managerial talent.

Staffers at ICICI Bank were given an 11 per cent hike, while those at Axis Bank enjoyed an inflation-beating 7.6 per cent average increase. HDFC Bank reported an average pay hike of 2.51 per cent. Interestingly, south-based Federal Bank, which has among the lowest attrition rates in the industry, reported an average pay hike of only 2.67 per cent.

When it comes to the top management remuneration's comparison with the median remuneration, Jagdishan topped the list, drawing 150 times the average HDFC Bank employee, and was followed by Bakhshi at 119 times and Chaudhry at 101 times the median salary of staffers at Axis Bank.

Jagdishan's package included a basic salary of Rs 2.82 crore, allowances and perquisites of Rs 3.31 crore, provident fund of Rs 33.92 lakh and a performance bonus of Rs 3.63 crore, its annual report said.

When looked at from a percentage hike perspective, the reported remuneration for Jagdishan grew by 62 per cent over the Rs 6.51 crore in remuneration he had drawn in FY22.

ICICI Bank CEO Bakhshi's overall remuneration was higher by over 35 per cent, while the same for Chaudhry was nearly 28 per cent higher.

It can be noted that there have been cases where RBI has approved the wage revisions for top management for FY22 after the completion of the year, and the remunerations reported in FY23 may include the arrears of the fiscal year gone. The disclosed hikes in remuneration by banks for its key management personnel may be lower. PTI AA MR",437,0.9531317114830017

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank (HDFCB) has delivered an exemplary track record over the past two decades that only a few companies in the world can take pride in (27% earnings CAGR in past 20 years). The merged entity is set to extend its lead as the second-largest bank in the country, with a market share of 16% in loans and 11% in deposits. The merger will help the bank improve asset duration and enable sustainable growth over the long term, with mortgage mix rising to 33%. We estimate the loan book to grow to INR 34.7t by FY26E with a ~17% CAGR (B/s size of INR 49t). -About 70% of HDFC Ltd (HDFC) customers do not have a banking relationship with HDFCB, while out of total ~85m customers of HDFCB, only 5% of them have taken mortgages (2% from HDFC Ltd). This offers a significant cross-sell opportunity, and along with aggressive distribution expansion, it would enable healthy loan growth over the medium term. According to the bank, home loan customers have 7x higher deposit balance potential than those not availing home loans. Margins are likely to moderate to ~3.8% in FY24E; however, a gradual re-pricing of borrowings and high-cost deposits of HDFC will lead to a 15-20bp gain in NIM to ~4% by FY26E. We estimate the cost-income (C/I) ratio to moderate to 35% by FY26E, which will compensate for lower margins and will support earnings.

Outlook

We estimate PAT of INR646b/INR791b/INR963b over FY24/FY25/FY26, translating into RoA of 1.9-2.1%. We estimate RoE to decline in FY24 and thereafter gradually revert to pre-merger levels of 17%+ by FY26E. HDFCB (Buy) remains one of our preferred stocks in the sector with a TP of INR 2,070.

India's biggest private sector lender HDFC Bank expects 17-18 percent loan growth during the current financial year as there is enough credit demand.

Effective July 1, the parent mortgage firm HDFC Ltd merged with its subsidiary HDFC Bank, making it the second biggest lender after State Bank of India.

During the first quarter, the total advances of the bank rose by 15.8 percent to Rs 16.15 lakh crore.

""On an overall basis, we are confident that there is enough credit demand. It is for us to see which one we want and what time we start to build in,"" HDFC Bank Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said in a recent call with analysts.

The bank will be selective in terms of credit and will not participate in certain loans, he said, adding, ""if the price is not to our liking, we do not need it.""

Meanwhile, vice chairman of the now-merged entity HDFC Ltd Keki Mistry has become the most valued independent director. The market capitalisation of the listed companies, including HDFC Bank, on which he is an independent director is over Rs 27 lakh crore. Apart from HDFC Bank, Mistry is also on the boards of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDF Life, Torrent Power and Flipkart, among others. He is followed by former SBI chairman O P Bhatt; Chairman, Capacity Building Commission, Adil Zainulbhai; and former Central Vigilance Commissioner K V Chowdary.

""On the distribution front,"" Vaidyanathan said, ""while the bank added 39 branches in the quarter, 1,482 branches were added over the last 12 months.""

The total number of branches now stands at 7,860. With regard to cards, he noted that the bank has issued 1.5 million cards in the first quarter and the total card stands at 18.4 million. ""Our website continues to receive enormous traffic. We received on an average 109 million visits per month with over 89 million unique visitors over the quarter at an year-on-year growth of 42 percent,"" he said.

The RBI in December 2020 had asked HDFC Bank to stop all launches of its upcoming digital business-generating activities and sourcing of new credit card customers after repeated outages at its data centre which impacted operations. It was subsequently lifted in March 2022.",407,0.5133458375930786

HDFC Bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD&CEO) Sashidhar Jagdishan took home an annual package of Rs 10.5 crore in the financial year 2022-2023, according to the annual report of the bank released on July 19. In FY22, Jagdishan had earned an annual salary of Rs 6.51 crore.

Jagdishan’s package included a basic salary of Rs 2.82 crore, allowances and perquisites of Rs 3.3 crore and a performance bonus of Rs 3.63 crore among other components, according to the annual report.

As against this, HDFC Bank’s Executive Director Kaizad Bharucha received an annual compensation of Rs 10 crore that included a basic salary of Rs 2.7 crore, allowances and perquisites of Rs 4.3 crore and a performance bonus of Rs 2.2 crore.

Both Jagdishan and Bahrucha received payments that also include the component received as part of the deferred cash variable of previous years.

As a point of comparison, State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Dinesh Khara took home Rs 37 lakh in the fiscal year 2022-2023 marking a jump of around 7.5 percent from the previous year, according to the bank’s annual report. SBI is India's largest bank by assets.

Khara’s salary included Rs 27 lakh basic pay and Rs 9.99 lakh dearness allowance. In the previous fiscal year, Khara earned Rs 34.42 lakh in annual salary for the financial year ending 2021-22 (FY22), 13.4 percent higher than what his predecessor Rajnish Kumar drew during FY21.

In the case of Kotak Mahindra Bank, Managing Director and CEO Uday Kotak opted to forego his fixed salary and accepted a token salary of Rs 1 for the financial year 2022-23, the annual report of the bank showed, Moneycontrol reported on July 15.

Dipak Gupta, Joint Managing Director, got an annual compensation of Rs 5.43 crore, the report showed. Gupta's total package included a basic salary of Rs 2.74 crore and an annual incentive of Rs 1.18 crore. Other whole-time directors KVS Manian, Gaurang Shah and Shanti Ekambaram got total packages of Rs 5.3 crore, Rs 5.03 crore and Rs 2.02 crore, respectively.

These amounts exclude gratuity, value of car perquisites under the Income Tax Act, 1961 and perquisites value on ESOPs, according to the report.

In FY22, Axis Bank managing director and chief executive officer Amitabh Chaudhry drew a total of Rs 7.62 crore in annual salary, as per the bank’s FY22 annual report.

Chaudhry was also separately granted a total of 412,938 stock options of Axis Bank during FY22, on the basis of approval received from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Axis Bank annual report said. The stock options were granted at Rs 726.25 per share. The FY23 numbers aren’t out yet.

There has been a long-standing debate on the salary disparity between top bankers in public sector and private sector banks. Typically, top executives at private sector banks get far higher annual compensation compared with that of state-run banks.",485,0.6337247490882874

Atanu Chakraborty, part-time chairman of India's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank on July 19 listed the benefits of the bank's merger with parent Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) saying multiple synergies will work in favour of the merged entity to grow further.

In his message to shareholders, Chakraborty listed the benefits of merger such as increased scale, comprehensive product offering, balance sheet resilience and the ability to drive synergies. ""This would enable the Bank to serve its customers in a significantly enhanced way with a bouquet of financial services,"" Chakraborty added.

The merger came into effect from July 1.

The entities have formed an integration committee that has been working on various streams across businesses, IT, HR, Risk Management, Operations, Compliance, etc. to make the merger seamless and effective, Chakraborty said.

""We are also putting in place the strategy to ensure that the financial conglomerate that has emerged has in place adequate systems and processes to ensure adherence to the various regulatory regimes and a governance framework for meeting group wide compliance

and risk management objectives,"" said Chakraborty in his message.

Post-merger, the loan book or advances of the merged entity jumped by 38.77 percent to Rs 22.21 lakh crore as against 16 lakh crore as on March 31, as per investor presentation of bank.

The merger gave HDFC Bank entry to India's booming housing loan market while for HDFC, the decision made sense on account of vanishing reglulatory arbitrage earlier available for non-banking finance companies.

A big opportunity, says CEO

In his message to shareholders, managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan too said the timing of the merger couldn’t have come at a better time.

""This was an opportunity that we truly believed in. Buying a home is a family decision and an emotional one. This emotion is transferred to the home loan service provider and helps build lifelong bonds with the customer and his family,"" said managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan in his message to stake holders.

Further, only two per cent of our customers source their home loans through the Bank, while five per cent do it from other institutions. This itself is a huge opportunity, said Jagdishan.

Further, the CEO higligted the opportunities to cross sell products across customers. Explaining the merger rationale, Jagdishan said HDFC Bank with its stronger digital platforms, digital journeys and physical branch network will have the ability to offer the home loan customer 'a complete bouquet of the Bank’s and subsidiaries’ products and services'.

""Savings accounts, personal loans, insurance cover, SIPs can all be bundled along with a home loan to create a compelling value proposition to the customer, that probably does not exist in the market at the scale at which this is envisaged. Going forward this is clearly going to be a game

changer,"" Jagdishan added.

Jagdishan further added that in line with economic growth, home buying across the country will accelerate and emerge as a key driver of India’s GDP

over the next decade, especially affordable housing. Investments in infrastructure are vital for India’s growth. A bigger balance sheet postmerger will enable HDFC Bank to take a larger exposure in infrastructure, the CEO said.

Both HDFC and HDFC Bank had annoucned the decision to merge on April 4, 2022. In fact, HDFC an HDFC Bank merger has been in news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances are in favour.

But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea in backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders. With the merger finally happening, HDFC Bank has emerged as an even bigger financial conglomerate inching closer to its bigger rival State Bank of India.",652,0.9963102882558649

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB reported a steady quarter with 30% YoY growth in PAT (8% beat). This was supported by lower provisions and higher ‘other income’. NII grew 21% YoY, while PPoP grew 22% YoY to INR187.7b (in line). Loan growth was driven by strong traction in Commercial and Rural Banking and a sequential pick-up in retail. Deposits registered a modest growth of 1.6% QoQ. Asset quality ratios remained broadly stable as slippages increased to INR58b. The restructured book declined to 27bp of loans (vs. 31bp in 4QFY23). PCR declined 81bp QoQ to 74.9%. We introduce forecasts for the merged entity and estimate the bank to deliver net earnings of INR654b/798b/957b over FY24-26, translating into RoA of 1.9-2.1%. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.

Outlook

We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR2,070 (premised on 2.8x FY’25E ABV + INR211 for subs).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB saw a mixed quarter. While core PAT at Rs115.4bn was 3.7% short of PLe due to higher opex, asset quality surprised positively with lower GNPA led by lesser slippages, despite Q1 being usually weak. Loan growth was softer at 0.5% QoQ driven by IBPC sell-down since bank would like to manage its PSL requirement in a calibrated manner. Quality of growth was superior as credit offtake QoQ was led by retail and CRB. Bank sounded confident of achieving a 18% YoY loan growth (merged) over medium term though we are factoring 16% due to likely deposit need. Benign asset quality environment may keep opex elevated in near term and for FY24/25E we raise opex by 5% but reduce provisions by 15/9bps, which will not change PAT materially. NII and core PPoP trend compared to peers would be keenly watched.

Outlook

We maintain multiple at 3.0x on FY25E core ABV and TP at Rs2,025. Retain ‘BUY’.

LKP Research's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank reported mixed operating performance in 1QFY24. Slippages increased 18% sequentially and GNPA at 1.17% is below the historical trend of 1.4%. In 1QFY24, the provisioning expenses were higher sequentially at ₹28.6bn (v/s ₹26.8bn 4QFY23). At the same time NII growth was tepid sequentially (21.1% YoY, 1.1% QoQ) against the loan growth (15.8% YoY, 0.9% QoQ). The bank reported stable NIMs at 4.3%. A marginally higher opex (C/I ratio: 42.8% v/s 42%) and lackluster NII growth led to sequential decline in PPOP. Thus, the bank has reported sequential decrease in PAT by 0.8% along with ROA/ROE of 2.04%/16.3%.

Outlook

We expect marginal reduction in ROA/ROE for FY24E owing to higher C/I ratio and margin pressure. We believe, superior underwriting practices, higher liquidity, adequate coverage and strong capital position makes HDFC Bank well placed and thus, we re-iterate BUY with price target of ₹2,074.

Axis Securities' research report on HDFC Bank

Given Q1 is a seasonally soft quarter, HDFCB’s advances growth was flat QoQ (+1% QoQ). Credit growth was driven by the Retail (+18%/4% YoY/QoQ) and the CRB (29%/3% YoY/QoQ) segment, while the corporate book de-grew by 1% QoQ. As a merged entity, HDFCB’s advances grew by ~16% YoY. NII grew by 21%/1% YoY/QoQ and NIMs (reported) remained stable QoQ at ~4.1%. Fee income and treasury gain drove non-interest income growth of +44%/6% YoY/QoQ. Opex growth continued to remain elevated, growing at 34/4% YoY/QoQ and dragging PPOP growth. The C-I Ratio inched up to 42.8% from 40.6%/42.0% YoY/QoQ. PPOP grew by 22% YoY and remained flat QoQ. Stable credit costs of ~70bps aided earnings growth of 30% YoY, flat QoQ. Despite seasonally higher slippages from the agri book, asset quality remains steady at 1.17% vs. 1.12% QoQ. The restructured book tapered to 27bps vs. 32bps QoQ.

Outlook

We value the core book at 2.9x FY25E ABV vs. its current valuation of 2.6x FY25E ABV and assign a value of Rs 165/share to subsidiaries of the merged entity, thereby arriving at a target price of Rs 2,050/share, implying an upside of 22% from the CMP.

The earnings season in the banking sector has begun, with prominent players like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank announcing their financial results.

On July 17, HDFC Bank declared its quarterly results for the April-June period of FY24, reporting a net profit of Rs 11,951 crore. This figure represents a significant jump from Rs 9,196 crore reported a year back. The bank's bottomline slightly surpassed market expectations, showcasing its robust performance.

As for ICICI Bank, its results are yet to be announced, building anticipation among investors and analysts.

Derivatives outlook

Experts say that the futures and options data suggest that banking stocks have been consolidating in anticipation of the results, without showing much weakness.

Raj Deepak Singh, Derivatives Research Head at ICICI Securities, stated that open interest in the Bank Nifty is relatively low, indicating lower downside risk at current levels. Singh also attributed the recent relative underperformance in the banking space to the ongoing sectoral rotation, which has diverted some attention away from banks.

Rajesh Shrivastava, a derivatives trader and analyst, expects the bullish trend in the banking sector to continue. ""The recent upswing in the IT sector can be viewed as a counter-trade strategy by investors who are booking profits in banks ahead of the earnings announcements. Banks are currently in a bullish phase, and we expect this trend to continue, albeit with some profit-booking prior to the results.""

Expected positions, target support, and resistance levels ahead of ICICI Bank's Results

Raj Deepak Singh expects a positive bias in the Bank Nifty, with support levels around 44,500 for a target of 46,000 in the upcoming sessions. ""Investors can consider selling out-of-the-money (OTM) puts or implementing Bull Spread strategies with a stop loss set at 44,500 levels."" he said.

Rahul K Ghose, Founder and CEO of Hedged, an algorithm-powered advisory platform, highlighted that the Bank Nifty Index broke through its crucial resistance level of 45,200, signalling positive momentum. Ghose emphasised that the index's immediate target is set at 45,900 and projected that the Bank Nifty may exhibit stronger momentum, compared to the Nifty Index, which is displaying signs of waning momentum based on several indicators. He noted that heavy put writing observed at the 45,500 and 45,000 levels for both the July end expiry and the current week expiry.

""Additionally, big banking names like SBI and ICICI bank are poised for a breakout from a very popular chart pattern called the Head and shoulder pattern. This is a bullish pattern and looking at the current undertone of momentum, it is likely to play out. "" stated Rahul Ghose.

Options trading strategy recommendation

With the commencement of the banking sector's results season, HDFC Bank has demonstrated strong profit growth, setting an optimistic tone for the industry. Traders and analysts remain cautiously optimistic about the future trajectory of the banking sector, anticipating continued positive momentum in the Bank Nifty Index and potential breakouts in major banking stocks.

Brokerage houses rolled out a positive growth outlook for HDFC Bank after the lender posted a steady set of earnings for the April-June quarter on July 17.

Shares of HDFC Bank also reacted positively to the upbeat growth outlook and at 09.18 am were trading at Rs 1,697.55 on the National Stock Exchange, up 1.1 percent from the previous close.

The lender posted a net profit of Rs 11,951 crore for the April-June quarter, reflecting a near 30 percent jump from Rs 9,196 crore in the same period of the preceding fiscal. The net profit was also slightly ahead of market expectations as at least four brokerages had predicted it to come to around Rs 11,581 crores.

Net interest income for the country's largest private sector bank also grew by 21.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 23,599 crore. Asset quality also improved as the lender's gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio came at 1.17 percent, improving from 1.28 percent in the corresponding period a year ago. Similarly, its net NPA stood at 0.30 percent from 0.35 percent in the year-ago period.

Following the steady numbers reported by the lenders, brokerages have also carved a healthy growth outlook for HDFC Bank.

At least five foreign brokerages, Citi, JPMorgan, HSBC, Jefferies and Morgan Stanley have either a 'buy' or 'overweight' call on the stock with a target price that sits upwards of Rs 2,000.

Citi attributed the lender's better-than-expected Q1 earnings to benign credit cost and treasury gains along with stable net interest margins. The brokerage also expects return on assets (RoA) for the merged entity to be hold around 1.9-2.0 percent post the merger of HDFC twins.

JPMorgan also likes the lender's solid asset quality even as there was a slowdown in retail deposit accretion. On the other hand, HSBC expects HDFC Bank to meet tough deliverables in the coming quarters through effective cross-selling and ramp-up of operations. The brokerage house also seconded Citi's estimates of an RoA of 1.9-2.0 percent for the merged entity, while it also sees HDFC Bank's standalone valuation as attractive.

Aligned with the consensus, Morgan Stanley also forecasted a healthy growth outlook for HDFC Bank as it expects to see an acceleration in loan growth in the coming quarters.

Another foreign brokerage, Jefferies believes that HDFC Bank's steady NII will hold-up better than its peers. Even though the firm believes that loan growth for the lender was softer in Q1, it expects it to pick up over the next couple of quarters as HDFC's loans stabilise. Retail deposit growth was also soft and Jefferies expects a pick-up in this segment to be key in aiding asset growth.

As a result, the company will be on a merged basis from the second quarter of FY24, Jefferies pegged a 17 percent profit CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) over FY23-26 with a 16 percent RoE (Return on Equity).

Motilal Oswal Financial Services also introduced its forecasts for the merged entity and thus estimated its net earnings of Rs 65,400 crore/79,800 crore/95,700 crore over FY24-26, translating into an RoA

of 1.9-2.1 percent. ""We thus estimate RoE for the merged entity to revert to pre-merger levels of over 17 percent by FY26,"" the broking firm stated in its report.

#1. Bull run continues in Indian stock markets, shrugging off Asian blues

Indian equity benchmarks have soared to new records after shrugging off concerns of tepid Chinese growth. The Sensex closed at a record level of 66,589.93 points, up 0.8 percent from previous close. It beat Friday’s closing high of 66,060.90. The Nifty reached a fresh all-time high of 19,731.85 points before closing at 19,711.45, up 0.75 percent. Since the lows of March, foreign investors have been net buyers of local stock worth more than Rs 78,000 crore.

Why it’s important: China is slowing down, diverting fund flows into Indian markets. There are, however, concerns the market is becoming overheated, as the volatility index has surged nearly 6 percent.

#2. India pulls 135 million out of poverty in five years since 2015-16

An estimated 135 million Indians were pulled out of multidimensional poverty between 2015-16 and 2019-21, with Bihar and Uttar Pradesh accounting for 56.8 million, a report by the Niti Aayog said. Some 24.9 percent of India’s population were assessed as multidimensionally poor in 2015-16, which declined to 15 percent in 2019-21. In rural areas, the share declined from 32.6 percent to 19.3 percent, while urban areas reported a drop from 8.7 percent to 5.3 percent.

Why it’s important: The reduction was mainly due to improvements in housing, sanitation, water supply and electricity. The estimates do not measure the monetary aspects of poverty, not updated since 2011-12.

#3. HDFC Bank reports 30 percent increase in net profit on lower provisions

HDFC Bank posted a 30 percent rise in net profit, driven by lower provisions for loan losses and increased other income. The first-quarter results do not include earnings of the merged entity, which took effect on July 1. Net profit rose to Rs 11,951.7 crore for the quarter ended 30 June from Rs 9,196 crore a year earlier. Net interest income increased 21.1 percent to Rs 23,599.1 crore.

Why it’s important: The bank went beyond expectations of analysts although it missed sequential projections in asset quality and net interest income. Its retail book is expected to outpace bulk loans.

#4. Corporate advertising spends to surge 20-25 percent in second half of 2023

Advertising spends are expected to surge a record 20-25 percent on year in the second half of 2023, spurred by the cricket world cup and the festive season. Spending is expected to be led by sectors like e-commerce, FMCG, travel and hospitality, apparel, fintech, banking, retail, and automobiles, among others.

Why it’s important: The spike would be due to launches postponed till June, either because of unseasonal rains or inflationary pressures, which will make a comeback in the second half of the year.

#5. Dunzo seeks additional $20 million from Reliance Retail after falling short of target

Dunzo is seeking at least $20 million (Rs 165 crore) more from Reliance Retail, its largest shareholder, after the cash-strapped quick commerce startup fell short of its target to raise $75 million by offering convertible notes. The firm could raise just about $45 million in April, with only Reliance Retail and Google subscribing to the convertible notes and other shareholders staying away.

Why it’s important: Falling short of the fundraising target has landed the company into an adverse cash flow situation. It is unclear whether Reliance would agree to the additional investment.

#6. Temasek Holdings lining up $10 billion to invest in India in the next three years

Singapore’s state-owned investor Temasek Holdings intends to invest $9 10 billion in India over the next three years to cash in on the rising opportunities in consumer retail, healthcare and eco-friendly businesses, India head Ravi Lambah has said. The firm on an average invests $1 billion a year in India, but it has already exceeded the target in 2023-24 due to its $2 billion investment in the Manipal Group.

Why it’s important: Temasek, which has till now invested just 6 percent of its $287 billion portfolio in India, sees increased opportunities in the country that are well aligned with its investment themes.

#7. US to work with India to spur energy transition through increased private investments

The US will work closely with India on an investment platform to lower the cost of capital and increase private investment to speed up India’s energy transition, Us treasury secretary Janet Yellen has said. India and the US held bilateral discussions on the sidelines of the third meeting of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.

Why it’s important: The increased private investment in India’s energy transition would be incumbent on faster reforms in the country. India already offers several incentives, and more are set to follow.

#8. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners buys 5.96 percent stake in Patanjali Foods, sparking rally

Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners has purchased a 5.96 percent stake in Patanjali Foods in its offer for sale. Patanjali had set a floor price of Rs 1,000 a share to sell 25.3 million shares. GQG Partners has now become the largest public shareholder of Patanjali Foods. Following the announcement, shares of Patanjali Foods jumped 2.91 percent.

Why it’s important: Rajiv Jain has made a name for taking contrarian bets. He surprised many after deciding to invest in Adani Group shares despite a market rout earlier this year.

#9. Belgium’s Proximus Group set to purchase Route Mobile for up to Rs 8,598 crore

Belgium’s Proximus Group has agreed to acquire a 57.56 percent stake in Route Mobile from the promoters of the Indian firm for Rs 5,922 crore. In a related transaction, Clear Bridge Ventures, an affiliate of the promoters of Route Mobile, will buy a 14.5 percent non-controlling stake in Proximus Opal for euro 299.6 million.

Why it’s important: The acquisition marks one of the largest cross-border deals in the communication space in India. Route Mobile, which went public in September 2020, provides communication solutions, including automated texts, WhatsApp notifications, voice-based services,

and emails.

#10. Zee’s board forms interim panel as Punit Goenka fails to overturn regulator ban

The board of directors of Zee Entertainment Enterprises has formed an interim committee of senior executives to run operations after managing director Punit Goenka’s appeal for relief from a market regulator order barring him from holding key positions in listed firms failed. The interim committee will be under the supervision of the board and will seek its guidance on all matters related to the firm.

Analysts expect its net interest income (NII) — the difference between interest earned and interest paid — to climb 21 per cent to Rs 23,553 crore, as against Rs 19,481 crore in the year-ago period.

However, the net interest margins (NIMs) – a key measure of profitability – can slip up to 10 bps from 4.1 percent in Q1 FY23.

This is because domestic banks’ funding costs are elevated while lending yields may not have material repricing benefits, analysts said.

Q1 Update

“The Indian banking sector continued to see y-o-y credit growth momentum at mid-teens through 1Q FY24, which should translate into high-teens credit growth for most large banks, especially in sticky loan segments like retail and SME. However, the fact that a highly motivated HDFC Bank could deliver only 10.7 percent CASA growth y-o-y suggests to us that system CASA growth still remains weak,” BNP Paribas analyst Santanu Chakrabarti said in a note.

HDFC Bank had disappointed the Street earlier this month with a lacklustre Q1 business update.

Its advances aggregated to approximately Rs 16.15 lakh crore for the quarter ended June 30, up nearly 15.8 percent year on year (YoY) from Rs 13.95 lakh crore a year ago. The bank's advances grew around 0.9 percent on quarter over quarter (QoQ) basis against Rs 16 lakh crore in Q4FY23.

Deposits jumped 19.2 percent YoY for the said quarter to Rs 19.13 lakh crore, from Rs 16.04 lakh crore in Q1FY23. They were up 1.6 percent QoQ from Rs 18.83 lakh crore in the quarter ended March 31, 2023.

HDFC Bank’s earnings expectations have already been rebased after the release of the business update, Nuvama Research said.

“The bank has posted a disappointing business update with deposit growth of 1.6% QoQ and loan growth of 0.9% QoQ versus expectations of 4% QoQ. Even on a consolidated basis, loan growth of 15% YoY and 0.7% QoQ is lower than the guidance of 18% YoY. Standalone NIM will likely remain stable QoQ. Slippage will rise QoQ due to seasonally high agri slippage,” it added.

Concerns on the agri front have been voiced by other experts as well.

“Asset quality is expected to see a slight blip and slippage ratio could rise from 1.26% to 1.46%, driven by agri slippages especially in case of SBI and HDFC Bank,” Prabhudas Lilladher said, adding Q1 usually sees agri delinquencies.

As per Emkay Research, slower business growth, moderating NIMs and slightly higher opex and provisions can keep Q1 profit growth in check for HDFC Bank.

The domestic brokerage sees slippages inching up QoQ due to seasonally high NPAs from the agri portfolio.

“The banking sector has bounced back over the past three months (Nifty Banking index up 10%) due to its inherent resiliency amid bank failures somewhere else, healthy credit growth belying expectations of a slowdown and a stabilizing policy/interest rate environment,” it said.

Though the sharp margin improvement story is largely behind, earnings momentum is expected to remain strong in Q1 and, thus should support the current banking rally with PSBs and small-midcap banks benefiting more.

“Notwithstanding near-term business dislocation due to the merger, we believe HDFC Bank should be back in the game from H2,” it added.

Analysts expect the lender’s asset quality to be steady. HDFC Bank had reported gross NPAs at 1.12 percent in the previous quarter, with net NPAs at 0.27 percent.

This is in line with the improving asset quality of the overall Indian banking system over the past few years.

As per RBI data, Indian banks’ gross NPA ratio declined to 3.9 percent in March 2023 – a 10-year low. The net NPA ratio of the scheduled commercial banks also improved to 1.0 percent, a level last observed in June 2011.

HDFC Bank's total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) as per Basel Ill guidelines was at 19.3 percent as on March 31, 2023, as against a regulatory requirement of 11.7 percent.

Provisions and contingencies for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 were Rs 2,685.4 crore.

Merged Entity Q1 Update

Some key takeaways about HDFC Bank and HDFC’s merged balance sheet:

-Gross advances were up 13.1 YoY and 0.7 percent QoQ basis, reaching Rs 22.45 lakh crore.

- Deposits aggregated to approximately Rs 20.63 lakh crore in Q1FY24, up 16.2 percent YoY and 1.2 percent QoQ.

- The merged entity's average liquidity coverage ratio for the Q1 stood at around 120 percent on a proforma basis.

Shares of HDFC Bank are up 1 percent on YTD basis, though the 1-year return stands at 21 percent.

Shares of Housing Development and Finance Corporation (HDFC) stopped trading on July 12, marking the end of an over four-decade-long journey for India’s oldest and biggest mortgage lender.

HDFC now lives on as part of HDFC Bank, but many market veterans view the company as a role model for corporate India and synonymous with the country’s socio-economic progress.

Here are some key highlights of HDFC’s market journey –

Founded by H T Parekh, uncle of Deepak Parekh. Incorporated on October 17, 1977

Deepak Parekh joined the company in 1978, leaving his Chase Manhattan Bank job where he was earning twice the salary offered by HDFC.

Deepak Parekh approached UTI seeking investment in HDFC’s IPO. UTI -- the only mutual fund in India that time -- refused, saying retail lending for home loans was too risky.

HDFC IPO launched in 1978. Issue size – Rs 10 crore (10 lakh shares of Rs 100 each). Shares issued to public at par (no premium).

126 equity shares of Rs 100 taken up by the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association, including 100 shares held by H T Parekh.

50,000 Equity shares of Rs 100 each subscribed by ICICI, the IFC (W) and HH the Aga Khan IV respectively.

4,50,000 equity shares of Rs 100 issued for private subscription.

3,99,874 equity shares of Rs 100 offered to the public. The Corporation received 10,697 applications for 4,73,976 equity shares. The Corporation allotted the shares to 10,543 applicants.

The stock has posted a stellar CAGR of around 19 percent over the last three decades. However, the CAGR for HDFC Bank is higher at 24 percent.

Rs 1,00,000 invested in HDFC in May 1995 would have grown to Rs 1,26,39,000 today (without dividends). However, Rs 1,00,000 invested in HDFC Bank would have increased to Rs 4,14,00,000 (without dividends).

HDFC received approval for setting up HDFC Bank in 1994. The bank was inaugurated in February 1995 by the then Finance Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.

HDFC took 33 years to hit the Rs 1-lakh crore m-cap mark. HDFC Bank reached the milestone in 15 years.

HDFC's market capitalisation reached Rs 2 lakh crore in February 2015, Rs 3 lakh crore in February 2018, Rs 4 lakh crore in July 2019, and Rs 5 lakh crore in February 2021.

In FY2000, HDFC’s net profit at Rs 400 crore was almost four times that of HDFC Bank at Rs 120 crore.

HDFC maintained its lead for the next decade. In FY2010, HDFC Bank overtook its parent in terms of net profit at Rs 2,949 crore vs Rs 2,826 crore for HDFC. The lead only widened over time.

For the financial year ended March 2023, HDFC reported a net profit of Rs 16,239 crore, compared to Rs 44,109 crore for HDFC Bank.

Even in terms of topline growth, HDFC Bank has usually outperformed its parent.

The HDFC IPO was a tepid affair, with shares listing below the issue price. Even at its last trading session on July 12, 2023, the share closed in the red, down nearly 1 percent at Rs 2,724.30 on the NSE.",523,0.20053911209106445

HDFC Bank has boarded over 1 lakh customers and around 1.7 lakh merchants under the central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot programme, the bank said in a media release on July 13.

The country’s largest private sector bank also introduced a Unified Payments Interface (UPI) QR code which can be interoperably used with CBDC. An interoperable QR code is used for basic QR code based payments using the scan and pay feature.

“The interoperable UPI QR code allows HDFC Bank merchants who have been onboarded on the bank’s CBDC platform, to accept payments from their customers in the form of digital rupee currency,” the bank said.

CBDC pilot launch

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on October 31, 2022 launched the first pilot of the digital rupee in the wholesale segment with nine banks. The lenders included State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, IDFC First Bank and HSBC.

A month later, the RBI kick started the pilot for the retail version of the CBDC.

The retail digital rupee, or e₹-R, can be used by people for day-to-day transactions. State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, Yes Bank, IDFC First Bank, BOB, Union Bank of India, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are participating in the retail project.

These banks can invite select customers and merchants to try the services through their mobile applications. After this, these users can make peer-to-peer transactions and peer-to-merchant transactions",275,

On July 12, the shares of Housing Development and Finance Corporation, or HDFC, stopped trading on bourses post the merger with HDFC Bank that came into effect on July 1. That marks the end of a four-decade-long journey for India’s oldest mortgage lender.

Founded by H T Parekh, uncle of Deepak Parekh, HDFC was incorporated on October 17, 1977, and disbursed its first home loan in 1978 to D. B. Remedios in Mumbai. To start with, the founding team had an unenviable job. Home loans were not a popular product back then and no one knew HDFC as a brand.

But the team worked hard and steadily expanded the business. By 1984, HDFC had crossed annual loan approvals of Rs 100 crore, a big milestone for the company. The company was listed in 1978 with a face value of Rs 100 each. The issue did not get a great response, in fact, it was undersubscribed.

Yet, that was the start of a remarkable journey to become a financial behemoth. On July 12, when the shares closed, HDFC had a market capitalisation of over Rs 5 lakh crore.

End of an era

Deepak Parekh, the man who played a key role in building India’s oldest mortgage lender from scratch, hung up his boots after four decades with the company. With Parekh stepping down from all roles, an era has ended.

In his last letter to shareholders of HDFC on June 30, Chairman Deepak Parekh announced his retirement ahead of the mega merger with HDFC Bank saying it is time for him to hang up his boots.

Parekh, 78, will not take up any role in the bank while HDFC Chief Executive Officer Keki Mistry is likely to join the bank's Board subject to clearance from the Reserve Bank of India.

""It is my time to hang my boots with both anticipation and hope for the future,"" Parekh told shareholders.

""While this will be my last communication to shareholders of HDFC, rest assured we now stride tall into a very exciting future of growth and prosperity,"" Parekh added. In a rather emotional letter, Parekh said the HDFC experience is invaluable. ""Our history cannot be erased and our legacy will be taken forward,"" said the veteran banker.

Questions on HDFC culture

In the letter, Parekh re-emphasised the importance of HDFC culture which helped the institution become a household name in India.

""An oft-repeated question is what happens to the culture of HDFC? My answer to this is that mergers are inherently about change. The work culture will be an amalgamation of the best of both organisations,"" Parekh wrote.

Explaining further, Parekh said the culture at the workplace is always a shared responsibility that needs daily reinforcement through the demonstration effect with the tone set at the top.

""As HDFC hands the baton, my wish is that our core founding values of kindness, fairness, efficiency and effectiveness get woven deeper into the fabric of the HDFC group,"" Parekh added.

In the letter, Parekh said HDFC Bank managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan and his team at the bank will take the HDFC legacy ahead.

""With the proven execution capabilities of HDFC Bank, we are confident that Sashi, together with the leadership team will forge an era of new opportunities for the combined entity,"" Parekh wrote in the letter.

Message to the bank?

In what appeared like a message or guidance to the bank with respect to home loan business, Parekh said that every home loan customer has their own story and it is the empathy factor that is the key differentiator between housing finance providers.

""Dealing with home loan customers requires immense patience. It is about understanding the needs and feelings of a home loan customer, assuaging their anxiety during this complex transaction, customising solutions, explaining financial implications of a mortgage product and lending responsibly to ensure a customer is not over-stretched,"" the veteran banker said.

Only home loan provider in the 80s

For CEO Keki Mistry too, this is the end of a long journey as HDFC CEO. In an interview with Moneycontrol in March this year, Mistry, who is associated with the HDFC brand for nearly 42 years, also highlighted that there will be structural opportunities in housing finance as the sector has seen tremendous change.

“In the early 1980s, we were the only housing loan provider. Convincing people in the 80s that housing finance and loan would work was a major challenge. But now the sustained demand for housing loans has been strong,” Mistry said.

Though the merger was discussed a few years ago, the plan entered a fast track in May 2021 with the bank deliberating the proposal at the top level and later approaching the parent with a proposal. HDFC Bank insiders say that compared with the previous boss of the bank, Aditya Puri, his successor Sashidhar Jagdishan was more amenable to the idea of a merger. Puri exited the bank in October 2020 and Jagdishan took charge as the new chief.

A good match for both parties

While the merger gave the much-need big entry to the bank into the lucrative home loan business, for the parent too, the decision made immense sense for one key reason. For NBFCs, life was getting tougher in India.

In his first-ever exclusive media interview post the merger announcement, Deepak Parekh told Moneycontrol that the NBFC business was getting tougher due to the tightening of the RBI regulations. “The constraint is that the RBI, over the last few years, removed the arbitrage between a bank and an NBFC,” he said.

Over the years, the RBI had brought in bank-like regulations for India’s big non-banks. Under the new multi-tiered structure for NBFCs (based on their asset size and systemic importance), bigger NBFCs were treated at par with banks on capital, regulatory scrutiny, and treatment of assets, which made operations even more expensive for this class of companies.

HDFC, with an over Rs 5-lakh-crore loan book, logically fell in the upper layer which meant it will be now monitored, inspected and regulated akin to a bank, whereas the incentives in NBFC business were less. However, when HDFC knocked on the doors of the regulator for a merger, it got a key relief.

The RBI gave critical relaxations on certain aspects such as priority sector lending norms and treatment of ownership of subsidiaries in April 21, 2023. Also, the RBI gave six months to HDFC customers to switch to new benchmarks.

Post-merger, the loan book of the merged entity will jump to Rs 22.21 lakh crore as on March 31, 2023, while deposits are at Rs 18.84 lakh crore. Further, HDFC Bank's market capitalisation will rise to Rs 14.6 lakh crore, from Rs 9.45 lakh crore prior to the merger. For the HDFC group, a great story ends and a new journey begins today.

The Nifty 50 flaunts a brand new, shiny look, with HDFC Bank emerging as the biggest weight in the index and LTIMindtree the newest kid on the block. With a weightage of 14.43 percent after merger with parent HDFC Ltd, HDFC Bank has pipped Reliance Industries as the anchor for the benchmark index, from July 13.

It is sort of a homecoming for HDFC Bank. Back in September 2017, both HDFC and HDFC Bank had weighed heavier than RIL on the Nifty. Now, the combined entity with 100 percent public shareholding has made its way back to the top.

Reliance Industries, however, continues to be the biggest Indian company with a market capitalisation of Rs 18.69 lakh crore. Over the last 20 years, RIL has been the only stock to have stayed in the Top-10 league on the Nifty 50. Even after Jio Financial Services demerger, its weightage will remain above 10 percent, said analysts. As per various brokerage reports, the JFS share price has been pegged in a range of Rs 130-160.

HDFC Bank, on the other hand, has had a tremendous journey. Back in 2002, it was at the 14th spot with a weightage of 1.8 percent. A little over 20 years later, it is the crown jewel of Nifty 50 at a significant margin over the second in line. The combined entity of HDFC Bank is pegged at Rs 12 lakh crore market cap.

Index weights are important to track as several index funds, hedge funds and exchange-traded funds benchmark their allocation to indices. Any change in the Nifty 50 index composition can result in inflows or outflows in the stock markets.

However in this case, there will be no significant outflows from funds benchmarked to Nifty 50 as both HDFC shares will get converted to HDFC Bank. A shareholder will get 42 fully paid-up shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 held in HDFC.

""The orchestration of this merger is to ensure that the future is not constrained for any of our stakeholders. The merger marks a phase of the two entities working jointly to tackle the issues on hand,” HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh wrote in his retirement letter.

But what about Bank Nifty?

A viral WhatsApp forward says HDFC Bank will command 52.40 percent weightage in Bank Nifty. Along with ICICI Bank, the two will take up 75 percent of the index weight, it said. But investors need to note that it is not true.

To eliminate concentration risk, the NSE has a weight ceiling of 33 percent for a single stock and 62 percent for the cumulative top three free float stocks. Thus, HDFC Bank’s weight in the Bank Nifty index will go up to 29.10 percent from 26.90 percent, paving the way for passive inflows of $70 million, as per Nuvama Research.

The top three banking index stocks - HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, State Bank of India - have a cumulative weight of 61.80 percent on the index. This will go up marginally to 62 percent after the merger.

“The index provider has already used a capping factor for HDFC Bank, which is 89 percent, and we continue to believe the capping factor can be adjusted to keep the stock’s weight below 33 percent,” said Abhilash Pagaria, Head - Alternative & Quantitative Research, Nuvama Institutional Equities.

The Bank Nifty index is trading near a crucial support zone of 44,800-44,750. “If this support zone is breached, it is likely to lead to further downside movement towards the 20-day moving average (20DMA), which is positioned at the 44,500-44,000 range,” according to Kunal Shah, senior technical and derivative analyst at LKP Securities.

The Bank Nifty index has been trading within a broad range of 44,500-45,500. In such a range-bound scenario, Shah advises traders to utilise opportunities presented by both the upside and downside movements till the key merger event is behind us.

The brokerage house believes that HDFC Bank has ample room for growth in the home loan sector, which could drive a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20 percent. The bank has significant opportunities to penetrate the market further.

Additionally, the portfolio rebalancing and an increased addressable market offer an expanded opportunity for HDFC Bank to capitalize on.

After the merger, as the brokerage house expects, there will be 18 percent growth in advances and 3.8 percent in net interest margin over FY23-26. Return on assets will hold near 1.9-2 percent, while return on equity will drag during this period.

Sharekhan's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank (merged entity) is attractively positioned ahead of the new decadal investment cycle to capture a large share in the fastest-growing Indian economy. There is a strong runway for sustained growth ahead, led by large scale, strong distribution network and wider financial product suites. The franchise has always been ahead of its peers not only in terms of smoothly navigating the tough economic cycles but also in sustaining superior profitable growth along with pristine asset quality across cycles and its track record is unmatched across the sector. Customer acquisition, higher productivity gains led by improvement in the vintage of branches, sustained cost reduction driven by accelerated investments in technology, and cross-selling of wider product suites are the key drivers for sustainable growth over the medium term.

Outlook

The macro outlook is positive, which should support asset quality and in turn lower credit cost in the near to medium term, offsetting higher upfront expansion cost and merger-related integration cost. The bank is confident of keeping long-term profitability metrics (1.9-2.1% ROA) with high teen growth. At the CMP, the bank trades at 2.5x and 2.2x its FY2024E and FY2025E Core BV, respectively. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a revised PT of Rs. 2,100.

The country’s largest private sector bank, Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Bank will see healthy growth across segments in the next 5to 6 years, said Chairman Atanu Chakraborty.

The bank, Chakraborty said in an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18 after its merger with HDFC Ltd., will bring in healthy net interest margins (NIM) and offer customers of HDFC Ltd. products like insurances, personal loans etc. at competitive rates through its large network.

“The bank will grow steadily across housing, micro small and medium enterprises (MSME), corporate and retail and priority sector lending segments. We will be able to provide funds at a cheaper rate to customers,” said Chakraborty.

On priority sector lending, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed the bank to meet priority sector lending requirements after the merger with HDFC in a gradual manner, up to three years.

“There is a standard stipulation for every bank and these were not there for HDFC Ltd. We will be able to meet the target on the basis of the roadmap provided by the RBI,” Chakraborty said.

Wider network

The total branch network of HDFC Bank till March 31, 2023 was 8,344. Whereas, HDFC Ltd, has 478 interconnected offices which will now be converted into HDFC Bank branches.

Chakraborty highlighted that now with a wider network, the combined entity through its large network will bring in healthy NIMs.

“Alongside healthy NIMs, we also see branch expansion happening by both physical and digital means. We aim to make customers’ journey simpler through digital service,” said Chakraborty.

Previously, Sashidar Jagdishan, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD and CEO), HDFC Bank in a letter to the 4000 employees of HDFC Ltd who joined the bank said that the bank’s future is bright.

“The pace at which we aim to grow - we could be creating a new HDFC Bank every 4 years,"" said Jagdishan.

Inflation and competition

India’s retail inflation fell to a 25-month low of 4.25 percent in May 2023.

On this, Chakraborty said: “There is a need to be mindful of lack of growth and sticky core inflation globally.”

He also highlighted that currently, the mortgage market only forms 11 percent of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) whereas that of China and other south-asian countries is higher.

“India is a very underpenetrated market. But we see the demand only going up as the overall growth of the country is going up.

We only see opportunity in the market for everyone and no competition. We also see that the bank will be able to provide competitive rates for home buyers,” said Chakraborty.

The merger

The merger of HDFC, India's oldest and largest mortgage lending firm, with HDFC Bank came into effect on July 1. Keki Mistry and Renu Karnad from HDFC Ltd will be joining HDFC Bank board, Chakraborty said.

HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge on April 4, 2022. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.

In fact, Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC Ltd, had said, back in 2015 itself, that his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank, if circumstances were favourable. But the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense, provided there is no loss for shareholders.

Once the deal comes into force, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the bank. With the parent finally joining with the bank, the combined entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry.",653,0.8269874254862467

The current market rally shows no signs of slowing down. While a correction is expected, its extent is uncertain. Experts believe that a correction, if it happens, is likely to be to a smaller degree.. one that would present buying opportunities at lower levels. However, the Indian market rally did not reach its peak, possibly due to the under participation of large caps in this leg of the rally.

Deven Choksey, Director, DRchoksey Finserv Pvt Ltd feels that the next two to three months will see greater participation by large companies such as HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries. For investors who are left with a feeling of FOMO (fear of missing out), his advice is to focus on the long-term prospects of the Indian market and to start investing gradually without attempting to time the market.

Edited Excerpts:

Markets are at an all-time high and the rally continues unabated. Do you expect any kind of meaningful correction to kick in from here? Or would you say we are headed higher from here?

Well, I think on one side, the market is expecting corrections but one is not very clear about the degree of corrections. On the other side, the fundamentals continue to be strong in the economy. The economy is counting on several positives. Growth is positive, tax collection is positive, new money flowing into the corporate sector is very positive, government spending on infrastructure is also positive. If you count the list of positives, I think we have quite a few of them. As a result, the market is basically in no mood to give up, especially since the news flow from the Western world is also turning favourable.

So, to a great extent, I would think that even if the correction comes, that correction would be to a smaller degree. And that correction will be a price correction, which will give an opportunity to buy at lower levels. Another important trend emerging in April, May, and partly in June, is that the midcaps are probably drawing the entire market and the valuations of midcaps have reached newer heights. People have made money by not booking profits in midcaps and in those two or three months, I think the large caps have been largely neglected.

Larger companies like Reliance and HDFC Bank were neglected. Now you are seeing the possibility of money flowing into larger companies because funds are coming into big portfolios. At the same time, I think the larger companies would allow them to absorb this kind of weak flow of money. So, my belief is that in the next two-three months, we should be seeing a larger participation of bigger players, ETF (exchange traded funds) players.. they will be parking money into some of the large cap companies. So, indices going up because of the sheer weightage of large cap companies is a given. And that is where you would see the rally continuing and the market index peaking to newer heights.

India’s bullish market will horn to glory: Vikas Khemani

Despite clocking strong growth, HDFC Bank has been underperforming the Nifty over the last three years. Now that the HDFC-HDFC Bank mega merger is complete, do you think HDFC Bank will emerge as one of the top performers in the second half of the year?

There are a few reasons why I think that could possibly happen. One of them is that post-merger, it’s the fourth largest bank in the world. I guess this is where it becomes a compelling proposition. Because if the global players were earlier looking at standalone HDFC or standalone HDFC Bank, they were probably not putting in as much money as they will now, in the larger unit. So, as a result of this, I think money will flow into it.

The second most important factor is the 20 percent credit growth continuing for some of the corporate banks including HDFC Bank, be it in the weight from the corporate sector, be it from the retail sector, be it from the housing finance business or for that matter, the priority sector. I think the 20 percent growth is continuing for the lender. That is where I believe that in 3.5-4 years’ time, you develop the visibility on doubling the size of the balance sheet. The combined balance sheet at the end of FY24 For HDFC-HDFC Bank combined, the aim would be somewhere around Rs 23-24 lakh crore. If this is compounded at the rate of 20 percent then possibly in the next four years the size of the balance sheet will be in the vicinity of Rs 45-50 lakh crore.

So in that kind of situation, there will be a compelling proposition for most of the global investors to buy into HDFC Bank. So, the current rally is just the beginning as in the last 3 years, HDFC Bank has not participated. This is all the more reason for HDFC Bank to participate now in the current rally.

Your thoughts on Reliance Industries. On a YTD basis, it has underperformed the Nifty, do you expect the stock to make a comeback and emerge as one of the leaders of the market rally?

In the last three months, large cap stocks haven't participated in the rally, and Reliance is included in that for a variety of reasons. The fundamentals of Reliance are absolutely strong and convincing, be it Jio where a 20 percent rate of growth is continuing or be it the retail business, where around 15 percent compounded growth is continuing, or for the oil and gas business and refining and petrochemical business as well, growth is continuing at a steady pace.

If I look at all this, I think Reliance would have invited participation much earlier but it did not. The larger funds, ETFs did not bring in enough money as much as they're bringing now in the last week or 10 days. So from that point of view, in my reading, I think Reliance will start participating in the market purely from a technical perspective.

From a fundamental perspective, I think the company is rolling out different business models; Jio Financial Services is being rolled out, we are seeing the 5G migration taking place in Jio Platforms, where I believe a larger number of customers would be brought in and at the same time, higher amount of average revenue per user will be coming in. So, all in all I believe for a company like Reliance, there is a case for a 20-25 percent rally from current levels.

What’s your advice for those who have missed the bus on this leg of the rally and are left with a feeling of FOMO?

I would always say that the Indian market offers you the visibility for the next 10-15 years. With that kind of visibility available to you, every dip or fall will offer a great buying opportunity. We have been shouting from the rooftops in February and March, that this particular fall in the market is technical in nature and has nothing to do with the fundamentals of companies.. and we were proved right as we saw a market rally in subsequent months.

So, my advice to investors would be, since good quality stocks are available in the market, I think some of the large tech companies which have been neglected and are available at a compelling proposition, should be invested in. One can start investing gradually and every month you can put in some money through SIP in direct equity. So, that will probably help you in building your portfolio. But investment is a must. I think you should not be timing the market. You should be timing your investment, I think systematically on a month-on-month basis.

Former HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh announced his retirement in a rather emotional letter ahead of the mega merger with HDFC Bank. The merger took place on July 1 making HDFC the fourth largest bank in the world. Meanwhile, Parekh announced his retirement on June 30 saying it is time for him to “hang up boots”.

While we are on this, let us tell you about a certain offer letter that has surfaced online. The letter dated July 19, 1978 was for Parekh when he was offered a job as the Deputy General Manager at HDFC.

According to the components of the offer letter, Parekh’s basic salary was Rs 3,500 plus Rs 500 as a fixed Dearness Allowance. He was also entitled to 15% Housing Rent Allowance and a City Compensatory Allowance at 10%.

In addition, Parekh was also entitled to Corporation’s Provident Fund, gratuity, medical benefits and leave travel facilities as per rules. HDFC was also willing to reimburse the expense of his residential telephone.

Deepak Parekh was offered a job as the Deputy General Manager at HDFC.

Meanwhile, a heartwarming tribute was given to the veteran banker by RPG Chairman Harsh Goenka. The businessman compared the banker’s retirement to the day when Sachin Tendulkar retired. Goenka also hailed Parekh as a true titan in the financial world.

“In Deepak Parekh’s retirement, I feel the same today as I felt the day Sachin Tendulkar retired. A true titan in the financial world, a crisis advisor to both governments and many senior industrialists, he has been instrumental in making #HDFC a trusted and a household name,” Goenka tweeted while sharing a picture of Parekh.

""It is my time to hang my boots with both anticipation and hope for the future. While this will be my last communication to shareholders of HDFC, rest assured we now stride tall into a very exciting future of growth and prosperity,"" Parekh told shareholders amid his retirement.

The merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India's oldest and largest mortgage lending firm, with HDFC Bank came into effect on July 1. And it is an emotional moment for many old HDFC employees who spent a lifetime with the company.

Some HDFC employees Moneycontrol spoke to recall their early days, including the struggles of selling home loans when the product wasn't popular. ""I still remember the first day I joined HDFC. Now I've worked for more than two decades with the company, and it feels like home to me,"" said Nitin Walia, Assistant Manager of a branch in Delhi.

Another employee, who did not wish to be named, said after working 34 years at HDFC, the culture of the company is what he will miss the most. ""The spirit of working and the culture is the most important thing I experienced in my career at HDFC,"" said the employee.

""HDFC is an iconic brand. No one can take HDFC from us,"" said another senior employee.

""My 17 years in HDFC were full of a roller-coaster ride. Now to see that HDFC merged with HDFC Bank is a happy moment,"" said Shalabh Sharma, Deputy Manager at an HDFC branch in Mumbai.

Old days

HDFC opened in 1977 and was the sole mortgage lender in India at that time. Keki Mistry, CEO and Vice Chairman, HDFC, in an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol in March 2023, said that initially it was the only mortgage lender in India, and, with time, “we created our competition.""

""We trained some individuals and banks to start mortgage lending. During the early years of the company, home loans were not popular in India,"" Mistry said.

Echoing this, Sharma said that his role in the initial years involved developing leads and contacts. ""In the early years, people did not know about home loans. Before selling, there was a need for informing,"" said Sharma.

Mahesh Shah, former Corporate Communications Head at HDFC, said that the first word that comes to his mind when he recalls his journey with HDFC is commitment. Shah recalled that in May 1987, Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC, came to Cross Maidan to motivate the HDFC Cricket team during the finals of the Corporate Cricket tournament ‘The Times Shield.’

""He took me for a stroll on the ground as it was a lunch break to discuss the status of the match which he responded HDFC will win. He wanted to know if we needed to strengthen the team to meet the challenges of a higher level and he stuck to his commitment of a spinner being recruited,"" said Shah.

The evolution

HDFC Bank was incorporated in 1994 as a banking subsidiary of HDFC in Mumbai. With time, HDFC and HDFC Bank became mammoths in their respective sectors. The bank’s loan book, over the years, grew tremendously from Rs 2.3 lakh crore in 2013 to Rs 16 lakh crore in 2023. As of March 2023, the market capitalisation of HDFC Bank is Rs 9.5 lakh crore and that of HDFC is Rs 5.2 lakh crore.

The struggle of selling a home loan was something that HDFC faced in the years of its evolution. Parekh, in a press conference in Mumbai, on June 27, said that he still remembers the first loan the company gave. ""Our first home loan was of Rs 30,000. We took photographs of the customer with his house and made it the cover picture of our first annual report,"" said Parekh.

Shah recalled that during his time in HDFC, he remembered the growth of the company and summed it up in one word — commitment. ""The management of the company created an environment of subtleness and friendliness from the earliest days,"" said Shah.

Culture of HDFC

Parekh said HDFC and HDFC Bank have different cultures due to the nature of their business. However, though there is some difference, the company aims to have the same culture in the bank, he added. ""We want to have the culture of HDFC in HDFC Bank. Culture is the essential part of our organisation. A bank which does not do housing will have a different culture,"" said Parekh.

Mistry also said that there is not much cultural difference in HDFC and HDFC Bank and that every single employee from the mortgage lender will get absorbed into the bank. ""We don't see too many cultural differences between the two entities and all our staff. We have reassured that every single employee of HDFC will be taken into the bank,"" said Mistry.

The HDFC Bank share price gained over 2 percent on July 3 and hit a fresh 52-week high after the lender announced completion of merger with its parent HDFC Ltd.

The private lender's top boss, Sashidhar Jagdishan, has said that HDFC Bank can now create a new bank its size every four years after the merger.

At 10:20 am, the HDFC Bank stock was quoting at Rs 1,757.50 on the NSE, up 2 percent over the previous close. Trading volumes at the time were over 10 million shares. HDFC Ltd was also trading 2.6 percent higher at Rs 2,925 on the NSE.

Given the combined entity's large and growing distribution and customer franchise, more-than-adequate capital, healthy asset quality and profitability, Jagdishan believes the bank is well placed to serve the under-penetrated markets.

According to analysts, this is an opportune time to invest in HDFC Bank which is on a rapid growth path. Foreign broking firm Morgan Stanley believes the stock is a compounder and is trading at attractive valuations.

The bank's current valuation is at 16 times the one-year forward earnings per share (EPS), which is 20 percent below the 15-year average, it said. This means that the stock is trading at a relatively lower price compared to its historical average.

""HDFC Bank has a strong track record of delivering investor returns. Additionally, the bank is expected to benefit from cyclical tailwinds, which will assist in navigating the challenges posed by the merger,"" the firm said.

With the deal getting effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the bank. Every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares they hold.

The board of directors of HDFC Bank in consultation with the board of directors of HDFC Limited has fixed July 13, 2023, for determining the shareholders of HDFC Ltd who would be issued and allotted the shares of HDFC Bank.

Having successfully executed the merger with parent HDFC, HDFC Bank's managing director and chief executive Sashidhar Jagdishan on Saturday said the country's largest lender aims to double every four years.

In a letter to the over 4,000 employees from HDFC who joined the bank's rolls on Saturday, Jagdishan said the future is bright, and the work on realising the potential of the merger starts now.

""The runway for financial services and mortgage, which are so underserved and under penetrated, is going to be very large. HDFC Bank - the combined entity - with a large and growing distribution and customer franchise, more than adequate capital, healthy asset quality and profitability, will be best positioned to capture growth. The pace at which we aim to grow - we could be creating a new HDFC Bank every 4 years,"" he said.

HDFC Bank began the day one after the merger with a rebranding exercise, wherein it is putting up its colours at all the over 500 branches and offices of HDFC Ltd.

The erstwhile HDFC's corporate headquarters at Ramon House already sports the HDFC Bank branding, and officials estimated that the entire exercise will be over in the next 24 hours.

It can be noted that dedicated teams have been put in place to make the merger as seamless as possible, right since its announcement on April 4 last year. As part of the USD 40 billion all-share deal, the biggest in Indian corporate history, HDFC Bank had committed to absorb all the over 4,000 employees of its parent.

""Our work starts from today, in realising the potential of what this merger holds for us,"" Jagdishan wrote.

To realise its growth aims, Jagdishan said the bank will be adding about 1,500 branches every year for some years to better serve the middle class and upper segment of the country.

It will continue investments on the digital front as well which, Jagdishan said, will make HDFC Bank into a 'technology company into banking"", and added that the same will get unveiled over the next three years.

The bank will be assessing its people on the basis of how they conduct governance and compliance, teamwork and their ability to delight customers, he said.

The canvas being offered to the HDFC Ltd employees is large -- both professionally and personally, the email said, adding that an external expert was appointed to arrive at the right formula for inducting people into the bank and deciding their role in the hierarchy.

Jagdishan said the cost-to-revenue ratio of HDFC at 0.04 per cent was the lowest for any mortgage company in the world, and thanked its leadership, including Deepak Parekh, Keki Mistry and Renu Karnad, for creating such an institution.

He said from a customer perspective, the home loan is a very emotional product which establishes a great bond between the financier and borrower and added that HDFC Bank would like to harness the same bond.

""The penetration levels of the home loan product in its (HDFC Bank's) customer base and the extent the distribution has been leveraged, is quite low. This is an opportunity! The runway for growth is going to be large and for a long time to come,"" Jagdishan said.

HDFC Bank will move from sales management to a relationship management model because of the opportunity to cross-sell that exists within the franchise after the addition of mortgage finance, insurance and asset management subsidiaries, Jagdishan said.

""The velocity of product sales and the reduced touch points to serve the customer will be a game changer with this 'power of bundling',"" he added.

HDFC Ltd, the parent of the country's largest private sector lender, merged into HDFC Bank on Saturday, with boards of both entities clearing the plan first presented on April 4 last year. HDFC Ltd, the largest pure-play home financier, ceases to exist 44 years after it was founded.

The USD 40-billion merger, the largest such deal in Indian corporate history, is driven by a changing regulatory landscape, which limited the advantages for HDFC continuing as a non-bank lending entity.

Post-merger, HDFC Bank will become the fourth most valued lender in the world, and narrow the gap by asset size with state-owned SBI to be the second largest Indian bank.

The total business of the merged entity stood at Rs 41 lakh crore at the end of March 2023. With the merger, the networth of the entity would be over Rs 4.14 lakh crore.

The combined profit of both entities was to the tune of about Rs 60,000 crore at the end of March 2023.

With the deal getting effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 per cent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 per cent of the bank. Every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares they hold.

The board has fixed July 12, 2023, for the transfer of non-convertible debentures while July 7 for the transfer of commercial papers of HDFC Ltd in the name of HDFC Bank.

""As HDFC hands the baton, my wish is that our core founding values of kindness, fairness, efficiency and effectiveness get woven deeper into the fabric of the HDFC group,"" Parekh added.

In the letter, Parekh said HDFC Bank managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan and his team at the bank will take the HDFC legacy ahead.

DGGI investigations revealed that these insurers were paying commissions beyond the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India’s permissible limit to their corporate agents in the garb of expenses related to marketing and brand activation.

The GST law doesn’t allow availing of such input tax credit as the supply of said service did not actually take place.

In a filing on June 23, the company also said the insurance regulator had approved the transfer of shares of HDFC Life from HDFC Ltd to HDFC Bank. This comes ahead of the merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank.

""We also wish to inform that IRDAI vide its said letter has also granted its approval for HDFC Limited to acquire additional shares in HDFC Life so as to hold more than 50 percent of its total share capital,"" HDFC Life said.

At 11 am, HDFC Life was trading 0.55 percent up at Rs 630.40 on BSE.

iPhone maker Apple is in talks with banks and regulators to launch its credit card, dubbed ""Apple Card,"" in India. The company's CEO, Tim Cook, met with HDFC Bank CEO and MD Sashidhar Jagdishan during his trip to India in April, according to two sources familiar with the matter.

The technology giant is also holding discussions with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to possibly launch Apple Pay in the country, a third source told Moneycontrol. It is not clear whether these discussions are regarding its credit card being powered by NPCI's Rupay platform or whether this is for Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The advantage of launching a Rupay Credit Card is that it can be linked to UPI as well. In India, only banks are allowed to launch credit cards. UPI allows customers to make seamless and fast payments by scanning QR codes through mobile phones.

This comes at a time when a significant number of payments are being increasingly made through mobile phones. Technology giants such as Apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung are actively pursuing expansion into the payments sector and have ambitious plans in the financial services space. These companies have developed payment apps and are looking to make significant strides in this area.

The Cupertino-based tech giant had also held discussions with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the modalities of the card, Moneycontrol has learned. According to one of the sources mentioned above, the regulator has asked Apple to follow the regular procedure for co-branded credit cards, without offering any special consideration for the company.

Both Apple and HDFC Bank did not offer any statements to the email queries sent to them. The RBI also did not respond to an email inquiry about whether the regulator had held discussions with Apple. NPCI did not respond to text messages sent by Moneycontrol.

According to the sources, Apple is looking to launch its Apple Card, a co-branded credit card with HDFC Bank in the country. The discussions are in the early stages and a decision has not been arrived at, the sources added. The nature of the discussion, as well as when Apple intends to launch this in India, could not be determined.

Apple was looking at significant deviations from the standard co-branded credit card model in India, one of the sources said. It is not clear whether the company is willing to make those compromises in order to launch the card in India, the source added.

Moneycontrol was unable to ascertain whether the discussions with the regulator took place through Apple executives or its potential banking partner.

Apple currently operates a premium credit card in the US, which was launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Mastercard. This card is made of titanium metal and is positioned as a high-end offering.

""Apple works only with the biggest and the best and hence the discussions with HDFC Bank. While a lot goes into building partnerships, banks and other brands would be willing to sweeten the deal terms to get Apple on board,"" said one of the sources mentioned above.

Why India?

India has been a focus country for Apple for the last couple of years, with iPhone sales growing at a rapid pace, albeit from a low base. Apple's revenue in India touched around Rs 50,000 crore or $6 billion in FY23, representing a 50% growth over Rs 33,500 crore (around $4 billion) in FY22. Apple's global services revenue stands at around $80 billion. Converting a significant portion of these transactions through the Apple Card would have a substantial impact.

During Cook's visit to India in April, the company launched exclusive retail stores in Delhi and Mumbai. Additionally, the company has been shifting a significant portion of its iPhone production to India and the country could see almost 25% of Apple’s total mobile phone production in the next three to four years.

Apple currently holds approximately 4% of the overall smartphone market in India, which accounts for roughly two crore users. If 20-30 percent of Indian smartphone users switch to iPhone over the next decade, as is the case in other middle-income countries, India could become Apple's third-largest market, after the US and China.

However, what might have prompted Apple to consider launching the Apple Card in India before Japan or other European countries is the fact that Apple does not currently accept card payments in India. In India, UPI powers most App Store purchases, apart from iCloud services such as storage and music.

This was after the RBI said that third-party websites should not store card details on their platforms, but only in a tokenised form. The regulator also insisted that all the payment data should be stored only on Indian servers. Another card-related direction was to take one-time customer permission through OTP for standing instructions meant that UPI was more seamless for Apple customers.

""Apple is cagey about several of these directions. Hence the company decided to stop card payments in India temporarily. It makes sense for the company to explore launching its own credit card before it restarts card payments in India thus preempting other credit cards being used on the platform,"" one of the sources mentioned above said. The Apple website still mentions only Apple Account Balance, net banking, and UPI as the approved payment methods on the platform.

Is Apple ready for compromises?

Unlike in the US, Apple cannot bring a plain card with just Apple's logo and the customer's name on the front. The regulations will require that Apple takes the back seat and the bank will take the driver's seat. The Goldman Sachs name and Mastercard also appear on the backside of the Apple Card in the US. The card also does not have any card number printed on it. These are not liberties that Apple can take in India as per the current co-branded credit card regulations in India.

Last year, the RBI clearly stated that the bank's partner cannot store customer data or transaction data. Even the Apple Card details cannot be stored on Apple platforms, which is not the case in other countries that Apple operates.

""To get all the premium Apple customers on board for their credit card is a great proposition for the banks, but none of them can offer any substantial privileges as the regulations around this is strict,” one of the sources mentioned above said.

What Apple Card brings to the customers?

The Apple Card is integrated with Apple Pay, and the reward money is deposited into Apple wallet and earns an annual interest rate of 4.15 percent.

The Apple Card also does not have any annual fees. In the US, Apple let its card users buy Apple products in installments without any interest. Apart from around 3-5 percent cashback on purchasing Apple products and Apple services, the company could tie up with other premium brands to offer 2-3 percent cashback or reward points on purchases from these partners.

In the US, Apple also provides a daily 2 percent cashback while using the card through Apple Watch or iPhone. This is by adding the credit card to Apple Pay and the payment is done using tap and pay at NFC (near field communication) -enabled payment terminals. The company also provide 3 percent cashback at major merchants.

Shares of HDFC Bank jumped nearly 1.5 percent in the early trade on June 21, as Goldman Sachs reinstated its “buy” rating on the stock and raised its target price from Rs 1,840 to Rs 2,050 a share, a 21 percent upside from the current market price.

India’s largest private sector bank is expected to emerge stronger after the merger with HDFC Limited, Goldman Sachs said in its report on June 21. It forecasts sector-leading earnings growth of 18 percent during FY23-26. This will be on the back of superior return ratios with a huge degree of earnings visibility in FY23-26.

“The stock currently trades at 14.6x standalone FY24 earnings per share (EPS) estimate and is expected to continue with strong balance-sheet growth and superior profitability,” the report said

Not just Goldman Sachs, several brokerages, too, see high growth for the private sector lender.

The brokerage house said in a recent report that the HDFC Bank is well-positioned to lead new-age banking. The brokerage house has given a potential upside of 21 percent with a target price of Rs 1,950.

“The bank is well positioned to lead new-age banking. At its analyst day meet, HDFCB management highlighted how the bank is getting future-ready by focusing on strengthening its digital capabilities and sustainable growth after the merger while maintaining RoA at the current level,” the report said.

The bank plans to announce various initiatives to provide a superior experience to customers, it said.

“Growth is likely to be broad-based, mainly driven by technology and expanding distribution network, while improved cross-selling will further augment revenue growth,” the report said.

The bank said that the cost-to-income (C/I) ratio may remain sticky for the near term but could decline to 30 percent over the next 10 years.

“HDFCB remains one of our preferred picks and we maintain our “buy” rating with a TP (target price) of INR 1,950,” it said.

Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher also has retained its “buy” rating on the stock in a recent report, with target price of Rs 1925, a potential upside of more than 20 percent. The focus of the bank is now shifting from product to customer, it said

HDFC Bank has given a return of 0.50 percent over the last six months against benchmark Nifty Bank gaining 3.02 percent during the period.

After Competition Commission of India's (CCI) green signal, mortgage lender HDFC can now acquire over 50 percent stake in HDFC Life. The development pushed the stocks of HDFC Life, HDFC and HDFC Bank higher on June 21.

At 9:25 am, HDFC Life was quoting at Rs 651.65 on the NSE, higher by 1.24 percent from the previous close. HDFC, too, was quoting 0.6 percent higher at Rs 2,677.

Eventually, HDFC Bank, which will be the surviving amalgamated entity, after the merger with HDFC, will hold over 50 percent stake in HDFC Life. Similar approval has also come for the combined entity's shareholding in HDFC ERGO.

Follow our live blog for all the market action

As of March 2023, HDFC held 48.65 percent stake in HDFC Life.

In April, the Reserve Bank (RBI) of India permitted HDFC Bank or HDFC to increase shareholding in both insurance companies to over 50 percent prior to the effective date of the merger. After RBI's permission, CCI approval is another step forward towards the merger.

According to Emkay and Nuvama Research, the decision by the RBI to hold more than 50 percent stake by HDFC twins in insurance entities is a significant boost for HDFC Life. The management has not quantified the increase in the stake. The theoretical limit is 100 percent.

""We believe it should be 50-60 percent. The Street had a high probability of this relaxation coming through. Last year, the management had explained that a higher stake would also mean higher cross-sell,"" Nuvama said.

Second, the concern of a possible 19 percent stake sale by HDFC-HDFC Bank (which currently holds 48.65 percent stake in HDFC Life) if the RBI had directed them to keep their stake below 30 percent, is now eliminated. It is now confirmed that HDFC-HDFC Bank will acquire fresh or secondary over 1.35 percent stake before the merger completion, an Emkay report said.

Competition watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) on June 20 granted its approval to mortgage lender HDFC to acquire a certain stake in HDFC Life Insurance Company and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company Ltd.

These approvals will help pave the way for the merger of HDFC into HDFC Bank, expected to be finalised by the third quarter of this financial year.

In April, the Reserve Bank also allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC to increase shareholding in HDFC Life Insurance Company and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company to over 50 per cent prior to the effective date of the merger.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI), in a statement said it has approved the proposed combination involving acquisition of additional shareholding of HDFC Life Insurance Company Limited by Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited (HDFC).

In another statement, the fair trade regulator said it has also cleared acquisition by HDFC of certain additional shareholding of HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company Limited.

In both these cases, the merged entity HDFC Bank (after the effective date of the proposed amalgamation) will hold over 50 per cent of the shareholding of the two insurance companies, according to CCI.

Termed as the biggest transaction in India's corporate history, HDFC Bank on April 4 last year agreed to take over the biggest domestic mortgage lender in a deal valued at about USD 40 billion, creating a financial services titan. The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore.

After the deal is effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the bank. Every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares they hold.

Deals beyond a certain value require approval from CCI, as it keeps a tab on unfair business practices in the market place.

“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”– Arthur C Clarke (1962)

In the heady days before the advent of computers, young, wide-eyed traders beginning their careers at some of London’s famed stockbroking establishments were given a large blue book and calculator on their first day at work.

But, if the hapless youngsters were caught using the calculator, the blue book would be hurled at them with great force by hardened veteran traders manning the floors.

The lesson? Be razor-sharp with numbers, develop the “trader’s instinct” and don’t depend on a puny device if you want to make it big in the business.

Alas, these admirable attributes declined the introduction of computerised trading. Suddenly, a computer terminal was able to parse reams of data and execute millions of trades before a stockbroker could even shout ""buy General Electric"".

Not just the calculator and blue book, computers made even humans obsolete on the trading floor.

A similar, if not bigger, seismic shift may be underway, at least for retail investors, with the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI).

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, Dall-E, Midjourney and various others are hogging the limelight with a smorgasbord of innovative applications, inspiring awe and fear in equal measure.

Some early adopters and researchers are also using AI platforms to analyse news reports, US Fed announcements and stock exchange filings. The initial results have been more than encouraging.

But how does AI perform when it comes to stock-picking in the Indian context? And can investors repose faith this digital black box? We decided to dig deeper.

Abracadabra

For the past few weeks, we ran multiple prompts on ChatGPT to find out its top recommendations among Indian stocks. Both the free and paid versions of the OpenAI-developed chatbot were used.

Even though its training data is till September 2021, we figured it would be interesting to see what ChatGPT thinks is worth buying on Dalal Street. And of course, it's not as if the Indian corporate landscape has changed dramatically from end-2021.

However, direct queries on which stocks one should invest in were invariably brushed aside with this anodyne response:

So we decided to get creative with the prompts. In one query, for instance, we asked ChatGPT to imagine it was a world-renowned money manager and at a conference in Mumbai, an audience member posed a question on the best stocks available in India.

Another prompt was:

Much like a genuine conversationalist, ChatGPT perked up in response and began to spew out names (albeit with the usual disclaimers).

It made its preference clear over multiple iterations. Bluechip names like Reliance Industries, TCS, HDFC Bank and Infosys.

The paid version of the chatbot, which has been trained on more parameters than the free-to-use option, too preferred to stick with the market leaders.

Nothing too adventurous. Just limit your exposure to traditional market leaders like TCS, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank HUL, ITC and others.

Often, the answers veered from specifics to platitudinous advice on how to excel at the hazardous art (and science) of stock-picking.

Understand the market trends, consider the financial health of the company, assess its management track record and gauge its ability to adapt to changing conditions. Nothing terribly new, right?

On follow-up questions on which companies met these criteria, it reverted to its risk-averse stance:

In fact, such was ChatGPT’s bias towards the largecap universe that we began to wonder whether it was aware of any midcap or smallcap names in India at all.

So, the next queries were limited to smaller companies.

Here, however, it was a lot more difficult to get ChatGPT to recommend names, as it kept on listing general factors to consider while picking stocks.

Finally, after many attempts, it did offer some choices:

Behind the veil

Language processing AI models are trained on humongous amounts of text data scraped from the internet.

ChatGPT-3, for example, was trained on a whopping 570 GB of data, with 300 billion words being fed into its system. Its successor ChatGPT-4 is trained on even more data, though OpenAI has, so far, not revealed the specifics.

So when ChatGPT recommends bluechip stocks, does this mean it is just parroting the names most often mentioned in millions of webpages it has crawled?

Daniel Lemire, a leading voice on AI and a computer science professor at the Data Science Laboratory of the Université du Québec (TÉLUQ) in Montreal, said it is certainly possible.

“ChatGPT has not yet shown an ability to quickly adapt to fast-changing information. It makes sense that it would recommend large corporations that have a track record of profitability, but these recommendations could be misleading and potentially dangerous,” he told Moneycontrol.

Lemire, however, added that ChatGPT has shown that large language models (LLMs) have the ability for superior text comprehension.

“This means that it can be used to scour large volumes of text (press releases, annual reports, government announcements, etc) and even data (stock prices and so forth) to potentially identify quickly patterns faster than most human beings ever could. There are already software doing such processing (eg, doing sentiment analysis on text) but it has generally been much more superficial,” he noted.

Which means the tool can be of enormous importance to the common investor, at least for market research.

LLM industry veteran Matt Busigin, who is the co-founder and CTO of Ollie AI and was also an investment advisor in the US, said he uses ChatGPT for household budgeting, corporate budgeting, product management and other tasks.

GPT-4 can be deployed for analysis of data releases and, in particular, natural language such as Fed minutes to make much more rapid post-announcement trading decisions.

“This definitely had alpha through most of 2022 (I was paying attention to this), but using that as an edge will probably be eroded quickly in 2023, and it will result in less market volatility post-announcement or data-release, as the information will be more efficiently processed by the markets,” Busigin told Moneycontrol.

So what is the takeaway from this experiment? Should you use generative AI tools to pick stocks?

The high profile merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank is coming to a close, and the resultant entity will be 'too big to ignore'. So much so that several mutual funds schemes will breach market regulator's norm for maximum permitted holdings in a security. According to a Moneycontrol analysis, around 60 mutual fund schemes will hold Rs 5,000 crore worth of HDFC Bank shares beyond Sebi's (Securities and Exchange Board of India) prescribed limit post merger.

As per SEBI, a mutual fund scheme cannot invest more than 10 percent in a single security. Exchange-traded funds and thematic funds are exempt from this rule.

Of the 60 funds, the largest excess exposure, to the tune of Rs 1,231 crore, will be held by Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund-Reg(G). A name from the HDFC group pops up, too. HDFC Top 100 Fund(G) will have the second highest excess exposure of Rs 720 crore.

Our calculations have also found two schemes - Tata Quant Fund-Reg(G) and Invesco India Tax Plan(G) - overshooting the limit by 5 percent. Invesco India Tax Plan(G), which has a total AUM of Rs 1,999 crore, will hold ~Rs 101 crore worth HDFC Bank shares in excess post merger.

Possible scenarios

According to a Reuters report, SEBI is unlikely to give special exemption to mutual funds if they breach the norms.

After the merger, when funds report the holdings in their schemes, they will get 30 days to rebalance, said Abhilash Pagaria, Head - Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

""The industry was prepared for this scenario. Fund managers can start adjusting their portfolios right away or sell their holdings in that 30-day period. Either way, the stock will not come under too much pressure because 20-day average trading and delivery volumes is sufficient to take care of Rs 5,000 crore impact,"" he said.

Market participants are certain that the selling will be absorbed by smart money.

""A good quality stock such as HDFC Bank always finds equilibrium in the case of a sell off being triggered due to non-fundamental reasons. Smart money by high-networth individuals and retail Investors will fill the gap left by their institutional contemporaries,"" said Ali Azar, a chartered accountant and content creator specialising in stock markets.

On May 4, HDFC Bank shares tumbled over 6 percent after index provider MSCI tweaked the adjustment factor for the combined entity. Soon after, the stock recovered a bit and is now down 1.4 percent since then.

On June 15, the stock was quoting at Rs 1,603 on the NSE, higher by 0.12 percent at 9:50 am with volumes of 1.4 million shares.

India's markets regulator is unlikely to give special exemption to mutual funds if they breach the norms for maximum permitted holdings in a security after the merger of HDFC Bank and HDFC, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

HDFC Bank and HDFC - both heavily owned by mutual funds - are set to conclude a merger in the next few weeks to create India's second-largest financial institution by assets after the State Bank of India.

However, pressure on mutual funds to reduce their holdings or any limitations on increases could be an overhang on the stock of the merged entity.

As per the rules of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), a mutual fund scheme cannot invest more than 10% in a single security. However, exchange-traded funds and funds that invest in particular sectors are exempt.

At least 60 equity mutual fund schemes will see their combined exposure to HDFC Bank and HDFC overshoot the 10% cap as of Wednesday.

HDFC Bank and SEBI did not reply to emailed requests for comments.

SEBI could consider this overshoot as a ""passive breach,"" implying no deliberate attempt to flout rules, one of the sources said. In such cases, the funds have 30 days to rebalance their portfolio, which can be extended by another 60 days, failing which the mutual funds may face regulatory action, the source added.

Regulatory intervention is warranted if there is a wider impact on the market, which is not the case here, said the second source.

Both sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.

The matter has been referred to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), according to two mutual fund executives.

Last week, AMFI officials and industry executives analysed the impact of the merger and how much of the stock the industry would need to sell to adhere to regulatory limits, the executives said.

""Considering the regulatory requirement, there will be some mutual funds that would need to sell which will create short-term pressure on the stock. However, with the prices reducing, it will create more opportunities for retail and other domestic investors to buy,"" said Deven Choksey, founder of KRChoksey Holdings Ltd, a brokerage firm.

Funds may have to offload 30 billion rupees ($364.9 million) to 40 billion rupees of the combined company's stock, said an executive with a large fund house.

""HDFC Bank and HDFC are fairly liquid stocks and have a lot of demand. This will hold true for the combined entity, too,"" the executive said, adding that funds that need to sell will find buyers.

This clause could curtail the ability of fund managers to take incremental exposure to the banking bell-weather, the chief executive of another large-sized mutual fund pointed out.

""Selling to meet the regulatory requirements could be seen by some in the market as a desperate act and the fund managers would not get good buyers at the right price,"" the person said. ""This will impact the fund's performance.""",529,-0.6116227626800537

The merger of India’s most valuable lender and the nation’s largest mortgage financier to create what could be the world’s fifth-most valuable bank is inching closer to completion, with just one key step remaining that investors are watching for closely.

Announcement of the so called ‘record date’ — or the cut-off day set for investors — for the swapping of shares of Housing Development Finance Corp. for HDFC Bank Ltd. is expected within three weeks. The merged entity is likely to trade under the HDFC Bank ticker before July 20, bringing an end to the process that began in April 2022.

The merger is unprecedented in India, creating a bank worth $168 billion and impacting over tens of millions of customers and shareholders across the two companies apart from group insurance and asset management businesses.

A central team, with 3 members from each company, and nearly three dozen committees worked on a business integration plan. Meanwhile, legal approvals were sought from shareholders, banking, securities market and competition regulators as well as stock exchanges with the final nod granted by the company law tribunal in March.

The approvals got done in good time and the integration of technology platforms is at an advanced stage, Keki Mistry, chief executive officer of the mortgage lender told Bloomberg News last week. “The target is for the merger to be effective early July,” he said.

Final Step

Once the merger is effective, a cut-off date will be announced to determine HDFC shareholders eligible to receive HDFC Bank shares. HDFC shares will stop trading on that date and it would take a week or two for allocation and listing of new shares.

HDFC Bank will allocate 42 new shares for 25 shares of HDFC. The mortgage lender said it will try to time the record date to ensure no gap takes place between HDFC shares being suspended and HDFC Bank shares being allocated to its over 740,000 shareholders.

A day before the record date will be the ex-date which marks the price adjustment between the two merging companies, said Anil Ghelani, head of passive investments and products at DSP Asset Managers Ltd.

On the ex-date, the HDFC Bank share price will adjust to incorporate the value of HDFC. This is important for key stock indexes that include the two companies, as well as overlying index funds and ETFs.

Nifty Indices’ new rules indicate HDFC will be excluded from any index on the ex-date and the value of HDFC Bank updated. Earlier rules excluded companies from the index at the beginning of the merger process. This changed soon after the HDFC merger announcement as the two financial majors are among the top five constituents of the benchmark National Stock Exchange’s Nifty50 by weightage.

Individual home loans have grown at a compounded annual rate of 16% over the last five years, according to its investor presentation.

The home loan segment is seen as a steady growth business with low delinquencies and has seen a boost since the pandemic.

While the share of portfolio will oscillate based on growth in other segments, the group is comfortable with it staying at current levels, the official said.

""We see home loans as a secured sticky product which can generate sticky deposits and spur lending into a number of home-related personal loan categories,"" the official added.

The merger, announced in April last year and set to conclude in early July, will see India's largest housing financier merge with the bank it parented in 1994 - now the country's largest private lender.

Post the deal, HDFC's 7.2 trillion rupee ($87.32 billion) portfolio will be transferred to the bank and make up about 30% of its overall loan book. This includes individual housing loans worth 6.02 trillion rupees.

The housing loan business will not function as a separate vertical, but HDFC's front-line staff will continue to lead growth in that product, while expanding offerings to other retail loans as well, the second official said.

The first official added that credit decisions for home loans will roll into the bank's broader credit department.

RUSH OF DEALS

As part of the merger, HDFC's subsidiaries will be transferred to the bank.

HDFC Bank, whose second-largest segment is its banking business, will raise its stake in the life insurance business from 48.7% to over 50%, and from 49.9% to over 50% in the general insurance segment.

Both transactions will be concluded before the merger and could happen via the open market or through bilateral deals, the officials said.

The Reserve Bank of India has also asked HDFC to sell a majority stake in its education loan arm Credila Financial Services, valued at close to $1.2 billion-1.5 billion, due to an overlap with the bank's business.

While this transaction will not conclude before the merger, negotiations are at an advanced stage, the second person said.

HDB Financial, HDFC Bank's non-bank lending arm, will continue as a separate entity and move towards a listing before 2025, the first official said.

Post the merger, foreign shareholding in the combined entity is seen at about 60%-62%, the first person said.

This could allow the bank to be added into the MSCI index for the first time since 2013, potentially bringing in foreign inflows into the bank.",519,0.9255373626947403

After a stellar show in the final quarter of FY23, banking and finance companies emerged as the top picks of analysts in May, with heavyweights like SBI, HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank garnering zero ""sell"" calls.

In contrast, the information technology (IT) pack had to bear the brunt of the Street’s ire as the slowdown in the West and the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry – led to a forgettable quarter

Overall, companies with better earnings visibility scored over their counterparts mired in macro and operational challenges. A bird in hand proved better than two in the bush.

The 'buy' list

The two companies with the perfect optimism score — zero ""sell"" or ""hold"" calls — were SBI Life and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.

SBI Life Insurance Company declared a decent set of numbers in Q4. Net profit rose 15 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 777 crore, while net premium income climbed 14 percent to Rs 19,897 crore.

The gross written premium (GWP), a key metric to assess an insurance company's fiscal health, jumped 15 percent for FY23 to Rs 67,320 crore.

Analysts were heartened by the all-round improvement in operational metrics.

“The management is confident of delivering 20–25 percent business growth in FY24E on the back of healthy demand and improving penetration owing to regulatory changes. The diversified distribution channels are expected to contribute significantly to the overall growth of the company,” brokerage KRChoksey said in a note.

The company has been maintaining its cost leadership among the private players over the past few years, despite an increase in operating costs led by increased spending on new initiatives, it added.

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), too, posted strong quarterly numbers, with revenues soaring 40 percent to Rs 5,797 crore, supported by Haifa port consolidation.

“As APSEZ embarks on becoming India's largest integrated transport utility company by 2030, it is strengthening its capabilities in all logistics segments (ports, warehousing, last mile delivery, ICDs, etc). Hence, it will offer end-t- end service to its customers thereby capturing a higher wallet share and also making the cargo sticky in nature,” analysts at ICICI Direct said.

In tandem with other Adani group stocks, APSEZ has rebounded following the rout triggered by American short-seller Hindenburg Research’s report in late January. The report accused the port-to-power conglomerate of stock manipulation and other wrongdoings. The group has denied the charges.

APSEZ is up over 87 percent over its 52-week low of Rs 394.95 hit on February 3.

The other prominent names figuring on top of analysts’ buy lists include SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Axis Bank.

Banking and finance firms had a standout quarter, marked by robust disbursements despite rising rates, healthy interest margins and stable asset quality.

Public sector banks’ cumulative profit crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark in the financial year 2023, with market leader SBI accounting for nearly half of the total earnings.

From posting a net loss of Rs 85,390 crore in 2017-18, PSBs have come a long way.

“The banking sector reported a strong 4Q FY23, driven by healthy loan growth, stable margins, and continued asset quality improvements. There were numerous drivers of credit expansion, with the retail and MSME sectors exhibiting robust growth and the corporate book displaying a healthy rebound,” brokerage Motilal Oswal said.

Declining fortunes

JSW Steel topped the pessimism list with 17 ""sell"", nine ""hold"" and just six ""buy"" calls.

Its Q4 performance was mixed -- consolidated net profit rose 13 percent to Rs 3,664 crore, even as revenue from operations stayed flat at Rs 46,962 crore.

The company also said it recorded higher-ever crude steel production as well as saleable steel sales during the quarter.

The narrative around the metal space has turned negative, given that China's demand has not really come up despite its post-Covid reopening, while recession fears in the West are further weighing on outlook.

“Though global steel consumption is facing headwinds due to inflationary pressures, high interest rate pressures, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a slowdown in China, steel demand is robust in the domestic market,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said.

Some of the most prominent names on this list, however, are IT companies.

India’s IT giants have been clobbered by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West.

“We remain underweight on IT as a sector. The macro overhang witnessed post the unfolding of regional bank issues in the US and EU impacted the growth and margin exit rates in March 2023. The companies which reported March 2023 results… expect some spillover of this weakness into the June 2023 quarter as well,” said Shibani Sircar Kurian, Senior EVP & Head-Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company.

Initial expectations of margin improvement have been kept under check on account of negative operating leverage, given the sudden ramp-downs the sector had seen.

“Overall, we expect the operating environment over the next two quarters to remain challenging due to the macro issues and cautious stance of companies on discretionary spends,” she added.

Pharma and auto companies, too, attracted a raft of ""sell"" and ""hold"" calls due to factors like revenue collapse post-Covid, negative consumer sentiment due to elevated inflation and demand headwinds.

Road ahead

Analysts say the bulk of Nifty’s earnings growth in FY24 is expected to come from sectors linked to investment and domestic consumption.

“Nifty ended FY23 with an 11% EPS growth on a high base of 34% growth in FY22. Earnings though remain lopsided with BFSI driving almost entire incremental earnings in FY23. With healthy macros, range-bound oil prices, a robust fiscal balance sheets, and moderating inflation, the backdrop for the market is quite optimistic,” Motilal Oswal said.

The Monetary Policy Committee has maintained the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent in its bi-monthly review, while continuing to keep a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook.

Five of the six-member committee voted in favour of maintaining withdrawal of accommodation stance to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.

The interest rate decision by MPC is on expected lines, though few experts were expecting a possibility of change in policy stance to neutral.

The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures.

Headline inflation is projected to decline in 2023-24 from its level in 2022-23 but would still be above the target, warranting continuous vigil, said the RBI, adding the progress of the south west monsoon is critical in this regard.

The central bank lowered its FY24 inflation projection to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent earlier, and also to 4.6 percent from 5.1 percent for Q1FY24 and to 5.2 percent against 5.4 percent for Q2FY24.

""As the RBI expects inflation to remain within its target range for the rest of the fiscal year, and with growth faring reasonably well, we think the RBI will stay on hold through the rest of FY24,"" Rahul Bajoria, MD and Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics at Barclays, said.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his policy address emphasised the need to bring down the CPI inflation to its 4 percent target consistently, saying that inflation being within the tolerance band itself was “not good enough”, Rahul pointed out.

The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is transmitting through the economy and its fuller impact should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months, the RBI said.

The central bank has maintained its current financial year growth projection at 6.5 percent, while expecting the real GDP growth for Q1FY24 at 8 percent and 6.5 percent for Q2FY24.

The market seems to have already reacted to the MPC move as the benchmark indices rallied sharply in previous session to hit the highest level of current calendar year. Today, the Nifty and Sensex turned volatile with trading in small range.

After the RBI policy decision, we collated 10 rate sensitive stocks that can deliver healthy double-digit return in the short-to-medium term from its closing price on June 7.

Mortgage lending major Housing Development Finance Corporation's (HDFC) 90 percent of short-term loans extended to certain corporations and real estate dealers have matured ahead of the merger with HDFC Bank as these loans are not permissible under the banking business rules of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said a person aware of the development.

HDFC is set to merge with HDFC Bank by July-August 2023, and the merged entity will be known as HDFC Bank.

The RBI has, however, allowed HDFC to carry forward some of these short-term loans to HDFC Bank, after the merger process.

What does this mean?

Out of HDFC Ltd’s total short-term loans worth around Rs 10,000 crore, largely given to corporates and real-estate dealers, 10 percent or Rs 1,000 crore, will be allowed to be passed on to HDFC Bank, sources said.

“These loans will mature in some time after our merger with HDFC Bank and the size of the portfolio is very small. Hence, the central bank has allowed us to keep those loans,” the person added.

Emails to the bank and the RBI seeking response to this report remained unanswered till the time of filing this copy.

On June 9, 2022, Moneycontrol was the first to report that HDFC Bank is said to have asked its parent to cut exposure to a certain category of loans that are not permitted for banks under the RBI regulations.

The mega merger

HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge on April 4, 2022. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.

In fact, back in 2015, Deepak Parekh, Chairman, HDFC Ltd, said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank, if circumstances were favourable. But the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense, provided there is no loss of value for shareholders.

On March 10, in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, HDFC Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Keki Mistry said that the merger will lead to bigger growth opportunities for the combined entity.

“Gradually, the objective is to expand housing loans from more and more branches of the bank. The growth opportunity on housing loans will be bigger in HDFC Bank (the combined entity) than HDFC,” said Mistry.

Once the deal comes into force, HDFC Bank will be 100 percent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 percent of the bank.

HDFC Bank’s suspension of a manager for alleged unruly behaviour with junior team members during a sales conference call is symptomatic of the larger issue of pressure to sell third-party financial products, experts said.

A video circulating on Twitter showed the manager shouting at his junior colleagues for not selling enough banking and financial products.

“This bears reference to a recent social media report. Basis a preliminary enquiry in the matter, the concerned employee has been suspended and a detailed investigation has been initiated which will be undertaken as per conduct guidelines of the Bank,"" HDFC Bank said in a statement made available to Moneycontrol on June 6.

The bank said it has zero tolerance for any form of misconduct at the workplace and believes in treating all employees with dignity and respect.

Deeper problem

Bankers told Moneycontrol that the incident highlighted a deeper problem: the pressure to sell third-party products such as insurance policies.

“Bankers are under lots of pressure, not only in the private sector but also in the government sector, to sell third-party products,” said a banker who did not wish to be identified.

This was one reason for the mis-selling or forced selling of financial products, the bankers said.

“We are forced to sell insurance products. Even though we are bankers, we have become agents of insurance companies,” said a manager-level employee of Bank of Baroda on condition of anonymity.

“In the last 1-2 years, core banking work has been disturbed badly as our workforce was involved more in selling insurance products,” an official said.

Gaurang Shah of Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol that ethics should be maintained above everything else. He said companies must train their employees on compliance and ethics. There are targets in all fields and for that you need team-driven qualities. One cannot use unparliamentary language or behave rudely, said Shah.

Ashwin Parekh, MD of Ashwin Parekh Consultancy, said the aggressive approach to selling insurance products is not limited to banks.

“It is also with insurance companies' agents,” said Parekh.

Not only private banks

The pressure to sell third-party products is not restricted to private banks.

In February, Moneycontrol reported that state-run bankers faced immense pressure from the top management to sell third-party products like insurance. Failure to meet targets invites informal penal actions, while meeting targets brings perks such as parties in five-star resorts, bankers told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.

Banks typically cross-sell the insurance products of their subsidiaries, and sometimes of other companies, along with loan products. Many times banks insist on the purchase of policies along with loan products.

While this has been the case for long, of late, the pressure has grown manifold on mid-level bank executives who typically do not speak in the open, fearing the wrath of senior colleagues, said bank executives.

RBI caution

On June 5, an expert panel appointed by the Reserve Bank of India under the chairmanship of former deputy governor BP Kanungo proposed a list of recommendations to improve customer service standards in regulated entities.

The proposals include reviewing charges levied by entities and extending deposit insurance cover to bank prepaid instruments and later to non-bank prepaid instruments.

It said cross-selling of third-party products should be subject to verification by the audit function to ensure there was no mis-selling and all instructions and guidelines with respect to the sale of such products are followed.",579,-0.9772704839706421

Misselling compliants

In the past, there have been instances where life insurance policies were sold to customers aged above 75 years in Tier II-III cities. Usually, branches of the banks push products of their subsidiary insurers.

Bank executives, especially from public sector banks (PSBs), are facing immense pressure from top management to sell third-party products like insurance. Failure to meet targets invites informal penal actions while meeting targets brings perks such as parties in five-star resorts.

Banks typically cross-sell insurance products of their subsidiaries, and sometimes of other companies, along with loan products. Many times banks insist purchase of policies along with loan products.

RBI caution

Last month, India’s central bank conducted a meeting with the board of directors of all public sector banks (PSBs) and private banks to discuss issues related to governance and ethics.

Concerned over rising incidence of mis-selling, the finance ministry has directed heads of public sector banks to put in place strong mechanisms to avoid unethical practices for selling insurance policies to customers.

The Department of Financial Services has received complaints that fraudulent and unethical practices are adopted by banks and life insurance companies for procuring policies from the bank customers, a letter addressed to chairpersons and managing directors of public sector banks said.",443,-0.8358797132968903

HDFC Bank will have the biggest home loan book in India after merging with parent Housing Development Finance Corporation by July, relegating State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, to the second position.

The merged entity will have a total home loan book of Rs 7.3 lakh crore, compared with SBI’s portfolio of Rs 6.4 lakh crore as of March 2023, a Moneycontrol analysis showed.

HDFC’s home loan portfolio was Rs 6.25 lakh crore, whereas that of HDFC Bank stood at Rs 1.02 lakh crore. HDFC Bank’s relatively smaller home loan book was because the bank wasn’t active in the mortgage business and typically passed on home loan customers to the parent company.

Other banks with a significant home loan book include ICICI Bank with Rs 3.46 lakh crore as of March, Axis Bank with Rs 1.57 lakh crore and Punjab National Bank with Rs 81,863 crore.

The merger is only about a month away, Sashidhar Jagdishan, managing director of HDFC Bank, said on an analyst call on May 24.

“It's now just another four or five weeks before the big day that is going to be happening, which is the merger with HDFC,” Jagdishan said.

The combined entity will have a total balance sheet of Rs 18 lakh crore and market capitalisation of Rs 14 lakh crore.

Interest income

Experts said the merger will boost the bank’s loan book and improve the net interest margin (NIM) too. NIM is the difference between interest income earned and interest paid by a bank.

According to Ashvin Parekh, MD of Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services, the NIM of HDFC Bank will improve by 175 to 200 basis points (bps).

HDFC Bank's current NIM stands at 4.1 percent.

“The quality of the housing loan portfolio will improve as HDFC will bring in a massive customer base. For a while, HDFC Bank will have the largest housing finance portfolio, but later we may see competition from other bigger players,” said Parekh.

“After the merger, HDFC Bank will be second to SBI in terms of market size. But with steady loan growth over the next five years, we can see HDFC Bank becoming the country’s largest bank,” said Aditya Shah, a banking analyst.

An analyst, who did not wish to be identified, said the Reserve Bank of India may look at reducing the repo rate, which could work in favour of the bank.

“The lowering of the repo rate will only work in favour of HDFC Bank as the deposit rate will come down,” the analyst said.

The RBI has increased the policy repo rate by 250 basis points since May 2022 and left it unchanged at 6.5 percent in April, suggesting that the central bank could start cutting rates soon. Some clarity may emerge after the RBI meeting this week.

Mortgage market

Many banks reported double-digit growth in their home loan portfolio for the quarter ended March 2023.

ICICI Bank reported an 18 percent growth in its home loan portfolio to Rs 3.46 lakh crore from Rs 2.96 lakh crore in March 2022. Axis Bank said its home loan portfolio grew 10 percent to Rs 1.57 lakh crore.

According to a report by SBI in August 2022, India’s home loan market is set to double by 2027.

“Post COVID-19, working from home has emerged as a dominant trend that is redefining the mortgage loan demand for the household sector,” SBI said.

In 2015, Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC, said his company could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were favourable.

HDFC Bank agreed on April 4 last year to take over the country’s leading mortgage company in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan. The deal was termed the biggest in India’s corporate history.

HDFC has received approval letters from RBI, Securities and Exchange Board of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority and Competition Commission of India, and BSE and National Stock Exchange of India.",715,0.99811319510142

Analysts are an optimistic bunch. They project hefty earnings per share (EPS) growth for the benchmark Nifty 50 every financial year, only to eat their words soon after.

Since FY12, Nifty earnings estimates have been revised downwards, notes Ambit Capital in a recent report. “Analysis indicates that in any financial year, EPS estimates have, on average, been revised downwards by 16 percent over the last two years, and by 8 percent on average over the last one year,” it said.

And even if the headline estimates were met, the earnings breadth remained poor. Some sectors, such as financials in FY23, powered the earnings story while sectors like consumer and utilities failed to deliver.

FY24 will be no different, believes Ambit Capital. In fact, more pain might be in store in FY24. Here’s a sector-wise analysis of the same.

Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI)

Buoyed by repo rate hikes, banks saw a significant jump in net interest margins (NIMs) in the year gone by. The banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector contributed 195 percent to Nifty’s EPS growth ― from Rs 730 in FY22 to Rs 842 in FY23.

According to Ambit Capital, the earnings trajectory will likely change in FY24 with BFSI's contribution to incremental earnings growth tapering to 43 percent. “Loan growth will moderate to 12-14 percent from 15-16 percent as credit growth in corporate stays muted and deposit growth stays anchored at 10 percent,” it said.

Valuation-wise, the firm’s pecking order is Axis Bank, SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Kotak Bank.

Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)

Last year, price hikes helped boost the topline of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies. Now, as inflation recedes, these companies have to start taking price cuts to help get back volumes.

But balancing the price-volume equation will be tricky, believe analysts. That’s because rural consumers will first prioritise deleveraging themselves, then invest in income-generating assets and eventually shift from unbranded to branded products.

“It would take some time for FMCG companies to revert to normalised volume growth of mid to high single digits,” according to Ambit Capital’s analysts. They have ‘Buy’ ratings only on Britannia and Godrej Consumer in this space.

IT

The second-largest weightage in the index is for Information Technology (IT) services, which have finally started to show cracks. In Q4, all tier-1 IT companies sounded off sluggish growth in BFSI, hi-tech, and telecom segments that make for the big clients.

Top-4 IT EBIT margin could decline 170 basis points (bps) to 20.6 percent over FY22-25E due to backfilling, deal transition, and travel costs, as per the report. Currently, Nifty IT trades at a 13 percent premium to Nifty versus a historical average of 9 percent, which makes the Street even more bearish on the sector.

Oil & gas

After dragging Nifty earnings by 42 percent in FY23, the oil and gas sector might turn the corner in FY24 on the back of China’s reopening and normalisation of the global energy market.

Ambit Capital expects oil and gas consumption to rise by 5 percent and 9 percent respectively in FY24. The increase in volumes will be accompanied by an improvement in gross marketing margins for oil marketing companies (OMCs) as crude prices trade lower. OMCs’ overall gross marketing margin is expected to be Rs 3.9 per litre in FY24.

Autos

After a year of strong volume rebound and margin expansion, this sector is set to see moderate numbers. This will be on the back of an elevated base, continued weakness in rural demand, a reversal in the tractor cycle after years of an upswing since FY20, and the introduction of stringent safety regulations like seatbelt reminders, airbags, etc., according to analysts.

Thus, Ambit Capital has ‘Sell’ ratings on Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra.

In conclusion

As these heavyweights on the index stare at an uncertain future, Ambit Capital's FY24 EPS estimate stands at Rs 940 while the consensus estimate is higher at Rs 991.

The banking sector, including both banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), sees robust growth, while there have been strong order wins in the engineering research and development (ER&D) space, Saurabh Mukherjea of Marcellus Investment Managers said.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Mukherjea shared his insights on various sectors. He mentioned that companies involved in the capital expenditure (capex) cycle, such as L&T, Siemens, and Cummins, reported strong order books.

However, weakness is seen in discretionary consumption sectors, including TTK, Jubilant FoodWorks, and Page Industries.

Mukherjea highlighted that HDFC Bank has consistently grown its loan book at 22-23 percent over 25 years, but the stock's compounding rate has been lower compared to the loan growth rate.

Marcellus Investment Managers has doubled its position in Divis Labs, which now constitutes approximately 7-8 percent of its portfolio. Divis Labs is a leading manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

Mukherjea also noted that ICICI Lombard shows good capital allocation and remains a market leader in motor insurance. Additionally, in the life insurance space, LIC has been consistently losing market share.

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Bank

At its analyst day meet, HDFCB management highlighted how the bank is getting future-ready by focusing on strengthening its digital capabilities and sustainable growth after the merger while maintaining RoA at the current level. The bank plans to announce various new initiatives to provide a superior experience to customers. For the bank, technology has moved from being an enabler to being a driver of outcomes. The bank has emphasized that running the bank includes modernizing the existing infrastructure , along with building competencies and CoE. Growth is likely to be broad-based, mainly driven by technology and expanding distribution network, while improved cross-selling will further augment revenue growth.

Outlook

The bank highlighted that the cost-to-income (C/I) ratio may remain sticky for the near term but could decline to 30% over the next 10 years. HDFCB remains one of our preferred picks and we maintain our Buy rating with a TP of INR1,950.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

Key takeaways from HDFCB analyst day were 1) Bank would protect loan growth (1.5-2.0x of the system) irrespective of its size. 2) Deposit market share is ~10% and bank would grow by gaining market share; incremental deposit accretion (18-20% market share) may not be a challenge. 3) On NIM, bank is willing to let go volumes in case of intense competition; it sold down Rs1trn of corporate loans in FY23 to not compromise on pricing. 4) Postmerger focus would shift from product-based to customer centric. Immediate benefit of the merger would be access to 25mn HDFC group customers that do not bank with HDFCB while 60-70% of HDFC Ltd. customers do not have a liability relationship with the bank. 5) Target is to bring down cost to income to 30% over the next decade (36% on merged basis in FY23). 6) RoA postmerger would be maintained between 1.9-2.1%.

Outlook

We keep multiple unchanged at 3.0x on core FY25E ABV and retain BUY with TP of Rs1,925.

A perfect cocktail of foreign and domestic flows, coupled with attractive valuations, and a pretty earnings picture, can propel the markets to new highs. The first two of these three ingredients are in place at the moment. The third one – the earnings picture – is blinking red.

Let’s dial the clock back. In September 2022, the Nifty hit a low of 16,747 and started its upmove. It hit the 18,300 mark on November 11, before touching an all-time high of 18,887.

At the time, the July-September quarter earnings were in full swing. Robust credit growth was driving the financial sector story, and IT companies were showing no signs of a slowdown. Consumer companies were basking in the glory of price hikes.

HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, HCL Tech, Tata Consultancy Services and ITC, as well as the industrials and energy space, powered by the government’s capex push, all participated in the rally.

The earnings story was powering the index. The price-to-earnings (PE) ratio for Nifty was 15 percent higher than its long-term average. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) had sold over $18 billion in equities in the first 10 months of 2022, with nervousness about rising Fed rates looming large, triggering a run towards safety (read the dollar). But, domestic investors were still betting big on the earnings story.

At record high flows of over $35 billion, domestic flows were ‘more meaningful than FII flows’ was Credit Suisse’s verdict.

What is different now?

The tide is turning now. With Fed rates perceived to be peaking by a majority of market participants, risk-on trade is back. And India, meanwhile, is looking well poised to take a fair share of the foreign money that is flowing back to emerging markets.

Currently, the Nifty is slightly below its long-term average. “Nifty trades at ~18x one-year forward P/E, which is at an 8 percent discount to the long-term average of 20x. This is a decent drop from the level of 21x, seen at the beginning of FY23,” Siddharth Khemka of Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

Valuation premiums to both the emerging and world markets have also shrunk by a fourth since October, making it an opportune time for foreign investors to buy into India again. That’s exactly what the trend has been. FIIs have bought shares worth $1.7 billion so far in May alone.

“The domestic market structure looks positive,” adds Khemka. But is it enough to sustain the momentum?

Looks unlikely. Inflow from domestic investors, which was earlier acting as a floor, has reversed. They have sold equities worth $485 million (~Rs 3,997 crore) in the last fortnight. Demat (dematerialised) account openings were at the lowest level since December 2020 with only 1.60 million accounts opened in April.

“FIIs are buying, DIIs are selling. Only when we see both groups buying for a consistent period of three or four months, we can start becoming bullish on Indian markets. The right word now would be ‘constructive’ instead of ‘bullish’,” Rahul Bhuskute, chief investment officer at Bharti AXA Life Insurance said.

What about earnings?

Most Nifty constituents recorded high double-digit EPS (earnings per share) growth in FY23, led by financials. The one sector that disappointed was metals. The rally came in 2022 but earnings did not.

It was a difficult time for the metals pack as a sharp rise in prices of raw materials, such as iron ore and fuel, as well as power expenses, dented their earnings significantly. But come 2023, the China reopening theme spurred another stock rally.

Foreign brokerages were quick to upgrade their ratings on metal stocks. “Weakening US and EU macro pose a risk to the global metal demand, but a potential improvement in China could provide an offset,” Jefferies said.

Analysts’ earnings estimates also reflect this optimism. JSW Steel, Tata Steel and Hindalco, which saw their EPS decline in FY23, could see EPS growth in FY24, as per current estimates.

But the fear of uncertainty is no stranger to markets. In April, China’s imports unexpectedly dropped 7.9 percent to $205 billion, raising concerns about a boost to global economy.

“Lingering US debt ceiling impasse, no clear signs of an uptick in Chinese consumption and slowdown concerns may continue to weigh on metal prices,” according to Ravindra Rao of Kotak Securities.

But metal stocks might be the least of the concerns when it comes to powering the index ahead. Metals and mining make for only 3 percent of the Nifty 50’s weightage.

Which sector matters the most?

It is the financials pack. It makes for more than 35 percent of the index. EPS growth for financials was a blockbuster in FY23 and the expectations for FY24 are also running though not as high as FY23.

Robust credit growth is all set to moderate, believe analysts. Nomura has projected credit growth at 10 percent in FY24 from 15 percent in FY23. It has cited diminishing levels of inflation, especially on the wholesale side which tends to lower working capital needs and an expected moderation in GDP growth to 5.3 percent in FY24 as the primary reasons for the lower bank credit growth.

Net interest margins (NIMs) are also set to come under pressure with the re-pricing of deposits kicking in.

According to Sunil Damania, chief investment officer at Marketsmojo, private capex will take a backseat in the coming months which will have a bigger impact on credit growth. “The IMF, as well as the World Bank, has declared that the world economy is going to slow down. Why would corporates put up capex at such a time,” he asks.

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Whole-Time Director KVS Manian also hinted at this during the bank’s earnings call. “Overall corporate credit growth in the banking system has not been very strong currently as the capacity creation is yet to pick up,” he said.

For now, financials continue to be at the steering wheel. Profits of the Nifty pack that have declared Q4 results so far have risen 10 percent year on year, fuelled by financials. Excluding the pack, profits would have declined 1 percent year on year, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Information Technology, which has the second-biggest weightage on the index, of 12 percent, has already put up a poor show and the EPS estimates for FY24 do not suggest any fireworks either, amidst project deferrals, cancellations and delayed ramp-ups.

A global banking crisis has come as a surprise for the IT pack. Infosys has guided for a slow FY24 and Tech Mahindra’s margins are already down to single digits.

Could things get worse? Analysts believe so.

Jefferies says cracks are beginning to appear, slightly ahead of the imminent US recession. “The entire IT pack is precariously placed,” as per the firm. It has trimmed FY24 and FY25 consensus EPS estimates by 1-6 percent and further downside risks remain.

Just like IT, the consumer pack – commanding about 10 percent weightage on the index – is also precariously placed. Pent-up demand has faded out, double-digit volume growth remains elusive and inflation has burnt a deep hole in pockets. Demand in rural India - which makes for 40-45 percent of FMCG companies' topline - remains weak. The rate of volume decline has moderated but it remains in the negative zone.

This sector is set to see the highest moderation in EPS growth, as per Bloomberg estimates. Even discretionary names, like Titan and Eicher Motors, which stand on the winning side of the K-shaped recovery, will see EPS growth moderate from 40-50 percent in FY23 to 20 percent level in FY24.

All things considered, there’s little to cheer about Nifty at 18,400. The bears have enough reasons to keep new highs in check and the bulls might have to wait longer.

Bajaj Finserv and Grasim Industries got the maximum upgrades by brokerages over the past month, while HDFC Bank received the most buy ratings at 41 amid robust quarterly results.

On the other end of the spectrum, Infosys saw the maximum downgrades, triggered by lower-than-expected earnings and a lacklustre outlook.

Sustained momentum in disbursements, healthy interest margins despite rising credit cost and stable asset quality were some of the tailwinds for the BFSI firms, analysts said.

Bajaj Finserv, which posted a 31.4 percent jump in consolidated net profit for the March quarter at Rs 1,769 crore, benefitted from strong growth in the lending business as well as lower provisions.

“Healthy pick-up in lending AUM and selective approach in insurance business coupled with focus on digitisation remain positives,” analysts at ICICI Direct Research said.

Digital transformation, client additions and ambitious targets on AUM growth (25-27 percent CAGR) will further boost profitability, they said, adding that the firm is expected to clock PAT growth of over 21 percent in the next two years.

Bajaj Finserv is a financial conglomerate that holds stakes in the financing business (Bajaj Finance), as well as in the life insurance (Bajaj Life Insurance) and general insurance (Bajaj General Insurance) businesses of the group.

Besides, Bajaj Finserv has received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for its mutual fund (MF) foray, with analysts saying its extensive distribution network and experience in the financial services space will enable it to tap the growing opportunities in the MF sector.

Grasim Industries, another diversified major with interests in sectors ranging from viscose staple fibre, to chemicals, cement and financial services, was the other stock with the most upgrades.

Grasim owns over 57 percent stake in UltraTech Cement and controls 54 percent of Aditya Birla Capital, besides small stakes in other group companies, giving it a vantage position in the domestic consumption story.

It recently announced its entry in the paints segment with a capex of Rs 10,000 crore.

“In our view, the street is not giving any value to Grasim’s maiden foray into paints business (given it is highly competitive). However, Grasim’s presence in wall-care segment (through subsidiary UltraTech Cement) offers it a fair chance to make its mark in this high growth segment,” ICICI Securities said.

“Success in paints business can drive up significant valuation re-rating over the next 2-3 years. Similarly, its foray into B2B e-commerce (mainly to trade in building materials), too, has not been ascribed any value,” the brokerage added.

However, April’s star performer was HDFC Bank with 41 ‘buy’ ratings, only 1 ‘hold’ call and zero ‘sell’ recommendations.

The country’s largest private sector bank reported a 21 percent jump in consolidated Q4 net profit at Rs 12,594.5 crore on the back of a healthy growth in revenues, net interest margins and disbursements in the retail and commercial segments.

Global broking firm Bernstein said the lender's Q4 FY23 performance met expectations and it is prepared for the HDFC merger.

HDFC Bank expects to complete its reverse merger with parent Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (HDFC) by July this year.

Earlier in April, it received some regulatory leeway from the RBI with respect to priority sector lending (PSL) norms for the merged entity, removing a big overhang on the stock.

Performance Pain

Infosys shocked the Street with Q4 numbers which were way below expectations, setting off an avalanche of ‘sell’ ratings by brokerages.

The company was jolted by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows triggered by the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry.

The Bengaluru-headquartered firm guided for revenue growth of just 4-7 per cent in 2023-24 (in constant currency terms). For context, its earlier guidance stood at 13-15 percent (for FY23) and 12-14 percent (FY22).

“The guidance bakes in an ambitious ask rate of 1.6-2.7 percent CQGR, which appears uncharacteristically H2 FY24 heavy. The company is prone to subsequent downgrades,” analysts at JPMorgan said.

The change in sentiment on discretionary spending in the US and other regions was a key highlight, with market watchers saying this will have medium-term implications not just for Infosys but smaller IT companies as well.

The other company which bore the brunt of a slowdown in global markets was Bajaj Auto.

Despite the two-wheeler company delivering an around 11 percent growth in both Q4 net profit (Rs 1,704.74 crore) and revenue (Rs 8,929.23 crore) – slightly better than estimates, a sharp drop in exports unnerved the Street.

Bajaj Auto’s exports skidded 41 percent year-on-year in the March quarter and 27 percent for the entire fiscal 2023 due to weak macro conditions and low availability of dollars.

“The domestic motorcycle industry continues to see demand weakness and management is now guiding for 6-8 percent volume growth over next few quarters for the industry,” HDFC Securities said.

Lacklustre domestic demand, led by weak recovery in the rural segment, and challenges on the export front also affected its peer Hero MotoCorp, which matched Infosys in terms of the most ‘sell’ ratings in April (9 each).

Hero MotoCorp, the country's largest two-wheeler maker, posted a 5 percent y-o-y dip in total wholesales (shipments to dealers) in April at 3,96,107 units. However, exports more than halved to 9,923 units from 20,132 units in the year-ago period.

“The company expects the momentum to build up in the coming months on account of a combination of multiple factors, including a slew of new product launches, healthy growth in the country's GDP and positive consumer sentiments,” Hero MotoCorp said in a statement.

Analysts, however, added that the traditional two-wheeler players face a stern challenge in the fast-growing EV space which is dominated by the likes of Ola Electric, Okinawa, Ampere, and Ather Energy.

Quarterly Scorecard

Bajaj Finserv, Grasim and HDFC Bank again dominated the list of companies which saw the highest number of upgrades over the past quarter.

A key addition in the mix was Bharti Airtel, which is seeing a turnaround in narrative as the telecom market transitions to the 5G era.

Analysts maintain the worst is over for the sector now.

“The single-biggest disappointment for Bharti since FY10 has been its inability to generate healthy FCF (free cash flow). It has barely registered any FCF after interest payments, which has capped value creation for shareholders through dividends, buybacks or simple net-debt-reduction, which boost equity value,” ICICI Securities said.

The major factors that adversely impacted FCF generation were competitive intensity in the telecom sector, investments needed to augment spectrum portfolio and AGR dues and penalties.

However, as the industry has now consolidated into a three-player market, the scenario is set to change. Moreover, with Vodafone Idea facing a risk to its ‘going concern’ status, an effective duopoly may be in the works.

Global brokerage Jefferies believes Vodafone Idea may potentially be able to secure incremental funding given government's support but this is unlikely to match Bharti Airtel and Jio's capex plans of $9 billion and $25 billion over the next three years.

""Initials signs are already visible in recent market share trends where in VIL has lost 3 percentage points market share in metro circles in Q3 FY23. As per calculations, Bharti Airtel's fair value could rise by Rs120 per share in a duopoly,"" it said in a research note.

Bharti Airtel has also started taking large tariff interventions supporting revenue growth, and has built a very large spectrum portfolio across technologies, which should aid in its 5G rollout.

“Bharti’s cashflow will also benefit from steady growth in non-mobile services including FTTH and enterprise. Dividends from Airtel Africa and Indus will add to India FCF generation. Spectrum moratorium is due to end in FY26 and this will increase cash outflow towards government payment from FY27,” ICICI Securities added.

No such worries for Titan, which continued to remain a market favourite due to its continued momentum and long runway for future growth.

Titan has come a long way from pioneering in just branded wrist watches to carving a place for itself in segments like jewellery, wearables, fragrances, eyewear and accessories.

“Titan has ample opportunities for growth, given its market share of sub-10% in jewellery and the ongoing challenges faced by its unorganized and organized peers. Its medium-to-long-term earnings growth potential is unparalleled,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said.

In contrast, Infosys once again topped the list of companies with the highest number of downgrades over the past quarter, followed by HDFC Life Insurance.

HDFC Life Insurance suffered from the aftershocks of the Union Budget proposals on taxing proceeds of insurance policies with premiums in excess of Rs 5 lakh and introduction of the new tax regime, which removes almost all exemptions.

The company also reported an almost flat net profit of Rs 359 crore for the fourth quarter of FY23, as against Rs 357 crore last year, even though net premium income increased 36 percent to Rs 19,426 crore.

“HDFC Life’s share price has underperformed in the past three years. Focus is expected to shift towards protection and annuity business but sustainability of margins along with healthy premium growth needs to be watched,” ICICI Direct Research pointed out.

In absolute terms, however, the company which received the most ‘sell’ ratings over the past quarter was Divi’s Laboratories.

Revenue collapse following abatement of COVID-19 conditions, no clear visibility of a significant recovery in growth or profitability in the near term and elevated valuations are major headwinds for the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) manufacturer.

Yearly Trends

Market heavyweight Reliance Industries had the maximum upgrades over the past year, with 33 ‘buy’ calls compared to 26 a year ago.

The oil-to-telecom conglomerate beat estimates with a 19 percent jump in net profit attributable to the owners of the company at Rs 19,299 crore for the March quarter of 2022-23.

Gross revenue from operations of India's most valued company came in at Rs 2.39 lakh crore, registering a year-on-year rise of 2.8 percent.

Goldman Sachs said the sequential earnings growth was led by the O2C segment on stronger gross refining margins (GRMs), and falling petchem earnings turned into a tailwind with the correction in feedstock US ethane and LPG.

The firm noted that retail continued to gain market share, with grocery revenue driven by rapid store expansion.

The capex rose to $17.6 billion in FY23 but was fully funded by cash profits. The net debt to EBITDA is well below 1x in FY23.

Many analysts said the capex/debt commentary was positive and the company's comments on disciplined capital allocation and maintaining net debt/EBITDA below 1x should assuage investor concerns on leverage.

Cigarette-to-soap maker ITC too posted better-than-expected Q4 numbers, leading to a host of positive brokerage commentary.

""With per capita consumption 1/18th of China’s, the cigarette opportunity in India remains attractive. However, with cig still contributing 85 percent to EBIT, reliance on regulated business remains high,"" Edelweiss said in a report.

The stock is trading at a discount to its Indian FMCG peers at 28.6 times its estimated earnings for FY19, and 25.2 times its estimated earnings for FY20. However, it is trading at a premium to global cigarette majors.

The domestic consumption story also boosted other names like Titan, Nestle India and HDFC Bank.

But bad tidings continued to stalk Divi’s Laboratories, which saw the most downgrades over the past year, followed by JSW Steel at 17 ‘sell’, 8 ‘hold’ and 7 ‘buy’ calls.

However, it was Wipro which emerged as the firm with the maximum number of ‘sell’ calls over the past year.

The company disappointed analysts with a 0.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in consolidated net profit for the March quarter at Rs 3,075 crore and guided for muted 1H FY24.

Motilal Oswal expects FY24 organic growth to be one of the lowest among Tier-1 IT services peers, with margins below the management’s medium-term guided range of 17.0-17.5 percent.

Indian shares declined on Friday and erased weekly gains amid weakness in financials stocks due to declines in Housing Development Finance Corp and HDFC Bank, and persistent fears over the U.S. banking sector.

The Nifty 50 closed 1.02% lower at 18,069.00, while the S&P BSE Sensex lost 1.13% to 61,054.29.

Financials stocks led the slide in the Nifty, falling 2.34% in the worst single-day drop in over three months.

Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd declined over 5.5% each after MSCI said it included the merged entity of the two companies in its large-cap index, but with an adjustment factor of 0.5.

Nuvama Research estimated this would lead to an outflow of $150 million to $200 million from the entity.

”The event is one-time, but the businesses of HDFC and HDFC Bank are perpetual,” said Avinash Gorakshakar, head of research at Profitmart Securities, adding that the fall in the shares is temporary.

Analysts expected Nifty 50 to consolidate after the recent rise on strong March-quarter earnings, but added that monsoons would be a key monitorable in the near term.

”If monsoons are poor, it will spark a slide in markets due to adverse impact on the country’s predominantly agri-linked economy and consumption,” Gorakshakar added.

European Central Bank’s rate hike and concerns in the U.S. banking sector due to the collapse of PacWest Bancorp also dragged investor sentiment.

Among individual stocks, TVS Motor Company Ltd jumped nearly 4% to a record high after reporting an uptick in March-quarter profit.

The auto index rose 0.40% and was among the top sectoral gainers in a weak market.

Contrary to Street's expectation of HDFC's merged entity commanding double the current weight in MSCI, the index provider tweaked the adjustment factor on May 5, indicating the weight will remain more or less the same.

""Previously, the adjustment factor for computing the weight of merged entity was 1x. Now, MSCI says it will be 0.5x. So, it was earlier expected that the merged entity would see $3 billion inflow. Now, MSCI's tweak could result in $150-200 million outflow,"" Abhilash Pagaria of Edelweiss Alternative Research told Moneycontrol.

At present, HDFC's weight is 6.74 percent in MSCI India Index and as per Pagaria's preliminary calculations, the merged entity will end up having a slightly lower weight of about 6.5 percent.

Both HDFC and HDFC Bank shares opened over 4 percent lower on May 5 after the MSCI tweak. At 9.20 am, HDFC was quoting at Rs 2,745 on the NSE, down 4.09 percent from the previous close and HDFC Bank shares were down 4.07 percent at Rs 1,657.50.

Why did MSCI bring down the adjustment factor?

Inclusion in MSCI index depends on a stock's foreign room. Foreign room is essentially the proportion of shares available to foreign investors relative to the maximum allowed. MSCI requires this to be at least 15 percent.

Based on the latest available shareholding disclosure, the foreign room of the merged HDFC entity is expected to be marginally above 15 percent.

""Due to volatile flows, if the foreign room comes below 15 percent by the next quarterly review, MSCI would have to change the weightage again. To avoid this, it has tweaked the adjustment factor,"" Pagaria said.

What was the expectation?

HDFC is a part of the MSCI index, while HDFC Bank is not as its foreign room does not meet the threshold.

After the merger, the non-index constituent, HDFC Bank in this case, will be considered for immediate inclusion. MSCI would have considered an adjustment factor of 1x, which could have doubled the free float market capitalisation of the entity.

This now stands changed.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) severely cracked down on the MD and independent directors of Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL), marking an inflection point in the stock market scam that siphoned off crores in investor wealth and also prompted deep and structural investor reforms.

The Karvy demat scam, when it came under the public glare, raised thorny issues of regulatory failure and brought to the fore embarrassing shortfalls in SEBI's scope of supervision. One can gauge the gravity and critical attention accorded to this issue from the recent comment of SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch, who emphatically spelt out that another Karvy-like event will happen over the regulator's dead body.

Also read: SEBI’s Brightcom order: Many firsts in a complex area that needs many more orders for conclusive jurisprudence

In an order delivered by Whole Time Member SK Mohanty, the market regulator has directed Karvy Realty (India) Limited and Karvy Capital Limited, two subsidiaries of KSBL, that were beneficiaries of illegal transfers from their parent company to return an amount of Rs 1,442.95 crore within three months. If the two beneficiary companies fail in returning the transferred funds, NSE has been directed to take control of assets of the two companies, in order to recover the amount. The aforementioned funds were transferred out of KSBL between FY17 and FY20.

The market regulator has also penalised KSBL and its MD Comandur Parthasarathy to the tune of Rs 13 crore and Rs 8 crore respectively for violations of several SEBI circulars and regulations. It has also barred KSBL and Parthasarathy from accessing the securities and dealing in securities, in any manner, for a period of seven years.

Independent directors of the company, namely, Bhagwan Das Narang and Jyothi Prasad have also been penalised to pay an amount of Rs 5 lakh. Both of them have also been restrained from holding the post of director, or any key managerial position or associating themselves in any capacity with any listed public company and any public company for a period of two years.

Lastly, CEO Rajiv Ranjan Singh, who was found to have acted negligently and failed in exercising due diligence has been cautioned and has been directed ""to be careful before associating himself as a director or any key managerial position in any intermediary of the securities market or any listed public company"".

The Karvy demat scam, which first came to light in the second half of 2019, was orchestrated by the brokerage house by pledging securities lying in the demat account of unsuspecting customers. The pledging, which happened behind the customer's back, was done to raise funds from banks and other NBFCs. Loans were raised from the likes of HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance and others.

In September 2016, KSBL’s outstanding borrowing under the loan against securities (LAS) facility offered by banks stood at Rs 789.41 crore, with the overall borrowing standing at Rs 1,051.36 crore. The said overall borrowing of KSBL increased to Rs 2,032.67 crore by September 30, 2019.

Simultaneously, there was a substantial increase in the pledging of securities by KSBL. The value of securities pledged increased from Rs 202 crore on June 30, 2017, to Rs 1,855 crore by March 2018 and had further increased to Rs 2,700 crore by September 2019.

The regulator also found out that as on September 05, 2019, at least 75 percent of the total shares in all its clients’ holdings were pledged by KSBL to borrow funds for its own use, which included cases where the clients’ holdings were pledged despite such clients having credit balances in their accounts maintained with KSBL.

""The massive asset mobilization drive followed by raising of huge sums of funds from financial institutions by using the securities mobilized from the clients with a promise to pay them interest and misappropriating those funds...speak a tell-tale story of fraud driven by the greed of KSBL and its management to amass thousands of crore of rupees at the cost of its innocent clients, making it a fit case where SEBI needs to send out a firm message to deter the stock brokers and their managements from indulging in such acts of unethical, unfair and fraudulent behaviour as observed in this case,"" the WTM observed in its order.",747,-0.9631926536560058

At least four companies, including SBI Capital Markets and Trust Investment Advisors, have submitted bids for merchant banking-cum-transaction advisor roles with Varanasi Nagar Nigam and Kanpur Municipal Corporations ahead of their proposed bond issues, according to two persons familiar with the development.

“Apart from these two merchant bankers, HDFC Bank and AK Capital Services are said to have submitted their bids,” one of the persons cited above told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.

Municipal bonds are issued by civic bodies to finance urban infrastructure projects. Merchant bankers act as intermediaries between issuers of stocks and bonds and investors. They take responsibility for the preparation of the sale prospectus and marketing.

“In the next few days the selection process of the merchant bankers will be concluded and after that issue structure will be made,” the other person cited above said.

Both corporations have invited bids to appoint merchant bankers-cum-transaction advisors for their municipal bond issues planned in the next few months.

The last date to submit their applications in the case of Varanasi Nagar Nigam was by April 21 up to 5 pm.

In the case of the Kanpur Municipal Corporation, the deadline was set at 3.30 pm on April 11. An official from the corporation told Moneycontrol that they may extend the last date of bidding by one week to get responses from more merchant bankers.

Further, the officials from Kanpur Municipal Corporation said they may raise Rs 100 crore through the municipal bonds maturing in 10 years.

On April 13, Moneycontrol reported that three municipal corporations — Varanasi Nagar Nigam, Agra Municipal Corporation and Greater Chennai Corporation — plan to raise funds through municipal bond sales.

Prior to this, Prayagraj Municipal Corporation and Kanpur Municipal Corporation are planning to issue their first municipal bonds, Moneycontrol reported on April 5.

In the last 10 years, municipal corporations have raised over Rs 4,000 crore through municipal bond sales, market participants say.

According to Prime Database data, Vadodara Municipal Corporation, Ghaziabad Nagar Nigam, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation and Indore Municipal Corporation were among the civic bodies that have sold municipal bonds since 2013.

On February 24, NSE’s index services subsidiary, NSE Indices Limited, launched India’s first municipal bond index, the Nifty India Municipal Bond Index, at a Securities and Exchange Board of India workshop on Municipal Debt Securities in Bengaluru.

The index has 28 municipal bonds issued by 10 issuers, all having a credit rating in the AA category.

Concerns on requests for proposal

Multiple merchant bankers Moneycontrol spoke to raised some concerns on the requests for proposal (RFPs) floated by some corporations recently for the appointment of merchant bankers-cum-transaction advisors.

One merchant banker on condition of anonymity said the proposed RFP for all the municipal bodies is the same with a higher weightage in technical bid given experience in advisory roles than to the merchant banking experience.

“Quality- and cost-based selection was used by which 80 percent weightage was given to the technical bid and only 20 percent weightage was given to the financial bid. This undermines the whole theme of issuance of bonds where only those with the experience in advisory roles would benefit since technical qualification emphasises advisor experience more in ULBs (urban local bodies),” said another merchant banker.",662,-0.9669082015752792

Over the weekend, all eyes were on the ICICI Bank, as the lender announced a good set of numbers on Saturday. The key numbers—both on growth and asset quality—throw up good news for the bank and map the road ahead for the industry. Typically, big bank earnings are good indicators of the banking system health and business momentum.

The lender’s loan book grew around 19 percent on a year-on-year basis, while deposits grew by 11 percent. The net interest margin, the spread between interest earned and interest expended, jumped sharply to 4.90 percent in Q4 of FY2023 as against 4 percent same period last year. These numbers add to the industry’s optimism of a sharp turnaround.

To be sure, one needs to wait for other large banks to confirm a pattern but if ICICI Bank numbers are any indication, the Indian banking industry is looking at a bull run ahead. On the asset quality front, most of the large-ticket NPA cases are either pushed to the bankruptcy court or written off.

According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, the gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) declined to 4.5 percent in December 2022 from 6.5 percent a year ago. According to RBI rules, a loan is classified as NPA if there is no repayment of principal or interest for a period of 90 days. Banks have to set aside money, called provisions, against such loans. This impacts their profitability.

Banking Central

Loan demand too is picking up and large banks are looking at quality projects to fund on the wholesale side while the broader thrust seems to be on the retail book. In case of ICICI Bank, the lender’s retail loan portfolio grew 22.7 percent on-year and comprised 54.7 percent of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2023. Its business banking portfolio grew 34.9 percent YoY on March 31, 2023, while small medium enterprises (SME) business grew by 19.2 percent YoY. ICICI Bank's rural portfolio widened 13.8 percent on-year and 5.5 percent on-quarter at March 31, 2023. The credit growth, across the industry shows signs of revival after the pandemic phase.

RBI clarification for HDFC Bank

The second major event for the banking sector was a clarification for the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger following certain requests made by the lender ahead of the merger. Among the issues the regulator has clarified, the two key ones-- related to priority sector lending obligations (PSL) and treatment of investments in subsidiaries—are important. The RBI has permitted HDFC Bank to spread the additional PSL over three years.

PSL refers to mandatory lending by banks to economically weaker sections of the society. Banks have to lend at least 40 percent of their money to such segments, of which 18 percent must be to agriculture. Given the size of the merged entity, this would have been a tremendous burden for HDFC Bank in the initial years of transition. Failure to meet PSL will require banks to invest in RIDF (Rural Infrastructure Development Fund) of Nabard. The staggered implementation of PSL will lessen the burden on the bank and impact on margins.

Also, permission to increase stake in HDFC Life and HDFC Ergo will help the bank mitigate the valuation concerns of subsidiaries. In the approaching days, we will see more banks announcing their quarterly earnings which should give further clarity on the business momentum.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

RBI provided certain key relaxations and clarifications to HDFCB related to the merger; which were 1) HDFCB (merged) can hold more than 50% stake in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO. This removes the overhang of RoE dilution in the merged entity. 2) For PSL, RBI permitted ANBC to be computed on 1/3rd of loans of HDFC Ltd. in the 1st year post merger with the remaining 2/3rd being considered over next 2 years equally. Hence merged entity would not incur any PSL cost in FY25E resulting in core PAT upgrade of 2%. 3) Bank has to comply with CRR, SLR and LCR requirements. Hence, dispensation in terms affordable housing bonds may not be available, which would increase CRR, SLR needs albeit minimally. NIM impact would be insignificant.

Outlook

Basis existing valuation of 2.6x core FY25E ABV, stock trades at a 13% premium to ICICIB. We remain constructive on HDFCB; maintain multiple at 3.0x with SOTP based TP at Rs1925. Retain ‘BUY’.

Shares of HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd surged to a one-year peak of more than 8 percent early on April 24 after the Reserve Bank of India allowed raising the stake in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO to more than 50 percent following the merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank.

The stock gained as much as 8.2 percent - its biggest since April 4, 2022 - to a high of Rs 554.60 on the BSE. At 9.35am, the stock was trading at Rs 545, up 6 percent from previous close.

According to Emkay and Nuvama Research, the decision by the RBI to hold more than 50 percent stake by HDFC twins in insurance entities is a significant boost for HDFC Life. The management has not quantified how much they will increase the stake to. The theoretical limit is 100 percent.

""We believe it should be 50-60 percent. The Street had a high probability of this relaxation coming through. In the analyst day last year, the management had explained that a higher stake would also mean higher cross-sell,"" Nuvama said.

According to Emkay, this decision will result in two major benefits for HDFC Life. First, HDFC Life will become a direct subsidiary of HDFC Bank, leading to a potential improvement in its current 50 percent share in the HDFC Bank channel, as well as an increase in margins due to an anticipated reduction in the cost of distribution in the HDFC Bank channel.

Second, the concern about a possible 19 percent stake sale by HDFC-HDFC Bank (which currently holds 48.65 percent stake in HDFC Life) if the RBI had directed them to keep their stake below 30 percent, is now eliminated, and it is confirmed that HDFC-HDFC Bank will acquire fresh or secondary over 1.35 percent stake before the merger-completion, an Ekmay report said.

Most industry experts agreed that the RBI's decision would have a positive impact on HDFC Life, but opinions were divided regarding the decision itself. ""The timing of the RBI's decision is noteworthy, as the regulatory and taxation environment for the life insurance industry is rapidly changing, which could have adverse effects. Additionally, other listed life insurance companies are facing challenges of their own. However, with the removal of the significant overhang that previously existed, HDFC Life is well-positioned to grow profitably and increase its market share,"" the report added.

Emkay has upgraded HDFC Life to 'buy' with a target price of Rs 650 a share. ""To reflect the impact of the new synergistic HDFC Bank-HDFC Life relationship, we change our FY24-25 estimates and upgrade the stock... The relatively clearer outlook for HDFC Life – at a time when listed peers are facing certain specific challenges of their own – implies that HDFC Life’s premium valuation versus peers would sustain, in our view. HDFC Life is our top pick in the sector,"" Emkay said.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Securities expects the RBI's decision to remove a key overhang on HDFC Life, which could enable an additional buying of Rs 2,200 crore into HDFC Life. The investments made by HDFC Limited can continue to be counted as investments of HDFC Bank. The brokerage adds that it will ensure complete alignment between the interests of the bank and the life insurance arm, as well as provide a boost to HDFC Life's distribution network and potential margins.",558,0.7530068026648628

Eight of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 1,17,493.78 crore in market valuation in an overall weak trend in equities last week, with Infosys taking the biggest hit.

Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank were among the eight companies that suffered a decline in their valuation. ITC and State Bank of India were the only gainers.

Last week, the 30-share BSE Sensex fell by 775.94 points or 1.28 per cent.

The market valuation of Infosys plummeted by Rs 66,854.05 crore to Rs 5,09,215 crore. Infosys Ltd on April 13 reported lower-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter net profit and gave a weak 4-7 per cent revenue growth guidance for FY24 amid tightening of IT budgets by clients following turmoil in the US banking sector.

HDFC Bank's valuation tumbled Rs 10,880.5 crore to Rs 9,33,937.35 crore.

ICICI Bank lost Rs 10,462.77 crore from its valuation which stood at Rs 6,17,477.46 crore and the market capitalisation (mcap) of TCS tanked Rs 10,318.52 crore to Rs 11,56,863.98 crore.

The mcap of Hindustan Unilever declined by Rs 8,458.53 crore to Rs 5,86,927.90 crore and that of HDFC fell by Rs 5,172.27 crore to Rs 5,06,264.24 crore.

The market valuation of Reliance Industries went lower by Rs 4,566.52 crore to Rs 15,89,169.49 crore and that of Bharti Airtel dipped Rs 780.62 crore to Rs 4,26,635.46 crore.

However, ITC's valuation jumped Rs 15,907.86 crore to Rs 5,07,373.82 crore and that of State Bank of India climbed Rs 8,746.11 crore to Rs 4,84,561.80 crore.

Reliance Industries remained the most valued firm, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, ITC, HDFC, State Bank of India and Bharti Airtel.

The country’s largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, recently said that it has received some clarifications from the banking regulator with respect to its proposed merger with the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC). These clarifications were given after the bank sought certain relaxations from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to make the process of merger smooth. The merger is expected to take effect by July this year.

A quick look at the clarifications shows HDFC Bank has received relief in certain major areas. The biggest relief is in relation to the priority sector lending (PSL) norms. Under the rules, a banking entity needs to lend 40 percent of the adjusted net bank credit to the so-called priority sector or economically weaker sections such as agriculture, micro-enterprises and other economically weaker sections.

If HDFC Bank (the combined entity) had to meet this on day 1 of the merger, it would have been a big jolt. But now, the RBI has clarified that HDFC Bank can calculate the adjusted net bank credit considering one-third of the outstanding loans of HDFC Limited as on the effective date of the amalgamation for the first year.

The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio of HDFC Limited can be considered over a period of the next two years equally, the RBI said. This means HDFC Bank will have around three years to comply with PSL norms. In fact, the PSL requirement kicks in only 12 months after the effective date of the merger, according to the bank.

In short, this will be a significant reduction in cost. The second big clarification is on the treatment of investments in subsidiaries. Investors were worried that the bank may be asked to cut stakes in key subsidiaries such as HDFC Life. Here, the RBI has clarified that investments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited are allowed to continue as investments of HDFC Bank.

The RBI has permitted HDFC Bank or HDFC Limited to increase the shareholding to more than 50 percent in HDFC Life Insurance Company and HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company. This is another major good news for the bank and investors. HDFC, as on March 2023, already has 49 percent stake in HDFC Life.

The parent company had earlier held a majority stake in HDFC Life at 50.14 percent in September 2020. To comply with RBI guidelines of 50 percent limit, the stake was cut to 49.99 percent in December 2020, 49.88 in December 2021 and to 48.65 percent in March 2023. Logically, the bank can now hike the stake in HDFC Life to over 50 percent, which may happen eventually.

Further, the RBI has permitted HDFC Bank to continue holding HDFC’s stake in HDFC Education and Development Services Private Limited, engaged in operating three education schools, for a period of two years from the effective date and HDFC Credila Financial Services Limited, subject to the shareholding being brought down to 10 percent within two years from the effective date.

In simple terms, what this all means is that HDFC Bank, post its merger, will get close control of all subsidiaries much like its rival conglomerates like ICICI Bank. One of the major concerns of investors in the run-up to the merger was the likely treatment of subsidiaries. With the RBI clarification, that worry is gone.

The not-so-good part of the clarification is that all the mandatory reserve requirements such as CRR (cash reserve ratio), SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) and LCR (liquidity coverage ratio) will be set in on the first day of the merger. But, considering the larger reliefs on PSL and subsidiary treatment, this will likely be a lesser worry for the combined entity.",630,-0.33175214131673175

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed some regulatory relief to HDFC Bank ahead of its merger with HDFC, which is a positive for the stock, analysts said.

In a regulatory filing on April 21, HDFC Bank said the RBI has allowed calculating the Adjusted Net Bank Credit (for PSL) considering only one-third of the outstanding loans of HDFC as on the effective date of the amalgamation for the first year.

The remaining two-thirds shall be considered over the next two years equally.

“Assuming PSL requirements would kick in only in FY25, PSL cost would reduce from Rs 20 bn to Rs 5 bn implying a core PAT upgrade of 2 percent,” brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a note.

Domestic banks are required to lend 40 percent of their total disbursal to the priority sector, which includes agriculture, MSMEs, education, housing, export credit and advances to weaker sections.

“The HDFC Ltd portfolio will be allowed three years (in equal instalments), after the first year post merger, to become PSL compliant. This is against the earlier assumption of 18 months from effective date to be PSL compliant,” Dhananjay Sinha of Systematix Group told Moneycontrol.

Investments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited have been allowed to continue as investments of HDFC Bank.

The RBI has also allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC Limited to increase the shareholding in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO to more than 50 percent. “This certainly removes the overhang of RoE dilution due to stake sale. Also this would be a positive for HDFC Life,” the brokerage said.

Assuming the stake would increase to 51 percent, sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) impact would be Rs 3-4 on HDFC Bank’s target price of Rs 1,925, it noted.

The stock should see a positive reaction, it added.

“The RBI rule had originally mandated that the shareholding in the insurance subsidiary can be either above 50 percent or at 30 percent. With the current HDFC Ltd shareholding in HDFC Life at 48.65 percent, there was the overhang on HDFC Life shares of the possibility of selling from HDFC Ltd to become compliant with the extant regulations,” Sinha said, adding this removes a major overhang on HDFC Life shares.

No relaxation has been granted on CRR, SLR and LCR norms, which was the consensus view and HDFC Bank has also utilised the time from announcement of merger to plan for this eventuality, he added.

In a recent note, Prabhudas Lilladher assigned a buy rating on HDFC Bank with target price of Rs 1,925. Based on April 21’s closing price of Rs 1,673.80, this implies a potential upside of nearly 15 percent.

Termed as the biggest transaction in India’s corporate history, HDFC Bank on April 4 last year agreed to take over the biggest housing finance company in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan. The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore.

The deal has got in-principle approval from the stock exchanges, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), SEBI, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), and Competition Commission of India (CCI).",580,0.6016359726587931

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC Limited to increase the shareholding in HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO to more than 50 percent, the bank informed the stock exchanges on 21 April.

The bank said the apex bank has allowed HDFC Bank or HDFC Ltd to increase the shareholding to more than 50 percent in HDFC Life Insurance and HDFC ERGO General Insurance prior to the effective date of the merger.

“Investments including subsidiaries and associates of HDFC Limited are continued as investments of HDFC Bank,” said the bank.

This is part of the clarifications provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for the merger of HDFC and HDFC Ltd, according to the filing.

Also, the central bank has allowed HDFC Bank to calculate the adjusted net bank credit considering one-third of the outstanding loans of HDFC Limited as on the effective date of the merger for the first year, the bank said.

Further, the remaining two-thirds of the portfolio of HDFC Limited can be considered over a period of next two years equally, said the bank.

But how will this impact the merged company?

According to RBI regulations, 40 percent of a bank’s total lending portfolio should be towards PSL. Out of the 40 percent, 18 percent should be towards agriculture.

Given that RBI has allowed hdfc bank to spread over the PSL liability across three years, experts said that this a positive move for the bank as it will have time to work on the portfolio and divide it across three years.

""HDFC Bank will get about 3 years to completely comply with these norms. This is positive for the bank as it can divide its lending portfolio across three year"" said Aditya Shah, a financial and banking analyst.

Experts also said that since fulfilling the PSL requirement will take time, there could be a possible marginal profit growth.

""Assuming PSL requirements would kick in only in fiscal year (FY) 2024-25, PSL cost would reduce from Rs 20 billion to Rs 5 billion implying a core profit after tax (PAT) upgrade of 2 percent,"" said a banking analyst.

Increasing stake in subsidiary

The apex bank, in 2021, in its guidelines for non-banking financial companies (NBFC) and housing finance company (HFC) said that a HFC parent company cannot hold a stake of more than 50 percent in its life insurance subsidiary.

""The maximum equity contribution such an HFC can hold in the JV Company will normally be 50 percent of the paid-up capital of the insurance company,"" RBI said in the guideline.

HDFC Ltd, as of March 2023, holds 48.65 percent stake in HDFC Life, its life insurance subsidiary. The parent company held a majority stake in HDFC Life at 50.14 percent in September 2020. After RBI guidelines, it started reducing its stake in HDFC Life from 49.88 percent in December 2021 to 48.65 percent in March 2023.

Experts said that in line with the permission of increased holding in its subsidiaries by the RBI, now the merged company will have almost all subsidiaries within itself.

One could assume that the parent company’s stake in HDFC Life could increase to 51 percent. This could impact the stock price by Rs 3-4 on its trading price of around Rs1925,” said the bank analyst mentioned above.

""HDFC Bank can even increase its stake in HDFC Credila. It will have all the subsidiaries within itself just like its closest private sector competitor, ICICI Bank. The hangover for subsidiaries gets removed. A large part of the de-rating of HDFC Life was due to the uncertainty of the merger. This goes away now,"" Shah said.

The regulator also clarified that HDFC Bank shall continue to comply with extant requirements of CRR, SLR and LCR from the Effective Date without exceptions.

The merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Deepak Parekh, the chairman of the country’s leading mortgage company, had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.

Between calendar 2012 and 2022, HDFC Bank Ltd grew its balance sheet by 22.5 percent on a compounded annual growth rate basis. Its stock returned 19.5 percent CAGR, beating peers State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. The private sector lender’s stock topped the list of every analyst’s buy ratings, be it during times of crisis or recovery.

Ever since the bank announced the merger with its parent HDFC in April last year, its stock has barely kept up with peers. Note that swallowing HDFC would instantly add more than 40 percent to the bank’s assets.

Morphing from David to Goliath isn’t easy and has costs. What complicates the matter for HDFC Bank is the management’s indication of a regulatory dispensation for the merger.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities summed this up perfectly. They noted that the bank is taking on high fixed costs through branch expansion, almost guaranteeing an elevated cost-to-income ratio.

Further, the ability to increase deposits post-merger “is still not yet established.” Lastly, key questions pertaining to the merger on regulatory dispensation are “still unanswered.”

Gearing for merger

Since a non-bank finance company would merge into a bank, regulatory costs such as cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) would be significant. Along with the merger announcement, the bank’s management alluded to discussions with the Reserve Bank of India over dispensations such as a glide path to adhere to CRR and SLR and even priority sector norms.

Most analysts said these are key aspects to the stock’s re-rating as they gave HDFC Bank an edge on earnings visibility.

“The merger outcome may take precedence over business performance, near term, with uncertainty from: a) liability-side transition, b) uncertain cost and c) PSL (priority sector lending) requirement. Given the nature of these, the impact is hard to gauge, and the outcome contingent on regulatory action/market condition,” analysts at Elara Capital wrote in a note.

To be sure, chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan made it clear to analysts during the Q2 earnings that the dispensations are good to have but are not reflected in the balance sheet projections of the bank post-merger.

“The merger is not predicated on this, the models are not necessarily assumed that these need to come. These are good to have, not necessary as such,” he said.

But when you are as consistent a performer as HDFC Bank, investors tend to take stellar numbers for granted and look for an additional earnings boost. A regulatory dispensation is just that.

Embracing an assets pile of Rs 7.01 lakh crore consisting mainly of long-term home loans entails changes to the liabilities side. HDFC’s borrowings totalled Rs 5.43 lakh crore as of December, of which 30 percent were from deposits.

Once merged with HDFC Bank, this would result in the share of borrowings in the bank’s liabilities growing to almost 20 percent. Also, the deposits would attract CRR and SLR.

That’s not all. HDFC Bank would need to garner deposits at a fast pace to keep up with the growth on an outsized asset pile now. This explains the bank’s efforts to get deposits over the past one year.

This was also where HDFC Bank won investors’ hearts through its performance in Q4 of FY23. The lender added Rs 1.5 lakh crore worth of deposits during the quarter, its biggest ever.

It hasn’t slowed its pace of branch expansion, either. The flipside? A surge in operating expenses, which analysts said will continue to stay elevated.

“Bank would continue to ramp up its branch network/customer addition to stock up deposits which may keep funding and sourcing costs elevated and the NIMs/core-PPoP (pre-provisioning operating profit) growth in check,” analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services noted in a report.

Those at Prabhudas Lilladher pencilled in operating expenses rising at a 21 percent CAGR in FY22-25.

As liabilities churn, it all comes down to margins for earnings growth.

HDFC Bank margins hold up

That margin call

The biggest selling point of the merger is the benefit of cost of funds through deposits of HDFC Bank. But this will happen over time. Meanwhile, HDFC Bank could face a short-term squeeze on margins as higher-cost borrowings come on board. Further, it is grabbing deposits during an elevated interest rate cycle.

Net interest margin shrank by 14 basis points sequentially in Q4, a sign that the bank is facing pressure on margins. Analysts at Kotak warned that most banks are mobilising deposits aggressively and that would be a big challenge for HDFC Bank.

The management has said margins will remain in a range as the bank’s fixed rate loans will get repriced, offsetting the higher cost of deposits somewhat. That said, analysts are concerned about the extent of margin pressure that may come from pursuing deposits aggressively.

“Increased competitive intensity, especially given the benign asset quality environment, will be another drag on NIM,” Kotak pointed out.

The merger with HDFC will determine the stock’s performance over the next few months. Beyond that, the odds of HDFC Bank growing at a fast pace become lesser as it gains critical mass.",876,0.16130646592692324

Don’t expect the second half of financial year 2024 (2HFY24) to be less challenging for information technology (IT) companies, contrary to the street belief of better times ahead in the June and September quarters, said Girish Pai, Head of Research at Nirmal Bang Securities, in an interview with Moneycontrol. He said the street isn’t anticipating a pricing compression, nor are the companies talking about any such compression.

Pointing to the client's behavior when the US economy was resilient, he said this behavior would worsen once the US goes even into a shallow recession.

Further, the institutional head of brokerage Nirmal Bang Securities also pointed towards more pain in store for midcap IT names in the upcoming quarter due to higher valuations, client concentration and vertical concentration, among other things. His pecking order, not considering valuations, would be TCS, Infosys and HCL Technology.

Edited excerpts from the interview.

Do investors need to panic, or was this reaction anticipated from Infosys and the IT pack? In terms of revenue growth at constant currency (CC), Infosys has managed to surpass TCS for the fourth consecutive year. However, the latter’s margin has been ahead of Infosys for the last two years. What do you make of this scenario?

If you were to compare TCS with Infosys, TCS' numbers for the 4Q (fourth quarter) have been definitely better. We saw quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth of about 0.6 percent, whereas we saw (about) 3.2 percent compression for Infosys. And as you mentioned, the commentary has also been different. TCS mentioned only deferrers. They didn't talk about cancellations. Infosys did talk about cancellations. TCS mentioned that the month of March was probably a little worse off because of the banking situation in the US and Europe, whereas we saw a diametrically opposite, but much milder commentary, from Infosys saying that March was a month of stabilisation. So, contrarian views (were) expressed by both the players when they announced results.

Obviously, TCS doesn't give guidance for the year, though it says it aspires for double-digit growth, which to me looks fairly ambitious as we speak right now. And was I expecting this kind of reaction? Yes. I mean, we have been negative on the sector for a fair bit of time. We put out an underweight stance in April 2022. And the stance of 3-5 percent growth for tier 1 stocks is something we've had for a fair bit of time since July 2022. So, the kind of numbers that Infosys talked about have not come as a great surprise to us. We've been wondering when the macro impact will come through for the fundaments of the IT service industry. So, while the commentary of the management post Q3 had been fairly positive, we've been pretty sceptical of that, and it has played out as we speak now.

Will mid-cap IT now take a sharper knock, because of vendor consolidation and valuations still at a little premium compared to the large-caps? Do you think mid-cap IT names are more vulnerable at this point in time?

I would say so, and that's the call that we've had ever since we had this underweight stance. So, as you mentioned, the multiples are more expensive than of pure tier 1 stocks, and they were vulnerable because I think client concentration and vertical concentration are much higher for tier 2 stocks. And if there is some kind of pullback in spending by any of their top 10 or top 15-20 customers, that would have an impact on the growth rates. And while they corrected quite a bit, they ran up again into Q4 results. So, some of them are fairly close to their 52-week highs. So, I would think that tier 2 would likely be under more pressure in the quarters ahead.

Tell us of that one factor that managed to surprise you. Was it the net addition number, attrition, no clarity on wage hikes, or the commentary itself?

I think the biggest thing has to be revenue growth. Revenue growth hasn't been built in and a negative operating leverage plays on the EBIT margins, so that has kind of played out. The other things have been fairly well known. These have been happening for many quarters now. Attrition has been going down. The fact that they've not been hiring in a very material way, it has been something that has been fairly visible in the last few quarters. I don't think those were surprises to the street. Revenue growth was not coming through the way people anticipated. People were anticipating a weak quarter, but the number that Infosys delivered was definitely a bit of a shocker, and the fact that the management didn't see it coming does indicate this whole issue of visibility. So, I'm not sure whether there is a great deal of visibility going into the next few quarters.

And the other thing that I keep hearing from the management is that maybe March quarter is not so great and June quarter will also not be so great. But then things should start improving towards the second half of FY24. I'm not very sure whether that is going to happen. Because the macro event that everybody is waiting or watching for would happen, which is this recession or material slowdown in the US is not behind us, it is ahead of us, which means that if customers can behave the way they have done in the March quarter, when the US economy has been fairly resilient, how they behave once US goes into even a shallow recession is something one needs to wait and watch. So, I think there's going to be pricing compression, which the street is not anticipating right now, nor are the companies talking about. So, those are some of the things that are waiting.

Let's talk about the banking sector. HDFC has managed to deliver, as usual, a very steady set of numbers. Probably the bottomline is a bit of a miss on account of the OPEX performance. But how do you look at the banking scenario playing out because there's a slew of companies from the banking sector that will be reporting numbers this week? Do you see some pain coming in for the banking names as well?

Quite a few of them have announced their credit growth and deposit growth numbers and stuff like that. Looks like this year is going to close out fairly well, at least from a loan growth perspective. The only thing is that we've seen a little bit of margin compression on QoQ basis for HDFC Bank, which I'm not sure the street was anticipating. I think, it came in at about 14 basis points (bps) on QoQ basis. The cost of deposits has gone up quite a bit and also the fairly high level of OPEX ― the company has been talking about doubling its branch network, and obviously, that would entail higher OPEX. I'm not sure whether that level of OPEX growth was something anticipated by the market immediately.

So, going into why we are positive on the banking space, because we think a lot of the asset quality problems which plagued this sector, for say, the last decade or so, have been sorted out.

The issue is more in terms of credit growth next year ― FY24 credit growth. A system of why credit growth should be in the low teens. We're building in mid-teens kind of growth for HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and some of the (other) private sector banks. If that disappoints, then I think… and with the kind of OPEX growth that HDFC Bank is talking about, we could potentially see some kind of downward revision to the operating profit growth, for say, HDFC Bank, for instance, for FY24.

So, the key thing to watch out for in FY24 would be credit growth. If credit growth disappoints, then that is going to be a bit of a challenge. But otherwise, I think things are fine. We have a neutral stance on the sector because we do worry about this credit growth aspect. But otherwise, valuations are relatively okay. I don't see a very big asset quality problem developing there. Broadly, most of those problems are behind us. There could be a few niggling issues that would probably come up next year when things slow down a bit. But otherwise, I don't see any great issues, or negative things. But, credit Growth is something to watch out for.

How about new-age companies? Motilal Oswal has come up with an initiation report on Zomato. It says that the food tech industry is still in early days, there’s a strong runway for growth ahead and Zomato to grow, but duopoly to delay scale gains. Overall, what's your view on new-age companies?

We don't cover them on an official basis. But, a lot of them are running at losses as we speak. Some of them have indicated that they will, at least on an adjusted basis, deliver EBITDA-level profits in certain parts of their businesses, not the entire business. Zomato has a food delivery business. They've also got a grocery delivery business. The food delivery business, from whatever numbers I've seen, seems to be slowing down a bit, because of consumption-related issues. Post-Diwali, consumption has been slowing down across India. That is showing up in the numbers of Zomato.

Whereas the fast-growing part of the business, which is the grocery delivery business, has an EBITDA margin problem or a profit-generation problem. That is a challenge in most of these kinds of companies. We need to study this a lot more closely. And my worry about some of these companies is the disruption that could potentially come through from some of the new entrants into the market because the absolute market cap of some of these companies is still fairly large. And it's a very nascent business, and should a very deep-pocketed conglomerate or a new investor want to enter this kind of space, I would probably think that it could be disruptive.

In terms of valuations in the pecking order, if you could put Infosys, TCS, Tech Mahindra and HCL Technologies, along with the other peers, how would that order be? And how do valuations look to you now?

TCS is probably the most expensive. But that is the company which is probably going to give you the maximum amount of comfort if you take a two-three-year view on the sector. So, if you keep valuation aside, I would say my pecking order would be TCS, Infosys and HCL Tech in that order. But having said that, if you want to look at returns with a little bit of risk, I would probably think of betting on Tech Mahindra at lower levels, even lower than where it is right now; that could be an interesting thought because, unlike other companies, there are quite a few things which can be set right. So, there is a valuation discount, fairly significant valuation discount vis-à-vis TCS and Infosys. There is a revenue growth challenge that they've always had. Their margins have been very low or (at least) in the last few quarters.

So, there are quite a few things there that can be set right. And if all of those three things can be set right by the new CEO, who is going to join the company a little later and the impact of that is going to be felt sometime later down the road. Maybe that is a stock, which could potentially give you the highest returns provided you buy it at the right price. The current price is probably not the right one; maybe another 15-20 per cent lower than where we are right now could be a good price to get in. That could be the one that could give you, in my opinion, from a three-year perspective, the best returns. Maybe it's not the best company, but from a stock perspective, that could be the best… it could deliver you the best returns from a stock perspective. I'm assuming that Mohit Joshi will deliver.",2020,-0.5836409231026968

“Companies focused on stock price will eventually lose customers. Those focused on customers will eventually boost their stock price. This is simple, but forgotten by countless managers.” - Morgan Housel

Tech stocks are to be avoided for the foreseeable future-that is the common refrain in the market right now after disappointing numbers from tech bellwether Infosys. The overall market sentiment has improved considerably over the last three weeks, but investors are in no hurry to loosen their purse strings.

Angel One

Yet another strong quarterly performance from broking firm Angel One; net profit up 30 percent year-on-year, revenue up 21 percent and operating margin up 310 basis points. This underscores a market truism that whether or not customers make money, the broker always does. But investors have cooled to the broking story a few quarters back. This can be seen from the lower valuations that broking stocks in general are now getting.

Angel has grown its net profit and revenues in eight out of the nine previous quarters, but the stock is now available at a trailing price earnings multiple of 12 times, compared to 25 times during the same time last year. The stock is a good 34 percent away from its record highs seen in April last year despite consistent growth in earnings. One reason for the apathy to broking stocks is that retail investors are not rushing to the market with the same enthusiasm as was seen till a few months back. New account openings have slowed down and are expected to stay that way for a while given mediocre returns from equity for about a year now.

But a bigger worry is that regulatory changes will make it hard for the broking industry to repeat the growth rates of the past. Sebi's greenlight for the use of ASBA in secondary markets for cash market transactions may soon extend to F&O transactions as well, many feel. This will starve brokers of the interest they have been earning on ‘float’, i.e. the customer money lying idle in trading accounts, a major revenue stream for brokers.

HDFC Bank

The stock fell over 1 percent on Monday after the company’s fourth quarter earnings fell short of what market was expecting. There were enough positives though: strong growth in loans, deposits and improvement in asset quality. Deposit growth has been a major pain point for most banks. As Digant Haria of Green Edge Wealth points out, even banks which have managed to show decent deposit growth have had to pay dearly for it.

He says that HDFC Bank’s deposit growth has come at a cost, as the bank is offering higher rates than its peers for the first time in 12-13 years. Near term outlook on banks is much better than for most other sectors. But much of the good news already appears to have been priced in. Investors will be keeping an eagle eye on net interest margins (NIMs) to decide what multiples they should be paying for bank stocks.

Rally without cheer

The recent rally in mid-caps and small-caps has been of little cheer to big ticket traders (read market operators). That’s because liquidity has not been good enough for them to be able to move in and out of large positions quickly. Many of them are said to be stuck with huge positions in flavour-of-the-season midcaps like sugar and railway. Till about a year back, operators could always count on the good offices of some friendly mutual fund and PMS fund managers to bail them out.

But average quarterly earnings from front-liners like TCS, Infosys, HDFC Bank has made investors all the more wary about second line stocks. Besides, closer scrutiny from Sebi is giving a pause for thought to portfolio managers before entering into cosy deals with market operators. In addition, investors appear reluctant to overpay for even the best of stories in this market.

In case of railway stocks, many are no longer reacting to a steady stream of order win announcements over the last couple of months, making it difficult for operators to cash in on their paper profits.

China GDP

The Chinese economy grew 4.5 percent in the first quarter, more than what opinion polls showed. This is the highest growth since the first quarter of 2022.

From CNBC.com

“But economists have warned China’s economic recovery could take longer than expected — with the likes of Citi pushing back its target for the Hang Seng index by three months. While most analysts polled by Reuters don’t expect to see a change in the central bank’s benchmark lending rate, some believe the People’s Bank of China could marginally cut its one-year loan prime rate if China’s inflation slows further.”

Wide range

Worries about a steep rise in crude prices because of the recent production cuts by OPEC may be overdone. Predictions by four energy agencies for oil demand growth in 2023 vary widely, says a report in oilprice.com.

“…..the only common theme being that all four expect demand to grow compared to 2022, but all are less optimistic than they were a year or so ago.

The OPEC Secretariat is the most optimistic, and has predicted that demand will grow by some 2.3 million barrels per day while the International Energy Agency (IEA) sees demand expanding by 2.0 mb/d. On the lower end of the spectrum, Standard Chartered is the least optimistic, and sees demand growing only 1.3 mb/d while U.S.-based Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects growth to clock in at 1.4 mb/d.”

China lithium

China’s lithium market maybe close to a bottom after a 66 percent collapse in prices over the last five months, reports mining.com.

“The declines came as companies across the battery supply chain avoided high prices by drawing on inventory rather than buying afresh, while the end to Chinese subsidies on EVs and a price war among automakers curtailed demand. Although the slump has offered some relief to downstream customers, the mineral is still over four times more expensive than the low hit in 2020.”",1020,-0.029716733623953426

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB reported an in-line quarter. PAT was up 20% YoY, supported by a healthy NII growth and lower provisions. NIMs stood stable QoQ. PPoP and Core PPoP growth remained modest at ~14% YoY each. Strong demand for Commercial and Rural Banking, and Agriculture, Corporate and retail loans led to a healthy QoQ growth in the loan portfolio. Deposits also showed strong traction. Asset quality ratios improved as slippages moderated to INR49b. The restructured book declined to 31bp of loans (v/s 42bp in 3QFY23). PCR improved to ~76%, which coupled with a contingent provision buffer (61bp of loans) should support asset quality. We uphold our earnings projection and estimate a ~19% PAT CAGR over FY23-25, with RoA/RoE at 2.0%/17.7% in FY25. A potential pick up in margins and progress on the merger would be the key monitorables. We reiterate our Buy on the stock.



Outlook

We reiterate our Buy rating with a TP of INR1,950 (premised on 3.0x Sep’24E ABV). A potential pick up on the margins and progress on the merger would be the key monitorables.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank (HDFCB) saw a mixed quarter. While core PAT at Rs120.8bn was in-line, core PPoP missed PLe by 4.4% due to weak NII which was offset by lower opex and provisions. Asset yields were below est. likely due to loans being booked towards the quarter end. Bank wants to maintain its current NIM, as funding cost rise would be offset by fixed rate loans (45% of book). Retail wholesale mix improved QoQ from 44:56 to 47:53. Retail deposit accretion was healthy (+7.5% QoQ) and its share is now 83% (80% in Mar’22). Bank added 1,479 branches in FY23 and this run-rate would continue in FY24E. However, key highlight is bank’s balance sheet which is merger ready as suggested by high cash and other assets which in the short term could drag NIM, in our view.



Outlook

Maintaining multiple at 3.0x, we roll forward to FY25E core ABV and raise TP from Rs1,850 to Rs1,925. Valuation is at 2.6x FY25 core ABV. Retain ‘BUY’.

Sharekhan's research report on HDFC Bank

Despite strong loan growth (~16.9% y-o-y/ 6.2% qoq) and lower credit cost (69bps versus 75 bps qoq), HDFCB earnings were below consensus estimates by ~ 3-4% mainly driven by higher opex growth (up 32.6% y-o-y/ 8.0% qoq). PAT reported at Rs. 12,047 crore up by 19.8% y-o-y/ down 1.7% qoq. Opex growth was higher led by continued accelerated investments in branch expansion (+9% qoq), employee addition (+4% qoq) and higher retail business volumes. Bank is taking benefit of benign credit cost to sustain future growth. Bank guided that loan growth outlook continues to remain strong. There is no slowdown in demand and strong traction in disbursements is seen across the segments. Margins are expected to remain range bound until the loan mix gradually shifts towards retail. Bank likely to sustain RoA in the range of 1.9-2.1% in near to medium term.



Outlook

We remain positive on bank however the near-term focus will continue to be on the regulatory relaxations needed for a smooth transition. Stock trades at 2.8x/2.4x its FY2024E/25E core BV estimates. We maintain our buy rating with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1920.

India's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank will complete its reverse merger with the parent Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (HDFC) by July this year, said HDFC Bank Chief Financial Officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan.

Vaidyanathan, after announcing the bank’s January-March 2023 quarterly results, in a post-results analyst call said that because of the change of regulators, they have gone to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) for its approval.

""We think it is June or possibly in July, which is where we think the timeframe is as we speak, given where we are on various things,"" said Vaidyanathan.

HDFC Ltd had received approval letters including from Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and Competition Commission of India as well as from India's stock exchanges BSE and the National Stock Exchange.

We've also gone to IRDAI because of a change of promoter on the insurance side and we are waiting for their nod,"" Vaidyanathan said.

After seeking approvals from all the regulators, Vaidyanathan said, “we will circle back with the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) to take it to the final stages”.

The merger

The merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Deepak Parekh, the chairman of the country’s leading mortgage company, had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.

The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore.

On March 10, in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, HDFC vice chairman and CEO Keki Mistry said that the merger will lead to bigger growth opportunities for the combined entity.

“Gradually, the objective is to expand housing loans from more and more branches of the bank. The growth opportunity on housing loans will be bigger in HDFC Bank (the combined entity) than HDFC,” said Mistry.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on HDFC Bank

Despite the healthy NII growth, HDFCB reported moderate core PPoP growth at 14% YoY, mainly due to higher opex as the bank continues to invest heavily into franchisee network, customer acquisition and ESOP expensing (Rs3bn). However, higher fees including TPD and lower credit cost led to in-line profitability, at Rs120bn (up 20% YoY). Overall credit growth for the bank was moderate, at 17% YoY/6% QoQ, due to some pulldown in retail credit growth (21% YoY) during 4Q, with its portfolio share at 46%. However, deposit growth came in strong (Rs1.5trn) at 21% YoY/9% QoQ, after a sub-optimal growth in 3Q on the back of healthy retail deposit growth in the run up to the merger. Overall NIM stood at 4.3% in 4Q, but the recent deposit acceleration may keep NIMs in check as the full impact is yet to play out. We have slightly cut our FY24E earnings, by 1%, factoring-in the elevated costs, but expect the standalone bank to deliver a superior RoA/RoE of 2%/17-18% over FY24-26E. Bank expects the merger to complete by July 2023, once RBI approval is in place which we believe will be critical from the point of view of the merger’s structure, including clarity on HDFC Life stake/merger of NBFC subsidiaries and regulatory dispensations, if any.



Outlook

Notwithstanding the merger-related regulatory overhang, we believe HDFCB offers the best play on India’s consumption story and is also a good defensive bet in current choppy waters. We retain a long-term BUY, with revised TP of Rs2,050/share vs Rs1,925 (valuing the core bank at 3x Mar-25E ABV) and a subs valuation of Rs87/share.

HDFC Bank share price touched a 52-week high of Rs 1,715.85 in the opening trade, however, erased the gains and was trading at Rs 1,669, down Rs 24.30, or 1.44 percent on the BSE.

The private lender has reported 21 percent year on year (YoY) rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 12,594.5 crore.

HDFC Bank posted a 20.3 percent YoY growth in consolidated net revenue at Rs 34,552.8 crore during the quarter against Rs 28,733.9 crore recorded in the year-ago quarter.

Net interest income (NII), or the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew by 23.7 percent to Rs 23,351 crore from Rs 18,872 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, HDFC Bank said in an exchange filing on April 15.

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company after the March quarter earnings:

Motilal Oswal

HDFC Bank reported an in-line quarter with healthy growth in NII, even as margins remained stable, while core pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) growth remained modest. Loan growth was driven by sustained momentum in the retail segment and robust growth in commercial and rural banking.

Asset quality ratios remained robust, while the restructured book moderated to 31bp of loans. Healthy PCR and a contingent provisioning buffer should support asset quality.

The broking house upheld its earnings projection and estimates the bank to deliver a ~19 percent PAT CAGR over FY23-25, with RoA/RoE of 2.0 percent/17.7 percent in FY25.

The brokerage reiterated its “buy” rating with a target price of Rs 1,950 (premised on 3.0x Sep'24E ABV). A potential pick up on the margins and progress on the merger would be the key monitorables.

Prabhudas Lilladher

HDFC Bank saw a mixed quarter. While core PAT at Rs 120.8 billion was in-line, core PPoP missed broking firm estimates by 4.4 percent due to weak NII which, was offset by lower operating expenses (opex) and provisions.

Asset yields were below estimates likely due to loans being booked towards the quarter end.

The bank wants to maintain its current net interest margins (NIM), as the funding cost rise would be offset by the fixed rate loans (45 percent of book). Retail wholesale mix improved QoQ from 44:56 to 47:53. Retail deposit accretion was healthy (+7.5 percent QoQ) and its share is now 83 percent (80 percent in March 2022).

The bank added 1,479 branches in FY23 and this run rate would continue in FY24E. However, the key highlight is the bank’s balance sheet, which is merger ready as suggested by high cash and other assets that in the short term could drag NIM, said the broking firm.

Maintaining multiple at 3.0x, and roll forward to FY25E core ABV, it raised the target price from Rs 1,850 to Rs 1,925 while retaining the “buy” rating. Valuation is at 2.6x FY25 core ABV.

Bernstein

The broking firm has kept an “outperform” rating on the Mumbai-headquartered lender and has set a target price of Rs 2,200 a share.

The bank's Q4FY23 performance met expectations and it is prepared for a merger, its analysts said in a report.

The report, however, also noted that the bank's EPS growth was limited due to a flat NIM and a spike in operating expenses, with an unchanged return on assets (RoA) compared to FY22.

UBS

The broking firm has maintained a “buy” rating, with a target price of Rs 1,900 a share. The report notes that HDFC Bank's Q4 results were in-line and it was getting ready for a merger.

However, the report mentions that some metrics were in-line, while lower treasury, higher operating expenses, and provisions led to a PAT miss. The report also highlights strong retail deposits and a decline in slippages, while the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) continues to fall.

The bank’s management expects stable NIMs and a higher cost-to-income (CI) ratio in FY24. The merger is expected to complete by July 2023, according to management.

The report notes that the peaking of the interest rate cycle and a fall in incremental system LDR could be a positive for the bank.

CLSA

According to a CLSA report, the bank's NII was in line, but PPoP was a miss due to operating expenses (opex). However, the report said credit costs are expected to offset high opex in FY24. The report also notes that deposits and loan mix were positive from Q4.

There was a high opex growth and asset quality provides a cushion to the bank's profit and loss (P&L).

Infosys Ltd on Thursday reported lower-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter net profit and gave a weak 4-7 per cent revenue growth guidance for FY24 amid the tightening of IT budgets by clients following turmoil in the US banking sector.

In the ranking of top-10 firms, Reliance Industries retained the title of the most valued company, followed by TCS, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, HDFC, ITC, State Bank of India and Bharti Airtel.",344,0.6473547915617625

The private lender posted a 20.3 percent YoY growth in consolidated net revenue to Rs 34,552.8 crore during the quarter, against Rs 28,733.9 crore recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2022.

Standalone revenue grew by 21 percent to Rs 32,083.0 crore for the quarter ended March, 2023 from Rs 26,509.8 crore posted a year ago.

A number of large corporations, including Kotak Bank, SBI, HUL, TCS, ICICI Pru, Tech Mahindra and HDFC, constituting a market cap of around $465 billion, or 21 percent of the Nifty weight and 17 percent of total FII holdings, are set to see a change in the corner office over the next 12 months.

Several large-cap companies such as HUL, TCS, Tech Mahindra, and ICICI Pru have announced changes in the rank of the chief executive offer (CEO) over the last few weeks. This makes a complete U-turn in the trend observed during the Covid period when too few transitions were recorded in the CEO rank.

Businesses are now dealing with a changed macro environment and geopolitical situations that make CEO changes more likely. Certain companies such as Reliance Industries have even started generational changes in leadership.

TCS leads the league of Nifty50 behemoths where the corner office sees change in occupants this year. While Krithivasan will take over as CEO and MD of TCS from June 1, HUL will have Rohit Jawa as the new CEO and MD by June 27.

Some corner offices will vacant this year because of the end of term of the reigning chief executives. Uday Kotak’s tenure as the MD and CEO of Kotak Bank will end by December 31 and Dinesh Khara’s term will be up for renewal at SBI in October. Whereas HDFC Limited will have a new CEO and MD in Sashidhar Jagdishan after the twins merge.

Assessing the Impact

Jefferies India stumbled upon surprising results as it picked up 72 CEO transitions to assess the impact of the change in the high chair. The 'zero date' was defined as one month prior to the actual announcement of the CEO change. According to the analysis, in 53 percent of the cases, the trend in the stock price did not change around the time of the transition.

In cases where there was a change, 68 percent of them were for the better, which means an underperforming stock became outperforming in six months, with a split between internal and external hires.

External hires seemed to have made a positive difference in the stock price trends in many cases. Among the 72 transitions analysed, less than 40 percent of large-caps replaced CEOs with external hires, while 55 percent of smaller-cap companies chose to hire externally.

Among sectors, it was found that the changes in CEOs triggered a disproportionate change in Staples where five out of seven saw a change in relative performance. In non-bank financials, it was eight out of 10, but practically none in consumer discretionary with only one out of 10.

The study suggests that CEO transitions do not necessarily require investors to re-look at their portfolios. However, it is important to note that this analysis only looked at the impact of CEO transitions over a six-month period from the 'zero date'. Over longer terms, other factors can influence stock performance and must be taken into account, Jefferies mentioned.",498,0.0004112422466278076

HDFC Bank, India's largest lender by market value, is all set to report its corporate earnings for the January-March 2023 period on April 15. The average of a poll of three brokerages estimates that the profits will rise to Rs 12,181 crore.

Net interest income (NII) is expected to increase 30.5 percent on-year (up 8.8 percent QoQ) to Rs 24,601.9 crore, whereas the average poll of estimates sees HDFC Bank to report 21.9 percent YoY rise in March quarter profits.

The financial results of the banking behemoth come at a time when the RBI has paused key interest rates for now but hinted at possible increases going forward in its battle to further weaken inflation without damaging economic growth. Whereas the Federal Reserve still combats the persistently high US inflation challenge with one more rate hike anticipated in the next FOMC meeting. It is due to the same only that fears of a global recession are rising.

As per brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher HDFC Bank Q4 net profit is seen up 21.8 percent YoY to Rs 12,245.4 crore. Net interest income (NII) is expected to increase 32.5 percent YoY (up 8.8 percent QoQ) to Rs 24,999.9 crore.

Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities

The Nifty has given a falling channel breakout on the daily timeframe, pointing towards a bullish trend reversal. Besides, the index has closed above the critical moving average for the second consecutive day. A positive crossover in the momentum indicator RSI will boost sentiment.

Going forward, the market will remain buy-on-dips as long as it remains above 17,500. On the higher end, immediate resistance is visible at 17,700; above which the index may move up towards higher levels.

Meanwhile, Bank Nifty continued its rally on the upside, and dips were well-bought. The index surpassed the level of 40,000 last week, and since then there has been a one-way rally.

The index is now trading around the next resistance zone of 41,000, and if it sustains above that in the upcoming week, the rally might continue to take the index towards the 42,000 mark. The lower-end support is visible at the 40,500.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India has decided to retain the repo rate at 6.5 percent with a 5:1 majority focussing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth.

The total repo rate hike by the RBI since May 2022 was 250 basis points with the objective of bringing inflation down to its target of 4 percent (+/- 2 percent).

Some experts expected one last rate hike of 25 bps, while others had forecast a long pause to assess the impact of earlier rate hikes on growth.

“This is in line with our expectations and possibly a best-case scenario and positive for the markets. The RBI has remained prudent as it evaluates the comprehensive effect of rate hikes that we saw over the last year,” said Divam Sharma, founder of Green Portfolio PMS.

Food inflation is a matter of grave concern for the RBI and it is willing to bend over backwards to slow inflation and get it back to the tolerance band, he said.

The RBI raised its growth forecast to 6.5 percent from 6.4 percent earlier, while the inflation forecast for the current financial year was lowered to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent earlier, assuming an annual average crude oil price (Indian basket) of $85 per barrel and a normal monsoon.

But it feels the lag in the passthrough of input costs could keep core inflation elevated. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 6.44 percent in February compared with 6.52 percent in the previous month.

Anil Rego, founder of Right Horizons PMS, said the unchanged stance signals that the RBI is confident of its projections and expects inflation to cool gradually.

Hence, Divam said there will be some respite for large debt companies, growth stocks, small and mid-cap space companies, and specific sectors like consumer durables and real estate in the medium term, thanks to the RBI’s decision to not hike rates.

The benchmark stock indices extended their upward journey for the fifth consecutive session amid volatility, with the BSE Sensex rising almost 52 points to 59,741 levels and the Nifty 50 climbing 19 points to 17,576 levels, at 14:01 hours IST.

Here is a list of rate-sensitive stocks that experts said can return up to 15 percent in the short term. The returns are based on the closing prices of April 5.

Expert: Viraj Vyas, technical & derivatives analyst, institutional equity, at Ashika Stock Broking

AAVAS Financiers: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,672 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,580 | Target: Rs 1,900 | Return: 14 percent

The stock has been languishing since January 2022 and is trading in a falling wedge pattern. Usually, this is a reversal pattern (bullish in this context). The RSI (relative strength index) has given a positive divergence, as highlighted in the chart.

Although there is no strength now, the stock presents a low-risk-high-reward probability. After crossing Rs 1,730, some bullishness can push the stock towards Rs 1,900.

ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 885 | Stop-Loss: Rs 840 | Target: Rs 980 | Return: 11 percent

The stock has endured a corrective leg from November 2022 and although it broke away from the falling trendline, the stock has not witnessed any follow-through beyond the Rs 880-875 zone.

Also read: MPC keeps repo rate unchanged, raises GDP growth forecast: 10 key takeaways

The stock is consolidating in a narrow range of Rs 815-875 and a sustained breakout above Rs 880 is likely to inspire a move towards Rs 940-920.

Recent volume activity too shows stronger buyer interest near the breakout, making a high probability bullish setup provided it sustains above Rs 840-850.

AU Small Finance Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 558 | Stop-Loss: Rs 585 | Target: Rs 540 | Return: 3 percent

The stock has broadly consolidated time- and price-wise since August 2021 and until recently, started forming lower highs and lower lows, breaking below the trendline around the Rs 600 mark.

The stock since then has headed towards Rs 585 and beyond, which shows bearish intent. On the RSI indicator, the stock is at 36, which denotes that it has been forming more lower lows and is in a bearish grip.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

ICICI Lombard General Insurance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,093 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,049 | Target: Rs 1,178 | Return: 8 percent

In mid-March, the stock registered a new 52-week low of Rs 1,049 and moved sideways thereafter. A bullish divergence in short-term indicators signals that the stock may bounce back, utilising the prior consolidation.

On the higher side, the stock may face a hurdle at around its prior point of polarity (Rs 1,116). As per the current set-up, the stock may surpass that hurdle easily and could move towards its 200-day SMA (simple moving average) of Rs 1,178.

In case of a decline, the stock will find support around its 52-week low.

Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 990 | Stop Loss: Rs 940 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 11 percent

After a falling channel breakout, the stock retested its extended upper band and resumed the up-move. Continuing its prior daily rising trend, the stock rose to a one-and-half-month closing high on April 5.

Key technical indicators are in favour of the bulls in the medium term as well as the short-term timeframe charts.

The stock has the potential to move towards its 200-day SMA of Rs 1,039 initially and the psychological level of Rs 1,100 subsequently.

On the lower side, the stock may respect the extended upper band of the channel.

PFC: Buy | LTP: Rs 157 | Stop Loss: Rs 149 | Target: Rs 172 | Return: 10 percent

In the last week, the stock respected its upward sloping 20-week EMA (exponential moving average) and breached its prior falling trend. Later, the stock extended gains and rose to a 12-day closing high.

The positive momentum may continue, which could lead the stock towards its long-term hurdle zone of Rs 168-172. The key technical indicators reversed from the oversold zone and gave buy signals.

In case of any decline, the stock may find intermediate support at around its 50-day EMA, which is currently Rs 150.

Expert: Rohan Shah, Head of Technical Analyst at Stoxbox

ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 885 | Stop-Loss: Rs 854 | Target: Rs 955 | Return: 8 percent

The stock plunged about 16 percent from a life high, declining from Rs 958 to Rs 796 in late January, after which it traded in a tight range. In this process, the stock recently witnessed a potential breakout from the Master Candle Pattern, with the price moving above the 20-week EMA after a good amount of time, highlighting a bullish momentum.

Also, the price decline was arrested at around its previous resistance level, which denotes polarity into play and highlights a robust price structure. Momentum indicator RSI has surpassed 50 levels with a bullish crossover, validating the bullish bias in the price.

Thes stock has the potential to scale higher towards Rs 930, followed by Rs 955, with a protective stop-loss of Rs 854.

Aditya Birla Capital: Buy | LTP: Rs 155 | Stop-Loss: Rs 146 | Target: Rs 173 | Return: 12 percent

The pattern analysis on the weekly charts exhibits a stage-2 breakout, followed by a potential base in the making. It witnessed a shakeout during the base formation and continued to hover above the breakout zone, which evinces another modest accumulation at elevated levels.

The accumulation base forming a potential Darvas box is captivating, while it trades a hair's breadth away from the ceiling near Rs 162.45.

It also shows a strong relative performance compared to the head index, which showcases further strength in the price action. We anticipate a potential upside till Rs 173 against a stop-loss of Rs 146.

Bajaj Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 5,761 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,000 | Target: Rs 4,920 | Return: 15 percent

The stock has been under pressure for many weeks, and the price has tumbled more than 25 percent since its September 2022 highs. On the price pattern front, the stock has registered a breakdown from a contracting triangle pattern, which denotes that the dominance of bears is likely to persist.

The stock has been trading below all key daily moving averages (20, 50, 100, 200), which indicates a bearish trend and lack of strength. For the past couple of weeks, the price has been consolidating at a 38.2 percent retracement level (Rs 5,650) from its prior advance from Rs 1,783 to Rs 8,050.

We sense another round of selloff once the price decisively trades below Rs 5,650. Going ahead, if the price trades below the mentioned levels, it will open the way for Rs 5,335 and Rs 4,920, with a stop-loss of Rs 6,000.

Expert: Rupak De, Senior Technical analyst at LKP Securities

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,654 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,615 | Target: Rs 1,725-1,776 | Return: 7 percent

The stock has given a swing high breakout on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in bullish bets. Besides, the stock has moved above the critical moving average on the daily timeframe.

The momentum oscillator RSI (14) is in a bullish crossover. Over the short term, the stock is likely to move towards a higher level. On the higher end, resistance is visible at Rs 1,725, above which further upside movement can happen. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 1,615.

Tata Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 427 | Stop-Loss: Rs 417 | Target: Rs 445-460 | Return: 8 percent

The stock has given a falling trendline breakout on the daily chart, suggesting a rise in optimism. Besides, the stock has moved above the 200 DMA, which points towards a positive trend.

The momentum indicator is in a bullish crossover. Over the short term, the stock is likely to move towards Rs 460. On the lower end, support is placed at Rs 417.

If we could see him diving a company in an active role, he said, ""If I find something like PharmEasy there, I am actively involved. So just like banking needed to go into the interior. We need to get quality healthcare and medicines to the interior you drive wherever you go to your own village.""

He continued, ""I do want to bring quality healthcare to all of India at a cheaper price delivered to the doorstep. That includes medicines, orthopedics, doctor on call! And I'm very passionate about that. I want to. And we are working, a couple of us are working together - the Mahindras, us, Bombay Port Trust, the government, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank to make your life more liveable. I think we will be able to come out with something soon.""

He stated that he would like to actively enter some company when the time comes. ""If there was something where I could eliminate the moneylender I would do that."" He added, ""we have the opportunity to be able to take finance and thereby take them out of the money lending business. I think that that is something that must be done. And if you give them finance, I think it will create another India,"" he said.

Anita Puri recalled the difficult days when Aditya Puri switched from Citi Bank in Kuala Lumpur to HDFC Bank in Mumbai, stating that they had to make significant lifestyle changes because Citi Bank was already established while HDFC Bank was a newborn.

On the big career move from Citi to HDFC Bank, Aditya Puri said it was a difficult decision and recalled what he told Anita, ""One day, I'll set up a bank in India that India will be proud of.""

Revealing why he decided to accept a pay cut to join HDFC Bank and the conversation he had with Chairman Deepak Parekh, he said, ""And the salary offered me, I was almost going to fall off the chair. I said, “Deepak are you bloody joking? What are we going to do?” Then I also said, “Look, if I come back, it will be to solve a passion. So whose bank will it be? How much will you run it?” And he said, “Look, you come back and you run it.”

""And I have to say, he never deviated from that. If I needed to do something, or if I needed his help, I went to him. But he never once said you do this or you do that. You have to give that credit to him. He said 'Look, come back to the country and do something',” Aditya Puri added.

Speaking on the most challenging moment for him when he was managing the HDFC Bank, he said, there were a lot of challenges, explained that they had to first set it up, and then had to see if we needed to expand and become large, how he needed to change the business due to ongoing technological advancements, geographical aspects, etc, and added: ""we wanted to be ahead of the curve. So being the first also entails risks"".

On the world's banking problems and whether India is doing things correctly, he remarked, ""If you see these collapses, and if you see also what the banking systems overseas look like, we look like a Garden of Eden.""

Reacting to Silicon Valley Bank and other bank collapses in the US, he gave full credit to the RBI and highlighted our asset liability management rules, portfolio management rules, and deposit regulations, among others. He opined, ""I think we do a damn good job, and the rest need to learn from us rather than lecture us. And I also believe that the “sone ki chidiya” is coming back.""",824,-0.5189106941223145

Global brokerage house CLSA has upgraded Kotak Mahindra Bank stock from “outperform” to “buy” tag, citing that the private lender’s risk-reward is getting favourable. The stock was trading a almost percent higher in the afternoon trade on March 27.

CLSA analysts have left the target price unchanged at Rs 2,080 a share, implying an upside of 23 percent. Its valuation premium to HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank is down 10-20 percent. ""Discounting the CEO transition, some premium to peers is justified,"" they said.

With just 2 percent market share and a formidable banking franchise, they expect Kotak to be the bank leader among large banks.

""Kotak Mahindra Bank's liability granularity has also improved with the low cost of fund gaps,"" the report added. Loan growth has picked up over the last 18 months to +20 percent driven by a higher willingness of management to lend, which allows Kotak to compete in segments like mortgages.

In Q3 FY23, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd beat Street estimates with a 31 percent growth in net profit at Rs 2,792 crore. The bank's net interest income surged 30 percent to Rs 5,653 crore, on the back of a year-on-year growth of 23 percent in loans and a jump in net interest margin to 5.47 percent from 4.62 percent.

Financial companies in India are better placed than its global peers despite global turmoil, said Jefferies in a report on the Indian financial sector. According to the global research firm, Indian firms are better placed with higher share of retail deposit, limited asset/liability management (ALM) gap and mark to market (MTM), limited dependence on AT-1 bonds and lower exposure to riskier segments like promoter and acquisition finance.

""While equities and global bonds saw pressure off-late, local bond market is stable. Post correction, valuations of some are near or below Covid lows,"" it said.

AT-1 bond market has polarised towards large/ quality banks post Yes Bank

""India had a Credit Suisse like AT-1 bond issue right around Covid when Yes Bank wrote-down AT-1 bonds and still there was some franchise value assigned to equity through capital infusion by leading banks/ NBFC. Since then, the issuances have been lower and market has become polarised towards larger and quality banks. Among banks, top three issuers are State Bank of India, HDFC Bank and Canara Bank with PSU banks having higher contribution from this,"" Jefferies said.

Valuations in some cases below Covid lows:

Valuation of Indian banks is looking fairly attractive and in some cases stocks trade below the levels during the height of Covid risk despite the fact that global events, especially in the financial sector, have stirred confidence and increased cost of equity capital (COE).

According to Jefferies, stocks above USD 5 billion in market capitalisation that are trading below the Covid-low valuations are Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance. ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank and State Bank of India are top bank picks with Bajaj Finance, Cholamandalam Investment among NBFCs. Life insurers are also attractive (and below Covid lows) but clarity on taxation of insurance policies will be key to rerating.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has cleared the way for the merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank, which is being billed to be the biggest merger in the history of Corporate India.

The country's largest housing finance company HDFC Ltd will merge with country's largest private lender HDFC Bank to create a banking behemoth.

HDFC Ltd had already received approval letters including from Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), PFRDA and Competition Commission of India (CCI) as well as from India's stock exchanges BSE and NSE.

Earlier, the tribunal had given its nod for holding a shareholders’ meeting for obtaining approval for the proposed merger.

Meanwhile, shares of HDFC Ltd and HDFC Bank were trading over 1.7 percent higher at Rs 2,575.95 and 1,578.20 apiece, respectively on BSE today during late trading hours.

The HDFC-HDFC Bank merger is expected to be completed by the second or third quarter of FY24.

On March 10, in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, HDFC Vice Chairman and CEO, Keki Mistry said that the merger will lead to bigger growth opportunities for the combined entity.

“Gradually, the objective is to expand housing loans from more and more branches of the bank. The growth opportunity on housing loans will be bigger in HDFC Bank (the combined entity) than HDFC,” said Mistry.

HDFC and HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.

Termed as the biggest transaction in India’s corporate history, HDFC Bank on April 4 last year, agreed to take over the biggest domestic mortgage lender in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan. The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore.

India Ratings has withdrawn short-term issuer rating (A1+) of 25 financial institutions, including banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC).

IndusInd Bank, in a regulatory filing, said that the agency has called off its A1+ ratings. The other financial institutions include banks like HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank among others.

The list includes NBFCs like Shriram Finance Limited, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited, Bajaj Housing Finance Limited and others.

The ratings agency said that it has withdrawn the Short-Term Issuer Rating of Issuers ""in line with regulatory requirements.""

""Short-Term Issuer Rating withdrawal is in compliance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) circular which requires credit rating agencies to use standardized rating scales and symbol,"" it added.

The agency also informed that all other outstanding ratings will remain unaffected including the ratings on short term instruments.

Regulatory norms

SEBI, in August 2022, issued rules that credit rating agencies (CRAs) have to follow standardise use of rating scales. The regulator, said that CRAs analyse and rate financial instruments, primarily looking at the debt side, and expose the risks based on the ratings they accord to the instruments. But with this, ratings are often filled with jargon and are difficult for a person to read and understand.

The norms also include details like what ‘rating outlook’ indicates.

Banking stocks look attractive now from the valuation perspective, believe foreign brokerages. After the recent corrections as well as unabated FII selling, most banks are trading below their 10-year averages.

HDFC Bank’s price-to-book value, for instance, is 3.25x while its 10-year average is about 4x. Axis Bank is trading at 2x while its 10-year average is 2.2x. State Bank of India is trading in line with its 10-year average of 1.4-1.5x.

If we look at a smaller horizon, the valuation of the financials pack is at the lower end of the range over the past three years. According to financial services firm Jefferies, valuation premium of Indian financials over emerging market financials is also near a three-year low and in line with long-term average.

These subdued valuations are making the risk-reward picture rather compelling, the brokerages believe.

“The operating environment for banks remains the best it has ever been in the last decade. Credit growth remains strong above 15 percent and a nominal GDP growth of over 10 percent would be sufficient to ensure it remains in the mid-teen levels,” according to a Bernstein report.

Further, gross non-performing assets and net non-performing assets ratio continue to decline annually as well as sequentially.

Franklin Moraes, AVP - Research at Research and Ranking, said better asset quality metrics will sustain going forward. “Since topping out in December 2022, Bank Nifty has corrected 5 percent so far. What appeared to be a panic initially caused by the Adani episode has eased out, with most banks flagging the Adani exposure being below 1 percent of their advances and backed by strong collaterals,” he said.

So is it a good time to lap up these shares?

Fund managers that Moneycontrol spoke to believe that investors should not ignore the obvious risks. “As central banks keep raising the rates, banks will face treasury losses if bond yields start moving higher beyond 7.5 percent level,” Azeem Ahmad, Head PMS and Principal Officer, LIC Mutual Fund said.

Concerns around net interest margin compression also continue to linger. The current net interest margin level for most banks is in line with the peak levels seen since 2013.

“In the near-term, banks will witness some moderation in NIMs as the benefit of faster repricing of advances over liabilities is now mostly in the numbers,” Christy Mathai of Quantum AMC added.

But, over the medium-term, banks remain well capitalised to participate in India’s economic upcycle, remains the prevailing sentiment. According to Ahmed, discretion is the better part of valor.

“One needs to be very selective and look at only frontline private and public sector banks and invest in a staggered manner. The horizon still looks gloomy especially in the coming 2-3 months,” he said.

""With the passage of time, the objective is to sell housing loans from more locations and branches of the bank,"" Mistry said.

The market, Mistry said, which currently has a penetration level of around 11 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), can reach up to 20 percent in the coming years.

In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Mistry, who is associated with the HDFC brand for nearly 42 years, also highlighted that there will be structural opportunities in housing finance as the sector has seen tremendous change.

“In the early 1980s, we were the only housing loan provider. Convincing people in the 80s that housing finance and loan would work was a major challenge. But now the sustained demand for housing loans has been strong,” Mistry said.

Post merger, there is a huge opportunity to the housing finance sector, Mistry said. and the post merger entity will provide a bigger platform for lending to the housing sector.

“Growth opportunity on loans will be a bigger opportunity in HDFC Bank than HDFC. Gradually, the objective is to expand housing loans from more and more branches of the bank,” Mistry said.

On regulatory requirements for lenders, Mistry said: “Regulator requires a 60 percent liquidity cover ratio (LCR). We have over 100 percent,” Mistry said.

LCR is a proportion of highly liquid assets which lenders keep aside to ensure enough funding during a period of uncertainty.

“Gradually, the objective is to expand housing loans from more and more branches of the bank. The growth opportunity on housing loans will be bigger in HDFC Bank (the combined entity) than HDFC,” said Mistry.

HDFC on April 4 said its board has approved the merger of its wholly-owned subsidiaries HDFC Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited with HDFC Bank Limited. As part of the plan, HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger.

Mistry said the lower regulatory costs for the merger at this point was one of the key reasons that led to the timing of the merger.

“It is not the vanishing regulatory arbitrage that led to the merger. We have time and again looked at the merger but the regulatory cost was high (earlier). Advantage of the merger was always there. Over the last 7-8 years, regulatory cost has come down for merger and benefits of the merger became stronger,” Mistry said.

Earlier, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh had cited the vanishing regulatory arbitrage as one of the reasons that led to the merger.

“Every new RBI policy entailed tightening of regulations for NBFCs,” Parekh told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on January 27 . “So, the flexibility and the light-touch regulation that an NBFC enjoyed was fast disappearing, and rightly so, because a number of NBFCs had collapsed and some had even taken public deposits,” the veteran banker said.

HDFC and HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.

But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders. On its part, the RBI has been encouraging large NBFCs to convert into banks, after the shadow lending space was shaken by the IL&FS crisis in 2018.

Not to take any executive role in the bank

Mistry said he will not take any executive role in the bank but could look at joining the board.

“I will not take any executive role in the bank,” said Mistry in the interview.

Earlier, there were speculations that Mistry might take up an executive role in the merged entity.

Replying to a question on whether the company has identified the person to head the mortgage portfolio, Mistry said non decision has been taken so far. “It's still being worked out. We have an integration committee looking at this,” Mistry said.

In the interview, Mistry said the demand for housing loans is expected to remain strong gong ahead despite high interest rates environment. “There is a sustained demand for housing loans.

What happened?

Privacy Affairs’s initial report was based on claims made by cybercriminal ‘kernelware’ on a popular hacker forum ‘Breached.vc’, where they provided 7.5 GB of customer data samples and demanded money for the full database.

The hacker claimed that the data was stolen between May 2022 and March 2023 and contained sensitive information such as customers' date of birth, full name, residential address, email address, phone number, loan information, credit scores, employment information and more. They claim to have 73 million entries.

Further, multiple customers took to social media on March 6 sharing that they received spam messages from the official HDFC Mobile Banking app and were unable to conduct online transactions. There has been a surge in spam bank text messages in the recent past, Business Standard reported.

What do the companies say?

However, HDFC Bank has continued to deny the leak and in a media statement said, “There is no data leak at HDFC Bank and our systems have not been breached or accessed in any unauthorised manner. However, we treat the matter of our customers’ data security with utmost seriousness and we continue to monitor bank systems and the ecosystem to ensure the highest standards of data security and safety.”

On the other hand, HDB Financial told Mint there was “an incident at one of our service providers, who process some of our customer information”, adding that “immediate steps” were taken to secure the service provider’s system and prevent any further unauthorised access.

“In addition, we are conducting a thorough review of the security measures adopted by the service provider to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. We have also notified the regulator and CERT-IN and we are working with them to investigate this incident to the fullest,” HDB Financial said.

While HDB Financial did not name the service provider, according to a report in Mint the company in question is Lentra.ai – a loan aggregate company that received early investment from HDFC Bank.

A spokesperson of Lentra told Moneycontrol that some reports have surfaced ""about an incident of data leak with one of our clients"".

""While the investigation is ongoing, preliminary analysis shows that only a minor part of single client reporting data has been compromised, and does not include customer banking data. We want to state that this is due to unauthorized access and there is no breach on our lending platform, nor ransomware or malware. To resolve the leak, we are working with regulators as well as the cyber police. Our commitment to ensuring data security on our platform is unwavering,"" the spokesperson added.

Nine of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 1,87,808.26 crore in market valuation last week, with HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries taking the biggest hit amid an overall weak trend in equities.

Last week, the BSE benchmark tumbled 1,538.64 points or 2.52 per cent amid concerns that the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates further to curb inflation. Fresh foreign fund outflows also dented investor sentiments.

Barring ITC, all 10 firms, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, ICICI Bank and Hindustan Unilever, were the laggards.

HDFC Bank's valuation declined by Rs 37,848.16 crore to Rs 8,86,070.99 crore at close on Friday.

The market valuation of Reliance Industries fell by Rs 36,567.46 crore to Rs 16,14,109.66 crore.

“Asset quality will improve as banks continue to provide for existing gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and incremental slippages also continue the downward trend,” said Jindal Haria, director-financial institutions, at India Ratings and Research.

A loan becomes an NPA when interest or the principal amount is not paid for 90 days. Slippage refers to the fresh addition of bad loans.

As per a CareEdge Ratings report, the gross NPAs of scheduled commercial banks fell 19.7 percent to Rs 6.1 lakh crore as of December 31, 2022, from Rs 7.5 lakh crore in the year-ago period. The gross NPA ratio reduced to 4.5 percent from 6.6 percent.

The gross NPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks is expected to reduce in FY24 due to lower incremental slippages, a reduction in special mention account books & restructuring portfolios, and healthy growth in advances, said Sanjay Agarwal, senior director at CareEdge Ratings.

Write-offs

According to CareEdge, the gross NPAs of public sector banks reduced by 17.9 percent on-year to Rs 4.6 lakh crore in the third quarter of the current financial year due to steady recoveries and upgrades, higher write-offs and lower slippages.

Their write-offs increased by 25.2 percent on-year to Rs 29,000 crore from Rs 23,000 crore in Q3 of FY22 and fresh slippages declined by 12 percent. A loan is written off when there is no hope of recovery from the borrower. Banks need to make full provisions for written-off assets.

“Banks are not expecting significant slippages from the 1.4 percent restructured portfolio,” Haria said.

Most banks reported an improvement in bad loan numbers in the third quarter.

State Bank of India reported 3.14 percent gross NPAs and 0.77 percent net NPAs, lower than 4.5 percent gross NPAs and 1.34 percent net NPAs a year earlier.

Bank of Baroda reported 4.53 percent gross NPAs and 0.99 percent NPAs, sharply lower than last year’s figures.

The star sectoral performers of 2022, the Nifty Bank and Nifty PSU Bank indices, have underperformed this year

The Nifty Bank rose about 20 percent, while the Nifty PSU Bank gained over 50 percent in 2022. The benchmark Nifty gave a modest 4 percent return.

In this calendar year so far, the Nifty Bank has declined 5 percent and the Nifty PSU Bank dropped over 10 percent, both underperforming the Nifty, which has fallen 2 percent.

Listen to the story here

One trigger that unnerved investors was the Hindenburg Research report, flagging the exposure of Indian banks, especially public sector banks, to the Adani Group. This was quickly rebutted by individual banks as well as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

State Bank of India (SBI) issued a statement that its overall exposure to the Adani Group was 0.88 percent of the book or around Rs 27,000 crore. Bank of Baroda’s total exposure stood at 0.60 percent of net loans as of end-Q3FY23.

Also Read: FM Sitharaman on Adani: LIC, SBI exposure to group within permissible limits

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said domestic banks' exposure to the Adani Group was ""not very significant"", and the system was strong and large enough to not be impacted by a single case.

What else could be troubling the sector?

Banks’ Q3 performance has been a blockbuster one, to say the least. For banks under Kotak Institutional Equities’ coverage, earnings growth came in at 45 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) in the three months to December 31, aided by operating profit growth of 30 percent YoY.

Net interest margins (NIMs) expanded and Net Interest Income (NII) growth touched a decadal high. Asset quality also improved, with gross non-performing loans at a seven-year low and net non-performing loan at a 10-year low.

But, are these numbers sustainable?

Banks’ margins quickly expanded last year due to faster repricing of floating-rate loans that are linked to external benchmark rates. Banks are always quick to hike interest on loans when the repo rate increases but raise deposit rates with a lag.

Also Read: IDBI Bank divestment: Why has it sparked so much interest?

According to Bernstein Research, the current NIM level is in line with the peak levels seen since 2013. In Q3, SBI’s NIM was 3.3 percent, ICICI Bank 4.7 percent, Axis Bank 4.3 percent and Kotak Bank’s was 5.5 percent—all peak levels seen between FY14 and now.

Now, as the repo rate inches towards peak levels, the scope for margin expansion is limited, believe analysts. “Liabilities (deposits) are getting repriced higher at a faster pace compared to loans,” according to a report by Nuvama Institutional Equities.

The fight for deposits is getting more intense and growth in loans is becoming weaker. In some cities, banks have literally taken to the streets to solicit deposits, as reported by Moneycontrol.

“Demand is now faltering in a more broad-based manner. Apart from exports, even domestic demand is seeing some cracks and corporate cashflows have weakened. This, in turn, should result in a moderation in the credit cycle going ahead,” added Nuvama.

It believes that the consensus estimate of 18 percent net profit growth for banks and 15 percent net interest income growth in FY24 looks a bit stretched and the actual numbers could disappoint.

Stocks to watch out for

Kotak Institutional Equities believes that investors should shift their stock preference towards Tier-1 banks from Tier-2 banks. That means optimism is higher for HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI compared to other banking names.

Within the private sector banks, Bernstein Research expects HDFC Bank to see a better margin trajectory than peers in the next 12 months, given its lower share of external-linked loans.

Debt-ridden telecom company Vodafone Idea has started discussions with private and public banks to refinance Rs 3,000-4,000 crore of loans to help it free up cash, The Economic Times reported on February 13, citing bankers in the know of the matter.

The refinancing will help Vodafone Idea pay substantial dues to tower companies like Indus Towers and network makers such as Ericsson and Nokia, the report said.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India on February 8 raised the repo rate by 25 bps to 6.5 percent with a 4:2 majority.

India's headline inflation, excluding vegetables, has been rising well above the upper tolerance band and may remain elevated, especially with high core inflation pressures, though the consumer price inflation eased for the third straight month in December.

The rate hike decision was as per the most of expectations by market participants. The January CPI inflation is scheduled to be announced on February 14.

According to the MPC, inflation remains a major risk to the outlook. Hence, the rate-setting panel is of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break core inflation persistence and thereby strengthen medium-term growth prospects.

And, it decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.

""Resilient high-frequency indicators and continued rate hikes by global central banks could have spurred the MPC action even as headline inflation has shown some signs of moderation. Rate hike of 25bps seems justified on the back of high persistent sticky core inflation - above 6 percent - to keep the inflation expectations anchored,"" Dhiraj Relli, MD and CEO at HDFC Securities, said.

The monetary policy acts with lags, it may take three-four quarters for the policy rate to be transmitted to the real economy, and the peak effect may take as long as five-six quarters, Relli feels.

After frontloaded rate hikes since May 2022, he said there could be a strong case now to put a brake on monetary tightening. Further rate hikes beyond 6.5 percent could pose an unwarranted risk to economic growth unless inflationary pressures re-emerge, he feels.

The market has reacted positively to the policy statement, with the BSE Sensex rising 376 points to 60,662, and the Nifty50 jumping 133 points to 17,854, at 1:02pm.

The Reserve Bank of India lowered its CPI inflation forecast for FY23 to 6.5 percent from 6.7 percent and sees 5.3 percent for FY24.

On the growth front, real GDP growth is estimated by the RBI at 6.4 percent for FY24 and the same has been raised to 7 percent for FY23 from 6.8 percent earlier, making India one of fastest growing economies.

""The risk of over-tightening always exists, however, we believe growth over inflation will take the centre stage for the RBI as the world passes through a sluggish growth phase, while the US and Europe continue with measured quantitative tightening,"" of Kunal Valia, Chief Investment Officer - Listed Investments at Waterfield Advisors, said.

The rate hike is going to add to the cost of capital and loans are going to become dearer, he feels.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,654 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,565 | Target: Rs 1,800 | Return: 9 percent

After the strong spike in price seen in the second week of November 2022, the stock has since consolidated and is showing signs of accumulation.

A move beyond Rs 1,670-1,680 is likely to spark further bullish momentum towards life highs. On the weekly chart, the stock appears to have formed a high and tight flag which is bullish continuation pattern.

Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,160 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,830 | Target: Rs 6,750 | Return: 10 percent

On the daily timeframe, the stock is trading above its 21-day EMA (exponential moving average). On the weekly chart, stock is consolidating in a triangle pattern since April 2021.

The stock has rebounded fairly well after touching the upward sloping trendline. We expect the stock to behave in a similar manner and move towards a fresh supply zone.

Poonawalla Fincorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 300 | Stop-Loss: Rs 285 | Target: Rs 340 | Return: 13 percent

After the V-shaped recovery seen during December 2022, the stock has broadly consolidated in a channel. Volume spikes were up on days when the stock was positive and strong volume participation was seen in the last session too.

The current pattern is similar to a 'Flag and Pole' which is a bullish continuation pattern.

Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,775 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,719 | Target: Rs 1,850 | Return: 4 percent

After making the top of Rs 1,997.55, the said counter has been continuously falling, resulting in a 16 percent correction. Currently, it has taken support in the zone of Rs 1,700-1,725 (which is also its historical support).

During the last few trading sessions, Kotak Bank has displayed multiple bullish candlesticks patterns (a couple of Doji's followed by a massive Bullish Engulfing structure) hinting at a possible bullish reversal.

From the indicator point of view, daily MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has made a bullish cross along with daily RSI (relative strength index) has violated its 3-month-old trendline thus confirming our bullish stance in Kotak Bank.

One can buy in the range of Rs 1,760-1,780 in small tranches and another around Rs 1,740-1,750 (if again tested), with upside target at around Rs 1,850 and with a stop-loss of Rs 1,719.

Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,160 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,975 | Target: Rs 6,500 | Return: 5.5 percent

After making the top of Rs 7,778, the said counter has been relentlessly falling which resulted in a 27 percent cut in price. Looks like it has stabilized near Rs 5,800, which is a crucial support for coming to a few sessions.

During the last few trading sessions, the said counter has witnessed nice buying interest along with volume coming in. Also double bottom is formed around Rs 5,900 level accompanied by a bullish divergence on daily RSI which are hinting at a possible bullish reversal.

One can buy in the range of Rs 6,130-6,165. The upside target is expected around Rs 6,500, with a stop-loss of Rs 5,975/

Tata Motors: Sell | LTP: Rs 435.45 | Stop-Loss: 455 | Target: Rs 415 | Return: 5 percent

Since last month, the said counter has been making a higher top and higher bottom which resulted in a whopping 22 percent return. One needs to be alert as of now because it has made a Dark Cloud Cover pattern followed by a trio of doji-like (refer to the chart) structures exactly at its historical resistance zone of Rs 455-460 which hints towards some profit in the coming few sessions.

On indicator front, daily MACD is overstretched along with daily RSI and has made an impulsive structure near 70 level which is a matter of concern and could be an early sign of bearishness in Tata Motors.

One should book profit in the range of Rs 435-440. Fresh buy is not advised as of now.

Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital

Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 267.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 249 | Target: Rs 320 | Return: 20 percent

The stock is trading at a 52-week high, which tells that the stock already is in strong momentum.

A recent breakout from a rectangle pattern, along with a gap and increased trading volume, confirms the trend's continuation to the upside.

The opening of Bollinger bands on the daily timeframe suggests rising volatility in support of an upward move.

The RSI on the daily timeframe has also demonstrated a breakout, reflecting sustained momentum in the stock's prices.

Going ahead we expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 320, where the stop-loss must be Rs 249 on the closing basis.

Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 781.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 730 | Target: Rs 865 | Return: 11 percent

After September 2022, Cholamandalam Investment now has got into the formation of Higher Highs, Higher Lows. This shows the positive undertone of the prices.

The stock has given a breakout of the Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern on February 1, 2023 which points towards the beginning of the trend to the upside.

The breakout is confirmed as it is accompanied by huge volumes and a Gap.

The stock is hovering near Upper Bollinger band which illustrate the rising volatility of the prices.

RSI on the weekly timeframe as well as on the daily timeframe is sustaining above 50 levels which shows that the prices have strong momentum in it.

We recommend traders and investors to buy this stock for the target of Rs 865 where the stop-loss must be Rs 730 on the closing basis.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,654.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,550 | Target: Rs 1,780 | Return: 8 percent

The multi-month breakout in the ratio charts of HDFC Bank against its benchmark index Bank Nifty on January 18, 2023 illustrates the outperformance.

Furthermore, the presence of higher volumes during upward price movements and lower volumes during downward price movements suggests that the demand for the stock is stronger than the supply. This can be seen as a positive signal as it may indicate that the stock has strong buying interest and that price increases are likely to be sustained.

The stock is demonstrating favourable technical signals, as multiple key moving averages, including the 50, 100, and 200-day are below prices which confirms the up move.

RSI on the weekly timeframe is sustaining above 60 mark reflecting presence of momentum for potential up move.

We recommend traders and investors to buy this stock for the target of Rs 1,780 where the stop-loss must be Rs 1,550 the closing basis.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Power Finance Corporation: Sell | LTP: Rs 143 | Stop-Loss: Rs 168 | Target: Rs 105 | Return: 27 percent

The stock respected its prior highs (Rs 139 and Rs 154) connecting rising trendline, as it reversed after testing that line (Rs 162) and moved towards its 20-week EMA (Rs 133) quite rapidly. Later, the stock witnessed a pullback after testing its 20-week EMA.

Bearish divergence on its weekly RSI and negative cross-over on MACD signals that the stock may resume its down move, wherein a stable move below its 20-week EMA (Rs 134) will accelerate the negative momentum. This could drag the stock towards Rs 110-105 zone in the medium-term.

In case of any rebound, its prior high connecting rising trendline (Rs 168) will cap the up-move. Fresh short position can be initiated at current juncture and on rise for a desired action.

L&T Finance Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 65 | Target: Rs 155 | Return: 73 percent

Since late-November 2022, the stock majorly ended last week above its long-term moving average (200-week SMA). We believe the stock is poised for a symmetrical triangle breakout, which could take it towards the breakout point of Rs 155 in the medium-term.

So far, the stock moved upwards taking support of its intermediate rising trendline. Its weekly RSI is positively poised above 50-mark since later-October 2022.

In case of major decline, the stock may find support around its lower band of symmetrical triangle pattern, which is currently placed at around Rs 65. Fresh long position can be initiated at current juncture and further after a breakout for an expected line of movement.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

With the breaking of month-long consolidation range, bears have taken charge of Dalal Street ahead of the Union Budget. In fact, it was a disheartening start to the February series on January 27 and, as a result, the market shed more than 2 percent in the passing week.

The Nifty50 closed at more than four-month low of 17,604, breaking out of the strong support at 17,800 held for a month amid consolidation and posting the biggest weekly loss since the week ended December 23.

The next support lies at 50 WEMA (weekly exponential moving average) of 17,400 after breaking the short-term moving averages of 9, 20 and 21 weeks. Experts hope to see a lot of volatility given the Union Budget week, but if the Nifty manages to hold the 50 WEMA, then there are fair chances that the index can easily surpass the 17,800-18,200 zone in the coming days, followed by 18,500.

""From an optimist point of view, it’s good that the market is approaching this event (Budget 2023) on a lighter note and any favourable outcome would lift the markets higher. On the other hand, a slight disappointment would lead to further aberration in the market,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

""Considering the ‘positive divergence’ in the ‘RSI-smoothened’ oscillator, we may expect some recovery from lower levels,"" he said.

He feels 17,700 – 17,800 are to be seen as strong hurdles. If the market has to regain strength as well as confidence, Nifty needs to surpass 18,000 on a closing basis.

The market expert advised traders to keep a note of all these scenarios and should ideally remain light ahead of the event.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the January 27 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Reliance Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,337 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 | Target: Rs 2,700 | Return: 15 percent

For the past 8 months, the stock has been in a wide trading range of Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,700. Whenever the market falls to extreme levels, Reliance falls on the lower boundary of the bearish parallel. On the other hand, Reliance was at Rs 2,700 whenever the market touched 18,500 level.

After a period of 4 months, the stock has again fallen to the level of Rs 2,300. Based on the logic of the bullish parallel channel, contra traders should be buyers at current levels and more on the downside around Rs 2,250. However, it requires a final stop-loss at Rs 2,150. On the upside, Rs 2,440, Rs 2,550 and Rs 2,700 would be major barriers.

Titan Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,331 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 | Target: Rs 2,600 | Return: 11 percent

From the lows of July 2022, the stock displayed a spectacular rally. It was at Rs 1,800 level and moved to Rs 2,790 in a period of 4 months, which is significant.

In the last 3 months, the stock is displaying a corrective move and has hit the support of 50 percent retracement ratio of the entire rally of Rs 1,000 points.

The positional/Contra traders should be buyers at current levels and more on dips at Rs 2,230. Place a stop-loss at Rs 2,150, which is slightly below the retracement level of 61.80 percent. Hurdles would be Rs 2,500 and Rs 2,600.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,616 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,500 | Target: Rs 1,750 | Return: 8 percent

The stock remained well above Rs 1,600-1,550 levels in last 3 months. In fact, whenever the stock dropped to Rs 1,600 or Rs 1,550 levels, it was quickly bought up.

In the last three days, Bank Nifty and bank stocks declined vertically, however, HDFC Bank remained the least loser.

Technically, we should be positional buyers between Rs 1,600 and Rs 1,550. Keep stop-loss at Rs 1,500. On the upside, the stock may decline towards Rs 1,680 or Rs 1,750 levels.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 346 | Stop-Loss: Rs 334 | Target: Rs 367 | Return: 6 percent

The stock has recently seen a corrective phase where prices have corrected from the high of Rs 361 to Rs 325. The stock has now given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance and has seen a gradual increase in volumes along with the price upmove.

The prices have also managed to show relative strength in the volatile markets during last week. The RSI (relative strength index) oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum and hence, we expect an upmove in the stock in the short term.

Hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities in the range of Rs 346-342. The possible near term targets for the stock are expected around Rs 358 and Rs 367. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 334.

Maruti Suzuki: Buy | LTP: Rs 8,737 | Stop-Loss: Rs 8,420 | Target: Rs 8,970 | Return: 3 percent

Post a corrective phase, the auto stocks have seen a positive momentum during last week and within this sector, Maruti has witnessed a pullback move along with rise in volumes. After the recent price-wise correction, the stock witnessed some consolidation and price volumes action indicates that the stock would resume its higher degree uptrend.

The RSI oscillator is in buy mode on the daily chart and is turning positive on the weekly charts as well.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock on dips in the range of Rs 8,620-8,600 for potential targets around Rs 8,820 and Rs 8,970. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 8,420.

Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital

KEI Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,573 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,465 | Target: Rs 1,780 | Return: 13 percent

The KEI has recently shown a bounce to the upside while taking support from the Bullish trend line which the prices have respected since May 2021.

Around the level of Rs 1,385 the stock has witnessed change in its polarity by the prices which points towards the rising bullish sentiment behind the intact trend.

The stock's price has surpassed the 20-week EMA which acted as a variable support for the prices.

While the momentum indicator RSI on the Daily timeframe has shown a Range shift which reflects the rising momentum for the prices.

Supreme Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,539 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,330 | Target: Rs 2,900 | Return: 14 percent

Supreme, is currently Trading near record Highs which tells that the stock already is in strong momentum.

The stock in the first week of November 2022 gave a breakout from the Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern which indicated beginning of the trend to the upside.

The bounce to the upside in the latest week is preceded by the prices taking support from the 16-week EMA, which acted as a strong variable support to the prices.

The RSI on the Daily timeframe has given a breakout, which reflect strong bullish momentum.

We expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 2,900 where the stop-loss must be of Rs 2,330 strictly on the closing basis.

Tata Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 445.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 390 | Target: Rs 560 | Return: 26 percent

The correction in the Tata Motors post January 2022 took in a disciplined way as the stock did not get into lower low, lower high formation.

The stock in the latest week gave a breakout from the Descending Triangle pattern which points towards the beginning of the trend to the upside.

The breakout is confirmed as it was accompanied by higher volumes and a gap.

The momentum indicator RSI has shown a bullish breakout which reflects the strong momentum in the prices.

We expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 560 where the stop-loss must be Rs 390 on the closing basis.

Emami: Buy | LTP: Rs 439 | Stop-Loss: Rs 409 | Target: Rs 480 | Return: 9 percent

In spite of the fact that the said counter has witnessed massive beating after making the high of Rs 524 on September 26, 2022 which resulted in a 22 percent cut in stock price. Since last month the said counter looks like it has stabilized around Rs 410-415 zone.

Following are some important points that are making Emami as a buy candidate:

Bullish Bat was seen on a daily scale with a potential reversal zone of Rs 415-425. Furthermore, bullish divergence was seen on the daily scale of RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence divergence). In addition to bullish divergence, trendline violation was seen on RSI. (refer to the chart).

Selling volume has dried up from the recent fall from Rs 480 to 410 thus indicating a possible turnaround. In the previous trading session, the counter witnessed decent buying of 4.5 percent supported by good volume at lower levels.

Looks like the price structure has changed since Emami has vouched for by breaking its previous swing high of Rs 438 and successfully closing near Rs 440 mark.

One can buy in the range of Rs 436-442 in a small tranche and another around Rs 420-425 (if tested again). Target is expected at Rs 480 with a stop-loss of Rs 409 on a daily closing basis.

PVR: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,740 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,649 | Target: Rs 1,825 | Return: 5 percent

At the current juncture, PVR is trying to stabilize near the 0.618 retracements of its previous rally which was started from December 2021 till August 2022.

Following are some important pointers that are making PVR a buy candidate:

Bullish AB=CD was seen on a daily scale with a potential reversal zone of Rs 1,620-1,650. Furthermore, bullish divergence was seen on the daily scale of RSI and MACD histogram. In addition to bullish divergence, trendline violation is seen on RSI. (refer to the chart).

Also, Triple bottom formation was seen on 0.618 retracement which makes PVR more lucrative at current levels.

Looks like the price structure has changed since PVR has vouched for by breaking its previous resistance of Rs 1,700 and successfully closing near Rs 1,740 mark.

One can buy in the range of Rs 1,725-1,740 in a small tranche and another around Rs 1,680-1,700 (if tested again). Target is expected at Rs 1,825 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,649 on a daily closing basis.

The key driver for the merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (HDFC) and HDFC Bank Ltd was the shrinking arbitrage between Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) and banks in terms of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations, says HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh.

“Every new RBI policy entailed tightening of regulations for NBFCs,” Parekh told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on January 27. “So, the flexibility and the light-touch regulation that an NBFC enjoyed was fast disappearing, and rightly so, because a number of NBFCs had collapsed and some had even taken public deposits,” the veteran banker said.

On April 4, 2022, HDFC, India’s largest mortgage lender, announced that it would merge with HDFC bank in a $40 billion deal.

“The overall process of merger till final NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) approval could take 7-8 months after the shareholders’ approval. We believe that the merger could be completed a few months ahead of schedule by one to two quarters,"" HDFC Bank’s chief financial officer (CFO) Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said after the announcement.

With the merger in place, HDFC Bank can eye a bigger and larger role within the banking sector and the economy as a whole.

The merger, which is expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2023, will give HDFC access to over Rs 16.7 trillion rupees in funds including low-cost current and savings account deposits and time deposits of the bank.

Parekh said the merger made sense before the full implementation of the RBI’s regulations on NBFCs. Once completed, the combined entity will emerge as a stronger organisation with a large customer base, Parekh said.

RBI regulations for NBFCs

Parekh highlighted that the merger was important before the completion of the full implementation of the RBI regulations for NBFCs.

""Banks have to maintain SLR (Statutory Liquidity Ratio), CRR (Cash Reserve Ratio) and have priority-sector loan limits, which NBFCs do not have. But, NBFCs are now required to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),” he said.

SLR is the minimum percentage of deposits that a commercial bank has to maintain in the form of liquid cash, gold, government bonds or other approved securities.

CRR is the share of a bank’s total deposits that is mandated by the RBI to be maintained with the central bank as reserves in the form of liquid cash.

LCR refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets held by financial institutions to ensure their ability to meet short-term obligations.

Further Parekh said the classification of NBFCs by RBI hinted at risk factors stemming from the large NBFCs, one of them being HDFC.

The RBI has put in place a process for classifying all NBFCs into three broad categories—the upper, middle, and base layers. The mandate is that upper-layer NBFCs include the large ones that can pose a systemic risk to the financial system, Parekh said.

“These NBFCs now have to follow bank-like regulations. So, in a way, it made sense to do the merger ahead of the full implementation of these new regulations,"" Parekh added.

A bigger opportunity for combined entity

Parekh said apart from the regulations, the scope of a bigger business opportunity also inspired the company to work on the merger.

Explaining this point, Parekh said the bank is a big player in retail credit, but its retail portfolio is a short-duration one of around 18 months. HDFC bank does not give mortgage loans because this is HDFC’s core business. With the merger happening, this issue can be addressed, Parekh said.

“Now, as a combined entity, the bank will get long-term mortgage loans which will increase the duration of the retail portfolio. Further, with a larger customer base, the bank will be able to do a lot more cross-selling of products."" the veteran banker said.

Inflation and rate hikes

To fight inflation, the RBI in the current rate hike cycle has increased the repo rate by 225 basis points. The repo rate is the rate at which RBI lends short-term funds to banks. One basis point is one- hundredth of a percentage point.

On how NBFCs guided the rate hike scenario, Parekh said: “We have to take care of so many, many moving parts and the RBI rightly articulated that it will rein in inflation, but would also keep in mind economic growth considerations.”

With inflation beginning to ease, Parekh said that central banks around the world have stopped their mega rate hikes.

“Even globally, with inflation beginning to ease a bit, I think the days of jumbo interest rate hikes by central banks are behind us now,” Parekh said.",760,0.6669004956881205

At 78, Deepak Parekh may have given up alcohol, but there is one habit he still holds on to. When Moneycontrol caught up with the chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation at his sixth-floor office in HDFC House, Nariman Point, Parekh admitted that he flouted most rules of good health through most of his life, but lost his taste for alcohol after battling Covid-19.

“I can admit that I mostly flouted all the rules in life when it comes to good health. I ate everything and used to enjoy a drink almost every night,” the veteran banker confessed. “Then in December 2021, I got Covid and post that, I've just lost the fondness for any alcohol. Even with friends, they'll drink while I’ll just have nimbu paani.”

But there is one habit he has no plans of giving up. “The one thing I won’t give up is doing a Sudoku every night before I sleep,” said Deepak Parekh, adding that the logic puzzle keeps his mind sharp.

“I’ll work on the most challenging, hardest Sudokus I can get my hands on. That excites me and helps keep the mind sharp,” he told Moneycontrol.

Parekh stepped down as CEO of HDFC more than a decade ago, but it’s clear he likes to remain in the thick of things. In fact, he still comes to office for a few hours every day, mostly for meetings and to stay connected with what’s happening in the business world. The 78-year-old is still on the boards of HDFC Life, HDFC AMC and Siemens India.

His focus these days is on ensuring that the mega-merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank goes through smoothly. This could take a bit of time, given that it entails approvals from Indian and US authorities (HDFC offers American Depository Receipts, too).

He had said last year that once this is done, he is looking forward to “keep my feet up and relax”. By his own admission, though, his Sudoku-a-day routine is unlikely to change even after the merger is done and dusted.",345,0.5803828835487366

The market ended a volatile week on a positive note on January 20, and sustained an upward swing for the the second straight week, with the Nifty taking support at the psychological 18,000 mark.

The index remained rangebound and formed a Doji candle for yet another week on the weekly scale with a higher-high-higher-low formation, as the closing was near its opening level, indicating indecisiveness among buyers and sellers about future market trend.

The index closed with 71 points gains at 18,028 for last week and has overall been consolidating within a tight range of 17,800-18,200 especially amid quarterly earnings and ahead of the Union Budget scheduled to be tabled in Parliament by the finance minister on February 1.

Experts feel the above range is expected to break on either side after the announcement of the Budget, hence, if the index breaks 18,200, then 18,500 is the level to watch out for as crossing it could bring a sharp upside, whereas the downside could be up to 17,500 if there is a decisive break of 17,800-17,900 levels.

""As far as levels are concerned, the rock-solid support is visible at 17,900 – 17,750 and bulls have till now managed to defend it in a challenging environment. On the flipside, it has become a daunting task to surpass the hurdle of 18,150–18,300,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

The way our markets have undergone a long time-wise correction, he expects the breakout to happen soon from this contracted range.

He feels the week beginning today may see some action, although it will be a truncated one as the expiry is advanced by a day on account of the Republic Day on Thursday. ""Also, it’s important to understand that we are inching closer to the Union Budget and hence, the market would try to position itself ahead of this mega event,"" he said.

The stock-specific action is expected to continue in the current week too, given the ongoing corporate earnings season and Budget expectations, experts feel.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the January 20 closing prices:

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

Dabur India: Buy | LTP: Rs 566 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Target: Rs 590 | Return: 4 percent

Dabur has corrected from a high of Rs 611 touched in December 2022. The stock recently found support around Rs 538 level in January 2023. This is close to the previous intermediate lows, indicating a double bottom formation. The stock has subsequently bounced back and made a higher bottom in the last few sessions.

In the process, the stock broke out of a trading range on the back of healthy volumes, which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend a buy between Rs 564-568 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 550 and target of Rs 590.

GAIL India: buy | LTP: Rs 99 | Stop-Loss: Rs 96 | Target: Rs 105 | Return: 6 percent

After correcting from a high of Rs 109 tested in April 2022, GAIL found support around Rs 83 level in September 2022. These are strong supports as they also roughly coincide with previous intermediate lows.

The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average). Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 97-101 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 96 and target of Rs 105.

Bajaj Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 5,860 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,075 | Target: Rs 5,460 | Return: 7 percent

Bajaj Finance is in a short term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks. Recently, the stock broke down below its recent supports after reacting from close to its 50-day SMA. This indicates that the downtrend looks set to continue.

Technical indicators are giving negative signals as the stock is now trading below the 20 day and 50 day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI are in decline mode and not oversold, which implies potential for more downsides.

We therefore expect the stock to correct further in the coming sessions. Sell between Rs 5,855-5,865 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 6,075 and downside target of Rs 5,460.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Divis Laboratories: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,343 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,430 | Target: Rs 3,100 | Return: 7 percent

The stock was forming a rising leg bearish consolidation and the support was at Rs 3,350. On Friday, the stock closed below the level of Rs 3,350.

Based on the charts, the stock is heading towards the next supports, which are at Rs 3,250 and Rs 3,100. The stock is trending down and a breakdown of the formation should generate further bearish momentum in the near term. Sell at Rs 3,350-3,400, with a stop-loss of Rs 3,430.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,661 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,600 | Target: Rs 1,770 | Return: 7 percent

The stock has completed a corrective pattern at Rs 1,560 and has reversed sharply on the back of broad based buying in the private sector bank stocks, which will help the stock to exhibit a trending move in the near term.

However, we can be buyers only if it crosses Rs 1,670 or dips towards Rs 1,630. In either case, the stop-loss would be Rs 1,600. Above Rs 1,670 it will find resistance at Rs 1,720 and Rs 1,770.

SRF: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,105 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,000 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 19 percent

The stock is on the verge of completing a corrective pattern. It has displayed a trending movement between the levels of Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,865 during the period July 2022 to September 2022.

The corrective pattern is nearing completion between Rs 2,125 to Rs 2,100 levels. It will be an opportunity for traders and investors to invest in the stock from a medium term perspective. On the upside, on the reversal it would rally towards Rs 2,400 to Rs 2,500 levels. Keep a stop-loss at Rs 2,000 for holding positional long positions.

Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi

Minda Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 228 | Stop-Loss: Rs 215 | Target: Rs 260 | Return: 14 percent

The weekly chart of Minda Corporation depicts a perfect symmetrical triangle breakout above Rs 230 mark. The said pattern has a theoretical target of over Rs 300 level. The price action is supported by the positive placement of the weekly RSI which indicates strength in the momentum.

Geojit's research report on HDFC Bank

Incorporated in August 1994, HDFC Bank provides corporate banking and custodial services and is also involved in treasury and capital markets. In addition, it offers project advisory services and capital market products, including GDR and currency bonds. • In Q3FY23, higher interest income (9.9% QoQ) was offset by increase in interest expenses (+12.0% QoQ). Resultantly, NIM remained flat at 4.3%. • Advances up 1.8% QoQ and 19.5% YoY while deposits rose 3.6% QoQ and 19.9% YoY. GNPA (1.23%) and NNPA (0.33%) ratios remained stable. • Higher retail loans coupled with pick up in commercial and rural banking would continue to support loan growth in near term. Deposits to remain healthy with healthy CASA mix. We may see marginal improvement in NIM in the near term, and is expected to largely remain stable from thereon owing to strong growth in retail portfolio, which would partially offset higher cost of funds. We therefore reiterate our BUY rating, with a rolled forward target price of Rs. 1,890 based on 2.9x FY25E BVPS.



Outlook

We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock, with a rolled forward target price of Rs. 1,890 based on 2.9x FY25E BVPS.

The market is currently at crossroads, with the Nifty index sitting in a ""make or break"" zone. With the weekly expiry happening today, volatility is likely to be high. However, the Nifty and Bank Nifty had a good follow-up yesterday. HDFC Bank, in particular, has shown signs of leadership and is currently within 5% of its 52-week high. From January 10th to today, HDFC Bank has seen a 4.4% increase in value while ICICI has seen a 1% increase.

This week, there are big FMCG Q3 numbers lined up which could have a bearing on sentiment. In terms of global cues, India is expected to be impacted by Fed talk, which has so far been quite hawkish. However, the market has called the bluff of the Fed and believes that the terminal rate is near. Nasdaq stocks are still outperforming in the US, and Indian IT stocks still have room for a rally. The China opening theme on metals is also expected to continue. The only global risk factor for India currently is a potential surge in commodity prices.

Looking specifically at the Nifty, there is heavy put writing at 18150, 18100 and 18000 strikes on the Nifty and no major call writing. If Nifty falls below 18,000, selling could accelerate as put writers try to make up for their losses by going short themselves.

However, a big rally is likely if the Nifty closes above 18,200.

In terms of the Bank Nifty outlook, HDFC Bank's price move has changed the texture of the market. The Bank Nifty is still relatively weak, with the 20 DEMA placed at 42,581.

As the economy recovers from the pandemic, banks are going aggressive with partnership models to expand their services and get new customers.

Both public and private banks have been on a partnership spree in recent months to bring more customers on board. Lenders have also introduced offers by way of new debit and credit cards, digital banking services, and lending rates.

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, has tied up with about 20 companies over the past five months to offer services ranging from digital banking and financial payment options to credit facilities. The lender recently partnered with Warehouse Development Regulatory Authority to provide low-interest rate loans to farmers. SBI also partnered with motorcycle company Jawa Yezdi to provide financial options to its customers.

Canara Bank, another public sector lender, has joined with National E-Governance Service Ltd. to expand its digital banking services. The lender will offer a digital workflow of bank guarantees that will eliminate physical insurance, stamping, verification, and paper-based record maintenance.

Among private sector lenders, Axis Bank has tied up with OPEN, a digital banking enterprise, to provide digital current account services for its various customer segments.

DBS Bank India recently partnered with Gofrugal Technologies, a platform offering ERP solutions to adopt Open Network for Digital Commerce for its enterprise customers.

Laura Spiekerman, president of Alloy, a fintech and banking facilitator, said in a report that such partnerships help banks adopt new technologies and infrastructure to provide their services.

“Partnerships with fintech companies help banks provide new features to eager customers without spending costly resources to build their own digital products, while still earning a share of the profits,” Spiekerman said.

International partnerships

Some private banks have partnered with international companies and airlines to expand their products and services.

HDFC Bank, the largest private sector lender, partnered with Microsoft for cloud services for its banking operations.

Yes Bank and Mastercard have got together to introduce a debit card for its ultra-high net worth individual customers.

IndusInd bank tied up with Qatar Airways and British Airways to introduce a multi-branded credit card.

Partnerships here to stay?

Banks have traditionally partnered with companies for reasons including reaching a wider customer network and availing advanced technological services.

As banks recover from the tumultuous times of the pandemic, experts said partnerships will be their focus for some time in the near future.

“Customers would prefer using different banking services. And not only that, but banks are looking for more tie-ups with companies. We feel that these partnerships will stay for some time,” said Vijay Singh Gour, a senior analyst at Care Ratings.

Any risks with partnerships?

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been strict on regulations concerning fintech firms and companies that are native to the digital ecosystem. Experts are of the opinion that barring partnerships with fintech and other digital lenders, on which RBI has kept a close watch, there is no risk involved in such partnerships.

Gour said there are some risks which the banks and the RBI are working on.

“The regulator has been working in a collaborative manner to mitigate the risks associated with fintechs and digital lenders,” Gour said.",528,0.12503653764724731

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB reported an in-line quarter. PAT was up 19% YoY, supported by a pickup in NII growth and controlled provisions. NIMs stood stable QoQ. PPoP growth remained modest at 13% YoY. However, Core PPoP grew by a healthy ~19% YoY. Loan growth was driven by strong traction in Commercial and Rural Banking and Retail loans. The corporate book witnessed a marginal QoQ decline. Asset quality ratios remained stable even as slippages were high at INR66b due to high Agri slippages. The restructured book declined to ~42bp of loans (v/s 53bp in 2QFY23). Healthy PCR of ~73% and a contingent provision buffer (62bp of loans) should support asset quality. We estimate a ~19% PAT CAGR over FY22-25, with RoA/RoE at 2.0%/17.7% in FY25. We expect the stock to perform gradually as the margin profile revives and the merger-related overhang eases (bank aims to complete the merger by 1Q/2QFY24). Maintain Buy.

Indian shares ended lower in a volatile session on Monday, weighed down by continued foreign investor selling and higher oil prices, which offset healthy earnings from HDFC Bank.

The Nifty 50 index closed 0.34% lower at 17,894.85, while the S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.28% to 60,092.97. Both benchmarks had risen more than 0.5% earlier in the session.

Ten of the 13 major sectoral indexes declined, with heavyweight financials falling 0.75% and metals losing 1.32%.

The reversal in the broader market almost mirrored the downturn in financials, which surrendered intraday gains, as did HDFC Bank despite a better-than-expected quarterly report. The stock of the country's largest private lender closed nearly 1% lower.

The broader weakness was due to foreign selling in Indian equities given their high valuations relative to markets such as China and Taiwan, where allocations were lowered earlier due to COVID curbs, three analysts said.

""The volatility in the markets will continue in the near term due to extended selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPI),"" said Siddhartha Khemka, head of research (retail) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Data showed FPIs have sold 150.68 billion rupees ($1.85 billion) worth of equities so far this year.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been net sellers for the last sixteen sessions in a row the longest such streak in six months, according to exchange data offloading nearly 239 billion rupees worth of securities since Dec. 23.

Analysts also flagged a moderation in domestic investors' buying as another reason for volatility.

Meanwhile, oil prices held near 2023 highs on optimism that China's reopening will lift demand. High crude prices hurt big importers like India as it adds inflation pressure.

The bank’s deposits grew 19.9 percent to Rs 17.3 lakh crore from Rs 14.4 lakh crore in the year-ago period.

How did the bank achieve such high credit growth in a tough market?

Analysts said the bank’s strong hold across multiple segments alongside its wide franchise network helped it grow with record numbers.

“HDFC Bank remains one of the few banks to clock a strong deposit growth amid rising competition for deposits, given its robust franchise,” said Anand Dama, senior research analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services.

Segment growth

Current account and savings account (CASA) deposits grew by 12 percent, with savings account deposits at Rs 5.3 lakh crore and current account deposits at Rs 2.2 lakh crore.

The lender’s time deposits grew to Rs 9.7 lakh crore, jumping 26.9 percent over the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

Analysts said HDFC Bank’s wider branch network aided in the mop-up of deposits.

“With plans to boost up its network and services, the bank is opening a lot of new branches and making inroads in the rural areas,” said Karan Gupta, banking analyst at India Ratings & Research, a Fitch Group company.

Dama said the bank’s large corporate relationship network enables it to present its products and services to various customer segments.

“The bank’s wider network takes it to newer market and customer segments. Its range of outreach programmes has boosted the bank’s overall growth,” Dama said.

Can the lender sustain deposit growth momentum?

Analysts said the bank has consistently recorded almost 20 percent (YoY) and 4 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) deposit growth and will largely stay on the same path.

Attributing this to the bank’s plans for branch expansion and a race for competitive rate hikes, experts said it is unlikely that the deposit growth momentum will slow.

Gupta said, “With the bank looking to double its branch network over a three-year period, this will work as a major booster for deposit growth. Hence, we do not see any possible challenges for its deposit growth.”

To attract new customers, HDFC Bank hiked rates on fixed deposits for different tenures across customer segments in December. The bank now provides interest rates ranging from 4.5 percent to 7.75 percent.

“The bank has been one of the few players to clock a strong overall deposit growth given its robust franchise, and has now increased rates to accelerate deposit growth in the run-up to the merger,” said Dama.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB saw a good quarter with core PAT of Rs118bn beating PLe by ~6% led by stronger NII and other income (excl. treasury) while provisions were lower. NIM was higher by 11bps at 4.84% due to superior yields driven by faster asset repricing, while cost of funds was a tad lesser. Retail wholesale mix improved QoQ from 43:57 to 45:55 led by stronger retail accretion (due to healthy consumption spends) and de-growth in corporate (owing to pricing pressure and widening bond spreads). Retail deposit accretion was strong at 5% QoQ and its share is now 84% (80% in Mar’22). Bank added 684 branches in Q3FY23 while it intends to add 600 more branches in Q4FY23 which would keep opex elevated. We upgrade FY23 earnings by 3% led by higher NII and lower provisions.

Outlook

Valuation is at 2.6x Sep’24 core ABV. Maintaining multiple at 3.0x, we raise TP to Rs1,850 from Rs1,800. Retain BUY.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB reported moderate credit growth at 20% YoY/2% QoQ, mainly due to de-growth in the corporate book which, coupled with flattish margin and elevated opex, led to moderate PPoP growth at 13%. However, lower than expected provisions led to a beat on earnings at Rs123bn (vs expectations of Rs119bn) up 18.5% YoY. HDFC Bank remains one of the few banks to clock a strong deposit growth amid rising competition for deposits, given its robust franchisee. On the credit front, HDFC Bank remains opportunistic on the corporate side; thus, we are not too worried about the 3Q growth moderation. Bank continues to clock strong growth in the retail/SME segment which we believe should support its margins amid rising cost pressure. The merger process is on the fast track, with shareholder approval now in place; the bank is hopeful of it being completed earlier than guided. That said, clarity on the stake of HDFC Life and other subsidiaries as well as on the merger structure by the RBI remains elusive. Notwithstanding the merger-related regulatory overhang, we believe HDFCB offers the best play on India’s consumption story and is also a good defensive bet in current choppy waters. The stock is trading at reasonable valuations, at 2.6x FY24E ABV.



Outlook

We retain our long-term BUY, with a revised TP of Rs1,925/sh (valuing the core bank at 2.8x Dec-24E ABV) and a subs valuation of Rs78/sh.

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post December quarter earnings:

Motilal Oswal

The bank reported an in-line quarter with increased traction in Core PPoP and NII growth, even as margins remained stable.

Loan growth was driven by sustained momentum in the Retail segment and robust growth in Commercial and Rural Banking.

Asset quality ratios remained robust, while the restructured book moderated to 42bp of loans. Healthy PCR and a contingent provisioning buffer should support asset quality.

The broking firm estimates HDFC Bank to deliver a 19 percent CAGR in net profit over FY22-25, with RoA/RoE of 2.0 percent/17.7 percent in FY25.

Motilal Oswal maintained its 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 1,930 (premised on 3.0x September 2024 ABV).

It expects the stock to perform gradually as the margin profile revives and the merger related overhang eases (bank aims to complete the merger by 1Q/2QFY24).

Prabhudas Lilladher

HDFC Bank saw a good quarter with core PAT of Rs 118 billion, beating broking house by 6 percent, led by stronger NII and other income (excluding treasury) while provisions were lower.

NIM was higher by 11bps at 4.84 percent due to superior yields driven by faster asset repricing, while cost of funds was a tad lesser.

Retail wholesale mix improved QoQ from 43:57 to 45:55 led by stronger retail accretion (due to healthy consumption spends) and de-growth in corporate (owing to pricing pressure and widening bond spreads).

Retail deposit accretion was strong at 5 percent on-quarter and its share is now 84 percent (80 percent in March 2022).

It upgraded the bank's FY23 earnings by 3 percent, led by higher NII and lower provisions. Maintaining multiple at 3.0x, we raise Target Price to Rs 1,850 from Rs 1,800. Retain Buy.

BoFA Securities

Brokerage house has maintained ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,000 per share.

Its headline growth/RoAs were on target and deposit ramp-up is a key focus in Q4.

The branch expansion was on fast track near term, reported CNBC-TV18.

Bernstein

Broking firm has kept ‘outperform’ rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,200 per share.

The Q3FY23 was a clean beat with another show of deposits. The earnings growth driven by healthy credit growth, while NIM was unchanged.

The asset quality trends remained benign, while non-interest income saw significant improvement.

The biggest positive was continued growth in deposits & rise in branch count, reported CNBC-TV18.

Kotak Institutional Equities

Research firm has kept ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target at Rs 1,800 per share.

The solid earnings led by growth in operating profit & decline in provisions, while increase in branches & headcount to sustain the business momentum.

However, merger continues to be a near-term headwind, reported CNBC-TV18.

Morgan Stanley

The revenue growth was strong which was used to accelerate investments. The core PPoP growth continues to improve and retail TD growth was strong, reported CNBC-TV18.

Jefferies

The retail deposit mobilisation was down. The branch & staff expansion led to cost growth of 27 percent.

The merger timelines are largely on track, reported CNBC-TV18.

HDFC Bank, the country’s largest private-sector lender, on January 14 reported strong double-digit growth in its net profit and a healthy jump in consolidated advances.

Here are key four highlights from the bank’s earnings report card:

Net profit jumps

The lender reported a 19.9 percent jump in its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 2022. Beating market estimates, it reported a net profit of Rs 12,698 crore, an increase of 18.5 percent over the quarter ended December 31, 2022.

The bank's December quarter net revenue grew by 18.3 percent to Rs 31,488 crore from Rs 26,627 crore last year.

Net interest income (NII), or the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew by 24.6 percent to Rs 22,987 crore from Rs 18.443 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2022.

Aggressive deposit growth

Total deposits of the bank showed healthy growth and were at Rs 17,33,204 crore, increasing by 19.9 percent.

HDFC Bank on January 14 reported a 19.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 to Rs 12,698 crore.

Consolidated advances grew 19.2 percent YoY to Rs 15.63 lakh crore in Q3Fy23 from Rs 13.12 lakh crore in Q3FY22.

Meanwhile, standalone net profit of came in at Rs 12,259.5 crore, an increase of 18.5 percent from the same quarter of the corresponding year. This was above estimate of Rs 11,754 crore by analysts in a Moneycontrol poll.

Net interest income for the quarter grew by 24.6 percent YoY to Rs 22,987.8 crore from Rs 18.443.5 crore in Q3FY22. Core net interest margin came in at 4.1 percent on total assets.

The lender's gross non-performing assets (GNPA) were at 1.23 percent of gross advances as on December 31, 2022 (1 percent excluding NPAs in the agricultural segment), as against 1.23 percent in the previous quarter, it said in a filing with stock exchanges.

Net non-performing assets (NNPA) stood at 0.33 percent for the quarter, showing no improvement or deterioration from the previous quarter.

Total deposits showed a healthy growth of 19.9 percent YoY and stood at Rs 17.33 lakh crore as of December end. ""CASA (current account savings account) deposits grew by 12 percent with savings account deposits at Rs 535,206 crore and current account deposits at Rs 227,745 crore,"" the bank added.

Provisions and contingencies for the quarter came down to Rs 2,806.4 crore as against Rs 2,994 crore YoY and Rs 3,240 crore QoQ. The total credit cost ratio stood at 0.74 percent, as compared to 0.94 percent in Q3 FY22.

Ahead of its results, the stock had closed flat on January 13 at Rs 1601 on the NSE. The stock has gained 18 percent in the past six months, but is down 1.7 percent in the new calendar year.",344,0.9852638329778399
2023-01-13 20:23:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/hdfc-bank-q3-preview-net-profit-to-grow-14-percent-9862301.html,"HDFC Bank disappointed investors with its growth in low-cost current and savings account deposits for the quarter.

HDFC Bank is expected to report a 14 percent growth in net profit in the October-December quarter on the back of a 22 percent increase in net interest income, and steady margins.

The average of a poll of estimates of six brokerages shows that the private sector lender is expected to report a net profit of Rs 11,754 crore in the third quarter, and a net interest income (NII) of Rs 22,427 crore. The healthy NII growth is expected on the back of a robust 19.5 percent loan growth that the bank reported earlier this month in an early update of its business.

Analysts believe the lender’s loan growth is slightly disappointing given its historic performance. “HDFC Bank delivered weaker-than-expected q-q (quarter-on-quarter) growth in advances, despite strong growth of about 5 percent q-q in both retail and CRB (commercial and rural banking) segments. This was primarily due to a 1 percent q-q decline in the wholesale loan book (27 percent of total advances in 2QFY23),” pointed out analysts at BNP Paribas in a note.

Nevertheless, given the size of its loan book, the lender’s growth rate is still robust. Besides, HDFC Bank’s lending has been largely secure and to high-rated individuals and companies. Its risk-weighted assets are one of the lowest with respect to capital. Given this, the asset quality is expected to remain pristine for the bank. That said, some analysts warn that a potential increase in slippages may be anticipated from the agriculture segment or the unsecured loan book.

“HDFC Bank’s provisioning adequacy is heavily dependent on the fact that its stressed asset numbers are the very lowest in the sector. If this were to change for any reason, the provisioning burden on RoA (return on assets) will be high. However, such a change is very unlikely given the focus on prime assets,” the BNP Paribas report said.

The focus on high-rated loans may also weigh on its yield on advances. While that may translate into pressure on margins, the composition of the bank’s loan book may offset some of it, analysts said. HDFC Bank’s unsecured loan book and high-yielding commercial loans to small businesses has grown faster than other segments. Therefore, even though a large part of its book is fixed-rated, the lender has been able to transmit the increase in interest rates.

“The bank is chasing the best quality customers across product segments, which comes at a lower yield. This will be offset by growth led by high-yielding payment products, rural and commercial,” analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher wrote in a note. Those at Emkay Global Financial Services expect the net interest margin (NIM) to marginally improve to 4.3 percent in Q3FY23, from 4.1 percent a year ago.

For investors, guidance on loan growth and more importantly, on deposit growth, would be a key factor to watch for. HDFC Bank disappointed the Street with its growth in low-cost current and savings account deposits for the quarter. Further, management commentary on unsecured loans and credit costs would also be of interest. A big trigger for the bank’s stock, though, remains the conclusion of the mega-merger between the bank and parent HDFC Ltd.",541,-0.10815038283665974

School edtech platform LEAD has raised Rs 160 crore (about $20 million) in debt capital from venture debt firms and banks, a day after laying off about 1-2 percent of its 2,000 employees.

The new funding round was a mix of long-term debt capital from venture debt firms Alteria Capital and Stride Ventures and working capital finance from banks such as Standard Chartered Bank, HDFC Bank, and ICICI Bank, the company said in a statement on January 11. LEAD plans to use the funding for financing the company's organic and inorganic growth, the company said.

Last week, LEAD acquired learning company Pearson’s K-12 (kindergarten through standard 12) business in India and the company said it would fund the acquisition through new fundraising and internal accruals. However, the company did not disclose anything on the new fundraise then.

LEAD's debt fundraise comes at a time when many direct-to-consumer edtech companies in the country are struggling to raise equity funding amid a slowdown in venture capital and private equity investments. Edtech companies are thus looking to cut costs as they are expecting slower growth in the coming quarters.

“Traditionally, startups have had limited avenues for raising capital beyond equity. However, with our strong unit economics and a clear path to profitability, we have been able to attract non-dilutive, traditional capital from India’s biggest banks and largest venture debt funds, which is value accretive to our shareholders,” said Sumeet Mehta, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of LEAD.

“LEAD is poised for 2X growth and this latest round of funding will help us fast-track our mission of providing high quality, integrated School Edtech solutions to over 60,000 schools across India by 2026,” Mehta added.

Founded by Mehta and Smita Deorah in 2012, LEAD runs a platform that tracks teacher and student progress, managing school operations on the cloud and providing digital resources to make learning more engaging. The company turned a unicorn in January 2022.

For FY22, LEAD reported a net loss of Rs 397.1 crore, which widened from Rs 126.1 crore a year earlier, as the company's employee benefit costs surged more than 2.5 times during the year. However, with schools reopening in FY22, LEAD managed to double its revenue to Rs 141.6 crore in FY22 from a year earlier.",379,0.499871626496315

HDFC Bank and India Overseas Bank (IOB) on Monday hiked their marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by up to 25 basis points, making loans linked to the benchmark expensive.

The new rates of HDFC will be effective from January 7, while that of IOB from January 10.

According to the HDFC Bank website, the overnight MCLR is now 8.50 per cent from earlier 8.30 per cent, an increase of 20 basis points, while the MCLR for one month is 8.55 per cent up from 8.30 per cent, a rise of 25 basis points.

The country's largest private sector lender said that benchmark one-year MCLR is up by 25 basis points to 8.85 per cent from 8.60 per cent.

The two-year MCLR will be 8.95 per cent compared to 8.70 per cent, and the three-year MCLR will be 9.05 per cent from 8.80 per cent, up 25 basis points.

IOB on the other hand raised the benchmark rate across all tenures by 5 basis points.

The rates have been increased from 7.70 per cent to 8.45 per cent, IOB said in a regulatory filing.",189,0.9907163977622986

Emkay Global Financial's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB reported lower than expected credit growth – up 20% YoY/2% QoQ, in Q3 (vs 24% YoY/6% QoQ, in Q2). This was mainly due to de-growth in the corporate book (down 1% QoQ/up 20% YoY), while Retail continued its strong growth momentum (up 21.5% YoY/5% QoQ), as did Commercial Banking (at 30% YoY/5% QoQ). We believe, this should support margins amid rising funding costs. Credit growth, gross of IBPCs and bill rediscounted, also stood low, at 24% YoY/3% QoQ in Q3 vs 26% YoY/7% QoQ in Q2. The Mortgage-Book purchase from HDFC Ltd continued to be high, at Rs88.9bn in Q3 (vs Rs91.5bn in Q2). Deposit growth of the bank remains healthy at 20% YoY/4% QoQ, while other banks continue to struggle. Overall CASA growth was slower at 12% YoY/ flat QoQ (Retail CASA grew 14%YoY/1% QoQ), which led to a slight decline in CASA ratio, at 44% vs 45% in Q2. We believe slippages could remain elevated in Q3 due to seasonal stress in the Agri portfolio (including KCC) which, coupled with slower credit growth, could keep NPA ratios largely flat. With the bank sitting on healthy, specific + contingent provisions, we expect LLP to moderate, which should thereby support net profitability.

Outlook

We believe that slower credit growth coupled with lower fees and elevated opex in the run-up to the merger could keep core-profitability growth in check. Post the recent uptick, the stock is currently trading at 2.7x FY24E ABV (ex-subs valuation). We retain our long-term BUY rating on the stock, given healthy return ratios, strong capital comfort and reasonable valuations. We will revise our estimates/TP post the results, once we attain better clarity on the growth/margin outlook and the merger process from Management.

Consumer price index (CPI) inflation is expected to ease to about 5.3 percent in the next financial year, aided by a correction in commodity prices, Swati Arora, Economist at HDFC Bank, said in an interview to Moneycontrol.

""Heading into FY24, CPI inflation is expected to ease to about 5.3 percent supported by a correction in commodity prices, while core inflation is expected to stay elevated at around 5.8 percent,"" she said.

She added that the upside risks to inflation could emanate from rising Covid cases in China, and if cases in India rise as well, that could again disrupt supply chains.

In November, the headline retail inflation declined to an 11-month low of 5.88 percent from 6.77 percent the previous month, while core inflation continued to remain high at over 6 percent.

Following a similar drop in October, November was the first time in 2022 that inflation had fallen below the 6 percent upper limit of RBI’s 4 +/- 2 percent tolerance band. However, CPI inflation has exceeded the medium-term target of 4 percent for 38 months in a row.

To fight higher inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has aggressively hiked the repo rate since May. Thus far, the central bank has increased the repo rate, or short-term lending rate, by 225 basis points (bps).

Going ahead, Arora said elevated and sticky core inflation and downside risks to domestic growth due to weak external demand will remain a challenge for the RBI.

""The RBI has appropriately responded by tightening policy to control inflationary pressures, which in India’s case are predominantly supply driven,"" Arora said.

Budget expectations

Arora expects the government to allocate higher capital expenditure amid headwinds like a slowdown in global growth and exports, and tightening financial conditions. Capex has a multiplier effect on economic output, making it essential for growth.

Further, the budget is likely to see enhanced allocation towards the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, PM KISAN Yojana, etc., in order to support the rural economy.

""The government wants to return to a path of fiscal consolidation. In the FY24 budget, the government is likely to reduce the fiscal deficit by 0.4 percent to 6 percent of GDP,"" she said.

She expects borrowings , which are important for the bond market, to remain higher compared to the previous fiscal due to higher redemption. ""This is likely to maintain upward pressure on bond yields,"" Arora said.

The yield on the 10-year benchmark government bonds have gone up from 6.45 percent at the beginning of the year to 7.31 percent as on December 28, 2022.

The Rupee is expected to trade in the range of 80.50-83.50 to the Dollar in calendar year 2023, said Arora.

""Stabilisation in crude oil prices given lower global demand, and a moderation in the Dollar rally as the market starts pricing in a Fed pivot, should lend some support to the Rupee,"" explained Arora.

She added that weak risk sentiment as Covid cases rise again, along with a slowdown in global growth, could keep any meaningful appreciation in check.

The INR:USD rate is likely to see some gains in H1 2023 within a band of 80.5-82.50, before moving to a higher range of 82-83.50 in H2, Arora said.

The rupee has remained volatile through the year and the RBI has been intervening in the forex market in the last few months to defend it from depreciating sharply. During this course, the central bank has spent heavily from its forex kitty.

But in the last few weeks, the forex reserves have seen some inflows. As on December 16, India's forex reserves stood at $563.5 billion, per RBI data.",639,0.11316913824815017

HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Bharti Airtel are set to see inflows of up to $29 million, $26 million and $16 million, respectively, with the quarterly recapping by the National Stock Exchange.

Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, SBI and Bajaj Auto will see the highest outflows of $57 million, $34 million, $32 million and $19 million due to the rejig in weightage, according to Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research.

The capping factor for stocks in all the Nifty indices is realigned upon change in equity, investible weighted factor, replacement of scrips in the index, periodic rebalancing and on a quarterly basis on the last trading day of March, June, September and December.

Since these indices are tracked majorly by domestic passive funds and ETFs, the recapping leads to a change in funds flow. While the adjustment will take place today, the changes will become effective only on December 30.

In the Nifty 50, scrips of Adani Ports, HDFC Life and HDFC Bank/ICICI Bank are set to see inflows of $11 million, $9 million and $4 million, respectively. Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and Tech Mahindra might see outflows of $12 million, $9 million and $3 million, respectively.

HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank will also see incremental inflows due to weightage increase in the Nifty Bank index of $25 million and $22 million. IndusInd Bank and Federal Bank are next in line, anticipating $19 million and $10 million inflows.

Axis Bank's weightage will go up in the Nifty 50 index but come down in the Bank Nifty resulting in a cumulative outflow of $57 million. SBI's weightage in Bank Nifty will come down 10.2 percent from 11.1 percent, resulting in an outflow of $32 million.

Coming to the Nifty CPSE index, Powergrid and NTPC will see inflows of $13 million and $12 million. On the other hand, ONGC will see highest outflow of $21 million.",323,0.4290858954191208

If you look at the Nifty’s move this year, from 17,600 to 15,300 to 18,800 and back to 17,900 ― investors bled money, made money and again lost some before closing the year. It was nothing short of a roller-coaster ride.

Many stocks made headlines but the ones that really left a mark were those that were picked up by the meme community. Be it a stunning rally or a disappointing decline, memes made some stocks eternal this year. Reddit, Twitter, and WhatsApp were all flooded by them and investors had a good laugh in a year marred by market volatility. Let’s take a look at some.

HDFC twins

On April 4, before the market opened, an announcement took everyone by surprise. A transformational merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank sent newsrooms into a scurry. It was not anticipated. There were hardly any whispers on such a deal brewing. “I am disappointed with media intelligence,” said Deepak Parekh as he addressed reporters in a press conference.

Nevertheless, the announcement gave enough fodder to memers who unleashed their creativity. As the merger is all set to create a $160-billion financial services behemoth, investors were quick to liken it to Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s popular dialogue from Gangs of Wasseypur – Kabhi kabhi lagta hai apun hi bhagwan hai.

Adani Enterprises

Akshay Kumar sported an eccentric polka dot shirt in Hera Pheri and claimed he can double your money in 25 days. That was a lie, but Adani Enterprises has certainly managed to do so in the span of one year. The stock began its 2022 climb at Rs 1,700 and is all set to end above Rs 3,700. A big trigger was its entry into the Nifty 50 index in September.

The flagship entity of Adani Group and its Chairperson Gautam Adani were in the limelight for many other reasons, as well. A cement deal which makes it the second-largest player in the space, a media deal which made heads turn, a blockbuster debut by the group’s FMCG arm, and a relentless rally that has propelled its promoter to Asia’s richest man ― it was certainly an eventful year for Adani Enterprises. Not to forget, a mind boggling 345x P/E valuation has also left many investors scratching their heads.

LIC

The public insurer’s listing on May 17 was the event of a lifetime. The government’s 3.5 percent stake sale in the 65-year-old institution made it India’s biggest ever initial public offering (IPO). It fetched close to Rs 21,000 crore. The issue price was set at Rs 949 apiece. Retail investors lapped up the shares, with their allotted quota subscribed 1.99 times. It was the perfect recipe for a grand success, but then… the dreadful happened!

The stock listed 8 percent below its issue price at Rs 872. Fingers were pointed at the Reserve Bank of India. Investors said RBI’s sudden interest rate hike soured the mood and caused the listing to be at a discount. For the meme world, LIC was Baahubali, RBI was Katappa.

Since its listing, the stock has gone only downwards. It is set to end the year near Rs 690 level.

ITC

No list is complete without the OG meme stock – ITC. Since May 2019, investors had been waiting patiently to see the stock touch the Rs 300 mark again. And it finally happened in July 2022. Just like its many businesses ― cigarettes, FMCG, hotels, paper, agri ― the variety of memes was a sight to behold. From a turtle on a treadmill to a galloping bull, ITC was likened to several animals.

It is the second-best-performing Nifty stock of the year, with a 52 percent gain. If we go by what brokerages say, the stock is all set to puff more gains in 2023. For instance, Antique Stock Broking has a Rs 419 target on the stock. One can only imagine the hysteria that will follow once ITC crosses the Rs 400 mark!

Zomato

Zomato’s lock-in period ended on July 25 and the stock crashed to a record low, triggering a meme fest on social media. The most iconic meme was one comparing Zomato’s share price to the price of one kg of tomato. Currently, it is trading way below its issue price of Rs 76.

Zomato sure has an edge as it operates in a duopolistic market, believe analysts. But, its $570-million acquisition of Blinkit resulting in greater cash burn has not gone down well with investors. The company still has some way to go before it can dish out profits. Till then, social media will serve you some great memes. Keep watching the space!

HDFC Bank is seeking to raise as much as $1 billion via an offshore loan, Bloomberg reported on December 19 citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The loan tenor could range from 1-5 years, the report said citing unidentified sources.

HDFC Bank is seeking to tap the market as early as the coming month, in anticipation of an increase in credit demand.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in July hiked the external commercial borrowing limit to $1.5 billion and raised the all-in-cost ceiling by 100 basis points in select cases up to December 31, 2022.

The minimum average maturity requirement for ECBs in the infrastructure space raised by eligible borrowers has been reduced to three years from the earlier five years.

Additionally, the average maturity requirement for mandatory hedging has been reduced to five years from the earlier 10 years, the central bank announced.

The report of HDFC Bank seeking an offshore loan comes days after the BSE and the NSE gave their nod for the lender's merger with the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC).

The combined entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore. The merger is expected to be completed by the second or third quarter of FY24, subject to regulatory approvals.

The bank wants to double the current pace of half a million new credit card issuances every month, according to Parag Rao, country head for payments business, consumer finance, digital banking and marketing. The firm will announce partnerships across a range of industries from online retail to food delivery in the coming weeks to increase spending on cards, Rao said.

The recovery for HDFC Bank has been swift since the eight-month long card ban was lifted in August last year, with the lender seeking to move past the punishment for repeated online glitches that hurt its customers. Reserve Bank of India data showed that the bank captured 29% of India’s overall spending on credit cards in October, the highest among its competitors.

“We focus not only on the issuance of cards which is a distribution game, but on deep engagement, ensuring customers find more value in their cards, and keep spending,” Rao said in an interview.

The partnerships in the next few weeks also include two airlines and a large hotel chain, according to Rao. HDFC Bank is in the final stages of developing a new digital credit card to pull in younger customers, he added.

Banks in the world’s second most populated country are poised to benefit from the growth in online shopping where customers use their credit cards for purchases. Between 200 million and 300 million Indians are expected to spend $50 billion on online retail this year, according to a Bain & Co Inc. report.

Part of the push at HDFC Bank will be tied to its merger with Housing Development Finance Corp., which will give it access to the mortgage lender’s customers, Rao said. The two firms agreed to combine this year in one of the biggest global deals to ride a boom in home loans and consumer spending in India.

Beyond partnerships, the bank also wants to attract more customers who use credit cards from India’s local retail payment system known as RuPay, according to Rao. He sees recent rules that allow the linkage of RuPay credit cards to the widely used government-backed payment interface expanding the market for these cards.

“The credit lines for such customers will be small but these will be customers of the future, who can upgrade to other cards as they evolve,” Rao said.

And while peers are offering rewards on a slew of products to gain customers, HDFC Bank is avoiding this strategy.

“We never have had the best discounts in the market nor do we want to be known as the card with the most discounts,” Rao said.",468,0.6112748980522156

Other income for the quarter, which included Fees and commission income constituting 3/4th of other income was at Rs.58 billion and grew by 17% over prior year and 8% over prior quarter.

In retail deposits, the bank added Rs. 710 billion during the quarter and Rs. 2,350 billion since September. Retail constitutes about 83% of total deposits, retail deposits have been the anchor of their deposit growth.



Outlook

HDFC Bank already had a huge opportunity with the under-penetration of banking services in the country. The proposed merger adds an entirely different dimension to the future. We believe that the runway is huge. HDFC Bank’s earnings trajectory remains on track with continued growth in retail. The ongoing expansion of branch network and cards business, coupled with the merger, is expected to aid long-term growth. Nevertheless, the bank’s long-term outlook remains positive. We thereby retain our BUY rating on the stock, with a revised target price of Rs. 1,908.

Private sector lender HDFC Bank has increased its stake to 7.75 per cent from the current 5.2 per cent in fintech start-up Mintoak for a cash consideration of Rs 31.1 crore.

Bank of America Securities is overweight on financials, industrials, staples and cement, head of India equity research Amish Shah said at a media roundtable. However, investors should rotate out of staples and cement in six months, he added.

“In the cement sector, there is good demand visibility for the next few months till Q2FY24, when the seasonally weak quarter begins,” said Shah.

He said Budget 2023 will create many opportunities, with subsidies expected for infrastructure schemes including Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and rural employment guarantee projects. These subsidies eventually lead to creation of an asset, so they are as good as capital expenditure, he explained.

Staples are expected to do well as rural sentiment is slowly turning the corner.

“All factors for a bounce-back in demand are lining up, like moderating of inflation and increase in non-farm income,” he said.

Foreign institutional investors and domestic mutual funds are materially underweight on staples versus their historical averages. Thus, the sector could see greater inflows in 2023, BofA Securities said.

Also Read: Nifty to hit 20,000 in 2023, driven by FII flows, says BofA Securities

Another good defensive bet, according to Shah, is the utilities sector.

“Reforms that are currently in the draft stage which propose privatisation of power distribution operations could be a game-changer,” he said.

Valuations are undemanding, with one-year forward price-to-book ratio at 1.4x.

Underweight sectors

BofA Securities is underweight on the information technology, automobile and healthcare sectors.

“21 percent of the Nifty is export-linked and these sectors will see the sharpest earnings cut,” said Shah.

The firm expects the earnings cut for the automobile sector to be 79 percent, the highest. Healthcare will likely get a 19 percent cut and IT 14 percent.

“Despite heavy outflows, FII positioning still remains slightly overweight on the IT sector and this has potential to reduce further. Valuations at 24x versus an average of 19x don’t give us any comfort,” he said.

Long-term bets

The bottom line is India will outperform developed market equities but will underperform emerging markets next year. With India’s structural story intact, financials and industrials will be good long-term bets, said Shah.

“There could be some contraction in net interest margins as the competition for deposits takes off amid banks. But there is good visibility on earnings and strong asset quality,” he explained.

The recent run-up in public sector banks is not keeping BofA at bay.

“The stocks are still trading below their book value and there is more steam left,” he said.

BofA Securities’ pecking order in the financials space is private and public sector banks over insurance companies. Non-banking financiers come last in the list. It has ‘buy’ ratings on HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.

Industrials is another multi-year bet, according to BofA Securities. Apart from the capex upcycle, underweight positioning of FIIs and current valuations at 22x (versus 26x at peak cycle) give analysts some comfort. Larsen & Toubro, Bharat Electronics, and Adani Ports are the top ‘buy’ calls in the sector.

India’s biggest merger ever will likely take away from the rupee bond market one of its top issuers, an absence that may weigh on debt sales and arrangement fees for banks.

The consolidation of Housing Development Finance Corp. and unit HDFC Bank Ltd. will create a more than $200 billion financial services behemoth, and the parent will be able to tap the bank’s deposits to grow, rather than pile on more debt. That’s not all bad for India’s bond world as the hole created by the shadow lender may let new borrowers sell notes, helping India deepen its debt market.

The shadow lender is India’s biggest bond seller in 2022, with its issuance accounting for 7.7% of the country’s total issuance volume this year, higher than an average of about 6% in the last 10 years, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The merged entity will be a bank and is still likely to offer notes when needed to boost its capital buffers and fund infrastructure projects.

“HDFC’s exit will initially hurt overall sales volume next year,” said Jayen Shah, founder of Mavuca Capital Advisors Pvt., a fintech investment banking firm. “I expect a lot of first-time issuers, state and private companies tapping the bond market next year as yields stabilize, which may then gradually fill the void.”

The merger, expected to conclude in the second quarter of 2023, will give HDFC access to 16.7 trillion rupees ($202 billion) of funds comprising so-called low-cost current and savings account deposits and time deposits of the bank. That will let it continue expanding its assets, which stood at 6.9 trillion rupees at the end of September.

The exit of a debt issuer of that size risks hurting the fee income of bankers who have arranged HDFC’s various offerings. In the last few years, Axis Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. have overseen most of those sales, Bloomberg-compiled data show.

For HDFC’s competitors, though, the firm’s exit may be a positive in fundraising terms. “The departure of HDFC from the bond market would benefit its peers as it will give them access to a larger pool of credit,” Mavuca’s Shah said. “That in turn will cut funding costs of other top-rated housing finance companies.”",412,0.33304665486017865

After moving closer to 18,900 level in the beginning of December, traders seem to have preferred profit taking and hence the Nifty50 is caught in a bear trap. The index lost more than 1 percent in the week ended December 9, after run-up in previous two consecutive weeks. Slightly hawkish tone by the Reserve Bank of India and caution ahead of FOMC meet weighed on market sentiment despite correction in oil prices amid global recession fears.

The index closed a tad below 18,500, the support which was being held on to for several sessions in the recent past. Overall if the same gets decisively broken then Nifty can take support at crucial 18,400-18,300 area, whereas on the other side, 18,600-18,700 zone is going to be near term resistance followed by new high, experts said.

""The Nifty is now placed slightly above the key support of '20-day EMA' (exponential moving average - 18,465) which coincides with previous swing high of 18,450. Hence, we continue to remain upbeat as long as 18,400 – 18,300 is not violated on a closing basis,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

Until then, he feels any intermediate decline should only be construed as profit booking before resuming the upward trend.

On the flipside, 18,650 – 18,700 are the levels to watch out for. The moment Nifty surpasses this, one should gear up for yet another milestone of 19,000 in the near future, the expert said.

Traders are advised not to get carried away by such small declines. Rather it’s better to focus more on thematic moves, especially from the broader end of the spectrum, Sameet advised.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the December 9 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Thermax: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,057 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,875 | Target: Rs 2,350 | Return: 14 percent

The stock is in the last leg of a corrective pattern. It could drop to Rs 1,950 or Rs 1,960 levels, where it has seen key support since March 2022.

Technically, it will mark the second low in the last two months. Our advice is to buy the stock 50 percent at current levels and the balance at Rs 1,950 with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,875 and we can keep a target of Rs 2,350 or Rs 2,450 in the medium term, which is the pullback level for the stock.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,631 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,590 | Target: Rs 1,722 | Return: 5.6 percent

It is forming a triangle consolidation formation between Rs 1,640 and Rs 1,590 range. It has shown a trending move from Rs 1,365 levels.

The overall formation is suggesting that the current formation is a continuation formation and on the dismissal of Rs 1,642, it will jump to the level, which lies between Rs 1,675 and Rs 1,722.

Buying around Rs 1,630 and Rs 1,620 is appropriate with a stop-loss at Rs 1,590.

Divis Laboratories: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,274 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,350 | Target: Rs 2,978 | Return: 9 percent

The stock is forming a series of lower top and lower bottom. On weekly basis, the stock closed below Rs 3,330 level, which was last week's low.

It is negative for the stock and it may witness further weakness till the next level, which is at Rs 2,978. The stock closed on a weekly basis at Rs 3,274 and based on technical analysis, the downside is favourable for short sellers with a stop-loss at Rs 3,350.

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC: Buy | LTP: Rs 449.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 430 | Target: Rs 490 | Return: 9 percent

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC has corrected from a high of Rs 503 touched in September 2022. The stock recently found support around the Rs 400 levels in October 2022. This is close to the previous intermediate lows, indicating a double bottom formation. The stock has subsequently bounced back and made higher bottoms in the last few weeks.

Last week, the stock broke out of a trading range on the back of healthy volumes, which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend a buy between Rs 440-460 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 430 and target at Rs 490.

Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 350.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 332 | Target: Rs 382 | Return: 9 percent

After correcting from a high of Rs 470 in January 2022, Suprajit Engineering found support around Rs 272 levels in March 2022. These are strong supports as they are just above the 200-day EMA.

The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of huge volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. One can buy between Rs 348-355 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 332 and target at Rs 382.

Bata India: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,679 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,739 | Target: Rs 1,580 | Return: 6 percent

Bata is in a short term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks. Recently, the stock broke down below its recent supports and also reacted from the 20-day SMA last week. This indicates that the downtrend looks set to continue.

Technical indicators are giving negative signals as the stock is now trading below the 20-day and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI are in decline mode and not oversold, which implies potential for more downsides.

We therefore expect the stock to correct further in the coming sessions. One can sell between Rs 1,670-1,684 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,739 and downside target at Rs 1,580.

Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,227 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,030 | Target: Rs 3,580 | Return: 11 percent

The stock consolidated after retracing 50 percent of prior up-move (Rs 2,560-Rs 3,546) and witnessed a range breakout. The stock also closed above its 20-week EMA and rose to 9-week closing high.

Its weekly Stochastic is positively poised; its RSI gave buy signal, while its MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is on the verge of a bullish cross-over.

The stock has potential to move towards Rs 3,490 initially and Rs 3,680 subsequently.

In case of any decline, the stock will continue to find support at around its 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior up-move.

Colgate Palmolive: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,657 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,570 | Target: Rs 1,820 | Return: 10 percent

Since couple of weeks, the stock oscillated above its cluster of moving averages (20-week EMA, 50-week EMA and 100-week SMA) and poised for a breakout.

In the last two weeks, the stock witnessed a steady rise with above average volume, which signals that major market participants were in favour of the bulls.

The key technical indicators are positively poised on medium-term as well as short-term timeframe charts. We believe the stock will rebound utilising prior consolidation and move towards its life-time-high.

On the lower side, the stock will find support around its cluster of moving averages.

Dr Reddy's Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,407 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,210 | Target: Rs 4,900 | Return: 11 percent

Post a trendline breakout, the stock again tested that extended line and formed a bullish reversal pattern. The stock also found support around its 100-day SMA and reversed.

This could take the stock towards Rs 4,600 initially and Rs 4,900 subsequently.

Major technical indicators are in favour of the bulls on the near-term timeframe chart.

In case of any volatility, the stock will find support around its long-term moving averages (100-day and 200-day SMAs).

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 934 | Stop-Loss: Rs 908 | Target: Rs 985 | Return: 5.5 percent

The banking index has been showing an outperformance and it is continuing its uptrend after some consolidation phase. Within the private sector banks, Axis Bank is showing strength and has given a breakout above its previous swing high resistance.

The prices above its 20 EMA support, the volumes along the price upmove are good and the RSI oscillator is indicating a positive momentum.

Hence, we expect the uptrend to continue in Axis Bank, so short term traders can look to buy this stock around Rs 934 for potential targets of Rs 969 and Rs 985. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 908.

Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 351 | Stop-Loss: Rs 337 | Target: Rs 376 | Return: 7 percent

The stock has been consolidating within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern since last few months and prices have given a breakout from the pattern on Friday. This entire consolidation is above its weekly 200 EMA which indicates that long term uptrend is still intact.

The volumes have improved in last couple of sessions and if the stock gives a follow up move, then it could lead to a decent trended upmove going ahead.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock around current market price of Rs 351 for potential targets around Rs 365 and Rs 376. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 337.

Strategists at Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research believe that mortgage lender HDFC Limited will be replaced from the Nifty 50 index only after merger completion with HDFC Bank in Q1FY24. In the March 2023 review, they expect no changes.

Post-merger, HDFC Limited is likely to be replaced by one of these companies - Pidilite (PIDI), LTI Mindtree (LTIM), Ambuja Cement (ACEM), and Tata Power (TPWR), in the 50 stock index, it said.

According to the research note, authored by Abhilash Pagaria, “It is quite early to pinpoint a stock that holds the strongest chance to replace HDFC Ltd on its merger ex-date. We expect the merger’s completion by Q1FY24 and a few stocks currently on our radar are Pidilite (PIDI), LTI Mindtree (LTIM), Ambuja Cement (ACEM) and Tata Power (TPWR).”

It noted that Adani Power, Varun Beverages, ABB, Page Industries may enter Nifty Next 50 in March next year.

Nuvama highlighted that there are borderline chances of one of the three stocks -- Adani Wilmar or Trent and TVS Motor -- entering the next 50 index.

According to the National Stock Exchange (NSE) website, index reviews are carried out every six months to ensure that each security fulfills all the laid down criteria. Nifty50 uses researched and publicly documented rules for index revision.

Nuvema further added the merger of L&T Infotech (LTI) with Mindtree is unlikely to make it to Nifty 50 in March 2023 review, dispelling the market chatter.

“Until the merger is completed and fresh shares are credited to the shareholders, the index provider (NSE) will consider LTI as an independent entity,” it said.

Nuvama underlined that the most important criteria for a Nifty inclusion is that the stock should compulsorily be part of the derivatives segment.

For instance, the average free float market cap of Avenue Supermarts, Adani Green Energy, and Adani Transmission is significantly higher than most of the existing Nifty 50 constituents, but the stock has not been included in the index for the past few reviews as they are not a part of the F&O segment.

""If any of the above stock. gets included in derivatives by the announcement date, then it would make it to Nifty 50,"" it said.",378,-0.9401885867118835

A month after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) launched the pilot for a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), it has kick-started the pilot for the retail version which goes live today. The retail digital rupee, or e₹-R, can be used by people for day-to-day transactions.

With both wholesale and retail pilots live in the country, the RBI has joined 17 other central banks including those of China and South Korea whose pilots are underway. Over 60 central banks have expressed interest in launching their own digital currency and a total of 105 countries are at various stages of exploring the technology. With these pilots, India joins a global movement which is being seen as the next step of the evolution of currency.

The RBI on November 29 while announcing the pilot said that the implementation will be done in phases in partnership with a few banks and in some cities to start with and the scope will later be scaled up.

The pilot will be implemented among a small group of customers and merchants, starting with the four cities of Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru and Bhubaneswar. It will in the next phase be extended to Ahmedabad, Gangtok, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Indore, Kochi, Lucknow, Patna and Shimla.

While the e₹-R is built for customers like us, what does it exactly do and why is it different from current digital transactions through wallets and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI)? Here are five things to know about the e₹-R.

What is CBDC?

The RBI defines CBDC as legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form. It is similar to sovereign paper currency, but in a digital form and is exchangeable at par with the existing currency. Meaning, Rs 100 in CBDC form is the same as Rs 100 in the form of notes.

The key difference here is that a CBDC is issued directly by the RBI, not by banks, and will appear as liability on its balance sheet.

The foundational principles and core features for a CBDC have been laid down by the Bank for International Settlements and serve as guiding principles for central banks globally.

Use cases

The RBI said that in the current phase of the pilot, e₹-R can be used for person-to-person (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M) payments.

Mihir Gandhi, partner and leader for payments transformation at PwC India, said, “Key use cases may be programmable payments, cross-border payments with immediate benefits of lower cost of printing and managing currency, instant payments and finality of settlement and enhanced safety.”

The RBI also said that the e₹-R will offer features similar to that of physical cash like trust, safety and settlement finality. “As in the case of cash, it will not earn any interest and can be converted to other forms of money, like deposits with banks,” RBI added.

How will transactions work?

The RBI has identified four banks to be part of the initial phase of the pilot which will help the central bank to distribute the e₹-R. Similar to current digital transactions, the RBI said that transactions can be executed through wallets offered by participating banks.

Users can make payments to other users who are a part of the pilot, and e₹-R will also be interoperable with existing bank accounts. This means that users can transfer funds between their CBDC accounts and bank accounts eventually. For merchant transactions, customers will be able to scan QR codes to make payments.

How is this different from UPI?

The key difference is that customers accessing CBDC will have to open a separate CBDC account which will be connected to the RBI’s server. The transactions will not take place on the bank’s server like UPI, wallet, National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) or Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) transactions. Instead, the transactions will be executed and recorded on the RBI’s blockchain.

Monish Shah, partner at Deloitte, explained, “e₹-R is digital currency representing cash issued by the central bank and is non-interest-bearing. It's different from UPI which is an actual debit and credit from one bank account to another.”

“Once implemented, it will also give more benefits where users can create programmable money, meaning you can earmark money for specific end uses. This may be helpful in the case of direct benefit transfers and other disbursals to ensure that the money is being used for the reason it has been given. It will help reduce the overall physical cash in the economy and make the system more efficient,” he added.

Banks in the picture

The first four banks that will be a part of the pilot are State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank and IDFC First. Four more banks—Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank—will join this pilot subsequently, the RBI said. As of now, the RBI has not involved fintechs like PhonePe, Google Pay and Paytm, which are UPI leaders, in the pilot. With banks on board, users will be accessing CBDC through the apps of the banks and wallets provided by them.",842,0.9998735785484314

HDFC Bank expects to amalgamate its home loan major parent HDFC into itself by September next year, a top official said on Friday.

Both HDFC and HDFC Bank held general meetings on Friday to seek shareholder approvals for what is billed as the largest merger in Indian corporate history at over USD 40 billion.

At the time of announcing the merger on April 4 this year, the entities had said the merger will take 12-18 months.

""We believe going by the past practice and going by past trends, it will take about 8-10 months time before an effective date is announced,"" HDFC Bank's chief executive and managing director Sashidharan Jagdishan said at the meeting.

The merger will help expand the capital adequacy ratio of the merged entity by 0.20-0.30 per cent, courtesy the healthy capital adequacy of HDFC Ltd, he added.

Given the fact that bank deposits have to comply with mandatory cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio requirements, many shareholders at both meetings showed keenness to understand if the regulator will be offering some forbearance for the merged entity on this aspect.

In the HDFC meeting, its chairman Deepak Parekh said HDFC Bank is engaged with the Reserve Bank of India on the same but asked the shareholders to not worry.

""In case, the forbearances are not forthcoming, the merged entity is expected to have sufficient liquidity and alternatives available to meet the necessary funding requirements,"" Parekh said.

HDFC Bank's chairman Atanu Chakraborty said all of HDFC's subsidiaries will become subsidiaries of the merged entity, but there are some which cannot be a part of the bank and will be divested.

It will be seeking approvals from the RBI and insurance watchdog Irdai (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) for the merger of the subsidiaries, he said.

On the issue of board composition of the merged entity, Chakraborty said HDFC Bank will absorb some of the members of HDFC's board subject to requirements laid down under the Banking Regulation (BR) Act, Companies Act and other statutes, and added that age, tenure and area of expertise are looked at by the BR Act.

Parekh made it clear to HDFC shareholders that he will not be joining the HDFC Bank board given the age mandate and added that Chakraborty will continue as the chairman of HDFC Bank.

Chakraborty said HDFC's Renu Karnad will continue to be on the board of the bank as her appointment is for a period extending beyond the merger and the company secretary will also be joining the bank's management team.

Jagdishan said that over 3,500 employees of HDFC will be joining the 1.61 lakh-strong staff of the bank, and almost all of the 508 branches of HDFC will also get merged barring a few ones, which are in close proximity to an existing HDFC Bank branch, which will have to rationalise.

The bank has also sought regulatory approvals for transferring the fixed deposits of HDFC into the merged entity, and will pay interest as per the commitments, Jagdishan said.

Both meetings were chaired by NCLT-appointed Gautam Doshi, who said a copy of the voting result will be informed to the National Company Law Tribunal by Saturday evening.",535,0.9990264177322388

Vostro accounts are essential for correspondent banking and are usually held by a lender on behalf of their foreign counterpart.

RBI's nod to Canara Bank and HDFC Bank, as reported by Business Standard, comes nearly a week after Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal said that nine special Vostro accounts have been opened to facilitate overseas trade in the rupee.

""Nine accounts have been opened. One in Uco Bank, one in Sber, one in VTB and 6 with IndusInd Bank. These six are different Russian banks,"" news agency PTI had quoted Barthwal as saying on November 15.

Sberbank and VTB Bank -- the largest and second-largest banks of Russia, respectively -- are the first foreign lenders to receive the approval after the RBI announced the guidelines on overseas trade in the rupee in July.

Another Russian bank Gazprom - which does not have its bank in India - has also opened this account with Kolkata-based Uco Bank.

The move to open the special Vostro account clears the deck for settlement of payments in rupee for trade between India and Russia, enabling cross-border trade in the Indian currency, which the RBI is keen to promote.

The RBI has allowed the special Vostro accounts to invest the surplus balance in Indian government securities to help popularise the new arrangement, the PTI report added.

UCO Bank already has a Vostro account-based facility in Iran. Gazprombank, or GPB, is a privately-owned Russian lender and the third-largest bank in the country by assets.

Last month, the RBI and finance ministry asked the top management of banks and representatives of trade bodies to push export and import transactions in the rupee. They want banks in India to connect with their foreign counterparts for opening special rupee Vostro accounts to facilitate cross-border trade in the Indian currency rather than the popular mode of the US dollar.

2022-11-21 09:06:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/credit-card-review-tata-neu-hdfc-bank-credit-card-has-offers-galore-for-tata-loyalists-9562041.html,"In March 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lifted the ban it had imposed on HDFC Bank from launching new credit cards. Since then, the bank is adding new cards to its portfolio. Recently, the Tata Group and the HDFC Bank teamed up to launch co-branded credit cards in two variants, Tata Neu Plus HDFC Bank Credit Card and Tata Neu HDFC Bank Infinity Credit Card. The ‘plus’ variant is an entry-level card for new-to-credit (NTC) customers and the ‘infinity’ variant is the premium card with benefits across different categories.

Both cards offer good cashback/rewards while spending on Tata-partnered brands using the Tata Neu, the super-app launched by the conglomerate in April this year. Here is a review of these cards.

What does it offer?

Tata Neu Plus HDFC Bank and Tata Neu HDFC Bank Infinity cards offer 2 percent and 5 percent cashback, respectively, when used at Tata partner brands online and offline in the form of NeuCoins. You get an additional 5 percent cashback as NeuCoins on both variants of the card while shopping through the Tata Neu app. NeuCoins are the reward points that customers can earn and use with the Tata Neu app.

Some of these Tata partner brands are online pharmacy 1mg, grocer BigBasket, electronics store Croma, AirAsia, apparel and lifestyle outlet Tata CliQ, Indian Hotels (Taj, SeleQtions, Vivanta and others), retail fashion chain Westside, premium food delivery service Qmin, Tata Play, Tata Digital-backed fitness and wellness chain Cult.fit, and so on.

“The credit card is for digitally savvy customers who are looking for a rewarding experience on their shopping and lifestyle needs. These cards cater to shopping categories which range from groceries to electronics, travel, fashion and healthcare,” said an HDFC Bank spokesperson.

The minimum income eligibility for the Tata Neu Plus card is Rs 3 lakh a year for salaried and Rs 6 lakh for self-employed persons. For the Tata Neu Infinity card, the minimum income eligibility is an annual Rs 12 lakh for both salaried and self-employed persons.

The joining and annual fees for the Tata Neu Plus and Tata Neu Infinity cards are Rs 499 and Rs 1,499, respectively. As a welcome benefit, 499 and 1,499 NeuCoins are offered to Tata Neu Plus and Tata Neu Infinity card users, respectively. The value of one NeuCoin is equal to one rupee. “These credit cards are beneficial if you are a loyal customer of Tata brands,” said Shavir Bansal, founder and CEO of Kifaayat.com, a financial advisory firm.

You can apply for the cards through the Tata Neu app as well as the HDFC Bank website. Both variants of the card are available on RuPay and Visa networks.

What works

These cards are a good option for those who frequently travel domestically by air as the user gets complimentary access to airport lounges on both variants of the card.

The Tata Neu Infinity card offers a 10 percent unlimited cashback on AirAsia and Indian Hotels bookings with no capping. “This unlimited 10 percent cashback offering on flights and hotel bookings through Tata Neu app is a useful offer. If someone travels often and prefers Tata brands, for them having this credit card will be favourable,” said Bansal.

There are insurance benefits to Tata Neu Infinity cardholders with a cover of Rs 1 crore against accidental air death, emergency overseas hospitalisation cover of Rs 15 lakh and lost card liability cover worth Rs 9 lakh. However, other card issuers also offer similar protection on premium credit cards.

What doesn’t work

“The primary app, i.e., Tata Neu, itself is in the evolving stage. There are quite a few glitches users report while encashing NeuCoins and shopping through it,” said Parijat Garg, a digital lending consultant. He added that as of now, the Tata Neu app is not too stable.

A spokesperson from HDFC Bank, however, said, “We are confident in the processes put in place between us and the Tata Group. We value customer feedback, and our constant endeavour is to take corrective actions to improve customer experience.”

HDFC Bank and Tata Group have kept the rewards programme attractive to both variants of the credit card, but it’s limited to Tata brands. “Accumulated NeuCoins can be used only for limited brands, so it’s not a great attraction for the card users,” said Garg.

“If we compare both variants of Tata Neu credit cards with some of the existing card offerings of HDFC Bank, then it seems existing credit cards of the bank are giving more value compared to these cards,” said Garg. For instance, HDFC Bank’s Millennia credit card offers 5 percent cashback on select Tata brands as well as on Amazon, Flipkart, etc. Similarly, HDFC Bank’s Regalia credit card offers discounts on dining and allows redemption of accumulated reward points via the lender’s Smartbuy platform on flights and hotel bookings.

The bank charges 3.75 percent per month (or 45 percent annually) on Tata Neu Plus credit cards as interest rates on overdue balances. “This annual interest charge is steep. Most banks in the entry level segment charge 3.5 percent per month (42 percent annually) on the overdue amount,” said Bansal.

Should you apply?

The Tata Neu cards offered by HDFC Bank seem to be a good option for those who love shopping, but more so for those faithful to Tata brands. Either variant can be a decent add-on card depending on the spending habit on Tata brands.

“It cannot be a primary credit card because there are much better cards in the market with similar pricing and providing much better features,” said Bansal, adding that on Tata Neu credit cards, the rewards are very limited while using the card on non-Tata partner brands.

If you are an NTC and keen to become an HDFC Bank credit card holder, then you can consider signing up for generic credit cards instead of these co-branded credit cards, suggest experts.

“It is because you are getting better rewards/cashback offers on generic credit cards of HDFC Bank and the eligibility criteria remain similar,” said Garg.",1007,0.8413526192307472

The NSE Indices, a subsidiary of the National Stock Exchange, on November 18 announced changes in its methodology of Nifty equity indices for mergers after receiving feedback from market participants.

The revised changes will be applicable to the index constituent (index company or transferor) that merges with another company.

As per the proposed changes, ""the index company will be excluded from the index on the ex-date of merger which is closing of T-1 day,"" the NSE Indices said in its release. The exchange has made ex-date an important factor.

These changes will be applicable to all corporate actions involving mergers with an immediate effect.

Media reports indicated that these changes may be taking place ahead of the proposed merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank, to avoid sharp price movements of these stocks.

Transferor Company

In the case of indices which have a fixed number of constituents (stocks), the NSE Indices said on ex-date, a replacement of company would be made based on the eligibility criteria of respective indices in place of the transferor company which is being excluded.

In the indices with a variable number of constituents, NSE Indices will not replace any stock, on ex-date, in place of the transferor company which is being excluded.

The announcement of these changes would be made a minimum of three working days in advance for the change in the constituents of indices, including the indices on which Futures and Options are traded at NSE. Earlier the announcement was made four weeks prior to the index reconstitution date.

As per earlier or existing rules, in the case of indices with a fixed number of constituents, the transferor company is excluded from the index and the same is replaced with another eligible stock soon after the equity shareholders’ approval of a scheme of arrangement for the merger of a company.

In the case of a variable number of constituents, the transferor company is excluded from the index soon after the equity shareholders’ approval of a scheme of arrangement for the merger of a company without making a replacement in the index.

If we take ‘A’ company and ‘B’ company just as an example – ‘A’ company is the transferor and ‘B’ company is the merged entity.

Merged Entity

In the case of the merged entity, as per the revised rules, NSE indices said equity shares, the investible weight factor of the merged entity would be updated based on the terms of the merger on the ex-date (closing of T-1 day) of the merger.

Earlier, there were alternate methodologies. If the equity shares of the merged entity allotted to the shareholders of the transferor company (post-merger) account for more than or equal to five percent of the current equity of the merged entity, then these shares are updated for calculation of market capitalistion with effect from the last trading day (T Day) of the calendar month of listing of these shares.

Or if equity shares of the merged entity allotted to the shareholders of the transferor company (post-merger) account for less than 5 percent of the current equity of the merged entity, then these shares are updated for calculation of market capitalisation with effect from the last trading day of the corresponding calendar quarter (March, June, September and December).

In October, the NSE Indices had floated a consultation paper to seek changes in the methodology of merger and demerger of index constituents for equity indices to avoid big churnings, which take place in the current system.

The changes in the methodology of the demerger will be announced later.

""As responses on market consultation related to the treatment of demerger in Nifty equity indices require further deliberations with various stakeholders, changes related to the treatment of demerger shall be announced in due course,"" the NSE indices said.

""As expected, the modified methodology evades HDFC Ltd's immediate exclusion from Nifty 50. The stock will only get replaced by another contender on the ex-date (T Day) of the HDFC- HDFC Bank merger,"" said Abhilash Pagaria, Head - Alternative & Quantitative Research, Nuvama Wealth Management.

In the best case scenario, Nuvama expects the merger to get completed around April-May 2023.",693,

After the completion of HDFC and HDFC Bank's union, the weight of the merged entity could be double that of HDFC Limited in MSCI, according to a sales note by global financial services group Macquarie.

HDFC is part of MSCI indices whereas HDFC Bank is not. MSCI requires the proportion of shares available to foreign investors relative to the maximum allowed to be at least 15 percent and HDFC Bank fails to meet this criterion.

Despite the heavy FII selling earlier this year, HDFC Bank's ""foreign room"" as of September end stood at 11 percent, as per Macquarie.

So, what has changed?

MSCI's new rule says, ""When there is a corporate event affecting index constituents, non-index constituents that are involved in the event are considered for immediate inclusion in the MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes.""

The non-index constituent will be treated as a continuation of index constituents, it added. This means that HDFC Bank, which is a non-index constituent, will be treated as an extension of HDFC Limited.

How this removes the technical overhang

The merged entity has a foreign room of 17.3 percent as of September-end, which is above MSCI's 15 percent threshold, but another key technical overhang was the 0.5x adjustment factor.

""If a security's foreign room is less than 25 percent and equal to or higher than 15 percent, MSCI will use an adjustment factor of 0.5 to reflect the actual level of foreign room,"" according to the firm's website.

As per Macquarie's calculations, the adjustment factor of 0.5x would have resulted in free float-adjusted market capitalization of $63.1 billion.

But now since HDFC Bank will be considered an extension of HDFC Limited, the adjustment factor applicable will be 1x and not 0.5x. This implies free float-adjusted market capitalisation of $126.3 billion for the merged entity.

This is more than twice of HDFC Limited's current free float-adjusted market capitalisation of $55.9 billion, said the Macquarie note.

How does the weight go up?

Free float-adjusted market capitalisation is used to derive the weight of the stock in the index. Thus, HDFC Limited's 5.78 percent weight in MSCI could now go up to 13 percent of the merged entity.

Anjali Sinha, who has penned the Macquarie note, concludes, ""My understanding is that post the merger, HDFC Ltd stock is replaced by HDFC Bank and the weight goes up. It's time to load up.""

At 2.30 pm, both the stocks were trading 6 higher in trade and were the top index gainers. HDFC was quoting at Rs 2,661 on the National Stock Exchange and HDFC Bank was trading at Rs 1,617.

Banks are likely to confront higher retail loans turning bad as accelerating inflation, high interest rates and job losses hurt borrowers’ capacity to repay loans, experts and analysts told Moneycontrol on November 9.

“Retail slippages will see some rise in the coming quarters as the portfolio seasons as well as rising interest rates impacting the repaying capability of borrowers,” said Aditya Acharekar, associate director at the credit assessor CareEdge.

“There could be a rise in slippages in some discretionary products like personal loans. However, those are smaller tickets loans and banks have been their tightening the underwriting norms.”

A loan turns bad when a borrower does not pay interest on it for over 90 days.

Banks are continuing with the strategy to aggressively build their retail loan book. Lenders find retail loans safer compared with risky corporate loans because default rates are relatively lower.

What’s driving retail loan growth?

In the July-September quarter, most banks reported a sharp rise in retail loans. HDFC Bank, for instance, grew its retail loan book by 21.4 percent against a 2 percent increase in corporate and other wholesale loans.

ICICI Bank reported 25 percent growth in retail loans on a Year-on-Year (YoY) basis. State Bank of India’s retail personal advances alone grew by nearly 19 percent YoY in the quarter.

Not just that, a majority of banks have guided that the share of retail loans on their book will be higher than corporate loans in the coming quarters.

IDBI Bank’s Deputy Managing Director Suresh Khatanhar told Moneycontrol that the bank is looking at diversifying to other products apart from mortgage loans. These include auto loans, personal loans and education loans.

Bank of Baroda’s Managing Director Sanjiv Chadha said that from a risk-management viewpoint it is better to have a higher proportion of retail than corporate loans.

“I would expect that our growth in retail would continue to outstrip corporate growth for a few quarters, going ahead,” Chadha said.

COVID-hit economy recovers

According to bankers and analysts, the primary reason why banks are bullish on retail loan growth is that the COVID-hit economy is seeing signs of recovery.

There has been a revival in consumer spending, credit growth has picked up and banks’ collection efficiency has improved.

According to data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for September, personal loans jumped 19.6 percent YoY, compared with 13.2 percent a year back.

Within retail loans, credit card outstanding loans has risen sharply by 27.2 percent, compared with 11.3 percent in the previous year.

“We believe banks have focussed on retail for some time as capex demand is weaker and not secular. It does imply confidence in the retail book and some opportunities after the coming off of bottlenecks in some sectors like auto,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice president – research at Kotak Securities. “On a low base, revolving rates are lower, implying credit card (lending) could be aggressive. Home loans remain a strong proposition as well.”

Asset quality woes ahead?

The key question to ask is whether these loans will prove to be risky for banks. These loans carry a high risk in an economic downturn. In the event of a major global economic slowdown, accompanied with high interest rates and massive job losses, these could turn bad and create for problems for banks.

“Although the delinquency levels in aggregate consumer credit (across all categories) have declined in the last fiscal year for both public and private sector banks, with inflation still being high and without sustained growth in wages and job creation, there is a risk of consumers’ repayment capacity being hurt,” Abhishek Kumar, associate fellow, and Divya Srinivasan, research analyst, at Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP), wrote.

Inflation has been the buzzword in the economy. Persistently higher inflation has been the pain-point not just for the RBI, but also for borrowers. The RBI has hiked the repo rate by 190 basis points since May to curb inflationary pressure. Banks are quick to pass on the impact of rate hikes to customers.

Buying power

High inflation, on the other hand, erodes the purchasing power of borrowers and erodes their disposable income. That apart, instances of job losses have been quite high and that could hurt the repayment capacity of borrowers.

The RBI has failed to meet its price mandate, with the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for September confirming a third straight quarter in which average inflation has stayed outside the tolerance band of 2-6 percent.

According to data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on October 12, headline retail inflation rose to 7.41 percent in September from 7.00 percent in August.

Already, some banks have seen higher retail slippages in the July-September quarter. For instance, Bank of Baroda’s fresh retail slippages rose to Rs 585 crore compared to Rs 451 crore last year and Rs 575 crore in April-June.

Bankers said that although risks persist, the overall asset quality of banks is healthier, enabling them to absorb such stress.

“Right now, the focus for banks is to grow the retail book and gain a share of the pie. Yes, incrementally stress can crop up; we are even bracing for some slippages but you have to remember that overall health of the banks have also improved,” said a banker with a state-run bank on condition of anonymity.

The banker added that retail loans are generally small ticket loans, and with tighter underwriting practices, adequate provisions and early warning signals could help banks prevent huge asset quality risks.

Kotak Securities’ Dhame said that there is little evidence of high retail slippages as yet, and the trend will only become visible with time.

“We may (have to) wait to see a few more signs. Banks balance sheets are stronger now and these loans are granular, which is de-risking for the banks,” added Dhame.",1002,0.0873581996330848

The Reserve Bank of India encouraged Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and HDFC Bank to go for a merger in anticipation of stringent guidelines to regulate large non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), Deepak Parekh, the Chairman of the mortgage lender said.

“We knew that the Reserve Bank of India was coming out with new guidelines for large NBFCs. Half a dozen companies collapsed in the last 3-4 years — big ones,” Parekh said at an event in Kolkata earlier this week.

“… we knew that they (guidelines) were going to be announced, and they (RBI) encouraged us that it is better if we merge because they are bringing bank-like considerations for large NBFCs,” said Parekh. “...we had disadvantages of being an NBFC and no advantage of a bank.”

The RBI has been tightening vigilance on systemically important NBFCs, bringing their regulation on par with that of commercial banks to ring-fence the system. The collapse of infrastructure behemoth Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) in 2018 and subsequent failures of leading NBFCs like Reliance Capital, Dewan Housing Finance Corp and SREI have prompted the RBI to tighten its scrutiny on shadow lenders.

On April 19, this year, the central bank issued detailed guidelines on regulatory restrictions for NBFCs aligning their lending and disclosure rules for large NBFCs with banks.

Under the new norms, large NBFCs must not have an exposure higher than 20 percent of its capital base to any entity, and its board can approve an additional 5 percent exposure limit to take it to 25 percent, the RBI said in its circular. Unless sanctioned by the board, NBFCs in the middle and upper layers may not grant loans of Rs 5 crore and above to their directors or relatives of directors. These directions were effective from October 1.

A few days before these norms were released, HDFC Bank on April 4 had agreed to take over the biggest domestic mortgage lender in a deal valued at about $40 billion, creating a financial services titan. HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger. The deal is termed as the biggest transaction in India’s corporate history.

The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore. The merger is expected to be completed by the second or third quarter of FY24, subject to regulatory approvals.

The deal has got in-principle approval from the stock exchanges, RBI, Securities and Exchange Board of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and Competition Commission of India (CCI).

Parekh said at the event that although the merger will add value to all stakeholders, the key challenge is about integrating the two entities.

“The task (about the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger) is how to do the integration; integration is the big issue because there are two companies whose cultures, systems, technologies are different,” said Parekh.",499,-0.5387800931930542

Banks have been aggressively accumulating deposits by offering higher, lucrative interest rates to depositors following four consecutive repo rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The central bank is fighting a tough battle to contain persistently high retail inflation, which is hitting common households hard.

The impact of aggressive deposit mobilisation is likely to weigh on banks’ net interest margins (NIM) in the coming quarters, banking experts and analysts told Moneycontrol on October 31. In banking parlance, NIM refers to the amount of money that a bank earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits. It is an indicator of a bank's profitability and growth.

“There are expectations of a rate hike in the next monetary policy, which will still allow banks to pass on the incremental cost to advances linked to the benchmark, and deposit rates will continue to rise with a lag, protecting the NIM for FY23,” said Aditya Acharekar, associate director at CareEdge.

“However, some impact on margins may be seen in the first half of FY24,” he added.

Rate transmission and NIM

Rate cues from the RBI are transmitted to the economy when lenders adjust their lending and deposit rates based on the RBI's rate actions. For instance, if the RBI hikes the repo rate, then banks will have to borrow short-term funds at a higher cost from the central bank. Banks are also expected to pass on the benefit to borrowers by offering high-interest rates.

Often, monetary transmission happens based on the prevailing liquidity situation. Typically, banks are quick to pass on rate hikes to consumers through loans, but a pass-through to deposits comes with a lag. For much of FY23, banks took advantage of this scenario, which helped them sustain or improve their NIM.

“We are prepared to take a hit on NIMs next fiscal year, but that is an obvious situation given that we have to fund the credit growth through deposits,” said a banker with a private bank on the condition of anonymity. “Mobilising deposits looks like the way forward.”

According to Arun Malhotra, founding partner and portfolio manager of CapGrow Capital Advisors, banks will have to forego NIMs as they could be compressed in the range of 20-25 bps in the short to medium term. Banks, according to Malhotra, may need to increase spreads on fresh repo-linked loans in the next two to four quarters.

In the July-September quarter, HDFC Bank’s core NIM was at 4.1 percent on total assets, and 4.3 percent based on interest-earning assets. Axis Bank’s NIM was at 3.96 percent, while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s NIM stood at 5.17 percent in the reporting quarter. Relatively smaller peers IndusInd Bank and IDBI Bank reported NIMs of 4.24 percent and 4.37 percent, respectively.

The rate picture

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, recently made an upward revision in retail term deposit interest rates on amounts below Rs 2 crore, by up to 80 basis points. One bps equals one-hundredth of a percentage point. Indeed, most banks have increased their FD rates following the RBI’s 190 bps repo rate hike in the current cycle to rein in inflation.

According to bankers and experts, the ‘war’ for deposits is likely to continue as the RBI hikes rates further and as credit growth continues to expand. This could happen via aggressive deposit mobilisation in the coming months, said bankers. Analysts and economists expect the RBI to increase the repo rate to 6.50 percent by March from 5.90 percent currently.

Sumant Kathpalia, managing director and chief executive officer of IndusInd Bank, said that the lender would continue with its strategy to granularise deposits. The bank’s liabilities will be priced 50-to-75 bps higher than the market, he said at a conference call after the July-September earnings.

On average, banks have raised interest rates in the range of 25-80 bps across tenors. Fixed deposit rates of top banks in the three-year to five-year tenor for amounts below Rs 1 crore currently stand between 5.65 percent and 6.75 percent.

“It is natural for banks to be aggressive as liquidity remains constrained and credit growth is way ahead of deposit growth,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice-president, of research, at Kotak Securities. “Many banks have been aggressive already, and some have reached a point where a further increase in rates will cause a passthrough in borrower rates.”

Rush for deposits

The primary reason for the rush for deposits is the tightening liquidity in the banking system due to heavy currency leakage and heightened spending on account of the festive season. The RBI’s dollar sales in the foreign exchange market to prevent the rupee’s depreciation have also tightened liquidity.

The mismatch between credit growth and deposit growth has forced most banks to offer high rates on deposits and increase promotional activities for the same.

“If we look at the July-September banking results for FY23, one consistent finding is that advances are growing faster than deposits,” said Punit Patni, a research analyst at Swastika Investment.

“As a result, we anticipate banks raising their deposit rates in order to maintain CASA (current account savings account) deposits or raise money through term deposits. Additionally, due to the dearth of liquidity and good credit growth demand, all the banks are expected to be aggressive in mobilising deposits.”

This trend is likely to continue as credit growth continues to expand, interest rate hikes become more entrenched and liquidity in the system dries up further.

“We are expecting inflationary pressures to persist, and so rates may keep climbing till the end of this financial year,” said Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer at BankBazaar.com. “We may see small banks offer 8 percent or more (FD rates) during this period. If inflation persists, large banks will follow the trend.”

Analysts and industry experts said that the impact of the deposit rate hikes will also depend on the bank's liability and asset profile. Banks having granular, retail-based liability and floating advances are better placed and will witness a minimal impact on their NIMs, they said.

Jindal Haria, a director at India Ratings and Research, said that most banks would have to continue to increase deposit rates till they are confident deposit growth will mirror loan growth. NIMs, however, could expand some more before deposit pricing catches up fully, he said.

Fund-raising to continue

Apart from mobilising deposits, experts also expect banks to tap the market for funds to meet credit demand.

“Banks will have to raise funds from the capital markets through infra bonds, sub-debt and perpetual bonds quickly for long-term funding requirements to augment credit growth as CDs (certificates of deposit) and FDs may not match their long-term funding requirements,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.

Further, banks that are not able to get sufficient funds through FDs and CDs due to tight liquidity conditions will have to continuously increase rates to compete with their peers, added Srinivasan.",1196,0.11236542065938314

If the proposal is approved and implemented, HDFC Bank and Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) are likely to be among the first stocks to fall under the new rubric.

The HDFC-HDFC Bank merger will likely create the third-largest Indian company as measured by market capitalisation.

With HDFC being a part of the Nifty indices, the mortgage company’s scrip could witness massive selling from passive funds, market experts believe. A report from international financial services firm Investec pegged these outflows at $2.4 billion by way of 88 million shares from exchange-traded funds and index funds tracking the underlying indices as of December 2022. Emkay Global Financial Services estimated an outflow of $1.25 billion.

If the proposal by NSE Indices is approved, sharp swings could be avoided in the prices of shares of companies that are in the process of being included or excluded from the indices on account of buying and selling by passive funds that track these indices.

NSE Indices has proposed changes for the inclusion or exclusion of a company from or into the indices closer to the event.

The NSE arm is seeking feedback from the market regarding the methodology.

Read here | NSE Indices seeks market feedback on existing methodology of merger, demerger in Nifty Indices

Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research (formerly Edelweiss Alternative & Quantitative Research) believes that the proposal should get support from participants. The brokerage has batted for this change as it sees the new methodology avoiding big churning under the current methodology.

Currently, index reconstitution takes place at the time of exclusion of the transferor company and subsequently during the weight rebalancing of the stocks in the index.

“This results into churning of stocks twice in case passive funds (ETF/Index funds) are tracking such index,” NSE Indices said in a press release.

Punit Patni, an equity research analyst at Swastika Investmart, a financial services firm, believes a change in the methodology of merger and demerger of index constituents will prevent needless churn in the index and funds tracking such index.

“This move will be beneficial for HDFC and HDFC Bank shareholders, as the current expected $1.5 billion outflow in HDFC due to index rebalancing would have caused unnecessary loss for investors and traders at least in the short term,” Patni pointed out.

But Koushik Mohan, lead analyst at Ashika Institutional Equities, feels that this proposal “might not bring a revolutionary change”. His reasoning is that this would largely affect arbitrage fund managers who take advantage of special events like mergers and demergers but overall, except averting wild fluctuations in the stock price of the companies concerned, this proposal is unlikely to create any difference.

Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research said if the proposed changes are considered after the consultation is over, HDFC will only get excluded on the ex-date which will likely be Q1 of FY24.",514,-0.8406689763069153

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank (HDFCB) reported an in-line quarter, with PAT up 20% YoY, aided by a pick-up in NII growth due to 10bp QoQ expansion in margin. PPoP growth remained modest at 10% YoY, adversely impacted by a treasury loss of INR2.5b. However, Core PPoP growth was healthy at ~17% YoY in 2QFY23. Business growth remained healthy led by strong traction in Commercial and Rural Banking as well as Corporate book while Retail too grew strongly. HDFCB's asset quality ratios remained robust and witnessed a sequential decline led by moderation in slippages and healthy recoveries and upgrades. Restructured book too declined to ~53bp of loans in 2QFY23 (from 76bp in 1QFY23). Healthy PCR of ~73% and a contingent provision buffer (at 65bp of loans) provided comfort on asset quality. We estimate ~19% PAT CAGR over FY22-24, with an RoA/RoE of 2.0%/ 17.2%, respectively, in FY24.



Outlook

We expect the stock to perform gradually as revenue and margin revive further while the merger-related overhang ebbs as HDFCB looks to complete the merger by 1Q/2QFY24E. We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of INR1,800 (premised on 3x FY24E ABV).

YES Securities' research report on HDFC Bank

While management stopped short of providing margin guidance, they conceded some of the sequential expansion was transient: Management stated that there is a lead-lag effect in terms of rise in loan and deposit interest rates, leading to expansion in margin. On the other hand, they also added that retail lending, which is higher-margin than wholesale lending, has picked up for the bank over a period of time. Furthermore, the penetration of the customer base in terms of term deposits is just 14-15%, which implies that HDFCB may not have to woo rate-shoppers with unduly high TD rates

Outlook

We reiterate BUY rating on HDFCB with a revised price target of Rs 1830: We value the standalone bank at 2.7x FY24 P/BV for an FY23E/24E/25E RoE profile of 14.4/14.5/15.4%. We assign a value of Rs 229 per share to the subsidiaries, on SOTP.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB saw a good quarter with core earnings beating estimates by ~5% led by stronger NII and other income (excl. treasury) while asset quality was better. NIM was higher by 9bps due to superior yields driven by faster asset repricing, which is expected to outpace that of liabilities, suggesting that NIM would improve in near term. Retail wholesale mix remained stable QoQ at 43:57 owing to stronger growth in corporate. Targeted retail contribution is 55% however the bank would also focus on wholesale if it is RoA accretive. As per its strategy, deposit flow in H1FY23 was largely led by TD (+13% YTD). The bank clarified that it would not resort to aggressive pricing in deposits. We upgrade FY23 earnings by 6% mainly led by higher NIM/NII while there is no material change in FY24/25E PAT.

Outlook

We remain positive on HDFCB though near term focus would remain on merger. Valuation is undemanding at 2.3x Sep’24 core ABV. We maintain multiple at 3.0x and TP at Rs1,800. Retain BUY.

Last week, Federal Bank and country’s largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, announced quarterly earnings. Analysts find the key numbers as good particularly in terms of credit growth and improvement in asset quality. To get a perspective, let’s look at some key numbers.

HDFC Bank’s total advances as of September 30, 2022 were Rs 14.4 lakh crore, an increase of 23.4 percent over the previous year. Domestic retail loans grew by 21.4 percent, commercial and rural banking loans grew by 31.3 percent and corporate and other wholesale loans grew by 27 percent. Overseas advances constituted 3.1 percent of total advances.

In the case of Federal, total advances increased 19.4 percent to Rs 1.64 lakh crore as of September 30, 2022. The bank, in a conference call, called it the strongest quarter till date with very good growth across all key parameters. In terms of asset quality too, the improvement was visible. For HDFC Bank, gross non-performing assets (NPAs) were at 1.23 percent of gross advances as on September 30, 2022, as against 1.35 percent as on September 30, 2021.

Net non-performing assets were at 0.33 percent of net advances as on September 30, 2022. Federal Bank’s gross NPAs at 2.46 percent came lower than the 2.69 percent in the previous quarter. These numbers, if they offer any indication, signal good news for the overall banking sector health in the July-September quarter. But, it is too early to call it as other big bank results are lined up in the approaching days.

What are the challenges ahead?

The risks emanating from a prolonged delay in economic recovery and fast rising interest rates are clearly staring at the sector. The repo rate, the key lending rate of the central bank at which short-term funds are offered to banks, has gone up by nearly two percentage point in the current rate hike cycle.

Jayanth Varma, one of the six MPC members, highlighted in the MPC minutes released last week that it is dangerous to push the policy rate well above the neutral rate in an environment where the growth outlook is very fragile. “While the level of economic output has recovered to pre-pandemic levels, it remains well below the pre-pandemic trend line,"" said Varma who voted in favour of a 50 bps policy rate hike but voted against the majority resolution of further withdrawal of accommodation.

How does rising interest rates impact banks' business?

The higher cost will have to be reflected in lending and deposit rates. Credit growth may slow in the approaching quarters with costlier loans. Also, cost of funds may come under pressure with deposit rates going up further. Also, as exemptions and relaxations given to banks during Covid expire and normal repayments begin, banks may see pressure on asset quality especially on loans given to small and medium sized companies.

A lot will depend on how the growth-inflation scenario evolves.

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post June quarter earnings

Prabhudas Lilladher

HDFC Bank saw a good quarter with core earnings beating estimates by ~5% led by stronger NII and other income (excl. treasury) while asset quality was better. NIM was higher by 9bps due to superior yields driven by faster asset repricing, which is expected to outpace that of liabilities, suggesting that NIM would improve in near term.

We upgrade FY23 earnings by 6% mainly led by higher NIM/NII while there is no material change in FY24/25E PAT. We remain positive on HDFC Bank though near term focus would remain on merger. Valuation is undemanding at 2.3x Sep’24 core ABV. We maintain multiple at 3.0x and Target Price at Rs 1,800. Retain BUY.

Motilal Oswal

HDFC Bank reported a steady quarter with recovery in Core PPoP growth and margins though treasury loss dragged PPoP. Loan growth was driven by a sustained momentum in Retail segment, along with robust growth in Commercial and Rural Banking as well as Wholesale loans.

Asset quality ratios remained robust, while the restructured book moderated to 53bp of loans. Healthy PCR and a contingent provisioning buffer provided comfort on asset quality.

We estimate HDFC Bank to deliver ~19% PAT CAGR over FY22-24, with an RoA/RoE of 2.0%/17.2% in FY24. Maintain buy with a Target Price of Rs 1,800 (premised on 3x FY24E ABV).

We expect the stock to perform gradually as revenue and margin revive further while the merger-related overhang ebbs as HDFCB looks to complete the merger by 1Q/2QFY24E.

Nirmal Bang

Aggressive branch expansion is leading to higher opex cost and is likely to remain elevated in the short term as the focus is to expand the distribution network. Credit cost stood at 87bps vs 130bps in 2QFY22 and is expected to remain range-bound as the bank continues to carry excess provisions.

Asset quality improved on a sequential basis, led by declining delinquencies. We expect earnings growth to remain strong and estimate FY25E ROA/ROE at 1.9%/17.1%. However, we remain cautious about merger transition, which along with elevated opex and margin trajectory would be key monitorables going forward.

We maintain buy on HDFC Bank with a target price (TP) of Rs 1,805 (2.8x 1HFY25E ABVPS + value of subsidiaries).

Nomura

We maintained buy rating on the stock with target at Rs 1,690 per share.

The Q2 was a beat on lower provisions.

We revise FY23/24/25 EPS estimates by +4.8%/-0.8/-2.7% and forecast 15.5% & 16.2% EPS & core BV CAGR over FY22-25, reported CNBC-TV18.

Morgan Stanley

According to Morgan Stanley, the profit was strong at 20% YoY led by revenue growth. The core PPoP growth has been on a sustained rebound, while margin has improved & has an upside risk.

Morgan Stanley expect 19-20% core PPoP growth in FY24/FY25, reported CNBC-TV18.

CLSA

The bank continue to deliver best-in-class loan growth of 23% YoY, said CLSA.

Broking house increases FY24-25 estimates by 1.5-2% and expect an RoE of 17.5% by FY24-25, reported CNBC-TV18.

Credit Suisse

The company strong operating performance, led by pick up in topline growth, while asset quality stable with net slippage at 90 bps & credit costs at 100 bps, said Credit Suisse.

The NPL cover is strong at 73% & contingent provisions of 65 bps. It is well capitalised & it remains among fastest growing banks, reported CNBC-TV18.

HDFC Bank on October 15 reported healthy second-quarter earnings with double-digit growth in the bottom line on strong growth in loans and improvement in asset quality.

1 Strong net profit

The bank’s standalone profit after tax grew by 20.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 10,605.8 crore in the July-September quarter, up from Rs 8,834.3 crore in the same quarter of the previous financial year.

The profit growth was higher than estimates. Analysts were expecting a 16 percent increase in net profit for the fiscal second quarter.

Kotak Institutional Equities expected an NII growth of 17 percent YoY for the quarter. Core net interest margin was at 4.1 percent on total assets, and 4.3 percent based on interest-earning assets.

2 Robust credit growth

HDFC Bank’s total advances as of September 30, 2022 were Rs 14.4 lakh crore, an increase of 23.4 percent over the previous year. The balance sheet size was Rs 22.3 lakh crore as against Rs 18.4 lakh crore in the year-ago period year, registering a growth of nearly 21 percent.

3 Upbeat deposit growth

The lender's total deposits showed healthy growth and were at Rs 16.73 lakh crore as of September-end, a 19 percent YoY increase. The growth in deposits comes at a time when banks are struggling to mobilise deposits amid a fast-tightening of liquidity surplus and to protect their margins.

Current Account Savings Account (CASA) deposits grew by 15.4 percent, with savings account deposits at Rs 5.30 lakh crore and current account deposits at Rs 2.3 lakh crore.

4 Improved asset quality

The asset quality of the lender improved during the second quarter of the financial year 2022-23. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) were at 1.23 percent of gross advances as on September 30, 2022, as against 1.35 percent as on September 30, 2021. Net non-performing assets were at 0.33 percent of net advances as on September 30, 2022.

Provisions and contingencies for bad loans also dropped to Rs 3,240.1 crore as against Rs 3,924.7 crore in the same quarter of the previous financial year.

5 Healthy capital ratios

The bank’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) as per Basel III guidelines was at 18 percent at the end of September against a regulatory requirement of 11.7 percent. Tier 1 CAR was at 17.1 percent compared to 18.7 percent last year. Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was at 16.3 percent as of September 30.

The shareholder meeting will be convened on November 25, 2022 for the purpose of considering and approving the Scheme of Amalgamation, HDFC said in a regulatory filing on Friday.

HDFC Ltd has also received approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for transfer of HDFC Property Ventures Limited (HPVL), a wholly-owned subsidiary, to HDFC Bank. Termed as the biggest transaction in India’s corporate history, HDFC Bank on April 4 agreed to take over the biggest domestic mortgage lender in a deal valued at about USD 40 billion, creating a financial services titan.

The deal has got in-principle approval from the stock exchanges, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Sebi, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and Competition Commission of India (CCI).

The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore. The merger is expected to be completed by the second or third quarter of FY24, subject to regulatory approvals.

Once the deal is effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 per cent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 per cent of the bank.

The brokerage believes the affordable housing financier could provide strong earnings growth in the coming years driven small size and ‘good’ execution track record that should enable a 29 percent annualised growth in assets under management over the next three years.

HDFC Bank is expected to report a healthy 16 percent increase in net profit for the July-September quarter on the back of a strong 23 percent growth in loans and stable net interest margins.

The bank’s profit is seen at Rs 10,681 crore, an average of estimates of seven brokerages shows. Its core interest income is expected to be Rs 20,594 crore, a growth of 15 percent year-on-year.

Much of this will be powered by loan growth in excess of 20 percent, while a sequential accretion in margins may also add a boost to core earnings.

“We expect NII (net interest income) growth at around 17 percent YoY, from Rs 17,684.4 crore, led by solid loan growth of 23 percent YoY,” said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities.

In an early update on its Q2 performance, the bank said its loans increased by 23 percent for the quarter, led by a robust 22 percent growth in retail loans. At this level, the bank is back to its heyday of strong loan growth that averaged 24 percent pre-pandemic.

Both retail and corporate loans have increased at a fast pace. Higher retail lending essentially helps the bank to maintain margins as corporate loans tend to be priced aggressively. The bank’s small business loans to have shown double-digit growth consistently over several quarters.

Advantage deposits

Analysts said HDFC Bank will continue to surpass its peers in terms of increasing lending, given its strong liability franchise.

“HDFC Bank’s retail deposits have grown strongly at 6 percent QoQ, much higher than the flattish growth for the sector, clearly demonstrating the bank’s strong franchise. We believe strong liability franchises become more valuable when rates rise,” analysts at Edelweiss Securities wrote in a note.

The high share of low-cost current accounts and savings accounts (CASA) would support margins. Lending rate hikes may also result in a sequential improvement in margins.

However, analysts at Kotak pointed out that HDFC Bank’s loan book structure could keep margins lower than peers. The bank has a retail-heavy book and also a higher proportion of fixed-rate loans.

“Given the increase in lending rates, we calculate that NIM will expand by 7- 10 bp. Even if NIM expands, the increase will be lower than other banks,” the Edelweiss analysts said.

Asset quality

HDFC Bank will show pristine asset quality ratios, in keeping with the past trend. Its gross bad loan ratio may remain around the 1.0-1.5 percent mark.

Seasonal stress in farm loans may moderate, dragging slippages down sequentially, according to analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services. Analysts noted that growth in riskier unsecured retail loans as well as small business loans is high. But HDFC Bank’s high provision coverage ratio compared with peers also adds to investor comfort.

“The bank carries a cumulative credit-related contingency + floating buffer of 80 bp and total provisions (comprising specific, floating, contingency and general) of Rs 307 billion is equivalent to 2.2 percent of advances or 170 percent of GNPA (gross non-performing assets). We estimate credit cost to settle 0.9 percent-1 percent,” ICICI Securities said in a note. The management’s comments on its unsecured loan book would be keenly noted by investors.

HDFC Bank shares have declined 14.7 percent so far this year.

While healthy loan growth along with stable margins and low credit costs may boost HDFC Bank’s profit, high operating expenses could mean softer operating profit growth. The bank has been expanding operations through new branches as well as investing in digital capabilities. This is expected to keep expenses high, which could put pressure on operating profit growth.",681,0.6271756738424301
2022-10-12 19:41:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/september-cpi-at-7-41-mpc-likely-to-hike-repo-rate-by-at-least-35-bps-in-december-9318931.html,"A persistently higher inflation print in September builds the case for the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to hike the repo rate by at least 35 basis points (bps) at its next policy meeting in December, economists told Moneycontrol on October 12.

Headline retail inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 7.41 percent in September from 7.00 percent in August. At 7.41 percent, the September CPI inflation figure was slightly above the consensus estimate. As per a Moneycontrol poll, CPI inflation was seen rising to 7.3 percent.

Inflation has now completed three full years above the central bank’s medium-term target of 4 percent. More importantly, inflation has been outside the mandated 2-6 percent tolerance range for three consecutive quarters, which is the definition of failure under the flexible inflation targeting framework.

“Food inflation continued to play spoilsport, pushing up the headline inflation. Besides, higher services inflation and base effect were at play,” said Swati Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank. “Going forward, we expect the headline inflation to remain above the RBI’s upper tolerance band of 6 percent until February 2023.”

Arora expects inflation to average at 6.7 percent for FY23, in line with the RBI’s estimate, with upside risks emanating from higher-than-expected food prices. On the policy front, she expects the MPC to deliver a 35 bps repo rate hike in December and another 25 bps in February.

Rate hike imminent

As per the law, the RBI must now submit a report to the central government explaining why it failed to contain inflation, the remedial actions it proposes to take, and the time period within which inflation will return to target.

Economists said that upside risks to food inflation have grown with unseasonal rains hitting major crop producing states in October, with both harvest and sowing estimated to have taken a hit. That could keep overall inflation elevated, they added.

“Vegetable inflation too remains stubbornly high,” said Sonal Badhan, an economist at Bank of Baroda. “The full impact of this (unseasonal rains) on prices of cereals, pulses and vegetables is yet to be seen and risks are tilted to the upside.”

Core (non-fuel and food) inflation, which was at 6.1 percent in September as per Moneycontrol calculations, too is hardening, owing to a revival in demand, noted Badhan. Core inflation is unlikely to cool down anytime soon, with the onset of the festival season further supporting demand, she said.

According to Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, another rate hike is certain in the December policy meeting. The quantum of the next rate hike, however, will be determined by how much the inflation print recedes in October, as well as the strength of gross domestic product (GDP) growth for July-September.

The MPC has already hiked the repo rate—or the rate at which the RBI lends funds to banks—by 190 bps since April. The repo rate currently stands at 5.90 percent.

“The surge in prices of cereals, vegetables and pulses is continuing into October as well. The unseasonal rains are further expected to keep the food prices volatile,” said Upasna Bhardwaj, chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank. “We expect the RBI to hike the repo rate by 35-50 bps in the December policy, with the next move being more data-dependent.”

Money market implications

The rise in inflation and expected rate hikes will dampen bond market sentiment, money market experts said.

“Bond yields are expected to go up further when the market opens tomorrow. With the expectation of further hikes in MPC policy, bond yields will continue to go up. Besides, with tight liquidity conditions, we can expect 10-year bond yield to break the barrier of 7.50 percent now,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner, Rockfort Fincorp, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.

The rupee, on the other hand, is expected to trade in the range of 81.60 to 83.20 to the dollar in the near term, dealers said. The rupee closed at 82.35 against the dollar on October 12.

“I personally continue to expect another 50 bps rate hike by the MPC in the December policy,” said Kunal Sodhani, vice-president, the global trading centre, Shinhan Bank. “For USD/INR pair, I continue to expect a broader range of 81.60 to 83.20 to continue for some more time. All eyes now remain on US CPI data as the Fed (Federal Reserve) clearly states they remain data-dependent for future policies.”

Gaura Sen Gupta, India economist at IDFC First Bank, said that in case the Fed hikes policy rates by 75 bps in November, the RBI could hike the repo rate by 50 bps in December.

“We see the terminal repo rate between 6.50 and 6.75 percent, depending on the degree of hawkishness of the Fed,” she added.",819,0.00337679386138916

The date was October 6, 2022. The stage was set, and the room was abuzz, flickering with multiple disco lights. HDFC Bank was all set to launch its newest digital initiative in one of Mumbai’s fancy five-star hotels. Bankers, fintech players and journalists were all there, revelling in one of the most glittering events in the banking landscape.

The event was the launch of the SmartHub Vyapar Merchant app, which would facilitate instant, digital and paperless merchant on-boarding for the bank’s customers. The app was developed by HDFC Bank in partnership with Mintoak Innovations, a merchant SaaS (software as a service) platform.

Such events, to launch their digital initiatives, have become the new normal in the banking space. Banks today are no longer confined to their traditional brick-and-mortar setup or the exhausting paperwork of old. They are getting with it.

Fintechs fuelling change

A major reason for banks constantly revolutionising and upgrading their digital services is the rise of fintechs. Relying on smartphones for almost everything is the new normal, particularly when it comes to financial services. Fintech companies have become an integral part of the country’s economy, keeping it on the move.

Today, India has more than 7,000 fintech startups, operating in various segments. Such is the breadth of their presence that they have a finger in every pie, from payments and online credit facilities to subscription management and peer-to-peer lending.

With the growing presence of fintechs, banks have realised that they need to gear up on the technology front. Banks are using artificial intelligence to ensure smooth customer identification and authentication, while also mimicking live employees through chatbots and voice assistants.

The use of Aadhaar and video know-your-customer (KYC) along with card-less cash withdrawals and paperless customer on-boarding are some of the tools that reflect acceleration in the digitisation of banking in India.

Gone are the days when consumers had to wait for hours to reach the front of the queue, complete formalities, fill forms and access customer care for assistance at banks. With fintech banking solutions, self-service capabilities provide customers with operational processes that were previously only available via a physical branch. Not just that, bank-to-bank payments have become the new normal.

The opportunity to tap this trend is huge. According to an E&Y report, only about 12 percent of Indian adults—fewer than 20 percent of account owners —had made a digital merchant payment in 2021. However, two-thirds of those who made a digital merchant payment did so for the first time after the onset of COVID-19. Also, the share of account owners with an inactive account in India is 35 percent, which was the highest globally in 2021.

Fintechs have been driving this change.

“The primary evolution that the fintech players in the country have brought in is that they have digitalised financial processes. One of the major trends in the fintech sector is digital lending, through which borrowers can avail of a loan through applications on their mobile,” said Mahesh Shukla, founder of PayMe, a fintech.

According to Shukla, fintechs have also significantly reduced and also simplified the documentation process. One of the major challenges in conventional banking is that it was earlier difficult for people in rural areas to access loans. Fintech has made it easy for people from all parts of the country to do so online, added Shukla.

Globally, too, cross-border remittance is a growing opportunity, with payment volumes expected to cross the $156 trillion mark in 2022, according to the E&Y report. Banks would require technology to cater to this growth, something that fintech companies are already providing.

Rise in fintechs

As of July 2022, India had over 7,300 fintech startups, according to ""The Winds of Change"" report presented by EY during the 2022 Global Fintech Festival in Mumbai. The EY report said Indian fintechs received $7.8 billion in funding in 2021, way more than the $2.9 billion they received in 2020.

According to the Chiratae and EY report, lending AUMs in Indian fintech have the potential to grow from $38 billion currently to $515 billion by 2030.

Fintechs are increasingly looking to capture underserved markets with their presence, convenience and technology. With the growing number of fintechs in India, banks are beginning to feel the heat and are gearing up on the technology front.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, for example, hired a chief technology officer recently, while other big lenders such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are ramping up tech teams through lateral hiring.

Fino Payments Bank has also appointed a Chief Digital Officer and plans to recruit many people for this division to drive digital banking among the youth.

“Several years back, most banks and large institutions began hiring Chief Digital Officers or Chief Data Officers. These trends are normal every time an industry goes through a massive change,” said Amit Das, chief executive officer and co-founder of Think360.ai, a Mumbai-based data science company.

“In a way, with the growth of fintechs, banks are aspiring to become savvier, and the advent of transformative technologies like AI (artificial intelligence) will force these realignments.”

Das’ views were corroborated by Kotak Mahindra Bank’s first chief technology officer, Milind Nagnur. In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol on September 14, Nagnur spoke of an important shift — that of viewing the bank as a software engineering-focused organisation. In his view, the new definition of trust in banking for customers is not about the safety of assets, but about how dependable a bank’s digital offerings are.

Are banks worried?

According to bankers, the rise of fintechs has indeed revolutionised the lending industry, with most traditional banks trying to catch up with fintechs. If anything, fintech lending has only threatened the ‘traditional’ way of banking and lending, which is good for customers and the market. However, it is too nascent to say that they could replace banks altogether, they added.

Banks have superior funding franchises, arguably more underwriting expertise, and a widespread distribution or collection network that is also becoming a lot more digital. Fintech companies have better technology capabilities, user interfaces, and innovative solutions.

According to industry players, both banks and fintech companies have realised the advantages the other offers and have come together to offer comprehensive solutions.

“Over the decade, especially after the start of the pandemic, it has been clearly proven that fintechs and banks have a collaborative relationship rather than a competitive one,” said Murali Ramakrishnan, managing director and chief executive officer at South Indian Bank.

“I feel that fintechs will continue to have the role of an enabler rather than a competitor. Even with banks’ legacy infrastructural gaps, they do have a firmly established long-term client base that is unlikely for fintechs to replace,” Ramakrishnan added.

According to Akhil Handa, chief digital officer at Bank of Baroda, while technological advances are not new to finance, digital innovation has brought major improvements in the connectivity of systems, in computing power and cost, and in newly created and usable data. These improvements have alleviated transaction costs and given rise to new business models and new entrants like fintechs.

“Fintechs have demonstrated that they can transform the financial-landscape, where consumers get to choose from a larger set of options at competitive prices and build efficiency through lower operational costs,” said Handa. “Banks may have lost some customers to mobile fintech applications, but this has also created an opportunity like never before for banking institutions and inspired them to embrace change.”

Large unbanked population

Another reason why there is a tremendous opportunity for both players to survive in this landscape is the large number of unbanked Indians. Around 200 million Indians are unbanked, according to the Global Findex Database –2021. That’s quite a large number for both fintechs and banks to tap into.

“In India, we have enormous unmet demand for credit and enough space for many players. So, thinking that fintechs are eating into banks’ business is rather odd,” said Sugandh Saxena, chief executive officer at the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE).

Saxena added that most traditional banks are trying to catch up with fintechs, which only pose a threat to the ‘traditional’ way of banking. Banks in India have capital, scale, credibility and a much larger mandate, he added.

Bank of Baroda’s Handa said that while there has been increased competition from fintechs in the last few years in segments like payments and lending, banks have taken on this challenge as an opportunity.

Fintechs, according to Handa, have to an extent inspired banks to make product delivery seamless and on the go. Banks are delivering products with enhanced user experience and have made customers transition back to using the products and services of incumbents, he said. Rather than fear, he feels it is “healthy competition” between two entities striving to constantly push each other to serve their clientele better every day.

Can fintechs replace banks?

For a while back in 2021, the question often asked was: will fintechs be a threat to banks? Today, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has left no one in doubt about the answer, going by the slew of circulars that it has issued to rein in fintechs.

“The RBI seems hell-bent on regulating fintechs through banks or NBFCs (non-banking finance companies), and hence our models will have to evolve around that,” said a fintech founder, on condition of anonymity. “Our wings are clipped, so we have to depend on banks and NBFCs for survival. With the kind of regulations that the RBI has brought in, it is impossible for fintechs to replace banks altogether.”

According to Rajat Deshpande, chief executive officer and co-founder of FinBox, the plan for legacy players—banks and NBFCs—looks like this: improve your technology stack, partner with fintechs where you can’t build it yourself, and convert the entire suite of offerings into a digital-first business where the cost of delivery is lower.

This way, there’s much more potential to increase revenue per customer, said Deshpande. Direct acquisition of customers, added Deshpande, is becoming increasingly expensive and hence eats into margins quickly.

However, some bankers said that while banks’ cost of spending on digital transformation has increased, the costs may be plateauing.

“I think we are plateauing; 50 percent is at an aggregate level. At an aggregate level we are clearly seeing a plateauing of costs already,” said Parag Rao, group head – payments, consumer finance, technology and digital marketing at HDFC Bank at the launch of the SmartHub Vyapar app.

The way forward: collaboration or confrontation?

At least seven bankers and fintechs Moneycontrol spoke to said that collaboration, and not competition, is the way forward. Rather than competing with each other, it would be best for fintechs and banks to identify each other’s strengths and play the market together, added industry players.

“It's no longer going to be an 'us versus them'. Banks and fintechs have both realised that they accomplish more when they are collaborating, instead of competing,” said Srikanth Mopidevi, managing director and head of technology at DBS Bank India. “By working in tandem, banks are able to provide customer-friendly technology, while fintechs benefit from the large-scale network and customer data available with the banks.”

The next few years, Mopidevi said, will see a host of new collaborations expected to further improve the banking experience. Bank-fintech partnerships have especially enabled smaller banks to innovate and become competitive. However, fintechs will complement and enhance the existing banking landscape and not replace it, he added.

HDFC Bank’s Rao concurred with Mopidevi’s view. Rao said that he believes “very strongly” in the partnership philosophy and that the bank is open to more partnerships with fintech players.

Fintech players, too, believe that the partnership model will work well for both sides. “We believe that neo-banks and traditional Banks can work together to increase the size of the pie and play off each other’s strengths,” said Kunal Varma, co-founder and CEO of Freo, a consumer neobank. “This would lead to a win for the consumer, reduction in costs, and rapid market expansion with sustainable profit pools for the industry.”

This trend is currently visible. In September, Axis Bank partnered with fintech firm PayNearby to launch savings and current accounts for last-mile merchants. IDBI Bank has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Vay Network Services as its first fintech partner for digital supply chain finance solutions (e-SCF). There are many such examples.

According to the EY report cited earlier, collaborations between traditional financial services players such as banks with fintech startups is “business as usual” now and enabled by the proliferation of APIs (application programming interfaces, which allow myriad software types to communicate with each other) and data sharing norms.

With limited new licences, fintech startups only have the partnership route to go to market, and that is being welcomed by banks, the report said.

Fund raising through corporate bond sales rose sharply by 49% month-on-month to Rs 82,378 crore on the back of large issuance by some banks and state-owned entities even as the rates on these instrument rise, dealers said.

This was because most issuers have raised funds before yields started to move up, said Umesh Kumar Tulsyan, managing director of Sovereign Global Markets, a New Delhi-based fund house.

Corporate bonds are debt securities issued by private and public corporations. Companies issue corporate bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes, whether building a new plant, purchasing equipment, or growing their business. When one buys a corporate bond, one effectively lends money to the ""issuer,"" the company that issued the bond.

According to data from Prime Database, companies and banks raised funds worth Rs 82,378 crore in September, compared to Rs 55,500 crore raised in the previous month. Data also showed that funds raised in September was the highest in the current financial year.

State Bank of India, Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd, Power Finance Corp., Small Industries Development Bank of India, and HDFC Bank were among the top five issuers in September, together raising Rs 31,708 crore. The money raised by these five entities amounted to 39% of the total funds raised in September.

""The view of the market was that the yield will be moving up and all wanted to fulfil their capital requirement, so somehow they timed the best of the market to raise funds,"" Tulsyan added.

""Issuance has risen in September because bond yields were supported due to expectation of global bond index inclusion, positive FPI (foreign portfolio investment) flows, lower SDL (State Development loans) supply and strong investors demand which reflected in primary issuance bidding. Also credit off-take has been positive, clocking around 16% Y-o-Y growth and with the festive season approaching we may see a significant rise in demand for money,"" said Sanjay Pawar, Fund Manager – Fixed Income, LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Ltd.

Yield movement

Yield on corporate bonds maturing in three years rose by 45 basis points, five years by 40 basis points and 10-year by 22 basis points month-on-month in September, tracking an uptick in government securities yield and low demand from mutual funds. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Pawar added that the market had seen a hardening of yields across the segment both in government securities and corporate bonds due to a delay in the inclusion of the country's bonds in its global index, the central bank hiking rates aggressively, a rally in crude prices, weakening rupee and draining out of liquidity from system.

Further, the yield on benchmark government bonds has risen by 25 basis points, whereas due to the quarter-end there was redemption pressure on mutual funds that led to a rise in yields on corporate bonds.

According to data compiled from the corporate bond deals, the yield on three-years corporate bonds that were trading at a 7.10% rose to 7.55% in September, yield on five-years paper rose to 7.65% from 7.20%, and the yield 10-year paper rose to 7.72% from 7.50%.

Going forward

Debt dealers said yields are expected to rise further due to heavy supply in the second half of the current financial year and expectations of further rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

While issuers will keenly watch the movement of the yield on government securities, which were expected to rise further given higher crude oil prices.

Usually, higher Brent crude oil prices put pressure on the inflation print, leading to a dampening of investor sentiments . In the last few days, Brent crude oil prices had risen sharply after OPEC and its allies decided to cut production output by 2 million barrels per day. Brent crude oil prices were trading at $97.38.

Moreover, the spread between corporate bonds and government securities, which is hovering at a historical low, is expected to rise as supply may increases and if liquidity conditions tighten further, Pawar said.",700,0.07836971879005432

HDFC Bank, the country’s largest private sector lender, aims to bring two crore merchants on to its digital banking platform over the next three years, Parag Rao, group head - payments, consumer finance, technology and digital marketing, told Moneycontrol on Thursday (October 6).

Payment processors use the term ‘merchant’ to refer to their customers. Customers, or merchants, are businesses that accept credit card payments from their clients in-person, online, or over the phone via the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

“We ride on our existing strengths as a merchant acquirer. We are already the market leader in the merchant acquiring space, with 50 percent plus share of card acceptance volumes,” Rao told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview. “…We are three million plus (over 30 lakh) merchants today. In the next three years, we expect to be a 20 million (2 crore) player.”

Rao was talking on the sidelines of HDFC Bank’s launch of SmartHub Vyapar Merchant app, which facilitates instant, digital and paperless merchant on-boarding for the bank’s customers. The app has been developed by HDFC Bank in partnership with Mintoak Innovations, a merchant SaaS (software as a service) platform.

Banks and fintech: Collaboration or confrontation?

Rao said that the era of partnerships between banks and fintechs is here. He elaborated that fintechs have brought to the industry an “agile, nimble” way of looking at products. These players, according to Rao, adopt an inward-looking approach of products keeping in mind customer interests and experiences.

“Now, with the kind of recent developments happening, we do believe this is an era of partnerships between large institutions like ours and the fintech community,” said Rao. “I think this will only help bring the best of both worlds to the table so that we can co-create products and bring significant value to customers.”

HDFC Bank is among the first banks to have formed partnerships with fintechs to offer products and solutions. In August last year, the bank had partnered with fintech platform Paytm to accelerate its digital footprint in semi-urban and rural India.

Rao added that he believes “very strongly” in the partnership philosophy and that the bank is open to more partnerships with fintech players.

HDFC-HDFC Bank merger impact

Another opportunity for HDFC Bank to scale up digital banking is the merger with mortgage lender HDFC, said Rao.

The merger was announced in April, when HDFC's board had cleared the amalgamation of its wholly-owned subsidiaries HDFC Investments Ltd and HDFC Holdings Ltd with HDFC Bank. The proposed merger has received a thumbs-up from the stock exchanges and the Competition Commission of India.

“The merger is about two very large institutions, with two large customer bases, coming together. We have seen that there is a little overlap in customers, but by far there will be two unique sets of customers coming in,” Rao said.

“It only increases the opportunity to offer a whole suite of banking products and services. It will be a very important step in the growth of the HDFC Bank franchise in the coming years,” he added.

Tokenisation impact

Speaking about the assessment of the Card on File Tokenisation (CoFT) process, Rao said that customer migration has been happening “pretty smoothly.” He added that the banking industry has been working on this for the last few months, ensuring there is no inconvenience to customers.

CoFT refers to the process of replacing card details with a ‘token’, which will be unique for every debit or credit card and merchant platform. The process is aimed at making card transactions more secure as card data is not stored on merchant platforms and hence cannot be accessed through a breach for frauds.

According to the Reserve Bank of India’s norms, payment aggregators (PAs), payment gateways (PGs), and merchants cannot store the card credentials of customers in their databases after September 30.

Moneycontrol had reported on September 28 that banks, payment providers, and merchants had been preparing for potential disruptions after the September 30 deadline as tokenisation has not yet been tested on a large number of payments. Additionally, because of the timing of the new deadline — right in the middle of the festive season — merchants have been scrambling to adopt the new payment method to prevent disruptions and loss of sales.

On Thursday, Rao said that the banking industry has seen a “significant ramp-up” in tokenised transactions across sectors. This is likely to continue, he added.​",769,0.6151811877886454

Emkay Global Financial's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB maintained its robust credit growth trajectory – up 23.5% YoY/6% QoQ, in Q2 (vs 21.5% YoY/2% QoQ, in Q1). This was mainly led by continued strong momentum in commercial banking (31.5% YoY/9.5% QoQ)/corporate book (27% YoY /9% QoQ). Retail growth too was healthy, at 21.5% YoY/5% QoQ. Mortgage book purchase from HDFC continued to be high at Rs91.5bn in Q2 (vs Rs95bn in Q1). As per our channel checks, vehicle financing too is showing signs of pick up and will, thus, be a key monitorable for the bank (being the leader in the space). Deposit growth was also strong, at 19% YoY, with retail deposit growth at 20% YoY; CASA growth stood at 15% YoY, which led to a slight decline in CASA ratio to 45%. We believe strong growth in the non-retail book coupled with some slip-up in CASA ratio should keep margins and, thereby, core profitability in check. After a slight surge in Q1, we expect the bank to report sequential improvement in headline NPAs during Q2, led by better recovery in the agri portfolio (including KCC) and accelerated credit growth. With the bank sitting on healthy, specific + contingent provisions, we expect LLP to moderate which should, thereby, support net profitability.



Outlook

We believe HDFCB will be the key beneficiary of the buoyant credit markets, given its strong retail orientation as well as its increasing inclination towards corporate growth. However, a positive regulatory stance on the impending merger structure and managing the merger without much disruption will be key for re-rating. Currently, the stock trades at 2.4x FY24E ABV (ex-subs valuation). We retain our BUY rating on the stock, with TP of Rs1,800/share (3.0x Jun-24E ABV + subs valuation of Rs78), given healthy return ratios, strong capital comfort and reasonable valuations.

The credit book was Rs 11.98 lakh crore as of September 30 last year.

Gross of transfers through interbank participation certificates and bills rediscounted, the bank's advances grew by around 25.8 per cent over September 30, 2021, HDFC Bank said in a regulatory filing. The bank's deposits aggregated to approximately Rs 16.73 lakh crore as of September 30, 2022, nearly 19 per cent higher from Rs 14.06 crore as of September 30, 2021, it added.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the bank purchased loans aggregating Rs 9,145 crore through the direct assignment route under the home loan arrangement with parent firm Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited. Earlier in April, India's largest private lender HDFC Bank agreed to take over the biggest domestic mortgage lender in a deal valued at about USD 40 billion, creating a financial services titan.

The proposed entity will have a combined asset base of around Rs 18 lakh crore. The merger is expected to be completed by the second or third quarter of FY24, subject to regulatory approvals. Once the deal is effective, HDFC Bank will be 100 per cent owned by public shareholders, and existing shareholders of HDFC will own 41 per cent of the bank.

In another filing, Yes Bank said loan growth during the quarter increased by 11.6 per cent to Rs 1,92,809 crore as against Rs 1,72,839 crore in September 2021. At the same time, the bank's deposits aggregated to Rs 2,00,020 crore as of September 30, 2022, a growth of around 13.2 per cent over Rs 1,76,672 crore as of September 30, 2021.",298,0.9979611337184906

Banking analysts and industry experts said the trend is likely to continue even in the upcoming quarters, despite worsening global macro headwinds and the central bank’s tightening monetary policy regime.

“Over the medium term, a well-capitalised balance sheet, improving loan growth and lower credit cost forecast are positive catalysts that should allow valuation multiples to improve as macro stability returns,” said Nilanjan Karfa, an analyst at brokerage house Nomura.

In this context, three narratives—banks’ current account savings account (CASA)-dominant compounding franchises, earnings geared to growth, and lower credit cost—will likely play out, said Karfa.

Numbers game

Banks’ July-September business updates paint a rosy picture for the sector. Top banks, including State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank, have reported a double-digit increase in loan growth for the July-September quarter on a year-on-year basis. Deposit growth has also been strong.

HDFC Bank, for instance, reported a 23.5 percent increase in loans and advances year on year in the July-September quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, loan growth increased by just over 6 percent. The deposit base grew 19.5 percent on-year.

IndusInd Bank, too, said its advances rose 17.6 percent and 4.7 percent on a yearly and quarterly basis, respectively. Deposits grew at 13.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, said its advances stood at Rs 67,981 crore in the fiscal second quarter, up 16.6 percent on a year-on-year basis and just over 5 percent on a quarterly basis. Deposits were at Rs 88,503 crore, up 1.9 percent year on year.

Relatively smaller peers Federal Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and Karur Vysya Bank reported a similar trend as seen in the chart below.

Not just banks, mortgage lender HDFC was also party to the trend. HDFC’s assigned loans stood at Rs 9,145 crore in the July-September quarter, up 28.2 percent on a year-on-year basis. Individual loans sold were at Rs 34,513 crore, up about 27 percent on a year-on-year basis.

What’s driving loan growth?

Indian banks are recovering from the COVID-19 crisis, which rendered many Indians jobless. Now that the economy is recovering, credit offtake has improved significantly. According to RBI data, bank credit registered a yearly growth of 16 percent in August. Also, the July-September quarter numbers come on the back of a low base.

Now that the festive season is around the corner, analysts expect banks to capitalise on higher spending and report healthy credit growth in the upcoming quarters as well.

“We expect strong (credit) growth for banks. System credit is at 16 percent, this is likely to translate into strong growth for banks,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice president–research, at Kotak Securities. “There has been better credit utilisation driven by MSMEs, strong personal loan growth, credit cards and housing.”

“We expect festive season credit growth to be healthy, too. We expect healthy credit growth trends for the year,” added Dhame.

According to Punit Patni, an analyst at Swastika Investmart, a rise in spending, the opening up of the economy as the coronavirus pandemic eases, strong housing and real estate demand, government spending, the thrust on infrastructure, and high capacity utilisation levels are some of the reasons that explain the improved credit growth.

“Following the normalisation of COVID effects, the banking sector is experiencing positive growth momentum, which is expected to last for the next few quarters,” added Patni. “The impending festival season will be the icing on the cake as retail spending and credit demand remain strong.”

Credit demand is expected to stay robust despite four successive rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), said analysts. The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has increased rates by 190 basis points since May to quell inflationary pressure . Rate cues from the RBI are transmitted in the banking system when lenders adjust their lending and deposit rates.

Moneycontrol reported on October 3 that even though lending rates are edging higher, bankers and analysts do not expect the rate hike cycle to curb demand for loans.

Deposit mobilisation to continue

To fund the credit growth, analysts expect banks to mobilise deposits, especially in the wake of banking surplus liquidity tightening at a faster pace.

Already, lenders such as Axis Bank, DCB Bank, ICICI Bank and RBL Bank have increased fixed deposit (FD) rates following the RBI rate hike. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, in his post-policy briefing, said there would be more traction with regard to the adjustment of deposit rates, going forward.

“We expect a rate war sort of situation to mobilise deposits, especially in the mid- and small-sized banking segment,” said Swastika Investmart’s Patni. “However, banks with high CASA share, high liquidity coverage, and low credit-to-deposit ratios are better positioned to navigate the upcoming liquidity dearth.”

Kotak Securities’ Dhame concurred with Patni. “Deposit mobilisation is likely to be the way forward,” she said. Banks have raised deposit rates since the rate hike cycle has begun but not commensurate with the hikes in repo. We believe there is more scope for deposit rate hikes and mobilisation thereof.”",891,0.7753433138132095

Yuvraj and Netra Yuvraj Thakkar purchased a home in Raheja Legend, Worli, for Rs 79 crore. The duplex measures 7,138 square feet in a built-up area, according to registration documents accessed by Zapkey.

The apartment is on the 39th and 40th floors of the 46-story building. The Thakkars will be entitled to five car parking slots in the project. The stamp duty for the property came to Rs 4.74 crore. Thakkar, 33, is the managing director of financial services firm BP Wealth which was founded in 1997.

Raheja Legend was completed in 2010. The project was in the news in July 2022 as well when Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal’s wife purchased an apartment for Rs 45 crore. In April this year, Inox’s Siddharth Jain bought a quadruplex—essentially, a group of flats across four floors—for Rs 144 crore in the project.

Incidentally, one of the flats that now forms part of the duplex purchased by Thakkar had earlier been taken on rent for two years by cricketer Virat Kohli in 2017. Even by the benchmarks of several premium projects in Central Mumbai, Raheja Legend has found favour among a super-niche audience that prefers exclusivity and limited density. It has just one apartment per floor. Given the numerous multi-floor transactions, the entire project has less than 10 families residing in it.

Messages sent to Thakkar didn’t elicit any response.

This transaction comes on the back of Ignatius Noronha, the CEO of Avenue Supermarts, which runs the Dmart retail chain, purchasing an almost 10,000 sq ft apartment in Bandra East for Rs 70 crore this month. HDFC Bank executive director Kaizad Bharucha also bought a Bandra apartment for Rs 35 crore, again in September.",300,

The Reserve Bank of India may need to find ways to replenish its foreign exchange reserves such as encouraging non-resident Indians to deposit more funds, as it looks to stabilise a depreciating rupee, HDFC Bank Chief Economist Abheek Barua said.

The Indian currency has weakened 9.5% so far this year, with the central bank defending the rupee via dollar sales that have depleted its forex reserves to $545 billion from the peak of $642 billion a year ago.

""The central bank should intervene to ensure that a falling currency does not eclipse India's fundamentals,"" Barua wrote in a note this week.

While there might be some benefits of a depreciated currency in closing the trade gap, the damage to the capital account in terms of reduced confidence of investors will outweigh this benefit, he said.

According to Barua, the central bank may need to think of ways to bulk up its forex reserves, should the pool shrink to near $500 billion in the coming months.

""More capital is needed at this stage to stabilise the rupee and enable the RBI to replenish its reserves chest,"" he said.

In July, the RBI had allowed banks to raise foreign currency non-resident deposits at higher costs and permitted foreign investors to buy shorter term local debt as a way to encourage more inflows.

Those measures have only helped marginally, analysts say.

It may be time for the central bank to ready other options such as those in 2013 when the rupee came under pressure due to the U.S. Federal Reserve announcing plans to taper bond purchases.

It may be time to think yet again of the taper tantrum playbook, subsidize forwards and get lumpy non-resident deposits in, Barua said.

Did you know that each time you scan a quick response (QR) code and pay money at a local Kirana store, a fintech is at work? Or that when you ‘GPay’ — send money to — your friend in seconds, it’s because of fintech? Again, when you go on a shopping spree on an e-commerce website, or buy stocks from the market, it’s fintech that makes it possible. All of this is just one side, the consumer-facing side, of fintech. There is a lot more to financial technology, but it’s always humming in the background, unseen, unheard, but nevertheless enabling millions of transactions every day, and not always involving the transfer of money.

Fintech companies, the brains behind this technology, have become an integral part of the country’s economy, keeping it on the move. Today, India has over 7,000 fintech start-ups, operating in various segments. Such is the breadth of their presence that they have a finger in every pie, from payments and online credit facilities to subscription management and peer-to-peer lending.

Broadly, fintechs in India majorly operate in the following categories:

Payments: Payments players include apps such as PhonePe, GPay and Paytm, which facilitate transactions through wallets and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Other players include online and offline payments providers such as Razorpay, Pine Labs, BillDesk, CCAvenues, etc. Players such as BharatPe serve only businesses and enable merchants to receive payments.

Lending: Fintechs that facilitate Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), personal loans, business loans, supply chain financing, etc. fall under this category. B2C lending players include ZestMoney, axio (formerly Capital Float), Slice, Navi etc. B2B players into lending include Rupifi, Mintifi and KredX.

Neobanking platforms: Fintechs that provide a tech layer over services offered by partner banks are categorised as neobanking platforms. Companies such as Jupiter, Fi, Freo and Niyo provide neobanking services to individuals. For businesses, the likes of RazorpayX and Open provide payroll management, banking etc.

Wealth management and investment platforms: These fintechs enable investment in stocks, mutual funds and gold. Zerodha, Upstox, Dhan etc allow users to trade and invest in stocks. IndiaGold, Jar and Rupeek facilitate investments in gold, while Groww, Paytm and PhonePe allow users to invest in mutual funds.

Insurtech: The Indian insurtech space includes general insurance companies such as Digit and Acko, as well as insurance broking platforms such as Policybazaar, Paytm, Coverfox etc.

Virtual digital assets companies: These include platforms that facilitate the trading of cryptocurrencies, including CoinDCX and WazirX. However, the crypt exchanges’ legal status is unclear as a law on crypto trading in India is still awaited.

P2P lenders: Peer-to-peer fintechs provide a platform for people to lend and borrow money from each other directly, rather than go to a bank or an institution. LenDen Club, Faircent and CRED Mint are among key P2P players in India.

While India has always lagged behind advanced economies in terms of economic development, thanks to these fintechs, it is among the very best when it comes to financial technology.

This transformation has been made possible due to an army of talented professionals, many of whom work for the country’s 7,000-plus fintech start-ups. These startups’ innovations and collaborations with different entities, including banks and other conventional financial institutions, often in the face of regulatory headwinds, have redrawn India’s financial landscape.

UPI is one such example. While the monetisation of UPI is being debated, it is a unique tool that has shown how fintechs and banks can take their partnership to the next level. In August, a total of 346 active UPI players conducted 6,579.63 million transactions amounting to Rs 10.72 lakh crore.

BNPL, another forte of fintech players, is likely to register substantial growth over the next five years, according to Zestmoney’s India 2021 fintech report. “BNPL forms about 2% of total retail GMV (gross merchandise value) and is expected to surge to nearly 7% by the end of FY26, according to Goldman Sachs. The current GMV of $3 billion is estimated to go up to $35 billion by 2026,” the report said.

The numbers

As of July 2022, India had over 7,300 fintech start-ups, according to ‘The Winds of Change’ report presented by EY during the 2022 Global Fintech Festival in Mumbai. A snapshot of how the Reserve Bank Of India’s (RBI) fintech policies have evolved over time can be viewed below.

Further, per the EY report, Indian fintechs received $7.8 billion in funding in 2021, way more than the $2.9 billion they received in 2020.

Overall, the domestic fintech industry’s total assets under management (AUM) will grow 10 times to cross the $1 trillion mark and reach $200 billion in revenue by 2030, the report said.

Unicorns aplenty

According to the EY report, there were 24 fintech unicorns in India as of July end. Unicorns are private entities that have achieved a $1 billion valuation without an initial public offering.

Paytm, Policybazaar, Razorpay, Zerodha, Cred, BharatPe, Groww and crypto players CoinSwitch and CoinDCX are among India’s fintech unicorns.

In all, there are 24 fintech unicorns in India, as per the EY report, and some of them listed on the exchanges in 2021. Paytm and Policybazaar/Paisabazaar parent PB Fintech listed on the stock exchanges late last year.

SEBI has also approved the draft papers for Flipkart founder Sachin Bansal’s fintech Navi, while the Prem Watsa-backed Digit General Insurance is awaiting the regulator’s nod.

Shifting economics

Large fintechs may have started their operations by offering just one service but have over time expanded their suite of services.

Some fintech players, including Paytm, Phonepe, MobiKwik and Google Pay, who initially offered payment and mobile wallets as their core service, have expanded over the years into e-commerce, consumer lending, investing via mutual funds and gold, equity, insurance, merchant lending, BNPL, consumer financing, payment gateway, gaming and travel.

Such ancillary offerings help these players generate additional revenue streams, especially in the case of players such as Paytm and PhonePe, as UPI does not generate revenues for these companies.

Fintech players such as Pine Labs, MSwipe and Razorpay, which initially offered core services such as POS and payment gateways, are now offering more value-added services to merchants, including rewards and loyalty programmes, pay-by-link and micro websites, BNPL, as well as consumer financing products via EMIs and merchant banking, among others.

Federal Bank Executive Director Shalini Warrier says that over the years, fintechs have evolved in the fields of payments, lending, wealth management, insurance, and basic banking products such as savings accounts.

“In my view, the Indian fintech industry has evolved more than overseas countries, though the models are different,” Warrier said.

“With the payment infrastructure that NPCI has put in place, with the Jandhan-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity, and with the growing smartphone penetration in India, fintechs here are able to deliver materially better products and services to customers than what is available overseas,” she added.

The fruits of collaboration

Anand Bajaj, MD and CEO at fintech firm PayNearby, says his company works with 52 non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and 9 banks to offer various financial services.

“We collect about Rs 1,000 crore worth of EMI for them (NBFCs) from their customers at their outlets … The best way for fintechs will be to partner with banks,” Bajaj said.

“We can augment the market, undertake speedy tech deliveries, create better interfaces, and provide faster and better insights of the market. It is not going to be a one-legged race; it will be a collaboration,” he added.

Federal Bank’s Warrier says fintechs have been instrumental in making the Indian financial services industry agile through their focus on UI and UX.

“Each Bank has a different strategy when it comes to working with fintechs. In Federal Bank, we believe in collaboration with fintechs rather than competition. The consumer gets the best of both worlds in our view — the trust, security and safety that Banks provide with the ease and convenience of banking that fintechs provide. I don’t think there is anything that compels banks to join hands with fintechs.”

Nikhil Jois, growth lead at Bureau, a Bengaluru-based fintech firm, says the firm is gearing up to partner with banks. “About 50 percent of our customer base is in BFSI and fintech … we have begun conversations with big banks; we are doing PoC (proof of concept) with IDFC FIRST Bank already, and we are in talks with HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank,” Jois said.

“Most of these banks are always looking for insights on their user base and at expanding the offerings they can have. These banks have years of experience and are looking for some exotic ingredients to play with in order to augment their AI-ML models,” he added.

Challenges aplenty

The break-neck speed of innovation, though, is also coming at an economic cost for the fintechs. Higher inflation, Covid-19 induced stress and regulatory uncertainty have combined added to their woes.

“As of June 2022, India had more than 100 unicorns, and in this prestigious pool of start-ups, almost every fourth unicorn is a FinTech,” the EY report said. “But there is a lot of headroom compared to global FinTech unicorns; India lags and contributes approximately 7% of the global pool of FinTech unicorns. Considering the market size, we should expect more,” it added.

Bankers, though open to fintech partnerships, are taking a cautious path. “There is nothing that fintechs do that banks cannot do on their own,” says Warrier.

“However, the broader intention of the Bank-fintech collaboration is to bring the best of both worlds to the customer. As indicated earlier, fintechs display higher agility and are able to work extensively on UI/UX (user interface/user experience). Banks bring trust, stability and confidence to the customer,” she said.

Parag Rao, payments and digital banking chief at HDFC Bank, said that he does not believe any one individual entity can crack the market on its own.

“I presume serious players are in this game for the medium-to-long term, which means you need to build a good economic model. Partnerships actually help in crunching the lifetime cycle of this model. I see more and more potential partnerships happening and that’s the way to go,” he said at the global fintech festival.

HDFC Securities received a ‘no objection’ on from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to set up a wholly owned subsidiary at International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Gujarat’s GIFT City, HDFC Bank told exchanges on September 20.

On May 13, HDFC Bank told exchanges that the Reserve Bank of India had given its approval for the setting up of a step-down subsidiary through HDFC Securities Ltd.

The bank said its subsidiary would offer broking and clearing services in IFSC at GIFT City on terms prescribed by the RBI.

“Each player in the ecosystem — whether it is a bank or NBFC (non-banking finance company) or a fintech — brings to the table its own strengths. I think the problem happens when we all think we are ‘superman’ and we can do everything,” Rao said at the Global Fintech Festival held in Mumbai. “Sticking to the basic principle of business is key.”

Rao elaborated that there is “ample opportunity” in terms of partnerships in India's financial landscape.

In such partnerships, each player brings to the table their own strength and one individual entity cannot crack the market on its own, Rao said. Bringing together forces and value for the customer is the “nature of the game,” he added.

Further, standalone entities trying to do something alone is not going to help in building a profitable business model, Rao said, adding that he sees more and more potential partnerships happening and “that’s the way to go.”

“I presume serious players are in this game for the medium to long term, which means you need to build a good economic model. Partnerships actually help in crunching the lifetime cycle of this model,” added Rao.

Indian banks are slowly adopting technology to make banking services digital and user-friendly. Banks, non-banking finance companies, and fintechs are all aiming for financial inclusion through innovative products, credit/debit cards and UPI payments. Not just that, banks are also indulging in co-lending partnerships to cater to a broad customer base and widen their reach.

Additionally, Rao said that India’s traditional banking landscape, which flourished in the past few decades, needs to change and imbibe attributes of the new age.

“Banks of tomorrow will necessarily have to be like fintechs or (have) some attributes that fintechs bring to the table,” Rao said. “They will not only have to be innovative (and) agile but will also bring to the table conventional banking attributes like trust, safety, managing risks et cetra.”

“Traditional banking” is now redundant and new banks or the banks of the future will necessarily have to morph into the system by retaining the good values and attributes of traditional banking and imbibing attributes of the new age, Rao said.

Traditional banking, which Rao was referring to, was when banks operated typically only in brick and mortar buildings, wherein staff did the paperwork, underwriting and looked at leisures.

If you don’t adapt to change, you cannot sustain, Rao added",443,0.854611873626709

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

Our update released on 6th July’22 (link) had covered merger related aspects like liabilities’ glide path, asset mix, regulatory requirements and profitability. Discussions with investors on this merger update brought to light certain queries, following which we met HDFCB management to allay these concerns viz. 1) garnering higher market share in system deposits, 2) grandfathering of HDFC’s bank borrowings, 3) share of unsecured loans in the merged entity, 4) drag on NIM due to PSL shortfall and 5) outlook on NIM/opex. We believe that faster deposit accretion for HDFCB from a system standpoint may be achievable, while grandfathering of bank borrowings may be permitted. Unsecured share in the merged entity might remain between 11-12%, as mortgage portfolio (higher ticket size) would grow aggressively. Standalone NIM may gradually improve (4.2% in FY22), as share of retail would rise that may also protect NIM owing to lower PSL requirements. Opex could remain elevated over the medium term. As we slightly raise NII for FY24E/25E, our PAT increases by average 2.5%.



Outlook

Hence we raise SOTP based TP from Rs1740 to Rs1800 basis Sep’24 core ABV but maintain ‘BUY’.

The name of the project is Satguru Rendezvous.

The size of the apartment is 3,414 square feet, inclusive of balcony area of 250 square feet, according to registration documents accessed by Moneycontrol. Bharucha will have access to five car parking spaces.

Bharucha had no comment. The stamp duty and GST paid by him is Rs. 3.5 crore, taking the per square foot cost to a whopping Rs. 1 lakh-plus.

The seller of the apartment is prominent local developer Satguru Builders. The company focusses on the micro-markets of Bandra, Khar, and Santacruz.

The property deal comes on the back of record transactions in that suburb this year. Toppr.com founder Zishaan Hayath bought an apartment in July for Rs. 41 crore. Mukesh Gandhi, former director of Angel Broking, purchased a duplex apartment for Rs. 50 crore.

Even by that benchmark, the price paid by Bharucha appears to be on the higher side given the early stage of construction. The project commenced construction in January 2022 and has a RERA completion date of December 2024.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on September 5 said that HDFC Bank, in partnership with Crunchfish AB, and Precision Biometric India Pvt. Ltd was selected for the ""test phase"" of the on-tap application facility for the theme ‘Retail Payments’ under the regulatory sandbox.

Regulatory sandbox refers to live testing of new products or services in a controlled environment. The sandbox allows regulators, innovators, financial services providers and customers to conduct field tests to collect evidence on the benefits and risks of new financial innovations while carefully monitoring and containing risk.

The RBI has undertaken various initiatives to realise India’s vision of payment systems by fostering an ecosystem that enables safe, quick and affordable digital payments. In this context, one of the challenges has been to minimise instances of financial frauds, which not only lead to apprehension among new users in the adoption of digital payments but also makes it difficult for banks to retain customers who experience such frauds. There is also a lag between the occurrence and detection of frauds.

FinTechs have the potential to play a pivotal role in strengthening fraud governance and reducing the response time to frauds and the lag between occurrence and detection of financial frauds.

Further, based on the experience gained from the first and second Cohorts and the feedback from stakeholders, the ‘Enabling Framework for Regulatory Sandbox’ was updated to include the ‘On Tap’ application facility for themes of closed cohorts. The ‘On Tap’ facility was opened in October 2021 to help in continuous innovation and engagement with innovators and proactively respond to the dynamics of the rapidly evolving FinTech space.

Meanwhile, the RBI on September 5 also announced the opening of the theme-neutral fifth cohort of the regulatory sandbox.

Innovative products, services, and technologies cutting across various functions in RBI’s regulatory domain would be eligible to apply, the RBI said in a separate statement. The application window for the same shall be communicated in due course, the regulator said.

To encourage innovations, RBI rolled out a regulatory sandbox framework on August 13, 2019.",344,0.3299451271692912

Banking giants HDFC Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) plan to collectively raise up to Rs 10,000 crore through sales of perpetual bonds this week, The Economic Times reported on September 5 citing people aware of the development.

The fundraise points to credit demand comeback in the world's fifth largest economy as bankers expect an over 10 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) loan growth in the current fiscal.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Perpetual, or Additional Tier 1 (AT-1), bonds are a type of perpetual debt instrument that banks use to augment their core equity base and thus comply with Basel III norms. These bonds were introduced by the Basel accord after the global financial crisis to protect depositors. These are relatively risky as investors – mostly institutional players – may lose their entire capital as happened in the case of Yes Bank in 2020.

The majority of these bonds include a call option in the fifth year.

According to the report, SBI plans to raise up to Rs 7,000 crore for which it is in talks with the LIC of India and the Unit Trust of India (UTI). Private insurers have also been approached, the ET report highlighted. The bank intends to offer about 7.70-7.80%.

HDFC Bank is seeking to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore on September 6 when its bonds will be up for bidding on the stock exchange platform, it noted. Standalone provident funds, large banks, and family offices might buy into these instruments that are expected to offer 7.80-7.95% returns, ET reported quoting dealers.

Last week, the Bank of Baroda issued AT-1 bonds worth Rs 2,474 crore at a cutoff of 7.88 percent.

As per the latest data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banks’ credit offtake increased 15.3 percent y-o-y for the fortnight ended August 12, up from 5.5 percent in the year-ago period.

In absolute terms, banks’ overall outstanding advances stood at Rs 124.3 lakh crore as of August 12, growing by Rs 16.5 lakh crore over the last 12 months.",352,0.3365520238876343

Private sector lender HDFC Bank on September 1 announced that it plans to open more than 200 bank branches and 80 smart banking lobbies in Maharashtra in the financial year 2022-2023. Along with that, the lender also plans to hire over 3,000 employees across the state, it said in an official statement.

Further, the bank said 90 of the new branches will be in metro and urban areas, while the remaining will be in semi-urban and rural pockets. Its present employee base in the state, which houses its headquarters and also a bulk of back office operations, was not known.

Commenting on the expansion plan, Abhishek Deshmukh, Branch Banking Head – Maharashtra, said, “HDFC Bank is present in every district and over 280 talukas in the state. With the expansion plan, our presence will increase further, and it will also generate employment for over 3,000 people. HDFC Bank is committed to growth of Maharashtra and a testimony of the Bank’s commitment is that the Bank’s Credit to Deposit Ratio is over 100% in 29 districts of the state.”

HDFC Bank, as per the release, has more than 5,300 touchpoints including 709 branches; 3,200 ATMs; 1,375 business correspondents; and 15,116 business facilitators in Maharashtra.

Additionally, the lender has deposits of Rs 4,35,604 crore in the state, which along with the advances add up to a total business of Rs 7,64,113 crore. The bank’s market share in total business is 13 percent, the statement added.

Shares of HDFC Bank on Thursday closed 0.95 percent lower at Rs 1,472.10 apiece from its previous close on BSE.

Earlier, HDFC Bank in August had announced it will invest Rs 49.9 crore to Rs 69.9 crore in Go Digit-Life Insurance in two tranches to acquire up to a 9.94 percent equity stake in the company.

The private lender stated that it has entered into ""an indicative and non-binding term sheet with Go Digit-Life Insurance.""

Wonder why your bank's system is down quite often or why you face transaction declines repeatedly?

A Moneycontrol investigation into tech glitches reported by Indian banks across multiple platforms — mobile and internet — over the last few years has revealed major fundamental problems in their operations.

For one, most banks, including bigger ones, continue to use outdated technology platforms, making upgrades difficult. Secondly, these banks severely lack the adequate number of talented tech professionals to support large-scale tech-enabled banking operations, often resulting in major delays in the event of an outage.

Moneycontrol studied the tech outages reported by at least six banks in the recent past and spoke to at least 10 officials from these banks and technology firms.

Rising customer complaints

According to the central bank’s 2021 ombudsman scheme annual report, customers submitted a total of 44,385 complaints related to mobile and electronic banking between April 2020 and March 2021, higher than the 41,310 complaints recorded by the regulator in the previous year.

This is at a time when banks continue to launch new digital initiatives and so-called super apps.

To give an example, on June 30, a Twitter user posted a “maintenance” break screenshot from State Bank of India’s (SBI) banking application YONO. He complained that the bank had shared no communication with customers to alert them of the service outage.

As per the screenshot, the app’s services were not supposed to be available till 7 pm on June 30.

“19:00 hours already passed…,” Verma replied to his original tweet after the maintenance break passed its deadline. The same day saw many similar complaints by users saying that India’s largest public sector bank had not sent any prior notice for the scheduled break at a time when the country is pushing for further digitisation.

Source: Twitter

SBI is not the only one facing heat for such issues. On August 17, multiple Twitter users posted complaints of not being able to log into the bank website or app of India’s largest private sector bank – HDFC Bank. Similarly on August 13, many complained that net banking was not working since morning that day.



@HDFC_Bank your netbanking site not working from today morning, please check and resolve the problem

— Satish Kumar (@SatishKRoy1976) August 13, 2022

“@HDFC_Bank your netbanking is down since an hour. I have payments to make and your site is just not working. Is it down for maintenance? If yes, no email or messages or any prior intimation was given to me,” tweeted user Ishita Shah.

Last year, the bank faced the wrath of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after five major outages between November 2018 and March 2021. While RBI lifted the ban on all launches of its upcoming digital business-generating activities later, RBI’s diktat set the bank behind in competing with its peer ICICI Bank in credit card issuances as well as new digital initiatives.

Both SBI and HDFC Bank did not respond to detailed queries by Moneycontrol on the scheduled maintenance break or on the service outage.

Twitter is full of similar complaints across banks -- multiple users facing problems at once on some days.

What is the core issue?

The biggest strength of India’s largest banks is also the biggest Achilles' heel when it comes to technology – scale. Besides the burden on internal tech systems to handle the rising volumes of digital transactions, these are legacy systems with a heavy dependence on external service providers that plug in each layer of tech for banks.

“The large banks have the issue of using legacy technology from years ago. The bigger you are, the more difficult it is to upgrade. The risk is immense even while migrating from a large old database to a new one,” said the technology head of a leading fintech.

The core banking system of most banks is provided by large information technology players, including Infosys’ Finacle, Oracle and BaNCS by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). With the core system being operated by tech teams of these IT giants, internal teams of most banks only ensure that these systems are kept up and running.

“In one of our conversations with a smaller private bank that positioned itself as a digital bank, we were told that they have a tech team of 400 people. But not a single one of them wrote any code. Their entire job was to deal with their IT vendors,” the person added.

In such a situation, many experts believe that internal bank teams are largely deployed for ‘requirement management’ and not equipped to fix larger issues or build for evolving needs of customers.

Legacy problems

Aishwarya Jaishankar, who has led digital initiatives at various private sector banks and is now Co-Founder of Hyperface which provides tech stack for credit cards, said, “The core banking systems were built for the back offices and branches of banks and have scaled from there. But now modern customers want to be served digitally, needing a front-end focussed experience that banks are struggling to create with pure-play core banking systems.”

The core banking systems too are legacy software built over the past two decades and have reached a scale that makes it difficult to upgrade these to handle the increasing volumes. Hence, the knowledge required to operate these systems too is similar to what was required years ago.

Harshavardhan Godugula, Partner, Forensic and Integrity Services, EY, said, “Traditionally, core banking platforms are centralised systems – on top of which banks have built newer applications and capabilities, such as mobile banking, Unified Payments Interface (UPI), etc. Sometimes, these legacy systems are unable to perform adequately and face system downtime, vulnerabilities, hardware failures, etc. If banking apps are not built and tested properly, they are bound to throw back errors.”

Another disadvantage for large legacy banks is the difficulty in attracting the right talent and pay disparity as compared to large IT players and startups. “Large financial institutions have a hierarchical structure that makes decision-making difficult,” said another fintech founder.

Hyperface’s Jaishankar added, “While core banking is resilient, it has not evolved at the rate that innovation has taken place. Banks have to plug more third-party switches into the existing systems as the usage of real-time payments and other innovations increase pressure on the system.”

Nilufer Mullanfiroze, who has over two decades of experience working with banks like Standard Chartered and Federal Bank and is now Head of Banking at investment startup Groww argued that the time for technology to become redundant is only becoming shorter. Hence, it is not practical to expect large institutions to redo their systems.

""But what needs to be the practical approach with most banks is to have the right infrastructure to build things on top of their core banking systems. Having the agility to be able to use the core banking system more as the backend system and build the right interfaces with newer age technology is the way to go for the future,"" she added.

The tide, however, has changed for the better after the regulator took cognisance of major outages across banks. Top management across banks are now more aware of the limitations of their technical capacities and seem to be working with the regulator around challenges.

Finally, the UPI hiccup…

“Since the last few days, when we try to send or receive money through UPI apps, the SBI server is down very often. Nowadays, people carry very less cash in hand. How are we supposed to transact seamlessly in such a scenario,” Sanket Rathi, an SBI customer for more than 10 years told Moneycontrol.

Failures on UPI payment systems are basically of two types, technical decline (TD) and business decline (BD). Technical declines are caused due to issues with the bank's system or NPCI systems, while business declines are caused due to issues pertaining to customers, such as incorrect PINs or transactions beyond stipulated limits.

“If we compare TDs to BDs, the former is always lesser than the latter. This is a clear result of seamlessness,” Venkatraman Venkateswaran, chief financial officer (CFO) at Federal Bank said.

To counter issues relating to reconciliation of timed out and declined transactions on the UPI platform, we might soon see the emergence of a tech that will allow real-time settlement of such transactions, he added.

Numbers don’t lie

The top five UPI remitter banks in terms of volumes in July were SBI, HDFC Bank, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank and ICICI Bank. For example, SBI's approval rate of UPI transactions was at 92.1 percent in July. The bank’s business decline rate stood at 7.26 percent as compared to 6.96 percent in June. The technical decline rate saw a steep drop to 0.68 percent in July from over 5 percent in June.

While the decline rates keep fluctuating every month, for the user dependent on UPI for all transactions, this is a major road bump. So why do UPI downtimes happen with banks?

Banks as well as the RBI have taken cognisance of the burden that the rise in UPI transactions has put on bank servers. Since the pandemic struck in March 2020, UPI monthly transaction values have grown by 5x from Rs 2 lakh crore to Rs 10.62 lakh crore in July 2022. What’s more is that UPI is used for multiple small-ticket transactions, including paying for an auto ride or even your local tea stall owner.

With over 600 crore transactions a month, the stress on bank servers is high.

“To add to that, the innovation is happening faster than the time banks can take to handle the growing transactions. With RuPay credit cards on UPI and UPI 123Pay, the number of transactions is expected to grow significantly,” said a senior executive of a payments company.

So, what are banks doing to address these problems?

Large banks are working towards pre-empting the problems that may emerge in the coming years as digital adoption increases further.

“While other private banks are trying to get their house in order, ICICI Bank is preparing for a wider presence in getting embedded across a large number of platforms where users transact. It is also preparing to scale horizontally and vertically,” said the founder of a fintech and bank infrastructure provider.

ICICI Bank did not respond to Moneycontrol’s request to participate in the story.

HDFC Bank chief executive officer Sashidhar Jagdishan, in a mail to employees in April 2021, had said that the bank has invested heavily in scaling up the infrastructure to handle any potential load that it will encounter for the next three to five years.

The bank is also setting up a digital factory and an enterprise factory to roll out new digital offerings and to help augment the bank’s IT infrastructure.

As for SBI, multiple reports suggest that the bank is in the process of upgrading its YONO app to offer a completely digital banking offering.

Another outlier is Federal Bank. The bank is known to invest heavily in modernising its internal tech capabilities, cloud adoption as well as target growth through tie-ups with fintechs. As per, customers are extensively using the bank’s internet banking platform due to the constant investments it has made.

“The enterprise or individual of today doesn't want to experience buffering pages. The 'lift and shift' model (migrating apps and data to cloud) of ensuring early adoption of tech will ensure that the sector is near glitch-free,” Federal Bank’s Venkateswaran said.

Union Bank of India General Manager Sanjay Narayan, who leads the lender’s digital initiatives, said that the lender has put in place a board-approved compensation policy whereby the bank compensates the customer for any financial loss that they may incur due to deficiency in service on the part of the bank, or any act of omission or commission directly attributable to the bank.

“With the growing customer base and increase in the number of digital products, robust infrastructure is a must. Adding new hardware to accommodate the continuous increase in digital transactions and customer base has become one of the important aspects of providing hassle-free banking services. Cloud is one of the growing spaces being used by entities for expansion of infrastructure,” Narayan said.

The UPI puzzle — To invest or not?

On UPI, industry experts have pointed out that banks see less incentive in investing further for UPI transactions as payment systems don't fetch enough revenues for banks and payment service providers, as per government norms.

“UPI has also introduced an orchestration approach due to its scale, something that was rarely conspicuous in the Indian banking system. But ensuring scalability with the right agility and security has its own costs. Government incentive will be helpful to take care of some of the costs associated with UPI,” Venkateswaran said.

In December 2021, the government had announced a Rs 1,300 crore scheme to incentivise banks, and through them payment gateways and UPI players for transactions. To be eligible for the full incentive, banks were required to show at least 50 percent year-on-year growth in UPI transactions by the end of the last quarter of the scheme.

With the Union Ministry of Finance’s recent clarification that the government has no plans to levy charges on UPI transactions, CRISIL Research Director Aniket Dani said that further government incentives in promoting UPI will aid in the upgradation of the existing services.

“The Ministry of Finance asserted on August 22 that would continue lending financial support to boost the digital payments ecosystem in the country. This help from the government will, in turn, aid the parties in the transaction to get monetary remuneration for the probable expenses associated with the same,” Dani said.",2268,-0.5134328692047684

There have been no successful cybersecurity data breaches at India’s largest private lender HDFC Bank between June 2018 and March 2022, the bank’s Chief Information Security Officer Sameer Ratolikar told Moneycontrol on August 4.

His comments were a day after the central government informed the Parliament that India’s banks reported 248 successful data breaches by hackers and miscreants between June 2018 and March 2022. Most of these data breaches pertained to card details leakage, and theft of business and non-business information, the Centre said.

“Data breach prevention is the most important challenge which the entire banking system has, to be very honest and transparent…to my understanding, these data breaches are prominent examples of cheating,” Ratolikar said.

Of the total 248 data successful data breaches reported by banks, 41 were reported by public sector ones while private sector banks reported 205 data leaks, the minister said.

“Today, in my understanding, the data is getting leaked by social-engineering tactics, where gullible people are disclosing their credit card number, debit card pin, net-banking ID, and password over a phone call or SMSs. A huge amount of data leakage is happening in these channels, rather than by technological means,” he said.

As per HDFC Bank’s FY22 annual report, the total number of frauds reported at the bank rose to 6,543 in FY22 from 5,232 in FY21. The total amount involved in frauds, though, reduced to Rs 505.9 crore during FY22, lower than Rs 1,640.8 crore rupees of frauds in FY21.

The trend witnessed at HDFC Bank is in line with the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) FY22 annual report data.

As per the RBI, banks reported a total of 9,103 frauds involving Rs 60,414 crore in FY22, as against 7,359 frauds amounting to Rs 1.38 lakh crore in FY21.

“Today, the model has shifted from phishing, which is e-mail based, to vishing--a voice-based mechanism trying to lure customers into divulging personal details…the modus operandi has moved to SMS’s,” the CISO said.

On the institutions side, banks are also prone to distributed denial of services (DDoS) attacks by hackers, malware attacks, and ransomware attacks, among others.

RBI action

As per Ratolikar, HDFC Bank assess its cybersecurity infrastructure on regular intervals through third-party security rating services, and regular audits are also carried out by the RBI and other independent agencies. The bank has “been maintaining data protection standards to a great extent”, Ratolikar said.

The private sector lender’s business growth was significantly impacted by the challenges faced after RBI imposed a moratorium on it from launching new digital products and offering credit cards in 2021. The regulator had undertaken the supervisory action after the bank’s servers repeatedly gave out and customers faced issues in online banking transactions.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol on March 16, five days after the regulator lifted the ban on lenders from offering new digital products, the bank’s group head of payments, consumer finance, and digital banking Parag Rao said the bank had used the interim period to “relook”, refurbish and upgrade many of its systems.

Data leakage counter-measures

Third-party service providers, who also work with banks on various financial services products, need to apply tighter data protection standards in order to avoid private data leakage.

Further, greater awareness among customers and the employee base of the bank is also required to prevent data breaches.

“The third-party service providers, which also works with banks these days for various purposes, there we need to tighten the control to ensure data leakage is addressed,” he said.

Further, HDFC Bank’s new mobile banking application is enabled with the “RASP” feature or Runtime Application Self Protection, which ensures that the bank application does not open if any remote access applications are already open in the background, tracking screen, or other data of the customer, the CISO said.

As per Amit Das, chief executive officer and co-founder at Think360.ai, there are significant challenges associated with losses that are caused by bad agents impersonating bank customers, carrying out phishing transactions for instance.

“In our experience, the balance between user experience and security at user front end, heightened security at infrastructure back end, and significant customer education is needed to improve data leakages,” Das said.",698,-0.6746695297104972

The index might consolidate in the 16,300-16,800 range, where bulls and the bears are sitting.

Hiren Ved, CEO, Director and CIO, Alchemy Capital Management, thinks the correction seen in the May-June period is over and Indian companies seem to have done well on the earnings front despite the odds.

“We are constructive about the market. The single reason for that is despite macro headwinds, earnings in India have held up reasonably well. For the next two years, Nifty can still deliver mid-teen earnings growth. That is the reason Indian markets have been fairly resilient,” he told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.

The biggest driver of the market over the last month has been a rally in banking and financial services stocks. They have a large weight—40 percent—in the Nifty as well as the Sensex. After months of sluggishness, these stocks have finally seen some buying, pushing up the indices.

The Nifty has rallied nearly 9 percent since hitting lows in June. The Nifty Bank index is up 14 percent from its 52-week low hit in June 2022.

“Financials should lead the market hereon. Credit growth has moved up sharply. Net interest margins are expanding for most of the banks,” said Ved, adding the largest delta of earnings within Nifty would be in that space.

He said that going deeper into the banking space, the pecking order was changing from what it was before the coronavirus pandemic.

“Even within the banking space, leadership is clearly changing. ICICI Bank clearly leads both HDFC Bank and Kotak Bank–both in terms of consistency of performance across parameters and growth,” Ved said.

His thoughts echo those of several analysts who believe ICICI Bank is the best investment in the banking space. The stock is one of the few stocks on which every analyst has a “buy” rating, as per Bloomberg data.

Tata Steel beat analyst expectations in its earnings announcement on July 25 but Ved is not a fan of such stocks. It is difficult to make money from cyclical names in the long term, he said.

“There are better structural plays at this time where there is clear visibility in growth and not that kind of volatility,” he said.

Tata Steel was one of the best-performing stocks in the calendar year 2021, riding on huge demand and rising international prices. However, this year, it is among the biggest losers in the Nifty pack, down about 40 percent.

Rates on certificates of deposit (CD), short-term debt paper issued by banks, have increased of late amid the rate tightening cycle of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Canara Bank on July 22 issued near-three-month CDs at a coupon of 5.60 percent, 5.62 percent and 5.52 percent, respectively, according to National Stock Exchange (NSE) data.

Almost a month back, rates for similar tenure CDs of HDFC Bank and Axis Bank stood at 5.28 percent each. Canara Bank, on June 15, too had issued over three-month CDs at 5.41 percent, according to the data.

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) hiked rates by a total of 90 basis points in May and June to arrest rising price pressures in the economy. One basis point equals one hundredth of a percentage point.

What are CDs?

CDs are a money market instrument and are typically issued by scheduled commercial banks and select financial institutions permitted by the RBI. For banks, the maturity period of a CD should be between 7 days and one year. CD rates are sensitive to interest-rate movements.

Why are CD rates rising?

According to money market participants, the primary reason for the rise in CD rates is the credit off-take in the economy and the fact that RBI is slowly withdrawing a liquidity surplus from the banking system.

Demand for credit is rising which, coupled with the dwindling liquidity surplus in the banking system, has increased the need for banks to issue these money market instruments.

Typically, while investing in CDs, investors demand a spread or a premium over government-issued Treasury Bill or T-Bill rates. On July 20, the government’s three-month T-Bill was sold at a cut-off yield of 5.40 percent, up from 5.09 percent a month ago.

“Investors preferred treasury bills over bank CDs as the three-month treasury bills are trading around 5.40 percent and one-year treasury bills are trading around 6.20 percent,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.

“Hence, being a capital market instrument, banks have to price their CDs over Treasury Bills to get enough investor demand.”

Srinivasan expects top state-run bank CDs to continue to trade with a spread of at least 20 to 50 basis points over T-Bill rates.

Will the trend continue?

Yes. Money market experts said CD rates are likely to edge higher as the rate hike cycle becomes more entrenched and as the RBI steps up liquidity absorption to combat inflationary pressures in the economy. The pace could accelerate if the RBI tightens monetary policy at a faster-than-expected pace.

The RBI’s actions directly influence the direction of short-term consumer debt and deposit rates. So with multiple rate hikes seen in what remains of 2022, experts see CD rates rising further. Already, the net liquidity absorbed by the RBI as of July 24 was Rs 1.24 lakh crore, down from Rs 3.29 lakh crore on June 8, according to central bank data. This indicates that surplus liquidity has fallen sharply since the last monetary policy decision.

“Looking at the global situation, RBI is concerned with the rising inflation and depreciating rupee,” said Umesh Tulsyan, managing director at Sovereign Global Markets. “There is no other option with RBI than increasing the repo rate to suck the liquidity from the market. Conclusively, we may see this trend to further continue in the coming next year till the time inflation is not combated.”

How many rate hikes are factored in?

Money market experts said the repo rate is expected to be at 5.75 percent by December, up from 4.90 percent currently. Accordingly, CD rates could move higher. Experts said the pace of the increase in CD rates could reduce now that most of the negatives are already factored into prices.

“Yields in money market segments have corrected after sharp rate hikes and withdrawal of liquidity from the system,” said Sanjay Pawar, fund manager – fixed income, LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management. “Repo rate hikes are likely in the immediate future; however the market has discounted the rate hikes in advance.”

Sovereign Global Markets’ Tulsyan added that T-Bill rates are also expected to go up assuming market borrowings increase. The extent of rate hikes priced in for the next one year is almost 100 basis points, he said.

Will CD issuances increase?

As the economic recovery gains momentum and rate hikes increase, bankers and money market experts expect CD issuances to rise. That should increase supply of debt paper and lead to an uptick in rates.

“As credit off-take continues in double digits and deposit rate doesn't increase in tandem, CD issuance will increase and so (will) the spreads,” LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management’s Pawar said.

Pawar pointed out that total outstanding CDs have increased to Rs 2.35 lakh crores versus an outstanding of Rs 1.81 lakh crores as of March-end.",811,-0.043948610623677574

HDFC Bank will be among the world's top 10 most valuable banks after its merger with the parent, mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), at the current valuations and will also be the first Indian bank to make it to the Top 10 club, a Times of India report said.

India's largest private lender has a market capitalisation of about $108 billion and recently edged past Citigroup (over $100. 5 billion), which was at the 17th position, said the report.

HDFC Bank is worth more than DBS Group and UBS and (both valued at around $58 billion). The country’s largest lender State Bank of India ($57 billion) is at number 32 ahead of BNP Paribas ($55 billion) in terms of valuation. The combined market cap of HDFC Bank and HDFC ($52 billion) would be around $160 billion.

The Financial Stability Board, an international body which makes recommendations on financial regulation, termed JP Morgan the most systemically important bank for 2021 followed by BNP Paribas, Citigroup and HSBC.

The board publishes a list of 30 systemically important banks worldwide. While the 2021 list does not have any Indian bank, it has four Chinese lenders. China has five banks in the Top 10, the most for any country.

2022-07-25 11:32:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/icici-bank-vs-hdfc-bank-a-tale-of-outperformance-8881781.html,"What began as a series of unfortunate events at a rival bank has now turned into a story of personal outperformance.

India’s top two private sector lenders, ICICI Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd, were born together in 1994 but diverged in their performance and path many times.

When it comes to investors, ICICI Bank has reclaimed its position as the most favoured company in the banking space after a gap of many years. Indeed, most analysts now tag ICICI Bank’s stock a buy even though this seems to be the most crowded trade. For perspective, ICICI Bank’s shares have risen by 18 percent over the past one year. The broad Nifty has gained about 5 percent. HDFC Bank has disappointed investors with a 3 percent fall. If we take their share price journey from pre-pandemic highs, the story doesn’t change much.

Last month, Jefferies India Pvt Ltd highlighted the fact that ICICI Bank offers the best risk-reward mix among all global banks. It said the lender would report superior returns on assets on a consistent basis and has enough firepower to participate in India’s credit recovery without accidents of bad loans.

“Our target multiple for ICICI is now on a par with HDFC Bank,” wrote analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a July 24 note.

As said earlier, ICICI Bank’s valuation boost began more from HDFC Bank’s troubles than its own outperformance. But the first-quarter performance of both lenders shows that ICICI Bank’s outperformance is the main driver of valuations. The private sector lender has trumped its rival on almost all profitability metrics for the quarter.

Bank in shining armour

ICICI Bank’s strongest performance point has been its operating profit growth. The bank reported 19 percent year-on-year increase in core operating profit for Q1FY23, higher than HDFC Bank’s 15 percent.

True, the bank’s operating profit growth has been volatile even as HDFC Bank’s has been more consistent. But operating profit growth has been consistent over the past four quarters.

While operating expenses continue to remain relatively elevated, the bank’s core interest income leaves the rest of the private sector lenders ny the wayside. For Q1FY23, net interest income growth was a smart 21 percent versus HDFC Bank’s 15 percent and other banks’ single-digit or low double- digit growth.

In a troubled quarter for treasury operations, ICICI Bank reported a small trading income unlike a trading loss by several lenders. That said, the bank too suffered a hit on its bond portfolio just like the others.

The bank’s loan book has shown interesting changes. Post-pandemic, ICICI Bank’s book has turned retail heavy while HDFC Bank has ventured big into wholesale lending. The share of retail loans now stands at 53 percent in ICICI Bank’s book, mostly driven by secured lending.

HDFC Bank’s loan portfolio is now corporate loan-heavy with a growing share of small business loans. With this divergence, the largest private sector lender’s margins are expected to remain superior to others. That said, low-cost deposits will help ICICI Bank too.

Return on assets

A key swing factor in investor sentiment towards ICICI Bank has been the sharp drop in dud loans. As the lender shed loans that were not generating income, the drag on core operating profit has stopped.

Further, the lender’s need to set aside a large part of its profits as provisions has also come down. This double benefit has meant that the bank’s return on assets has expanded quickly. No wonder analysts have increased their expectations here.

Those at Jefferies see an RoA increase of 2 percent for FY23. Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd expects 2.1 percent growth. Unlike a year ago, when 5.2 percent of loans were non-performing, only 3.4 percent of loans do not generate any income for ICICI Bank. The improvement has been because of the bank’s renewed focus on retail and a conscious effort to be cautious on wholesale lending.

The management has indicated, though, that it would seek out opportunities in corporate lending during the current economic recovery. HDFC Bank continues to retain its premium as far as asset quality goes. The bank has been consistent in keeping its bad loan ratios low even during times of crisis.

Verdict of the markets

If one goes by the valuations, the markets favour ICICI Bank compared with HDFC Bank now. The rally in the former’s share price still has some steam left, according to analysts. At current price, ICICI Bank’s shares traded at roughly twice the estimated book value for FY24, similar to HDFC Bank’s multiple.

The gap has been bridged largely because of HDFC Bank’s valuation erosion over the past two years owing to concerns over technology, uncertainty surrounding the merger with Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd and a management change.

However, from here on analysts believe that ICICI Bank’s performance, if sustained, could continue to keep it in favourable books of investors.

“The stock return will be a function of earnings growth and re-rating over the coming years and ICICI Bank has all the ingredients in place to take over the pole position in the Indian banking space,” wrote Motilal Oswal analysts.",851,0.13922551274299622

The market had a strong week ended July 22, closing at more than two-and-a-half-month high with over 4 percent gains on the back of positive global trend, renewed buying interest at the FII desk, and easing commodity prices, including oil. After breaking out at the 16,000 levels, the Nifty50 did not look back, and crossed the 200-day exponential moving average of 16,521 in the middle of week, which also sustained in the later part of last week.

The index closed at 16,719.5 on Friday, the highest closing level since May 2, and has been making higher high higher low formation from the last five weeks on the daily charts, with bullish candlestick pattern formation on the daily as well weekly charts, while on the monthly charts, there was Bullish Engulfing kind of pattern formation.

The index has taken a support around its 30-31 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of up-move (from Covid lows to all-time high), which was placed at Rs 15,183 and since then it has seen upward move, barring intermittent correction.

Oscillators on the higher time frames indicated the sentiments are positive, but the lower timeframes (one hour and below) indicated negative sentiments which can be a sign of overbought and hence some setback can't be ruled out, especially after a 4 percent run-up last week and 10 percent rally from June lows, experts said.

On the levels, the next resistance for the index may be at 16,794, (the previous swing high point on June 3), followed by 16,946 and then 17,050 (200 days SMA), while the breakaway gap of 16,360-16,490 created during the last week can be act as a crucial support area, experts said.

""Going ahead, any decline towards this support is likely to get bought into. On the higher side, the recent swing high of 16,793 is very much within a touching distance now and soon we would see the benchmark index surpassing this as well. Slowly but steadily, we would see it eyeing its '200-SMA' (simple moving average) zone of 16,900 – 17,050 which would certainly be a sigh of relief for market participants,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.

He further said that although the undertone remains bullish, it's important to understand that the low hanging fruit is already gone and hence, it's advisable not to become too complacent; rather better to take one step at a time for a while.

A lot of thematic moves started doing well last week and hence, the pragmatic approach would be to focus on such potential movers which are likely to provide better trading opportunities, the market expert advised.

Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the July 22 closing prices:

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

L&T Finance Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 72.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 69.8 | Target: Rs 78 | Return: 8 percent

After a short term correction, the stock has formed higher bottom formation. From last couple of weeks, the stock is hovering between Rs 70 to Rs 74 price ranges. However, the short term texture of the stock is still in to the positive side.

We are of the view that, as long as the stock is trading above 20 days SMA (simple moving average) Rs 70.50, the uptrend wave is likely to continue. Above which it could hit the level of Rs 78. Further upside may also continue which could lift the stock up to Rs 80.

PVR: Buy | LTP: Rs 1939.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,870 | Target: Rs 2,070 | Return: 7 percent

In this month so far, the stock rallied over 5 percent. After a promising uptrend rally, the stock consistently taking support near Rs 1,875 level.

Technically, on daily charts it has formed higher bottom formation and comfortably trading above 20 days SMA (simple moving average). Unless it is trading below Rs 1,870, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 2,070. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 1,935 and Rs 1,900 levels with a stop-loss below Rs 1,870.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,392.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350 | Target: Rs 1,485 | Return: 7 percent

After a short term correction, the stock took the support near 50 days SMA or Rs 1,350 and bounced back quickly. In the last week, from the weekly lowest level it rallied over 4 percent.

It also formed long bullish candle which suggesting strong possibility of further upside from the current levels. Looking at the overall pattern it offers buying opportunity for the positional traders with a decent risk-reward ratio. The trend reversal move is likely to continue up to Rs 1,485.

Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative & Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities

Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 358.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 340 | Target: Rs 380-400 | Return: 12 percent

The stock price has broken out from the symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart. Short and medium term trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its important moving averages.

Momentum oscillators – RSI (11) and MFI (money flow index - 10) have placed above 60 and sloping upwards, indicating strength in the current uptrend of the stock.

Plus DI is trading above Minus DI while ADX line has crossed 25 levels, indicating momentum in the current uptrend.

The stock price has broken out on the daily line chart where it closed at highest level since May 2. The stock price has broken out from the downward sloping trendline, adjoining the highs of April 22 and July 7.

Trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its important moving averages. Plus DI is trading above Minus DI while ADX line is placed above 25, indicating stock is likely to gather momentum in the coming days.

Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa

Bharat Forge: Buy | LTP: Rs 706.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 682 | Target: Rs 748 | Return: 6 percent

After the recent corrective phase, the stock has recovered gradually from its swing lows and has now given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance on the weekly charts.

The volumes along with the price upmove are rising and the ‘RSI Smoothed’ oscillator is also hinting at a positive momentum.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 706-702 for potential targets of Rs 735 and Rs 748 in the near term. The stop-loss should be placed below Rs 682.

Polyplex Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,367.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,220 | Target: Rs 2,650 | Return: 12 percent

In the recent corrective phase, the stock has managed to hold above its 200-day EMA support and prices have now resumed the positive trend. The volumes along with the prices upmove are good and the momentum indicators are also hinting at a positive momentum.

The 5 days EMA (exponential moving average) has given a positive crossover above the '20 DEMA' which signals a short term uptrend.

Thus, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 2,370-2,360 for potential targets of Rs 2,520 and Rs 2,650 in the near term. The stop-loss for short positions can be placed below Rs 2,220.

Jatin Gohil, Technical & Derivative Analyst at Reliance Securities

JK Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,332.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,135 | Target: Rs 2,720 | Return: 17 percent

After a higher level of reversal, again the stock tested its 50-month EMA and witnessed a smart recovery. In the past, the stock resumed its up-move after testing that moving average.

We believe the history will repeat itself, as the key technical indicators reversed from the oversold zone on medium-term timeframe chart and positively poised.

This could lead the stock towards its point of polarization, which is placed at around Rs 2,720.

Mphasis: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,276.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,065 | Target: Rs 2,700 | Return: 19 percent

Since late-June 2022, the stock oscillated around its 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior up-move (Rs 630-3,660), which was placed at Rs 2,145. On week ended July 22, the stock breached its prior weekly falling trend and bounced.

The key technical indicators are in favour of the bulls on medium-term as well as short-term timeframe charts. On the higher side, the stock may face hurdle around Rs 2,380.

A stable move above that hurdle will take the stock towards Rs 2,475-2,550-2,700 in the short-term. In case of any decline, the stock will find support around its prior swing low, which is placed at around Rs 2,065.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,827.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,760 | Target: Rs 1,925 | Return: 5 percent

The stock is in the strong up-trend, as it again reversed after testing its 38.2 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior up-move (Rs 1,712-1,852). In the past, the stock extended gain after testing that level and moved towards its 100 percent Fibonacci extension mark.

The key technical indicators are positively poised on short-term as well as near-term timeframe charts.

The stock has potential to move towards its 100 percent Fibonacci extension of prior up-move, which is placed at around Rs 1,925. On the lower side, the stock will find support around Rs 1,760, where its 20-day and 50-day EMAs are placed.

Sharekhan's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank clocked a PAT of Rs. 9,196 crore (up 19% y-o-y/ down 8.5% q-o-q) which was in line with consensus. However, PAT was 2% below our estimates mainly led by higher treasury losses. NII met expectations, rising by 14.5% y-o-y and 3.2% q-o-q led by healthy net advances growth of 21.6% y-o-y along with a pick-up in retail loans (21.7% y-o-y vs 15.2% y-o-y in last quarter). NIMs were stable q-o-q. Core PPoP grew by 14.7% y-o-y and 2.2% q-o-q. GNPA & NNPA rose 11.7% q-o-q / 10.9% q-o-q. GNPA/NNPA ratio`s rose sequentially by 11 bps/3bps reported at 1.28%/0.35% led by some stress in agri (due to seasonality factor) and in corporate book. Bank has good track record of execution capabilities and have consistently given healthy returns in terms of ROA irrespective of economic cycles and RoE consistently above cost of capital. Per management comment in Q1FY23 earning conference call, near-term focus would be on merger with HDFC Ltd in terms of regulatory dispensations. Stock trades at 2.6x and 2.2x its FY2023E and FY2024E core BV.

Outlook

We maintain Buy with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1800.

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

Despite strong credit growth (22% yoy), core profit grew by 15% yoy on flat margins/higher opex, This, coupled with higher MTM loss on investments, partly offset by lower LLP, led to PAT growth of 19% yoy to Rs92bn. However, the bank expects a gradual improvement in core profitability, driven by a pick-up in NIMs/fees, partly offset by elevated opex, given the investments in infra, people and technology, and a gradual pick-up in the retail business. HDFCB expects overall credit growth to remain healthy, with the share of retail/SME improving, which, coupled with a re-pricing of the asset pool, should support margins. Higher slippages in Q1 were mainly due to seasonally higher agri NPAs and a lumpy corporate NPA (Rs4bn) to be recognized by other banks as well. Overall stress levels in SME/retail seem to be coming off, which should lead to lower NPAs/LLP going forward. The bank clarified that the RBI has given in-principle approval for its merger with HDFC Ltd, but clarity regarding regulatory forbearance, stakes/subsidiarization of HDFC Life and NBFCs, etc. will emerge later. We believe this will prolong investor concerns around the merger structure, weighing on the stock in the near term.

Outlook

Better credit growth/NIMs and a pick-up in fees should lead to steady improvement in core profitability (18% CAGR over FY23-25E), while lower LLP should lead to healthy RoAs/RoEs of around 1.9%/17% over FY23-25E. Though the lack of clarity about the merger structure remains a near-term overhang, the mortgage business should be long-term RoE-accretive for the bank. Further, the stock is currently trading at a reasonable valuation (2.2x FY24E ABV). Thus, we retain our long-term Buy rating with a TP of Rs1,800 (valuing the core bank at 3x Jun'24E ABV) and a subs valuation of Rs78.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB saw a good quarter with core earnings beating estimates led by better NII and other income (excl. treasury). NIM was higher by 5bps due to superior yields driven by strong retail credit growth of +5.0% QoQ. Retail wholesale mix improved QoQ from 43:57 to 45:55 which may continue to enhance. With increased focus on retail and the merger in progress, opex might remain elevated over the medium term. TD accretion during Q1FY23 was healthy at ~Rs620bn, suggesting that garnering TD in relation to merger may not be challenging. Asset quality saw a blip due to higher slippages of which 25% were attributable to OTR and agri, although recoveries were higher. OTR pool declined QoQ from 1.14% to 0.9%; contingent provisions were maintained at Rs96bn or 69bps.

Outlook

We remain positive on HDFC Bank even though near term focus would remain on the merger and subsequent conditions. We maintain multiple at 3.2x on Mar’24 ABV and TP at Rs1,740. Retain BUY.

Credit Suisse

The results were in line despite Rs 1,300 crore of treasury loss. The credit costs remained low at one percent, aiding healthy return on assets of 1.8 percent.

Credit Suisse raises FY23-24 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by two to three percent and expects 17 percent plus return on equity (RoE), CNBC-TV18 reported.

Nomura

The brokerage house has maintained a buy rating on HDFC Bank and cut the target price to Rs 1,690 per share.

Further decline in provisions aided profit.

FY23/24/25 EPS estimates changed to -1.2/-0.6/-0.8 percent on lower treasury income and lower net interest margin (NIM).

Nomura forecast 16.6 and 16.8 percent EPS and core book value compound annual growth rate (CAGR) respectively over FY22-25, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Kotak Institutional Equities

The research firm has kept a buy rating on HDFC Bank with a target of Rs 1,650 per share.

The company posted 19 percent YoY earnings growth on the back of two percent operating profit growth. The high treasury losses were offset by healthy NII growth and solid fee income growth.

Asset quality metrics were stable while near-term overhang would be the merger.

Motilal Oswal

The brokerage observed margin stood flat sequentially and is expected to improve gradually. Asset quality ratios have deteriorated marginally, while the restructured book moderated to 76 basis points of loans.

""We expect the lender to deliver 20% profit after tax CAGR over FY22-24, with a RoA/RoE of 2/17.5 percent in FY24. We maintain our buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,800 per share (premised on 3x FY24 adjusted book value).

""The lender remains among our preferred picks. We expect the stock to perform gradually as revenue and margin revive over FY23, while clarity emerges on several aspects related to the merger with HDFC,"" the brokerage said.

Prabhudas Lilladher

""The lender saw a good quarter with core earnings beating estimates led by better NII and other income (excluding treasury). NIM was higher by five basis points due to superior yields driven by strong sequential retail credit growth of five percent.

""With increased focus on retail and the merger in progress, opex might remain elevated over the medium term.

""Asset quality saw a blip due to higher slippages of which 25 percent were attributable to OTR and agriculture, although recoveries were higher. OTR pool declined sequentially from 1.14 to 0.9 percent; contingent provisions were maintained at Rs 9,600 crore or 69 basis points.

""We remain positive on HDFC Bank even though near term focus would remain on the merger and subsequent conditions. We maintain multiple at 3.2x on Mar’24 adjusted book value and target price at Rs 1,740. Retain buy,"" the brokerage said.

Sharekhan

""We believe that the bank is on an accelerated growth path with strong advances growth led by retail and small and medium business segments along with healthy low-cost deposit mobilisation.

""The bank’s continuous building up of its digital capabilities and franchise network is likely to bode well for growth going ahead.

""The lender is well-capitalised and has the ability to manage asset quality across cycles and deliver superior return ratios irrespective of economic cycles and reap opportunities from a revival in the economy going ahead.

""As per management comment, near-term focus would be the status of the merger with HDFC in terms of regulatory dispensations.

""Maintain buy rating with an unchanged price target of Rs 1,800,"" the brokerage said.

“We have made necessary applications to various authorities. The Board is closely monitoring the merger process for approval of various aspects of the merger, as required by the legal process,” he said.

On 4 April, HDFC Bank and HDFC announced the decision to merge. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through a ""transformational merger"". Every 25 shares held by HDFC shareholders will fetch them 42 shares of the bank. The merger will create an entity with a total market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore, and a combined balance sheet of Rs 17.9 lakh crore.

The Chairman’s comments came on the heels of HDFC Bank reporting its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June at Rs 9,579 crore, up 20.9 percent year-on-year (YoY), primarily on the back of lower provisions and higher asset growth.

Chakraborty said considering higher housing demand in the economy and with HDFC Bank’s lower cost of funds and strong distribution network, “there is huge merit in seizing this opportunity”. A large and more stable balance sheet would enable the lender to step exposures and facilitate higher credit growth, he said

Moneycontrol on July 8 reported that the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) has approved the merger of HDFC twins. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) accorded its approval to the proposed HDFC-HDFC Bank merger on July 4.

Further, HDFC Bank is harnessing the strength of various digital platforms developed by fintech companies and other start-ups to service a larger customer base, improve bank reach and create new products, the chairman said.

“We are also working to enable new age consumer experiences by partnering with modern neotechs. Under our technology transformation agenda, we are investing to ‘Run the Bank’ as well as ‘Build a Future-ready Bank’,” he said.

During the previous financial year, the RBI had imposed restrictions on HDFC Bank related to the onboarding of new credit card customers and launching of new digital offerings. The regulator’s action had come after HDFC Bank customers reported frequent outages in online banking services of the bank.

""We are happy to share that the restrictions on your Bank are completely lifted following the progress we have made on our technology investments, processes, and governance,” the Chairman said.

HDFC Bank has realigned the employee incentives at the “cutting edge” to make it more responsive to customer needs, Chakraborty said. The lender is also scaling up net promoter system (NPS) implementation as a customer response measurement tool, he added.",454,0.6358298460642496

HDFC Bank on July 16 reported strong first quarter earnings with double digit growth in bottomline on the back of lower provisions and steady asset growth. Here are the top five takeaway from India’s largest private lender’s Q1Fy23 earnings:

Stable Profit

The lender's consolidated net profit for Q1FY23 stood at Rs 9,579 crore, up 20.9 percent year-on-year YoY. This was on the back of lower provisions and higher asset growth.

Robust Credit Growth

The private bank’s total loans stood at Rs 13.95 lakh crore as on June 30, up 21.6 percent YoY. Retail loans, which accounted for 39 percent of the bank’s advances, grew by 21.7 per cent YoY, while commercial and rural banking loans, accounting for 35 per cent of loans, grew by 28.9 per cent on year. Corporate and other wholesale loans grow by 15.7 per cent YoY during the reporting quarter.

Double digit credit growth, with corporate loan growth returning back to healthy levels, suggests the credit offtake in India is on rise post 2 years of slump during Covid-19.

“Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 grew by 14.5% to Rs 19,481.4 crore from Rs 17,009.0 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, driven by advances growth of 22.5%, deposits growth of 19.2% and total balance sheet growth of 20.3%,” the bank said in a regulatory filing.

Asset quality deteriorates sequentially

HDFC Bank’s asset quality deteriorated in the quarter under review with gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) ratio rising to 1.28 percent, up 11 basis points (bps) from the previous quarter, but lower 19 bps on a YoY basis.

The net NPAs stood at 0.35 per cent as on June end, 3 bps higher sequentially and 15 bps lower on YoY basis.

Lower capital adequacy

HDFC Bank’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stood at 17.5 per cent as on June 30, as against 18.9 percent in Q4Fy22 and 19.1 percent in Q1FY22.

Even as 17.5 percent CAR remains comfortably above the regulatory mandate, the downward trajectory points that the lender will soon raise capital to support growth, analysts said.

Margins stable

During Q1FY23, HDFC Bank’s core net interest margin stood at 4.1 percent on total assets, and 4.2 percent on interest earnings assets. The trends are broadline stable in comparison with previous quarter.

During April-June, HDFC Bank added 2.6 million new liabilities accounts, as per the statement.

Total deposits grew 19.2 percent to Rs 16.04 lakh crore as on June end. CASA deposits grew by 20.1 percent YoY with savings account deposits at Rs 5,14,063 crore and current account deposits at Rs 2,20,584 crore as on June 30.",444,0.39838909677096773

The lender's net interest income (NII) stood at Rs 19,481.40 crore, up 14.5 percent year-on-year (YoY). The rise in the NII was driven by 22.5 percent growth in advances and 19.2 percent growth in deposits. The lender’s total balance sheet grew 20.3 percent.

The Bank's core net revenue, excluding trading and Mark to Market losses, grew 19.8 percent to 27,181.4 crore from 22,696.5 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.

HDFC Bank, which is scheduled to announce its June quarter numbers on July 16, is likely to report strong growth in profits and net interest income (NII), said analysts tracking the company.

Analysts expect the most valued private bank to report 12-23 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in NII. Net profit growth is likely to be in the range of 19-32 percent YoY. However, sequential growth will likely be flat or negative.

ICICI Securities, which is bullish on the bank’s stocks, said credit growth is expected to remain strong at 21.6 percent YoY to Rs 13.95 lakh crore. Deposit growth is expected at 19 percent YoY and CASA ratio is likely to be at around 46 percent, it said.

“NII growth to be at 12.9 percent YoY to Rs 19,203 crore and expect margins to be flattish quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) at 4 percent. Other income to see improvement YoY and asset quality expected to improve QoQ with gross non performing assets (NPA) at around 1.1 percent levels,” it said. The broker expects provision to decline to Rs 3,208 crore, which will lift net profits up 26 percent YoY to Rs 9,720 crore.

However, sequential growth will not be as spectacular, analysts noted.

According to YES Securities, sequential loan growth would be moderate due to idiosyncratic aspects and the bank bouncing back from the impact of the third wave of Covid-19 in Q4FY22, which would somewhat offset the seasonal impact of a tepid first quarter of the financial year.

“Sequential NII growth would be particularly healthy given yield on advances would have evolved faster than cost of deposits due to repricing of externally benchmarked loans, implying net interest margin (NIM) expansion on sequential basis,” it said.

Analysts said sequential fee income growth, though, would be healthy due to a bounce-back in payments-related fees, which will offset seasonal sluggishness to an extent. Treasury income would be weak, but since it is such a low part of the interest income that it will not have much impact, they said.

After some quarters of relatively weaker numbers, the bank has bounced back in the last couple of quarters, regaining its mojo. And, Choice Broking also believes the mojo will continue for another quarter.

“NII/PAT are expected to grow at 23 percent/20 percent YoY. Meanwhile, the bank has reported 21 percent YoY advances growth during QFY23, which came in line with our estimated growth of 21.5 percent,” it said.

According to Axis Securities and Choice Broking, key things to watch for the bank will be:

- Bank's announcements on digital infrastructure front

- Commentary on its merger with HDFC with respect to regulatory compliance

- NIM guidance",450,0.7675119414925575

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

We remain constructive on HDFCB as merging of two systemically important financial institutions would boost balance sheet size, access to a larger client base and cross sell opportunities. Our interaction with the management of HDFC Bank and HDFC Ltd reinforced our confidence in the ability of the merged entity to garner deposits, meet regulatory requirements and improve profitability. While we don’t foresee any shortfall on CRR/SLR, a deficit of 50% is projected on PSL needs, although it could be lower.

Outlook

NIM may initially dip post-merger but improve thereafter and core RoE might enhance over FY23E-25E from 15.1% to 16.8%. Due to lower NII and higher opex we trim our PAT for HDFCB in FY23E/24E by average ~6.4% and lower multiple to 3.0x from 3.2x. With combined core market cap at Rs9trn, valuation is attractive at 2.3x core FY24 ABV. We roll forward to Sep’24 core ABV and our TP is unchanged with SOTP based TP of Rs1740. Maintain BUY.

Private lender HDFC Bank said it has received no adverse observations from the stock exchanges in relation to its proposed merger with parent entity Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Ltd.

""We would like to inform you that HDFC Bank has received observation letter with ‘no adverse observations’ from BSE Limited and observation letter with ‘no objection’ from the National Stock Exchange of India Limited, both dated July 2, 2022,"" it said in a regulatory filing.

The merger was announced in April this year when HDFC's board had cleared the amalgamation of its wholly-owned subsidiaries HDFC Investments Ltd and HDFC Holdings Ltd with HDFC Bank.

While the proposed merger has received a thumbs-up from the stock exchanges, it still requires approvals from other regulatory bodies.

""The scheme remains subject to various statutory and regulatory approvals inter alia including approvals from the Reserve Bank of India, the Competition Commission of India, the National Company Law Tribunal and the respective shareholders and creditors of the companies involved in the scheme, as may be required,"" HDFC Bank said.

As per the plan, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger. Every 25 shares held by HDFC shareholders will fetch them 42 shares of the bank. The merger created an entity that will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs 17.9 lakh crore.

HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh, while announcing the plan, had called it a ""merger of equals"" and attributed tight RBI regulations on non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) as a major reason for the merger.

In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol after the announcement, Parekh, the veteran banker who built the iconic mortgage lender over four decades, had said that it makes sense for the mortgage lender to merge with the bank considering the absence of any regulatory arbitrage for non-banks due to RBI tightening of rules.

Parekh elaborated on how the tight RBI regulations have impacted the NBFC industry. He cited rules on NPA (non-performing assets) and liquidity coverage ratio as examples. Also, the cost of money for NBFCs is on the rise, he said.

HDFC and HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour.

With the parent finally giving the go-ahead for the merger, the resultant entity is expected to emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry.",425,0.9999537467956543

His comments came on the heels of HDFC Bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (MD & CEO) Sashidhar Jagdishan saying in the bank’s FY22 annual report that “quite simply”, the lender could have not afforded missing the chance of the proposed merger with Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC).

Analysts say the aggressive growth commentaries from the chiefs of two large banks show that credit demand, after hovering in single digits during the pandemic and till earlier this year, will likely pick up this fiscal. As the country’s largest private bank and public sector bank combat to gain market share, Moneycontrol analyses how the two lenders’ assets and deposits compare with each other, and whether SBI will be able to secure its age-old leadership position in the banking industry.

Assets

SBI’s loan book stood at Rs 26.64 lakh crore as on December end, up 8.5 per cent year-on-year (YoY). Retail personal loans at Rs 9.52 lakh crore as on December 31, rose 14.6 percent. Corporate loans, however, de-grew 0.7 percent to Rs 7.83 lakh crore. In a conversation with CNBC TV-18 on April 13, Khara had said that the bank will likely see more than 10 percent loan growth in the current fiscal.

Credit offtake is happening essentially in the iron, steel and cement sectors, and capital expenditure was also being seen in the automobile and e-mobility sectors, he said. Infrastructure projects are also driving credit demand in airport and port sectors, he added.

When asked whether the merger of the HDFC twins will challenge SBI’s market share in the home loan segment, Khara said the bank will be “more than happy” to rejig its products and platform to capture demand.

“I always feel that competition brings more and more agility. I think, being the largest home loan provider, that is a trigger for us to ensure that we should stay the largest ever. So, for that, whatever is required to be done, we will be more than happy… looking into our product and platform,” he said.

The combined advances of HDFC Bank and HDFC, as per an official company document seen by Moneycontrol, stand at Rs 17.86 lakh crore as on December end on proforma basis.

Analysts at ICICI Securities maintained its ‘Buy’ rating with a Rs 1,330 price target on HDFC Bank on June 23 saying the runway for the bank in terms of growth is huge and it can add one HDFC Bank every five years.

“The CEO’s message is similar to what was articulated during the analyst day on 31 May 2022 highlighting why this is an opportune time to fructify the merger given housing loan growth opportunity with deeper penetration, regulatory convergence, conducive market development, pricing convergence, portfolio rebalancing, enhanced cross-sell,” it said.

While SBI will continue its focus expanding its digital footprint across country, HDFC Bank plans to open between 1,500 and 2,000 branches each year for the next three to five years, as per Jagdishan.

“The branch will be digital from a customer on-boarding and transaction/servicing perspective. It will provide the emotional connect and relationship management necessary for offering financial solutions to our customers. These branches will be small in size and will be phygital relationship centres,” Jagdishan said.

“This will enable us to go after the catchment more aggressively and build the required liability franchise that we are known for, and we are confident that we would execute well,” he added.

As on March end, HDFC Bank’s total banking outlets stood at 21,683, while total branches, including four overseas, stood at 6,342. The lender’s total ATMs and cash deposit machines were at 18,130 at the end of March, and it had 15,341 business correspondents (BCs) in its network.

Further, as only 2 per cent of HDFC Bank customers source their home loans through the bank, the scope for rise in mortgage loans is immense, the MD said.

“Home loan customers typically keep deposits that are five to seven times that of other retail customers. And about 70 percent of HDFC Ltd’s customers do not bank with us. All these gives us an idea about the size of the opportunity,” he added.

HDFC Bank has a home loan agreement with HDFC, according to which HDFC Bank sources loans for the parent for a 1.10 percent fee, with the right to buy 70 percent of the loans it originates. Due to the agreement, HDFC Bank could only source home loans from 2,000 of the over 6,500 branches it had as on March end, an HDFC source said.

Liabilities, asset quality

On the liabilities side, SBI’s total deposits stood at Rs 38.47 lakh crore as on December-end, while HDFC Bank’s total deposits stood at Rs 16.01 lakh crore on a proforma basis.

The low-cost current account, savings account (CASA) deposits for SBI stood at Rs 17 lakh crore as on December-end, while HDFC Bank had total CASA deposits of Rs 6.81 lakh crore on a standalone basis in same period.

Further, SBI’s net interest margin (NIM) stood at 3.40 per cent as on December end, while HDFC Bank’s core NIM stood at 4.1 per cent.

“Overall, factoring in the regulatory requirements (CRR+SLR+PSL) and assuming that 20 percent of high-cost HDFC borrowings are replaced, our workings suggest that the bank will have to mobilise deposits to the tune of Rs 5.5 trillion over FY24-25, which need to be met through a combination of growing vintage of branches and accelerated growth via some rate tinkering,” brokerage Emkay Global said in a report dated May 23.

“However, the deposit ask can be reduced by slowing down HDFC’s growth, increasing affordable housing/PSL-compliant loan growth, phased grandfathering of HDFC’s bank borrowings, and even raising relatively cheap overseas bonds,” it added.

In terms of asset quality, SBI’s headline numbers were higher than HDFC Bank.

While SBI’s gross and net non-performing asset (GNPA, NNPA) ratio stood at 4.50 per cent and 1.34 per cent as on December end, respectively, HDFC Bank’s corresponding numbers stood at 1.26 per cent and 0.37 per cent for the same period.",1034,0.7494124282490123

HDFC Bank proposes to double its network of branches in the next three to five years by adding 1,500 to 2,000 branches annually, which would akin to adding a new HDFC Bank every five years, said its managing director and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan.

Outlining justification for merger of HDFC with the HDFC Bank in his letter to shareholders in the annual report 2021-22, Jagdishan said: ""The proposed merger adds an entirely different dimension to the future. We believe that the runway is huge, and we can potentially add an HDFC Bank every five years.""

He further said that the bank proposes to nearly double its network of branches in the next three to five years by opening 1,500 to 2,000 branches every year. Currently it has over 6,000 branches across India.

""The density of branches for the population of this country is way below that of OECD countries. This is where our branch banking strategy comes in. Today we have 6,000-plus branches across India, and we plan to nearly double our network in the next three to five years by opening 1,500 to 2,000 branches every year,"" he said.

In early April this year, the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and its subsidiary HDFC Bank had announced a transformational merger, which is expected to be completed in about 15 to 18 months. Christening the merger as the 'Power of One', Jagdishan said the bank looks forward to the phenomenal set of talent, deep product knowledge and expertise, the processes, and system that the lender will add to the existing ones.

HDFC Bank cannot afford to miss this opportunity, Jagdishan said, adding that home loans are emotional products and bring with them a host of accelerated benefits for the bank. ""Today the environment for buying a home has changed. RERA has ensured greater transparency in the process. Price corrections in the property market have seen inventories come down. Also, rising incomes mean that home loan EMIs have come down as a percentage of a person's income,"" the official said.

He said with the penetration of telecom, internet and television services, the desire to own better homes has increased across the country. ""All this means that housing is going to be a huge growth opportunity and one of the key drivers of India's GDP over the next decade.""

Putting forth the statistics, Jagdishan said that only 2 per cent of its customers source their home loans from it, while 5 per cent do it from other institutions. ""The latter is equivalent to the size of our retail book. Home loan customers typically keep deposits that are 5 to 7 times that of other retail customers. And about 70 per cent of HDFC Ltd's customers do not bank with us."" All these give HDFC Bank the idea about the size of the opportunity, he said, adding that the long tenor nature of home loans provides resilience to the balance sheet. The bank is one of the largest consumer durable financiers in the country.

""We can easily bundle this with a home loan, as with every home loan, there is a propensity of a customer to take new consumer durables. It is this kind of bundling that will increase margins. With the advantage of a lower cost of funds and the phenomenal distribution muscle that we have built, it is imperative that we seize this opportunity,"" he said.

Reasoning the timing of merger, he said there are other favourable factors too such as narrowing down of the regulatory arbitrage between banks and NBFCs over the last few years, with the reserve requirements coming down to about 22 per cent from 26 per cent.

""Both institutions are well-capitalised and have surplus liquidity and a strong portfolio of investments in government securities. The increase in priority sector lending that we need to do, due to the merger, is possible now with our own increased focus on MSMEs, the affordable housing loans that we can do and the well-developed PSL certificate market. ""All this means that on the day of the merger there may not be any need to raise further funds to meet reserve requirements. The addition of the home mortgages portfolio on our balance sheet makes it more diversified and robust.""

Futher, the enhanced capital position of the bank post the merger also means that the lender can take bigger exposures in leading corporates and power the country's infrastructure build out, Jagdishan said. He said HDFC Bank already had a huge opportunity with the under-penetration of banking services in the country. ""The proposed merger adds an entirely different dimension to the future."" He said HDFC Bank already had a huge opportunity with the under-penetration of banking services in the country.

On the capital raise plans, the lender said it proposes to raise an amount not exceeding Rs 50,000 crore by issuing long-term bonds on a private placement basis. It will seek shareholders' approval in the ensuing annual general meeting scheduled for July 16, 2022 for the fundraise plan.

In fiscal year ended March 2022, HDFC Bank reported nearly 19 per cent growth in its net profit at Rs 36,961 crore. Its balance sheet grew by 18.4 per cent to Rs 20,68,535 crore. On the asset quality front, bank's gross non-performing assets stood at 1.17 per cent of the gross advances as of March 31, 2022.",902,0.8125791441310536

""I think the RBI is in a civil war. One faction talks about innovation and inclusion. Another faction works hard to undermine this. This circular makes no sense to me at all.""

""They seem to have decided to close fintech companies in India. One blow coming after the other.""

These were just some of the messages being exchanged between founders of fintechs in India on WhatsApp groups on the evening of June 20th, minutes after a letter by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) threatened to endanger their very existence. In a missive that went out to many startups in the evening, the RBI said that loading credit lines into prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) such as wallets and prepaid cards is not permitted.

What seemed like a routine Monday swiftly turned into an existential crisis for many Indian fintechs. RBI reminded these entities that a prepaid instrument can only be loaded using cash, a bank account debit, or a proper debit or credit card, and other PPIs and ‘other payment instruments issued by regulated entities’.

It was just a two-paragraph-long clarification, but words so potent that it threatened to junk the business model of a number of fintechs that have seen tremendous growth over the past year. Apart from unicorns like Slice, others like Uni, PayU owned LazyPay, KreditBee, extend loans through prepaid cards which are issued by their partner banks including SBM Bank India, RBL Bank, among others.

Many of these fintechs have grown in size and visibility and have managed to become well-known brands in the past year. They have actors as brand ambassadors, are even IPL sponsors and have raised millions in funding. This clarification potentially puts a question mark on all of this, some industry insiders say.



RBI continues to play Cupid to ensure Fintechs Banks

— Amrish Rau (@amrishrau) June 21, 2022

What is the confusion?

The clarification, viewed by Moneycontrol, was addressed to ""All Authorised Non-bank Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) Issuers.""

At first glance, it looks like these players are safe because prepaid cards under their branding are issued by their partner banks. However, the loan itself comes from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in most instances, and the customer can avail of it through a bank-issued prepaid card. That is what the RBI may be against.

Secondly, as the communication said that norms don’t allow for credit lines to be loaded in PPIs at all, it puts a question on the overall model, even if the prepaid instrument is issued by a bank.

What’s worrying is none of this has been explicitly stated. So, what are the fintechs supposed to do? A few have already stopped issuing cards or will soon pull the plug.

A senior executive of one of the impacted fintechs said, “My sense is all PPI regardless of who issues it will get affected now or very soon. This is a concern. We will have to stop issuing cards very soon until there is more clarity.”

The move may also impact players like OlaMoney Postpaid Plus and Paytm Payments Bank. While OlaMoney Postpaid Plus uses a wallet to load credit from its NBFC partner Aditya Birla Finance, Paytm has been loading customers’ wallets with Paytm Postpaid credit lines. According to Macquarie, more clarity is needed on the impact on Paytm.

RBI’s mixed signals

Over the past few months, multiple instructions have come from the RBI. On the one hand, RBI aims to be a friend of the fintechs, working hand in hand and consulting with them to release a set of guidelines on digital lending. These guidelines are being worked on by the newly formed fintech department within the RBI.

On the other hand, clarifications or changes in guidelines like these are aimed at one set of players – those facilitating loans to be used through a card form factor.

On April 21, RBI released new norms for co-branded cards as part of the Master Direction on debit and credit cards, a document that consolidates instructions on rules and regulations.

The Master Direction limited the role of co-branding entities to marketing and distribution of credit or pre-paid cards, casting a shadow on the viability of the business models of these fintechs. The changes which are set to come into effect on July 1 also said that the co-branding partner shall not have access to information relating to transactions undertaken through the card.

“The signals from RBI have to be looked at in totality, despite separate communications. What is unclear is that there no reasons assigned. If you say this is wrong and hence we are stopping it, it makes it clear,” said the founder mentioned above.

How the industry reacted

The central bank has left all fintechs confused with its cryptic wording. These budding startups are now looking for answers (and some even a workaround) on whether this means that they need to stop their core offering altogether and go back to the drawing board.

While founders wondered why the RBI was dealing a deathly blow, Amrish Rau, the CEO of Pine Labs, tweeted suggesting that this was another move to ensure that fintechs remain dependent on banks.

Already reeling from a slowdown in funding, upending the key product offering, marketing and branding is going to be a question of survival with many risking losing customers in the process.

A fintech founder remarked, “If it actually means what we fear, the move will impact 10-15 million customers who currently use these products.”

Advantage banks

But banks have been long concerned about the spurt in the growth of these companies, especially that of Slice which had been adding 200,000 to 300,000 per month, at par with leading credit card issuers like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.

“These banks have been wanting to know what Slice is doing to achieve such numbers. They have been a worried month after month with their disbursal numbers,” said a source on the condition of anonymity.

A day after this clarification by the RBI, Macquarie said in a note, “We believe this regulation could significantly impact the fintechs involved in this business and would be advantageous to banks, as they can further accelerate card acquisition with less competition.”

In a direct impact, the stock of SBI cards closed higher by 6.78 percent in trade on June 21.

Was this expected?

The move by some is also being seen as expected. Over the past few months, RBI has been more cautious of card issuing fintechs as compared to other lending or Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) players who extend credit independent of any prepaid instruments.

Customers too had been misunderstanding these products, taking them to be a credit card. In fact, this is a personal loan being linked to a card, a fact that came as a shock to many customers leading to many complaints on social media against these fintechs. Fintechs on the other hand claim to be transparent about the product.

On this, the note by Macquarie said, “The main purpose of a PPI license is to act as a payment instrument and not as a credit instrument, and we believe many fintechs were using this as a channel to load credit.”

“We also believe many customers were unknowingly taking a line of credit through their wallets at the point of check-out. Some of these practices have not gone down well with the regulator, in our view.”

While many of these players grew aggressively in a high liquidity-low interest rate scenario, many believe RBI sees these models as a systemic risk with agreements such as First Loan Default Guarantee (FLDG) in the picture under which fintechs agree to compensate lending partners to a certain extent in case of a default.

That said, fintechs too seem to have done their due diligence before launching these products.

“It's not like these entities have just gone ahead and done what they want. They've had someone advising them. This is the destruction of value and trust, how will customers trust these brands now,” said a founder quoted above.

In a legal opinion dated February 11, 2022, former Chief Justice of India VN Khare concluded that lending through PPIs can be allowed, and many players have banked on this. The opinion was sought by one of the card players, according to sources.

The legal opinion document as seen by Moneycontrol mentions players including OlaMoney Postpaid Plus, Dhani Loans, and Services, TVS Credit Services, a joint offering by Bajaj Finserv and Mobikwik, and LazyPay.

“It is opined that it shall be permissible under the payment and settlement systems laws as well as RBI regulations and directions (including PSS Act and PPI Directions) to undertake loading of funds into PPI Card of the Customer by the Financing Partner through the credit line/facility in an aforesaid manner,” the opinion by the former Chief Justice read.

While fintechs can use this in their favour, RBI’s word shall prevail on these matters.

For now, there are many interpretations, disappointments, and reactions after the two paragraphs issued by RBI on June 21. Fintechs meanwhile are scrambling for clear answers, or by some miracle a change of heart by the RBI.",1552,-0.802110318094492

Private sector major HDFC Bank will open between 1,500 and 2,000 branches each year for the next three to five years and will roll out new product features every three weeks, the lender’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Sashidhar Jagdishan said in the bank’s FY22 annual report.

“The branch will be digital from a customer on-boarding and transaction/servicing perspective. It will provide the emotional connect and relationship management necessary for offering financial solutions to our customers. These branches will be small in size and will be phygital relationship centres,” Jagdishan said.

“This will enable us to go after the catchment more aggressively and build the required liability franchise that we are known for, and we are confident that we would execute well,” he added.

As on March end, HDFC Bank’s total banking outlets stood at 21,683, while total branches including 4 overseas ones stood at 6,342. The lender’s total ATMs and cash deposit machines were at 18,130 at the end of March, and it had 15,341 business correspondents under its network.

Branch expansion will help HDFC Bank in deposit accretion and aid in merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation with the bank, analysts said.

“The real concern in this merger is about mobilising a huge pool of deposits to meet regulatory requirements, including CRR/SLR/PSL, and replacing HDFC Ltd's high-cost borrowings to the tune of Rs 4.2 trillion, excluding housing bonds,” says Anand Dama, head of BFSI at Emkay Global Financial Services.

As on March end, HDFC Bank’s total deposits stood at Rs 15.59 lakh crore, up 17 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. Low-cost current account and savings account deposits held 48 percent share in total deposits. The lender’s loan book, meanwhile, rose 21 percent YoY to Rs 13.68 lakh crore.

Digital drives

HDFC Bank could not have grown to be a bank of large scale and increase its market share consistently if it did not focus on expanding technology infrastructure, the MD said.

“Our customers faced some technology-related issues in accessing the bank’s products and services during the previous year, which had led to some regulatory action, last fiscal,” he added referring to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) temporary ban on the bank last year from launching new digital services.

“I am happy to inform you that thanks to the progress we have made on our technology investments, processes and governance, the regulatory actions have been fully lifted. We converted the challenge into an opportunity and have made substantial strides in the way we evaluate, manage and operationalise our technology,” Jagdishan said.

In the next few quarters, HDFC Bank will launch more products and services under its “Digital 2.0” drive, he noted.

A new payments platform for HDFC Bank customers, merchants and a wealth management platform are in the offing, he said, adding that these platforms will be built in partnerships with new-age tech companies.

Further, HDFC Bank customers can expect better services going ahead as the lender has set up a new centre in Bengaluru where an internal team is working on re-writing the mobile and net banking platforms of the bank.

“The entire project will be completed in a 2-year time frame and will allow the bank to own a modern cloud-enabled Mobile/NetBanking platform. Enabling a new-age experience for customers, we will roll out new features every 3 to 4 weeks, in line with digital fintech companies,” the MD said.",567,0.5523053556680679

One such instance that has caught the attention of the banking and corporate fraternity’s eyeballs is Great Indian Nautanki Company and its corporate guarantor Great Indian Tamasha Company.

While the default amount in this case may be relatively small, the names of both the companies have certainly aroused curiosity.

Nautanki literally translates into drama, while tamasha is the Hindi word for fuss or commotion. This probably explains the media attention and social media frenzy surrounding the case.

The issue came to light when IDBI Bank put out a public notice for the sale of assets of Great Indian Tamasha Company through an e-auction. When a company (Great Indian Nautanki Company) defaults on a loan, the guarantor (Great Indian Tamasha Company) is liable to pay and its property can be attached until the amount is recovered. The attached property can be auctioned too.

What we know so far

The Great Indian Nautanki Company owes IDBI Bank Rs 86.48 crore, HDFC Bank Rs 6.26 crore and Bank of Baroda Rs 49.23 crore, besides interest and penalties. As of May 1, the dues of IDBI Bank stood at Rs 92.69 crore plus interest with effect from May 2, according to IDBI Bank’s notice.

Its directors or guarantors are Anumod Sharma, Anu Appaiah, Viraf Sarkari and Sanjay Chaudhary, SG Investments, Great Indian Tamasha Company and Wizcraft International Entertainment.

IDBI Bank has invited bids or offers for the sale of the property of Great Indian Tamasha Company under provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act.

The SARFAESI Act allows financial organisations and banks to auction residential and commercial assets of a borrower that has defaulted on debt.

IDBI Bank, HDFC Bank and Bank of Baroda have sought bids through an e-caution for the sale of 107.24 acres of land owned and mortgaged by Great Indian Tamasha Company with these banks.

The properties scheduled to be auctioned are situated in the Peroor village's Ballamvati Mandal Panchayat of Kodagu district in Karnataka.

The properties have a reserve price of Rs 11.53 crore and will remain open from July 16 to July 22. The e-auction will be conducted on July 27, according to the public notice.

Typically, banks invoke security/guarantee only after classifying an account as an NPA. Moneycontrol could not immediately confirm when the banks declared the account an NPA.

What do these companies do?

New Delhi-based Great Indian Nautanki Company was set up in 2007 and is an operator of entertainment venues and shows, most notably the Kingdom of Dreams in Gurgaon.

Great Indian Tamasha Company was set up in January 2008 and is based in New Delhi. It is a non-government company with an authorised share capital of Rs 2 crore. It is involved in sporting and recreational activities.

Anumod Sharma and Sanjay Choudhry are directors of both companies.

IDBI Bank had filed an insolvency application against Wizcraft International Entertainment, a guarantor of Great Indian Nautanki Company, with the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal in 2021, for not being able to recover dues after invoking its corporate guarantee.

Alarm bells?

Names such as Nautanki and Tamasha are not very common in India’s corporate culture.

Some banking and corporate executives had questioned why the names of the companies themselves had not triggered alarm bells when banks conducted their due diligence.

However, a legal expert was of the opinion that names should not be considered an indicator of a company’s credibility.

“The names sound dubious but we cannot conclude that due diligence was compromised,” a Mumbai-based lawyer said on condition of anonymity. “The long and short of it is that the loan has turned sour and banks will have to struggle to recover the default.”",654,-0.9723721146583557

The deal the sovereign wealth fund signed with IIFL Finance, the parent of IIFL Home, marks one of the biggest investments in the affordable housing segment in India.

In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Nirmal Jain, founder of IIFL Group, said ADIA’s investment would be used to penetrate deeper into the affordable housing segment and target under-served markets in Tier 4 or Tier 5 markets.

Home loan rates can rise by another 75-to-100 basis points at the industry level, assuming the rate hike cycle by the Reserve Bank of India, will continue for some time, Jain said. He also spoke about the impact the merger of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and HDFC Bank will have on smaller housing finance companies.

Edited excerpts:

What would the proceeds of the ADIA investment be used for?

IIFL Home Finance has been growing at a fairly good pace... The market opportunity is big because in the affordable housing finance segment there are not too many players. This is a huge under-penetrated market and affordable housing finance is something which even banks have not been able to capture - people who are self-employed or those in the informal sector, where documents are not fool-proof. There are so many smaller towns and places in India where credit still has to go deeper. And this is what we would want to target now that we have the investment from ADIA. We want to grow the business across the country.

Which new geographies are you looking to tap?

There are many districts that we need to penetrate deeper. Right now, housing finance is operating in 230 cities across India. When we say new markets, we mean that we would want to target the under-served markets in Tier 4 or Tier 5 towns and cities. We will go deeper in these markets.

What is your outlook on branch expansion?

Right now, we are present across 16 states and two Union territories with 230 branches. We will continue to expand branches. IIFL Finance, which is the holding company, will set up 300 new branches in FY23.

How will the rate hikes impact demand for housing loans?

Rising interest rates will definitely have a negative impact on the demand. But at this point in time, demand has been very strong. There is pent-up demand. Interest rate hikes worth 50-to-100 basis points at this stage can be absorbed, but if they go up further by another 100 bps, there will be an impact on home loan demand; it will slow down. It is a function of two things — one, economic activity and second is the interest rates. One good thing is that housing prices, in nominal terms, have grown at a much slower pace in the last 20 years compared with the income. But I agree that if interest rates further go up, there will be some impact on demand.

By how much will home loan rates rise across the industry given that the rate hike cycle is expected to continue?

Currently, across the industry, home loan rates have gone up by 75-to-100 bps. These rates are for a period of one year and these are floating rates. I think the rate increases in the shorter end of the G-Sec yield curve will get passed on, and we may see rates rise by another 75-to-100 basis points at the industry level, assuming the rate hike cycle will continue for some time. If RBI is compelled to take more rate hikes, then housing demand, which is very robust, will see some moderation.

What is your outlook on interest rates?

Any guess at this point in time looks difficult. It will largely depend on the trajectory of crude oil prices, economic environment in developed countries and inflation.

How do you assess the impact of RBI’s rate hike on the affordable housing market?

This is a hugely under-penetrated market and I think the relative impact of rate hike will be less in the affordable housing segment. Since the loan amount is small, the rate hike can be absorbed. At the same time, we also have to see that our cost-to-income (ratio) should be efficient enough to absorb some of the cost. This segment is very large. Some of the housing finance companies that cater to this market have scaled back or wound up. So competitive intensity for this has reduced and the demand remains strong.

What would be the impact on your margins?

We won’t have much of an impact on our margins because we are able to pass on the rate hike to our customers. Almost the entire loan book is linked to external benchmarking or floating rate. We do not have a fixed rate for long-term loans. We normally do not lend for a very long term. If you lend for a long term, then you do not have the flexibility to increase the tenor. So, instead of increasing the EMI (equated monthly instalment), most lenders, most housing finance companies, tend to increase the tenor. This helps in repayment and collection.

Do you have any growth target for Assets under Management (AUM) in FY23?

It is difficult to make a forward-looking statement at this point. But, if the industry is growing at 15-to-20 percent, our AUM should be able to grow slightly faster than that.

How has asset quality panned out for IIFL Home Finance?

This quarter what has happened is that all the moratorium and restructuring that was offered is over. We are seeing that most customers have started to make the scheduled payments or else they are classified as delinquent or Non-Performing Assets (NPA).

What is the outlook on NPAs?

We expect asset quality trends to improve from here. Our NPA ratios will improve; after the third COVID wave, collections have also been improving. Our target is to bring down the gross NPA ratio to below 2 percent of our loan book in this financial year. We also aim to have more than 100 percent coverage on these. Home loan NPAs will be brought below 1 percent of our loan book in FY23; that is our target.

How will the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger impact smaller players in the industry?

Since it is a merger behemoth, we expect them to focus more on large, premium customers. They would probably look for co-lending or partnership arrangements for affordable loans or small ticket segments. So, it may not impact us much.",1100,0.6978207230567932
2022-06-09 09:09:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/exclusive-hdfc-bank-asks-parent-to-cut-exposure-to-certain-loans-before-merger-8661791.html,"India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank is said to have asked its parent Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) to cut exposure to a certain category of loans that are not permitted for banks under Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations.

These are mostly short-term loans that include certain corporate loans and loans to developers. It is estimated that the value of this chunk of loans will be around Rs 20,000-25,000 crore on HDFC's book at present, part of which will get extinguished over the next few quarters.

Even then, it is estimated that HDFC will have less than approximately Rs 10,000 crore such loans on its books prior to the merger.

“The bank has asked HDFC to pare down exposure to all such loans that aren’t compliant with RBI rules for banks. They have time to do it in the next 15 months or so before the merger take effect,” said a person familiar with the development.

The person declined to be named citing the sensitivity of the matter. HDFC Bank didn’t respond to a query from Moneycontrol on this issue.

HDFC and HDFC Bank announced the decision to merge on April 4. As per the plan, HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the merger.

HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh called it a merger of equals. Every 25 shares held by HDFC shareholders will fetch them 42 shares of the bank. The merger will create an entity that will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs 17.9 lakh crores.

The announcement came as a surprise to most analysts. Markets cheered the decision.

In an exclusive conversation with the media after the announcement, Parekh, the veteran banker who built the iconic mortgage lender over four decades, explained to Moneycontrol on April 5 why the company decided to merge with the bank and the challenges on culture integration.

HDFC is the largest mortgage lender in India, whereas HDFC Bank is the largest private lender in terms of assets. The bank, however, has only a relatively small presence in the housing loan market compared with rivals.

The HDFC-HDFC Bank merger is expected by the second or third quarter of FY24. HDFC too had said the proposed transaction will enable HDFC Bank to build its housing loan portfolio and enhance its customer base.

HDFC and HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour. But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders.

With the parent finally joining up with the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry.

HDFC is awaiting regulatory guidance on the path forward for its mega merger with HDFC Bank and needs shareholders’ trust and support “more than ever before” at this juncture, Parekh said in the company’s annual report.

“We have at length, already articulated the rationale for the proposed merger, which takes cognisance of the future growth potential of the country, the evolving macro environment and changes in the regulatory architecture,” he added.",553,0.06513407826423645

The country's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank on Tuesday announced a 0.35 percent hike in lending rate. The hike, which comes a day ahead of the RBI's scheduled policy review, is the second such move from the lender in as many months, taking the cumulative hike to up to 0.60 percent.

The RBI had surprised all with a 0.40 per cent hike in key interest rates on May 4 to tame the inflation situation and is widely expected to follow up with further tightening of the policy on Wednesday.

HDFC Bank increased its Marginal Cost of funding based Lending Rate by 0.35 percent from June 7, as per the new rate structure published on its website.

The one-year MCLR, on which a bulk of consumer loans are pegged, will be 7.85 percent after the newest review as against 7.50 percent earlier.

The overnight MCLR will be 7.50 percent against 7.15 percent, while the three-year MCLR will be 8.05 percent compared to 7.70 percent.

It can be noted that the rate hikes come at a time when credit growth is not very high and banks are keen to accelerate on the same. There have been hikes in deposit rates as well, which have preceded the lending rate hikes, along with the change in the policy environment.

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

Merger to meet regulatory ask, remain competitive; regulatory approval on deal structure could be a hurdle: HDFCL management has been vocal that the regulator has clearly indicated that large NBFCs/HFCs need to either operate with bank-like rules or convert into a bank, while housing business at a scale is best done now under a bank given their cost advantage (see Exhibit 11) and potential cross-selling benefits. That said, HDFCL shareholders’ may be apprehensive about selling housing/other businesses at valuations inclusive of holdco discount. For HDFCB, the merger of the housing portfolio could be RoE dilutive in the near term due to regulatory costs, but brings scale, security and higher portfolio tenure with better long-term RoEs, factoring in crossselling/leverage benefits. We believe the RBI may have reservations in approving the proposed merger deal structure with non-lending businesses (mainly insurance with current stakes >30%) under the bank, as it will challenge its longstanding stance to ring-fence banks and avoid regulatory overlap. Allowing NBFCs HDB Fin/HDFC Credila as subsidiaries under a bank could also be difficult given the RBI’s insistence to undertake lending business primarily under the bank.

Outlook

We reduce TP but maintain Buy as valuations remain comfortable; top-picks are ICICI, SBI: Based on the Gordon growth model for the merged entity and factoring in a slightly higher CoE, we work out fair value at 2.7x FY24E ABV for the merged bank (10% discount to FV basis merger overhang), or implied 3.0x ABV of standalone bank (pre-merger) vs. earlier 3.2x ABV of standalone bank. Add to that the subsidiaries' valuation of Rs172/share for the merged bank (Rs78 for standalone bank pre-merger), we arrive at a TP of Rs1800 (Rs1,950 earlier).

Updates from the two most valuable HDFC group companies, HDFC Ltd and HDFC Bank, about the status of foreign shareholding show there is plenty of room for investors to buy in.

Foreign investors held 68.56 percent in Housing Finance Development Corporation Ltd and 66.55 percent in HDFC Bank as on May 13, stock exchange notices showed. Further, the foreign institutional investor (FII) shareholding in HDFC Bank included 20.98 percent owned by HDFC Ltd and its units.

Both firms have been receiving queries from investors seeking information on their aggregate foreign shareholding.

HDFC Bank shares’ tepid performance over the past year had led the street to believe there was little room left for foreign investors, given that demand for the stock from this class of investors was strong compared with that from domestic investors. Foreign shareholding is capped at 74 percent for HDFC Bank.

The proposed merger between HDFC Bank and HDFC was expected to free up room for foreign investors to buy. Through the merger, every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of HDFC Bank for 25 shares they hold in the mortgage giant.

Post-merger, foreign shareholding in HDFC Bank is expected to be 66 percent and may dip further. Since the merger announcement, HDFC Bank and HDFC have fallen over 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively. In comparison, benchmarks Sensex and Nifty lost a little over 10 percent each over this period.

However, analysts believe the inclusion of the merged entity in the MSCI India index may be difficult, as it requires a larger FII headroom (from cap) for inclusion.

Analysts said based on the current methodologies being used for index construction, the weight of the merged entity could be 15 percent in the Nifty 50 and that in the MSCI India index could be very low, assuming no meaningful change in shareholding between now and the merger date. This would make it difficult for both domestic money managers (who are benchmarked to the Nifty) and foreign money managers who are benchmarked to MSCI.

HDFC has said that index providers (MSCI, FTSE) are reviewing the transaction especially in the context of the merger vis-a-vis consideration of combined entities as new entrants and may consider both free float percentage and free float value.",395,0.0017158091068267822

HDFC Bank on May 19 announced its plan to open 1,060 branches in the semi-urban and rural areas in this financial year, as the private lender aims to increase penetration of its rural banking network.

This move was taken by HDFC Bank to increase the reach of banking products to the hinterland. The initiative is a part of the bank's 'Future - Ready' project, the Rural Banking business to focus on semi-urban and rural areas, a large part of which remains untapped.

Head of National Rural Banking Business

Anil Bhavnani has been appointed National Rural Banking Head.

""We are excited to take the bank's world-class products and services to the remotest corner of India,"" said Anil Bhavnani, Sr Executive Vice President and National Rural Banking Head, HDFC Bank.

The Bank holds 50 percent of its 6,342 branches in semi-urban and rural areas, and the remaining 50 percent in metro and urban areas. The Bank also works with Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLE) of Common Service Centres (CSC) as an extension of the Bank's branches in far-flung areas.

""This is both a challenge and an opportunity and I am very excited to take this up. For many years now, the Bank had 50% of its branches in semi urban and rural areas. With this enhanced focus, we will open more branches this financial year in Semi-Urban and Rural areas. While branches are touchpoints, we are working on meeting rural needs holistically, by creating products specially designed for these markets,"" Bhavnani added.

In a strategic partnership, the bank has joined hands with the Institute of Rural Management, Anand, to create a 'Rural First' strategy by understanding evolving dynamics related to consumer behaviour, customer satisfaction, service design, and service delivery.

Additionally, the bank aims at expanding its distribution in rural areas. The Bank also aims to build new products and services related to rural transport, forest, Agri economy, and other allied activities.

Going ahead, the bank plans to expand the portfolio, the official said, adding that the impending entry of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in the space is not a cause for worry.

“What we have seen is the impact of Covid waves one and two. But since then, whether you track it by entry rates (customers going delinquent for the first time) or by early delinquency of new bookings, both of these look very much under control,” said Sanjeev Moghe, president and head, cards and payments at Axis Bank.

“We are confident that we can keep expanding scale without necessarily adding to incremental risk from here on. The book is very clean right now,” he added.

Indian banks have been aggressively chasing growth in the high-return but exposure-wise unsecured credit card business. Most banks have been upbeat about their credit card portfolios and are engaging in partnerships and tie-ups to add more customers. Axis Bank on March 30 had announced the acquisition of Citibank’s India consumer business for $1.6 billion in an all-cash deal.

On its part, HDFC Bank, after a good chunk of major market share in the credit card space due to a temporary ban on new digital offerings last year, has ramped up its business to gain market share.

Axis Bank is also confident its outstanding credit cards will be higher than what they were in the previous financial year, Moghe said.

The private lender had issued around 1.1 million credit cards in January-March, taking total card issuances in financial year 2022 to 2.7 million.

Axis Bank will continue to gain share in the merchant acquiring space and is also looking to launch some cards in partnership with other companies, Moghe said.

“We are looking at some co-branded credit cards. We launched one with Airtel in March, we have (another) one coming up this week,” Moghe said.

“Beyond that, there are discussions happening in the co-branded space. We will see those fructifying, but those will take six to 12 months,” he added. “Similarly, in the acquiring space, we are looking at a few things and will come by as we go through the year

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 21 announced new norms on credit and debit card issuance for 2022. The central bank said NBFCs with minimum net owned funds of Rs 100 crore can also issue credit cards provided they have a certificate of registration, apart from specific permission from the RBI to enter this business. The RBI also said that charges and interest rates on credit cards shall not be exorbitant and shall be connected with the cost incurred and reasonable expected returns.

The likelihood of NBFCs entering the credit card market will not lead to an incremental business disruption at Axis Bank, Moghe said.

“We are ready to face whatever competition we see in the market, whether it is from banks or NBFCs or fintechs,” he said. “I don’t see any incremental business disruption for Axis Bank.”

Although the impact of this circular on banks’ margins will be “marginal” going forward, it is unlikely to impact the long-term profitability of the banking sector, Moghe said.

In December 2020, the RBI had imposed restrictions on HDFC Bank after repeated outages at the lender's data centre. The restrictions barred HDFC Bank from launching any of the activities planned under its Digital 2.0 programme as well as the sourcing of new credit cards. The regulator revoked the ban completely in March.

When asked about the learnings for the bank from this debacle, Moghe said that Axis Bank continues to watch this space closely and is mindful that one cannot grow only when the competition takes a hit.

“We have put in investments in technology, we upgraded our cards platform some time back,” Moghe said.

“Whether it is the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) space or the cards space, we continue to invest in technology infrastructure. Having said that, we need to be very watchful about downtime incidents,” he added.",697,0.4526877318109785

This was after a top-level review meeting at HDFC Bank in May 2021 on the matter, according to persons in the know.

The persons quoted above declined to be named citing sensitivity of the matter. HDFC Bank declined to comment for this story.

In the May review meeting, the HDFC Bank management evaluated the potential benefits of the merger and decided to go ahead with the idea, one of the persons quoted above said. Also, in the meeting, it was assessed that the conditions for the merger are more conducive now compared to five years ago.

The May 2021 review meeting was held at the Worli corporate office of the bank and was attended by Managing Director Sashidhar Jagdishan and Chief Financial Officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan, said the person.

“After analysing a presentation on the potential benefits of the merger, the HDFC Bank top brass concluded that a merger will help the bank to capture the booming mortgage lending market,” the person added.

HDFC is the largest mortgage lender in India, whereas HDFC Bank is the largest private lender in terms of assets. The bank, however, has only a relatively small presence in the housing loan market compared with rivals.

“Regulatory conditions were also assessed including that of mandatory reserve requirements, priority sector lending and in terms of valuation,” said the second person quoted above.

After the proposal in November, the plan gained momentum in February 2022 when the bank again approached the parent seeking to speed up the process. Finally, the merger was announced on April 4.

As per the plan, HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger. Every 25 shares held by HDFC shareholders will fetch them 42 shares of the bank. The merger created an entity that will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs 17.9 lakh crore.

The timing of the announcement came as a surprise to most analysts.

Announcing the merger, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh had called it a merger of equals and attributed tight RBI regulations on non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) as a major reason for the merger.

In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol after the announcement, Parekh, the veteran banker who built the iconic mortgage lender over four decades, had said that it makes sense for the mortgage lender to merge with the bank considering the absence of any regulatory arbitrage for non-banks due to RBI tightening of rules.

In the conversation, Parekh elaborated on how the tight RBI regulations have impacted the NBFC industry. Parekh cited rules on NPA (non-performing assets) and liquidity coverage ratio as examples. Also, the cost of money for NBFCs is on the rise, he said.

“We had to have a larger base of resources with our growth. Indian debt market is not developed yet. For NBFCs to raise large sums of money is not easy and financial sector, home finance, home demand is increasing by leaps and bounds,” Parekh had said.

“So, we also have to be careful that we will be able to raise the resources we need for disbursements five years from now. See, today we are very comfortable, tomorrow we will be very comfortable, two years later we are very comfortable but what about the future as the business keeps growing? Housing demand is not going to stop in India for next 50 years,” he added.

The HDFC-HDFC Bank merger is expected to be completed by the second or third quarter of FY24. HDFC too had said the proposed transaction will enable HDFC Bank to build its housing loan portfolio and enhance its customer base.

HDFC and HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour. But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders.

With the parent finally merging the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry.

The RBI has been encouraging large NBFCs to convert into banks, after the shadow lending space was shaken by the IL&FS crisis in 2018.",744,0.988797128200531

The country's largest lender, HDFC Bank, has sought the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s permission to retain all its subsidiaries and those of parent HDFC Ltd in the current form after their merger takes effect, according to people familiar with the development.

However, the banking regulator has expressed some concerns on the nature of businesses done by two subsidiaries - HDFC Credila and HDB Financial Services - since these are businesses that can be done within the bank.

Credila is a subsidiary of HDFC Ltd, while HDB Financial is under the bank. Credila is in the business of education loans, while HDB Financial is primarily engaged in personal loans, business loans and auto loans.

If the RBI doesn’t permit the bank to retain these two subsidiaries, the bank will seek a glide path from the regulator to pare down stake in HDFC Credila and HDB Financial Services, one of the people quoted above said. These holdings will be then monetised to reinvest in other businesses that are allowed by the regulator, the person said.

The sources declined to be named, citing the sensitivity of the matter. HDFC Bank declined to comment for this story.

To be sure, the RBI is yet to give a final opinion on the matter.

HDFC twins have close to a dozen subsidiaries, including HDFC Credila and HDB Financial Services, that are in the lending business. Other subsidiaries of HDFC include HDFC Life, HDFC Pension, HDFC Mutual Fund, HDFC ergo, HDFC Property Fund and HDFC Edu.

Bank may get a glide path

According to the people quoted above, the RBI is not averse to giving HDFC Bank a glide path to pare holding in Credila and HDB Financial after the merger if the regulator concludes that continuation of these two units in the current form is not possible, said the second person quoted above.

The glide path will apply to only those subsidiaries where the bank cannot continue business, said the person quoted above.

“The RBI will give the bank a direction and the bank is open - whether it is Credila or HDB - to monetise stake over a period of time. Both will have the same kind of issue,” the person said.

However, given a choice, HDFC Bank is keen to continue with all subsidiaries as it is, the person added. This has been communicated to the regulator.

“If they (RBI) say continue, the bank will continue, if they say don’t continue, they will give a glide path. The bank will pare it down. All other subsidiaries they are okay to keep below the bank,"" the person said.

Level playing field sought

As for other subsidiaries, which are not directly into the bank’s business, such as mutual fund and insurance subsidiaries, the bank will seek a level playing field with the regulator, said one of the persons quoted above.

HDFC Bank’s rivals, including State Bank of India, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, are allowed to keep insurance and asset management subsidiaries below the bank. HDFC Bank may cite these cases as example to make a case to retain other subsidiaries in insurance and asset management etc.

On April 4, Housing Development Finance Corporation and HDFC Bank announced a mega merger ending speculations that stretched over years.

As per the plan, HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger. Every 25 shares held by HDFC shareholders will fetch them 42 shares of the bank. The merger created an entity that will have a market-cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs 17.9 lakh crore. It will take around 15-18 months for HDFC group to get all necessary regulatory approvals for the merger.

In an exclusive conversation with the media after the announcement, Deepak Parekh, the veteran banker who built the iconic mortgage lender over four decades, spoke to Moneycontrol on April 5 where he explained why the company decided to merge with the bank now and what are the challenges ahead on culture integration.

Parekh said one of the reasons why HDFC chose to merge with the bank was increasingly tighter RBI regulations on the NBFC sector which has largely eliminated the regulatory arbitrage available to such companies earlier. Also, it is not easy for NBFCs to raise large sums of money for business, Parekh said. Hence, it made sense at this juncture for HDFC to merge with the bank, Parekh added.",748,-0.9999868869781494

Mortgage lender HDFC increased its Retail Prime Lending Rate (RPLR) on housing loans, on which its Adjustable Rate Home Loans (ARHL) are benchmarked by 5 basis points, the company said in an exchange filing on May 1.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) had last month said its board has approved the merger of its wholly owned subsidiaries HDFC Investments Limited and HDFC Holdings Limited with HDFC Bank Limited.

A host of large banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), hiked their marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5-10 basis points last month. After the RPLR hike, HDFC’s adjustable-rate home loans for customers with a credit score of above 750 will now be 6.75 percent as against 6.7 percent earlier.

For loans of up to Rs 30 lakh, customers would be charged an interest rate of 6.85 percent. Loans ranging between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 75 lakh will have an interest rate of 7.10, and those above Rs 75 lakh will have an interest rate of 7.20 per cent. For women customers in all segments, the interest rate is 5 basis points lower, according to a report by Business Standard.

Adjustable-rate home loan (ARHL) is also known as a floating or a variable rate loan. The interest rate in an ARHL is linked to HDFC’s benchmark rate i.e, RPLR, and any movement in HDFC’s RPLR may effectuate a change in the applicable interest rates.

SBI has raised its MCLR by 10 basis points, with effect from April 15, across all tenors (100 bps = 1 percentage point). The one-year MCLR has been revised to 7.1 percent while two- and three-year MCLRs have been raised to 7.3 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively.

The MCLR is a benchmark interest rate, which is the minimum rate at which banks are allowed to lend. Most loans are linked to the one-year MCLR.

Bank, the third-largest private-sector lender in the country, and Kotak Mahindra Bank hiked their MCLR by 5 basis points. While Kotak Mahindra Bank increased its one-year MCLR to 7.4 percent, from April 16, public sector lender Bank of Baroda increased its MCLR by 5 basis points from April 12.

The increase in lending rates comes after the Reserve Bank of India’s hawkish stance in the recently concluded monetary policy meeting last month as it turned its focus to tackle inflation from supporting growth.

Due to the ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance and excess liquidity in the system for the last two years, interest rates are at an all-time low with many lenders offering mortgage loans as low as 6.5 percent.",441,

Union Bank of India became the first public sector bank to go live on the Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem, the bank said on April 29.

Touted as the UPI moment for lending, the AA framework ensures swift data sharing with the consent of the user and eliminates the need for physical documents.

Since it went live in September 2021, 332,000 customer accounts have been linked and over 310,000 consent requests have been fulfilled.

The framework facilitates sharing of financial information on a real-time basis between regulated entities. AAs are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs).

FIPs are institutions that hold customer data and FIUs are entities that consume data to offer better service, underwrite loans, and so on. Banks and other financial institutions must become FIPs to be able to also become users of data from other financial institutions.

An AA is data blind and only receives encrypted data which is decrypted only by the FIU.

Union Bank of India has said that it will work both as an FIU and FIP to allow its customers to share data digitally on a real-time basis.

Major private sector banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are already live as FIPs and FIUs. There are 34 banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and other institutions so far live on AA, including Federal Bank, IDFC First Bank and IndusInd Bank.

Moneycontrol had reported on January 17 that the next step for the ecosystem is to grow the number of FIPs and get more banks to go live, mainly the State Bank of India (SBI) which has the largest share of accounts in India.

As per information on the website of Sahamati, a not-for-profit self-organised collective for the AA ecosystem, SBI is in the testing mode.

The ecosystem is also working on linking accounts of Small and Medium Enterprises as only individual current and savings accounts are linked currently. Insurers are working on integrating too and the next step will be to get mutual funds on board.

Do you think most of the bad news is now digested? Is it becoming a buy-on-dips market?

I don't think the market has fully discounted the macros yet because the market has not fallen a lot. The market is down less than 2-3 percent year to date. Major issues like inflation, COVID-19 and the Ukraine war still persist. The Indian public is a bit over-excited.

The account aggregator (AA) ecosystem, introduced in September 2021, can ensure better security and stronger protection of banking data while enhancing customers’ experience, say experts. Nine private banks including, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and IndusInd Bank went live on the AA system last year and five public sector banks will join this year.

The AA network is a financial data-sharing system regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). One of its main features is that data cannot be shared without the consent of the individual concerned.

The finance ministry in the first week of September 2021 said eight of India’s largest banks had introduced the system, even though its concept was approved by the RBI in 2016 itself.

Better user experience

The government when introducing it said the AA system was aimed at helping individuals securely and digitally access the information they have with a financial institution as well as share this information with any other regulated financial institution within the AA network. Banks that have implemented the system say the network has been built with the customer at the center. It empowers customers to effectively manage their data.

“They have the power to decide with whom their data can be shared, for what purpose it can be used, and for what duration it can be retained,” said Deepak Sharma, president and chief digital officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank.

At its launch, the government said the AA system replaces the complex ‘terms and conditions’ form of ‘blank cheque’ acceptance with granular, step-by-step permissions and control each time the customer’s data is used.

“In a regular scenario, there is significant effort involved, wherein the customer has to share their banking data with another bank/financial institution using hard copies or PDF documents. However, with the AA framework, it is very easy for customers to share information either one time or on an ongoing basis for a defined period of time,” said Sameer Shetty, president, and head, of digital business and transformation, Axis Bank.

Moreover, as pointed out by various lenders, the system makes things easier for customers, eliminating duplication and paperwork to offer seamless information to banks.

“The ease of on-boarding and managing consent by customers will ensure large-scale adoption in every nook and corner of the country,” said Murali Ramakrishnan, MD and CEO, South Indian Bank.

Enhanced encryption of users’ data

The system aims to create a third-party trusted source of information that allows seamless data flow between all players, say experts. “In various cases, once customers’ data is shared with a bank for one purpose, it gets circulated among other departments too. For example, if a customer shares her/his data for a housing loan, it might happen that the vehicle loan department may get access to it. But the AA system prohibits that,” said Nageen Kommu, founder and CEO, Digitap, a tech company providing AI-driven solutions for the banking industry.

Customers can choose which department their data will be shared with and the system minimises the chance of data sharing even within various departments of the same bank. “The system enables customers to offer authentic information in a controlled and managed environment to all the players in the ecosystem, including banks,” said Kunal Jhunjhunwala, founder and MD, Airpay, a payment gateway for banks.

It helps customers take real-time lending decisions in multi-bank personal finance management (PFM) and maintain a consolidated financial dashboard while also enabling wealth assessment and planning, all the while ensuring encryption.

“AA handles the consent management part on behalf of the customer and the data is exchanged only between financial information users (FIU) and financial information providers ensuring that only the right FIU receives the data,” said Sharma.

The privacy aspect is well taken care of by the regulator requiring customer consent. This can pave the road to full-fledged open banking in India going forward, according to Ramakrishnan.

What next?

Although widely accepted in the banking sector, several experts asserted that there is still room for improvement for the system. Banks already part of the AA system said more banks joining it will strengthen it further. “In future, the addition of GST (goods and services tax), PF (provident fund) and utility bills information in the AA framework will make it truly transformational,” added Shetty.",773,0.9417463958263397

Shares of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India’s largest mortgage lender, and HDFC Bank have slumped close to 15 percent each after the initial euphoria over their merger announcement on April 4.

HDFC vice-chairman and managing director Keki Mistry spoke with CNBC-TV18 on what the merger means for customers, about concerns emerging over post-merger synergies, particularly in the distribution of housing loans, and also on cross-selling opportunities for HDFC Bank.

The recent selling of shares by investors is due to a lack of communication between management and investors. The deal will be EPS (earnings per share)- accretive from day 1, Mistry said.

Edited excerpts:

The whole discussion around the proposed merger has been from the shareholders' point of view. What would be the impact of the merger on HDFC and HDFC Bank, fund raising?

Now, we will not be borrowing money as a housing finance company. We would be getting money through savings, current accounts and deposits like other banks. So, the cost of funding should come down.

Secondly, we will have the full HDFC Bank platform to distribute housing loans. Today, as you look at it, HDFC Bank does not source housing loans. Ones that do the sourcing of loans for us take about 27% of our business. In half of the places, HDFC does not have a presence in a nearby location. Ideally, we would like to have our offices in a nearby location to meet the customer. In case there is a delay in making payments, we can also contact the customer. So, when we become one entity, the full array of banking branches will be available to us for distribution (of housing loans). The shareholders of the bank will have our 40 years of experience in the mortgage business, which is time-tested and which is reflected in the fact that despite showing growth year after year, our asset quality in retail loans is impeccable. right from the time of the total money losses when we write off individual retail loans. It is less than 2 bps (basis points) of our total business bps. This is cumulative. In a period of 40 years.

Will the merger lead to potentially selling non-housing loans to your HDFC customers?

In terms of our ability to cross-sell, if we look at our customer base, 70% of our customers do not bank with HDFC Bank. These customers have a good association with HDFC because we help them buy a house, which is like the single largest possession. If we go back to these customers and say we are now one entity and ask them to shift their banking needs to HDFC Bank, we will get assistance on it.

Why is there selling pressure on your stocks? What is the feedback that you have received from your discussion with foreign shareholders?

The only reason we think there is selling is because we were not being able to communicate some of these (facts) to our investors after the Board meeting. This is one reason. Another reason is mass-scale foreign selling. Both HDFC and HDFC Bank are extremely liquid counters. Foreign investors are pulling out from emerging markets either due to higher interest rates in the US market or the Russia-Ukraine (war) impact. But the investors we talked to have not expressed any real concern over this (merger). As things get clearer with the passage of time, the stocks will move up logically.

The proposed merger will lead to higher CRR (cash reserve ratio) and SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) requirements. What concessions have you sought from the regulator in meeting the requirements?

We spoke with regulators. We sought some degree of forbearance to create this CRR, SLR and PSL (priority sector lending) over a period of three years. We are awaiting a response from the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) on the matter. We will work through it. We do not believe the regulatory process would impact the synergies that we are gaining and the synergies will more than offset any regulatory cost.

The proposed merger will see the housing book increase to one-third of the bank's book. Hence, there is a feeling that this may lead to a drag on the net interest margins while the operational costs will also increase for the bank if they open more branches. What is your view on the margin pressures that could kick in? Could the return ratios as well drag post the merger?

Why would the net interest margin reduce? HDFC today, as a mortgage company at a higher cost of funding, had a net interest margin in the last quarter at 3.5%. The bank's net interest margin is 4%. When we migrate from a largely wholesale funding structure to a more banking structure, the reduction in the cost of funds logically has to be much more than 50 bps. If it is more than 50 bps, logically it will happen, then automatically the 3.5% net interest margin we are having would be well over 4%...I don't see any drag on the net interest margin beyond an immediate couple of quarters. As far as earnings per share are concerned, it will be EPS-accretive from day one. The combined profitability of the two entities should be more than the standalone profits of HDFC Bank and HDFC as separate entities. The number of shares would come down by the virtue of the fact that the 21% shareholding of HDFC in the bank will get cancelled. So, it will be EPS-accretive from day one.

Analysts say the merger move works well for HDFC shareholders and not as well for HDFC Bank shareholders. What is your take?

HDFC Bank does not have a mortgage product. All banks today have mortgage products. Despite all other banks having mortgage products, HDFC Bank grew its individual loan book by as much as 16% in the December (quarter) period. Housing loans in the banking system are under 10% (of total lending). So, despite the fact that we don't have a banking structure, despite the fact that bank did not source housing loans from different locations, we gained market share in that period. So, imagine when all the branches of HDFC Bank start sourcing loans for us, the quantum of housing loans the bank generates will logically increase. That will be a huge benefit to the bank. Also, the fact that the housing loan book carries longer maturity enhances the overall maturity of loans for the bank and the overall duration of assets of the bank…The benefit of the lower cost structure will move on to the bank. There are enough synergies for the shareholders of HDFC Bank.​",1122,-0.01171834021806717

Saurabh Mukherjea, chief investment officer (CIO), Marcellus Investment Managers, spoke on concerns emerging around the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger, about the sharp fall in the shares of HDFC twins, underperformers Nestle & Asian Paints, and on margins coming down in the Q4 for the consumption companies.

Dismissing concerns around the growth outlook for HDFC Bank going forward, Saurabh Mukherjea, speaking in an interview with CNBC-TV18, did not slash the earnings growth estimates going forward, and said the stock will continue to give high premiums for investors in the long term.

On being asked over some concerns regarding the weakness in HDFC twins after the merger announcement, Mukherjea said HDFC Bank was an outperformer in the private banking space in the last five years.

The analyst believed the stock price movement is momentary and the superior asset quality will keep the returns intact for investors.

Outlining his reason for this outlook, he stated he was positive about HDFC Bank with a long-term view. Mukherjea further said HDFC Bank could deliver around 20 percent, from a long-term perspective.

Mukherjea, reacting to a question on HDFC Bank and HDFC stocks witnessing sell off recently in the run up to the merger, said, ""Last five years have been spectacular. They have just blazed away. 20 percent loan book compounding and 20 percent deposits compounding.”

He also believed no other bank remotely matches up to HDFC Bank.

The analyst said, "" No other bank in the private space has been able to compete with HDFC Bank on both sides of the balance sheet. On gross and net NPAs also, no other private sector bank is even close to HDFC Bank. If HDFC's 2 percent ROA is seen, it is difficult to see any other with 2 percent ROA. If we look at the performance of HDFC Bank in the last 15 years, it is in a completely different league. Even in the last 3 years, no other bank came close to such performance.""

On being questioned again over pre-provisioning operating profits of HDFC Bank slightly looking weaker, Mukherjea said, ""We have to back companies which have delivered through decades in a stellar fashion. So, we back such companies which give 20-25 percent returns on our clients' investments.""

Coming out in defence of the merger, Mukherjea said, ""The merger will bring two very profitable businesses together. We will see their ROEs exceed and growth reaching high.""

The market expert added, ""Currently, HDFC Bank's mortgage runs on HDFC, so HDFC Bank's growth is reduced. When HDFC Bank holds on to mortgages, it will accelerate.""

Since their merger announcement on April 4, shares of HDFC Bank and HDFC tanked close to 15 percent each.

HDFC Bank, the largest private sector lender in India, on April 16 reported a 23 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone net profit at Rs 10,055.2 crore for the quarter ended March 2022 as bad loans provisions declined 29 percent, with further improvement in asset quality. But the lender’s operating performance showed spots of trouble. Operating profit growth was just 10.2 percent for the quarter and the net interest margin was at a record low.

The analyst stated the succession plan for HDFC Bank was taken care of, when asked whether the new leadership will continue to produce the kind of results it gave and if there is a reason to worry.

Dismissing such concerns, the market expert said, ""We have closely monitored the succession planning. Shashi was mentored and trained by the erstwhile CEO. The operating metrics from the time Sahshi took charge are stellar. They are growing at a fast pace. Delivery impeccable on asset quality and growth. I give 10/10 to Sahshi.""

Mukherjea is also extremely bullish on Nestle India and Asian Paints.

The expert termed both the stocks which are market-leading franchises have been compounding consistently, and added, slight margin pressures witnessed by Nestle India do not add any material value.

He said, ""Nestle's share price compounded around 25 percent in the last five years. Profits compounded to 22-23 percent. It is obviously a dominant player in its category. There is food cost pressure. It utterly dominates the category that is a compulsory purchase.""

Mukherjea, reacting to the performance of Asian Paints in the stock market, said margin pressures of the company should not be a concern for long-term investors.

""Whenever crude doubles over a two-year period, Asian Paints' operating gross margins are solid. This results in the share rallying. Share price of Asian Paints in the last 12 months compounded. It has gained rapidly in the last 4-5 years,"" said Mukherjea.

The expert noted rising raw material costs and inflation have acted as a dampener for both the business companies.

Nestle India on April 21 reported a 1.3 percent decline in its net profit to Rs 594.7 crore for the quarter ended March, which came in below Street expectations of Rs 625 crore. It registered a 10.2 percent growth in revenues from operations to Rs 4,002.14 crore.

ICICI Bank’s share price has been on fire for the past one year, raking in gains of over 30 percent.

Strong investor interest has helped the lender topple rival HDFC Bank as an expensive stock in what some analysts would call a “crowded trade,” which means a position or theme embraced by a large number of investors.

On a 12-month trailing basis, ICICI Bank shares traded at 3.3 times the book value on April 20 compared with HDFC Bank’s multiple of 3 times.

Sure, the gap isn’t much and there is a long way to go in terms of market capitalisation. HDFC Bank’s market cap stands at Rs 7.5 lakh crore while that of ICICI Bank is Rs 5.25 lakh crore. However, it is noteworthy that ICICI Bank’s shares have crossed that of its rival for the first time in terms of a key valuation multiple.



Why do investors love ICICI Bank so much?

The private sector lender has cleaned up its balance sheet, increased provisioning cover for stressed loans, and turned its corporate-heavy loan portfolio into a retail-dominated one.

Its provision coverage ratio stood at 80 percent as of the December quarter of FY22, the highest in the sector. The ratio was a mere 54 percent five years ago.

Notwithstanding the pandemic, the lender reported robust net interest income growth in FY21 and in the first three quarters of FY22. This supported operating profit growth. Its net profit growth has shed the volatility of earlier years, credit costs have dropped and return on equity has improved sharply. Free of its stressed corporate book, ICICI Bank’s loan growth has been robust.

Another factor favouring ICICI Bank is the fading away of misgivings over its top management and corporate governance. The bank was mired in controversy when its head Chanda Kochhar was alleged to have circumvented conflict of interest norms. She stepped down in October 2018 and her successor Sandeep Bakhshi has steered the bank out of the trouble. The top management transition pain and misgivings over the bank’s governance are now behind it.

Investor confidence in the bank’s earnings trajectory remains high. For FY22, analysts expect return on equity to increase to 15 percent and improve further in the coming financial years. The upshot is that earnings growth is expected to trump that of HDFC Bank and profitability metrics look supportive of premium valuations.

“ICICI Bank appears firmly placed to deliver healthy sustainable growth, led by its focus on core operating performance. We estimate an RoA/RoE of 2.0%/16.5% for FY24,” analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

Will ICICI Bank continue to outperform the market and HDFC Bank?

Given the outsized gains in the share price over the past year, analysts note that the margin of outperformance may narrow now. Even so, the lender’s stock will still find enough support among investors despite premium valuations.

“There has been a significant outperformance of Axis Bank/ICICI Bank over HDFC Bank but there still appears to be room for further outperformance,” analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note dated April 16.

Another factor in support of ICICI Bank shares is that rivals HDFC Bank and Axis Bank are poised for merger and acquisition costs, respectively. HDFC Bank needs to implement its merger with Housing Development Finance Corporation, while Axis Bank has to absorb Citibank India’s retail business that it acquired. Both transactions could be a significant overhang for their respective shares.",580,0.660384605328242

Sharing his thoughts on the recent underperformance of marquee bluechips, Tibrewal said that it's a good time to have some overweight on large caps now and start selectively deploying over the six months on some of these blue-chip names. Edited excerpts:

How to wade through the recent market volatility?

Since the start of the year, our thought has been that this year will be a year of consolidation and capital protection. There are too many headwinds that are in front of us. First is earnings, earning support to the market will be limited due to huge margin compression. From September 2020, the sharp rally was led by very strong earnings growth.

Second, interest rates will weigh in on equity valuation.

The third reason is commodity inflation. Increasing odds of global shock if commodity prices stay inflated. Inflated prices will also weigh on demand.

How to read the recent underperformance of marquee bluechip names like HDFC twins?

Many of the large names are becoming attractive on valuation. Though there is a near-term concern about FIIs selling. Somewhere it is coming to a level where we have seen a rebound happening. Whenever the FIIs selling stops, abates or resumes again, these blue-chip names have a lot of value now.

Are markets under-invested in coal, oil and gas stocks?

The world is realising that from a medium to long-term perspective, ESG concerns on the environment are valid. But for that, we need to pay price in the short term. The elevated commodity price is not because of very strong demand, but because of supply-side issues.

In the last five years, the oil and gas sector has not seen investments that are worth talking about. No new discoveries are weighing on when demand starts to recover.

In the near term, the commodity prices may remain more inflated than we all desire because of supply-side issues. In the medium to long term, the other sources will catch up.

What's your outlook on defence stocks?

We are positive on the entire capital goods space and defence is one part. With geopolitical tensions rampaging across the globe, all countries are looking to strengthen their defence sector. China and Germany are some examples. India is also realising that we need to be more ""aatmnirbhar"" on the defence side. The traction in this space is unprecedented.

Talk of the US Federal Reserve going in for tapering quicker than expected and geopolitical tensions around Russia warning Sweden and Finland against NATO membership also had investors worried.

At close, the Sensex settled 1.23 percent lower at 56,463 points, while the Nifty fell 1.25 percent to 16,958 points. Both benchmarks have now declined for eight of nine trading sessions, shedding over 7 percent each. Investors lost Rs 10 lakh crore in market value over this period.

“Intensification of geopolitical tension and hyperinflation as crude and metal price rise worried the market.

Analysts say the world continues to witness the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war. Over the near term, issues arising from disruptions due to the conflict and sanctions on Russian products would have high negative bearing on global and Indian equities

Here are some of the factors for the falling markets:

1 Worsening Russia-Ukraine war

Russia on April 19 called on Ukrainian forces to “immediately lay down arms” and issued a new ultimatum for the defenders of the besieged port city of Mariupol to give up their resistance.

Russia’s military shelled southern and eastern Ukraine overnight, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying Moscow had launched a new campaign focused on conquering the eastern Donbas region. US President Joe Biden will hold a call with key allies later in the day to discuss the situation in Ukraine. The meeting comes amid efforts to coordinate supplies of heavy weapons to Kyiv as it prepares to counter Russia’s push in the east.

2 FPI selling continues

After a brief respite, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have begun selling in Indian markets, adding to volatility. FIIs sold around $2 billion in equities in the last six sessions amid expected tightening of policy by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on surging inflation.

The RBI in its recent bimonthly policy raised the annual inflation forecast to 5.7 percent from 4.5 percent, which analysts say indicates a rate hike in coming months.

3 Infosys, HDFC Bank’s poor performance

Weak earnings from Infosys and HDFC Bank have spooked markets, analysts said. Infosys’ margins were down 193 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) 21.6 percent. Following this, many brokerages have downgraded expectations with Jefferies India cutting Infosys’ margin estimates by 100-170 bps, pegging it at 21.9 percent in FY22. Nomura Research expects FY23F EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin to drop 100 bps year-on-year (y-o-y) to 22 percent and FY22-24 earnings per share by 5-7 percent primarily on our lower margin expectations.

HDFC Bank and HDFC Ltd have been under pressure for the past few sessions. Both stocks surged over 10 percent after news of the merger of the two companies but have since erased all gains on expectations that the merger will not address investor concerns over slowing growth and declining margins.

Analysts believe post-merger, loan growth will likely slow and be a lot more dependent on economic conditions, and that the ability to distinctly deliver superior loan growth would be challenging.

Despite strong loan growth (21 percent y-o-y), HDFC Bank reported an operationally weak set of numbers with historic low core net interest margin (4.0 percent), muted net interest income growth and multi-years low pre-provision operating profit growth (at 5 percent y-o-y).

4 Fed’s expected aggressive stance

The Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis president James Bullard said the US central bank needs to move quickly to raise interest rates to around 3.5 percent this year, with multiple half-point hikes and that it shouldn’t rule out rate increases of 75 bps.

Fed chair Jerome Powell has said a 50-bps increase is possible at the Fed’s May 3-4 meeting. Comments by his colleagues since have hardened expectations that they’ll make that move, as officials extend a hawkish pivot to curb the hottest inflation since 1981.

5 World Bank cuts global growth

Global markets were under pressure also because the World Bank cut its forecast for global economic expansion this year on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and is planning to mobilise a funding package bigger than the Covid-19 response for nations to deal with various resulting and ongoing crises.

The Washington-based institution has lowered its estimate for global growth in 2022 to 3.2 percent from a January prediction of 4.1 percent.

India’s largest housing finance company HDFC Ltd was on April 19 knocked out of the country’s 10 most-valued companies in terms of market capitalisation after its shares slumped nearly 19 percent in the last two weeks.

HDFC now ranks at the eleventh spot. The top 10 most valued firms of India's are Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, Infosys Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Adani Green Energy Ltd, State Bank of India, Bharti Airtel and Bajaj Finance Ltd.

Shares of HDFC have fallen 12.24 percent over the past one year as against 20 percent rise in the Nifty 50 index. HDFC Bank was down 3 percent in this period.

The steep decline in HDFC shares continued despite the announcement of a mega merger with its banking subsidiary HDFC Bank. On April 4, HDFC announced that it will merge operations with HDFC Bank. The share exchange ratio was at 42 equity shares of HDFC Bank for every 25 shares of HDFC Ltd.

Both HDFC and HDFC Bank surged over 10 percent after the merger announcement. However, they have since erased all the gains on the expectations that the merger will not address investor concern over slowing growth and declining margins.

The HDFC stock declined nearly 19 percent since the April 4 announcement, wiping off more than Rs 90,000 crore in market capitalisation. HDFC Bank shares too suffered a similar fall with investors left poorer by over Rs 1.66 lakh crore.

Analysts believe that after the merger, loan growth is likely to be slower and will be a lot more dependent on the economic conditions and the ability to distinctly deliver superior loan growth would be a challenge.

""Key risks are slower-than-expected credit growth amid weakening macros due to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, further softness in margins due to slower retail credit growth/regulatory buffer built-up in the run-up to the merger, and delay in getting regulatory approval for the proposed merger,"" said Emkay Research in a note to investors.

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, the near-term outlook would be to manage the liability transition. The bank would see a shift in its liability structure and the funding of this would be quite critical to understand near-term margins. It is unclear if the current structure would be approved, given that the bank would have a significant stake in non-banking subsidiaries.

Return on equity is likely to dilute marginally for the merged entity, given the differences in return ratios. Also, there would be an impact due to regulatory requirements, analysts said.

Further, the selling in HDFC shares have been driven by foreign portfolio investors who have been diluting their stakes in bank and non-bank lenders over the past six months.

At 11.45am, shares of HDFC were down 3.5 percent at Rs 2,186 on the National Stock Exchange.",478,-0.7497771754860878

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

Despite sector-leading credit growth (~21% yoy), HDFCB reported a slight miss on PAT at Rs100bn (est.: Rs103bn) due to continued weak core profitability (up 10% yoy), which was dragged by weak margins/fees and additional contingent provisions of Rs10bn. Asset quality trended well, with GNPA ratio down 9bps qoq to 1.2%; for HDB Fin, it was down by 200bps qoq to 5%. Retail credit growth (15% yoy/4% qoq) lagged overall credit growth (21% yoy/9% qoq on corporate/commercial credit growth), with the share of retail down to 45%, thus weighing on core margins (~4.1-4.2% down from 4.2-4.3% range). Management argues that the focus is on risk-adjusted margins, which have improved qoq to 3.5% from 3.1%. It expects retail growth to improve, driven by unsecured loans, providing some support to margins. However, we believe that the rising share of mortgages/higher fixed-rate loan book could keep margins in check in the near term.



Outlook

We expect pro forma average RoE for HDFCB (merged) at ~16.6% over FY24-25E, which will still be reasonable vs. large peers. Retain long-term Buy on the stock given recent correction, with it trading at 2.4x standalone FY24E ABV (stripping subs value of Rs78 per share).

LKP Research's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank reported a strong trend on assets quality and moderate operating performance in 4QFY22. The slippages decreased 13% sequentially, which resulted in improvement in GNPA ratio to 1.17% v/s 1.17% in the previous quarter. The reported GNPA is well below the historical trend of 1.4%. Moreover, the restructuring book decreased to ~115bps of overall loan v/s 136bps in the previous quarter; Secured loans contributes ~30% of restructured book. Furthermore, the contingent stands adequate. In 4QFY22, the provisioning expenses were slightly higher sequentially at ₹33bn (v/s ₹30bn 3QFY22), which includes contingent provision buildup of ₹10bn. At the same time NII growth was slower (10% YoY, 2% QoQ) against the loan growth (21% YoY, 9% QoQ) Thus, the bank has reported sequential decrease in PAT by 3% and ROA/ROE of 2.1%/16.8% v/s 2.2%/18.0% in the previous quarter. However, the management emphasized the slower NII growth will be compensated by lower specific provisioning expenses. We believe, superior underwriting practices, higher liquidity, adequate coverage and strong capital position makes the bank best in class and thus, we recommend BUY.



Outlook

HDFC Bank is expected to outperform the sector led by 1) healthy balance sheet growth, 2) much higher provision than regulatory requirement in the balance sheet, 3) strong capital cushion of 17.9% at Tier1 level and d) best in class underwriting and risk management practices. Given these strengths we expect HDFC Bank to remain one of the best among all the lending business. Thus, we continue to maintain BUY rating on the bank with target price of ₹1,831.

Indian state-run and private banks are likely to tap the debt market to raise capital in the coming months, before the central bank embarks on its rate-hike cycle, top analysts and bankers told Moneycontrol on April 18. Among the banks that plan to hit markets for funds are ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and some large state-owned banks, according to people familiar with the development.

Banks are charting out their fund-raising plans in anticipation of a hardening corporate bond yield curve as rising inflation worries could prompt the Reserve Bank of India to hike the key repo rate by 25 basis points in the Monetary Policy Committee’s next policy in June. The repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends short-term funds to banks.

Inflation, measured by retail prices, escalated to a 17-month high of 6.95 percent in March from 6.07 percent in February, driven by high food prices. Market participants anticipate a hardening corporate bond yield curve as rising inflation worries could prompt the RBI to hike the key repo rate by 25 basis points in June.

“What we are likely to witness is an increase in banks’ fundraising in the next few months, before the RBI’s policy,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.

“Moreover, banks are likely to refinance their earlier borrowings in the coming months. A few banks, including Canara Bank and Union Bank, issued perpetual bonds before March to capture the lower interest rates and are likely to continue this fiscal year too, besides other large state-owned banks,” Venkatakrishnan added.

In the April round of the monetary policy review, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had kept the key repo rate steady at 4 percent for the 11th straight time, but had flagged worries over rising inflation. Economists expect retail inflation to stay over the RBI’s tolerance band in the coming months, assuming energy prices remain elevated due to the Russia-Ukraine war. The MPC’s next policy decision is due on June 8.

Early movers

Before the April policy, many banks had already started fundraising assuming a rising interest-rate scenario. For instance, in March, state-run Indian Overseas Bank raised Rs 665 crore by issuing 10-year Basel III compliant Tier II bonds at a coupon of 8.60 percent, according to dealers.

UCO Bank, too, raised Rs 100 crore last month via a similar bond issue at a coupon rate of 8.51 percent. Karnataka Bank sold its 10-year Basel III compliant Tier II bonds at a coupon rate of 10.70 percent last month, dealers added. This is at a premium compared with the 10-year government bond, which currently yields 7.23 percent.

Some banks have already received their boards’ approval for fund raising. On April 16, for instance, HDFC Bank’s board approved a fund-raise of Rs 50,000 crore via bonds. In March, Punjab National Bank’s board had approved raising capital via the issue of Basel III-compliant additional Tier I bonds up to Rs 5,500 crore and Tier II bonds up to Rs 6,500 crore, in one or more tranches.

“The market has already begun to discount a 25-basis-point rate hike by the RBI in the June policy review, and if this happens we are expecting the corporate bond yield curve to harden at least 25 basis points further,” said Ritesh Bhusari, Deputy General Manager, Treasury, at South Indian Bank. “We expect the pain in the corporate bond market to accentuate from here.”

According to Anil Gupta, Vice President & Co-Group Head, Financial Sector Ratings, at rating agency ICRA, as bond yields rise and as the RBI sucks out surplus liquidity from the banking system, not only would corporate bond yields rise but spreads with government securities are also expected to widen in the coming months.

Rockfort Fincap’s Srinivasan expects banks to issue bonds in the 7-year to 15-year segment in the next three months, and spreads to increase by at least 50 basis points compared to the February or March corporate bond traded levels.

The fund-raise during this period could help banks take advantage of a comparatively lower interest rate considering the market expectations of continuous rate hikes by the RBI this fiscal year, and simultaneously help address growing credit demand, Srinivasan added.",724,0.02174338698387146

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB’s PAT at Rs100.6bn was a miss (PLe: Rs115.04bn), due to weaker NII and other income although opex was lower. Asset quality was stable and OTR pool is ~1.1% of loans. NII traction remained softer than loan growth due to non-retail focus. HDFCB’s credit accretion in the recent past has been primarily led by wholesale and CRB, since credit standards were tightened in retail due to COVID. This has been a drag on margins. Loan mix in terms of non-retail/retail stands at 61/39 compared to 50/50 pre-pandemic. Balance sheet strength is suggested by a PCR of 70%+, contingent provisions at 71bps and a CET-1 of 16.7%.

Outlook

However, near term RoE (FY23 & FY24) could remain between 16-17% as commentary suggests that the positive effect on NIM that could emanate from faster retail credit offtake, may take 4-6 quarters to materialize and as rates rise, CASA share is expected to moderate. We reduce our PAT for FY23E/24E by ~6% each, owing to lower NII and other income. Hence, we cut our target multiple from 3.6x to 3.2x on Mar’24 ABV and trim our TP from Rs2,000 to Rs1,740. Retain BUY.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

HDFC Bank Ltd bounced back to its historic year-on-year net profit growth of 20 percent and above in the fourth quarter of FY22. Asset quality is pristine compared to that of its peers and loan growth of 20 percent is way above the industry’s single-digit performance.

But the lender’s operating performance showed spots of trouble. Operating profit growth was just 10.2 percent for the quarter and the net interest margin was at a record low.

There are four reasons behind HDFC Bank’s weak operating metrics.

Credit risk

HDFC Bank has reduced its risk-weighted assets steadily over the past two years after the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020. The bank’s regulatory disclosures show that assets with 100 percent risk weight grew by 25 percent between FY20 and FY22 and those with less than 100 percent risk weight grew by a strong 51 percent.

Exposures that carried more than 100 percent risk weight grew by 32 percent. Risk weights are prescribed by the banking regulator and banks are expected to set aside capital depending on the risk weights of each loan. As such, most banks avoid loans that have more than 100 percent risk weight. The higher the credit risk, the higher is the interest income for the bank and vice-a-versa.

Loan mix

Another reason behind the modest 10 percent growth in net interest income for HDFC Bank was the steady increase in the share of wholesale loans. Wholesale loans now form more than half of the bank’s loan book, a marked shift from its retail-heavy days.

The share of retail is down to 39 percent now from pre-pandemic levels of 55 percent. Within wholesale, 26 percent is large corporate loans while 35 percent are to small business and the rural sector excluding farm loans. Further, incremental wholesale lending was to high-rated borrowers. The credit risk spread charged over and above the benchmark lending rate is low for such borrowers.

Low-risk retail

Retail loans continue to grow at a strong clip for HDFC Bank. In the March quarter, retail loans grew by 15 percent year-on-year. But the mix of retail book has also changed. Growth in high-risk credit card loans has slowed while auto loans have shrunk. These two loan categories fetch higher interest income and also contribute to fee income. The bank also tightened credit standards in order to avoid increase in credit risk in the wake of the pandemic. This too dragged down net interest income growth.

Margined out

Besides the drag on core interest income, low-risk loans tend to drag down net interest margins. HDFC Bank’s net interest margin was at a record low of 4 percent for the March quarter. Historically, the lender has reported margins in the 4.1-4.2 percent range every quarter.

Low-rated wholesale loans and sustained growth in retail loans kept the pressure on the margin. Further, since retail and small business loans were priced off the repo rate, the transmission of deep rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) onto loan rates was swift. For margins to improve, the lender would need policy rates to go up. Thankfully, the interest rate cycle has turned and margin expansion is now on the horizon for the bank.

Shares of the lender were down more than 2 percent on Monday despite most analysts retaining their buy rating on the stock. Surely, investors seem to have taken note of the unimpressive operating profit, core income growth and record low margin.",583,0.03835856914520264

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after its Q4 earnings:

Prabhudas Lilladher

HDFCB’s PAT at Rs 100.6 billion was a miss (PLe: Rs 115.04 billion), due to weaker NII and other income, although opex was lower. Asset quality was stable and OTR pool is 1.1 percent of loans.

The NII traction remained softer than loan growth due to non-retail focus. HDFCB’s credit accretion in the recent past has been primarily led by wholesale and CRB, since credit standards were tightened in retail due to COVID. This has been a drag on margins.

Loan mix in terms of non-retail/retail stands at 61/39 compared to 50/50 pre-pandemic. Balance sheet strength is suggested by a PCR of 70 percent-plus, contingent provisions at 71bps and a CET-1 of 16.7 percent.

However, near-term RoE (FY23 and FY24) could remain at 16-17 percent as commentary suggests that the positive effect on NIM that could emanate from faster retail credit offtake, may take 4-6 quarters to materialize and as rates rise, CASA share is expected to moderate.

We reduce our PAT for FY23E/24E by 6 percent each, owing to lower NII and other income. Hence, we cut our target multiple from 3.6x to 3.2x on March 2024 ABV and trim our target price from Rs 2,000 to Rs 1,740. Retain Buy.

Credit Suisse

There was a strong growth trends, while NIM remains soft. The capital levels remain strong and increases EPS estimates by 2-3 percent.

Credit Suisse expect RoE of 16-17 percent, reported CNBC-TV18.

CLSA

The Q4 was mixed with strong growth & low opex growth, while the NIM will only gradually recover.

The bank will upfront distribution expansion costs in FY23, and expect earnings resilience to remain high.

CLSA prefer ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI over HDFC Bank, reported CNBC-TV18.

LKP Research

HDFC Bank is expected to outperform the sector led by (1) healthy balance sheet growth, (2) much higher provision than regulatory requirement in the balance sheet, (3) strong capital cushion of 17.9 percent at Tier1 level and (4) best-in-class underwriting and risk management practices.

Given these strengths, we expect HDFC Bank to remain one of the best among all the lending business. Thus, we continue to maintain buy rating on the bank with target price of Rs 1,831.

Motilal Oswal

HDFC Bank continued to deliver strong business growth v/s its peers, resulting in market share gains. This was propelled by a sustained momentum in Retail segment along with robust growth in Commercial and Rural Banking and a sharp pick-up in wholesale loans.

NII and PPoP growth stood modest due to a decline in margins even as earnings were buoyant because of benign credit cost despite making additional contingent provisions.

Asset quality ratios have improved, while the restructured book too moderated to 1.14 percent of loans. Healthy PCR and contingent provisioning buffer provide comfort on asset quality.

We estimate HDFCB to deliver 20 percent PAT CAGR over FY22-24, with an RoA/RoE of 2.1 percent/17.8 percent in FY24. We maintain our BUY rating with a target price of Rs 1,850.

HDFC Bank remains one of our preferred buys and we expect the stock to recover gradually as revenue and margin revive over FY23, while clarity emerges on several aspects related to the merger with HDFC Ltd.

Arihant Capital

HDFC Bank has reported mixed performance during Q4FY22 as business momentum was strong while NII and PPoP came in lower then estimates.

Increased share of lower yielding products has resulted into decline in margins while credit cost of the bank was lower due to higher addition of secured and safer assets. Momentum on business growth front leading to market share gain, adoption of digital capabilities and aggressive focus on liability profile will lead the bank to deliver steady state RoE profile of 17-18 percent.

We marginally increase our estimate by 2-3 percent for FY23-24E and maintain our buy rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1,864 (earlier Rs 1,910), based on 3.4x FY24E P/ABV. At CMP, stock is trading at 2.7x to its FY24E ABV.

Sharekhan

We believe that the bank is on an accelerated growth path with robust advances growth led by retail and commercial segments and better asset quality. Advances are likely to clock a CAGR of 17 percent over FY23 to FY25.

The bank’s continuous building up of its digital infrastructure and franchise network is likely to bode well for growth going ahead.

We believe that the bank now has sufficient drivers in terms of asset quality, reasonable provision buffers and appropriate asset mix to drive sustainable growth going forward.

The bank is well capitalised and has the ability to manage asset quality across cycles and deliver superior return ratios and reap opportunities from a revival in the economy going ahead. We maintain a buy rating with a revised price target of Rs 1,800.

At 9:23am, HDFC Bank was quoting at Rs 1,428.35, down Rs 36.50, or 2.49 percent on the BSE.

(Illustration by Suneesh K.)

The merger of the HDFCs, the original housing finance company and its offspring, the bank, is a good occasion to remember the man who made them possible. Together, the two will make for a financial powerhouse, a banking giant with a market capitalisation of Rs 14 lakh crore. But even as independent entities they were huge successes. HDFC Bank is India’s largest private sector bank by assets while HDFC has been the Indian home buyers’ lender of choice for the last five decades.

All thanks to Hasmukh Thakordas Parekh, an extraordinary business leader who ended his professional career as the chairman of ICICI, and then, at the age of 65, went on to set up the country's first housing finance corporation.

This was in 1977, nearly 14 years before liberalisation and 40 years before startups became the flavour of business in the country. Indeed, what an era that was for the sheer explosion of entrepreneurship in the country. In 1973, Dhirubhai Ambani renamed his tiny polyester firm Reliance Industries and started a journey that would lead to today’s dominant mega-corporation, straddling multiple businesses. Around the same time, in 1976, Anil Agarwal was laying the foundations of today’s Vedanta Resources which started off as a tiny cable manufacturing unit and went on to list on the London Stock Exchange in 2003. There were others too. Karsanbhai Patel started selling detergent powder made in his backyard even while a host of computer manufacturers like HCL were planting the seeds of today’s world-beating IT industry.

The environment in which they seeded their vision couldn't have been more asphyxiating. India of the 1970s was the very epitome of the infamous licence-permit raj whose sole purpose seemed to have been to prevent businesses from growing.

When Parekh came up with the idea of Housing Development Finance Corporation, a company that would give loans to ordinary home buyers, it was a massive leap of faith in a country with a razor-slim middle class and a crippling shortage of jobs which made most people averse to any kind of debt. Parekh, however, had the will and the persistence to make it happen. It would be well over a decade before HDFC had any form of competition.

The striking thing about the entrepreneurs of that era, men like Parekh, Ambani, Karsanbhai and Agarwal, is how they identified a real need and set about addressing it. HDFC went on to finance millions of middle class homes in the country. Ambani in his lifetime created a refining and domestic petrochemical giant, a real need in an oil-starved country with rising energy requirements. And they did it without being part of traditional business families having easy access to capital and political clout.

Parekh wanted middle class Indians to have the chance to build a home before they were too old. Dhirubhai Ambani, not satisfied with building a petroleum giant, dreamt of giving every Indian a chance to make a phone call for the price of the postcard. Karsanbhai wanted to make a detergent at a price point that every middle class housewife could afford.

Nor were they looking to build and bolt, a common enough occurrence in the new era of entrepreneurship. In the face of steep competition, they stayed the course to build institutions that define India in 2022.

Entrepreneurship does not flourish in a vacuum. It needs a robust and even competitive environment. Many nations, lucky enough to have a handful of such builders, have been unlucky not to have enough of them. The Indian entrepreneurs of the 1960s and '70s, much like another generation that started out before independence, fed off each others’ exertions and together they all grew. Pushing back against stifling restrictions on scale and scope, they laid the foundations for the robust business climate of today. Their contribution needs to be measured not just in the milestones they achieved, but in the roadmap they set out for future generations.

Hasmukh Thakordas Parekh set up HDFC in 1977. He passed away on 18 November 1994. By then HDFC Bank, too, had started. His legacy will endure in the combined might of the two.

Housing Development Finance Corp (HDFC) has sold a 3% stake or nearly 50 crore shares of Bandhan Bank via bulk deals, people in the know told Moneycontrol. As of December end, the mortgage giant held a 9.9% stake in Bandhan Bank.

“HDFC held around 10% stake in Bandhan Bank. Sometime back one and a half percent approximately was sold and today 3.5%, so now they are just below 5%,” one person quoted above said.

“This is to basically comply with RBI regulations. Henceforth, the understanding is that there will be no more sale of Bandhan Bank shares,” one of the persons quoted above said.

Today, shares of HDFC ended 0.2% lower at Rs 2,457.35 apiece on the National Stock Exchange, while those of Bandhan Bank ended 2.9% higher at Rs 325 per share.

In a surprise move on April 4, the HDFC twins announced the merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank. On completion of the deal, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank and all subsidiaries of the housing financier will be owned by the lender.

HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh said the rationale behind the merger included several aspects like less onerous statutory liquidity requirement and cash reserve ratio (SLR and CCR requirements), a favourable interest rate regime, and increased transparency in the realty sector, and giving mortgage customers access to a wider range of services.

Parekh said HDFC Bank in its proposal has asked the RBI to adopt a phased approach to meet SLR and CRR requirements after its merger with HDFC. Further, HDFC Bank also requested the RBI to allow it to “grandfather” certain assets and liabilities of HDFC. Grandfathering is essentially an exemption from a new regulation that may be introduced for a particular sector.

In a post monetary policy committee meeting press conference on April 8, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the regulator has received a proposal from HDFC and HDFC Bank on the merger deal and it is being examined.

“We have received a proposal from HDFC and HDFC Bank with regard to the merger announcement they have made,” Das said. “The proposal has been received and is under examination and we will, in terms of our various regulatory guidelines and other aspects, examine them and as and when a decision is taken, you will come to know about it,” the governor added.",393,

The monetary policy announced by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 8 was largely on expected lines with the repo and reverse repo rate left unchanged at 4 percent and 3.35 percent, respectively, with an upward revision in inflation and cut in growth forecast, citing the spike in commodity prices due to supply disruptions caused by the Ukraine-Russia war.

The central bank has maintained its ‘accommodative stance’ while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.

Analysts say the RBI has chosen to support growth over inflation by keeping the rates at the same level. “We believe it is a sensible choice because for India to attract foreign capital it will have to focus on generating growth. It has tried its best to balance the sharp increase in inflation forecast and a lower GDP growth forecast,” said Abhay Agarwal, founder and fund manager at Piper Serica.

He believes that the RBI does not want to signal a series of rate hikes that will increase the cost of borrowing and negatively impact the nascent recovery in consumer sentiment, manufacturing and rural income. “The hope is that with supply bottlenecks easing inflation will trend down.”

Rate-sensitive stocks including banks, financial services, auto and realty largely remained flat as the policy was on expected lines.

After the sharp increase in oil prices, the key element in the import bill, the RBI has lowered its GDP forecast to 7.2 percent for FY23 from 7.8 percent earlier, while significantly raising the full-year CPI inflation forecast to 5.7 percent from 4.5 percent earlier.

The central bank assumed oil price at $100 a barrel for forecasting economic growth and CPI inflation. “This implies that growth and inflation can be better if crude declines sharply if the war hopefully ends early,” said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

The MPC is of the view that since the February meeting, the ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions, generalised hardening of global commodity prices, the likelihood of prolonged supply chain disruptions, dislocations in trade and capital flows, divergent monetary policy responses and volatility in global financial markets are imparting sizeable upside risks to the inflation trajectory and downside risks to domestic growth.

Given the cross-current of multiple headwinds, “our approach needs to be cautious but proactive in mitigating the adverse impact on India’s growth, inflation and financial conditions”, said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das while addressing a press conference.

He added that the RBI is, however, reassured by the strong buffers that India has built over the past few years, including large foreign exchange reserves, significant improvement in external sector indicators and substantial strengthening of the financial sector, all of which would help weather this storm. “Once again, we in the RBI stand resolute and in readiness to defend the economy and navigate out of the current storm.”

Das rightly emphasised India’s macro strengths, pointing to the improvement in the external situation helped by record exports, ample forex reserves of $606.5 billion and strengthening of the financial sector, said Vijayakumar.

The RBI has introduced the standing deposit facility (SDF) as a new tool to absorb liquidity. The SDF rate, which will now be the floor of the liquidity adjustment facility corridor, will be at 3.75 percent.

The prices have given a falling trend line breakout on the daily chart which indicates a positive momentum is likely to continue.

Expert: Mehul Kothari, AVP - Technical Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,517 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 | Target: Rs 1,625 | Return: 7 percent

After the recent correction, HDFC Bank is hovering near the 61.8 percent retracement level of the entire rally which started from Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,700. This support coincides with the gap area formed due to the merger news.

The support zone is also the placement of the Kijun of Ichimoku indicator. Hence there is a high probability that the stock might resume its uptrend.

Thus, short-term traders are advised to buy the stock in the range of Rs 1,515-1,505 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,450 for the upside potential target of Rs 1,625 in the next two to three weeks.

Sunteck Realty: Buy | LTP: Rs 480 | Stop-Loss: Rs 450 | Target: Rs 530 | Return: 10 percent

The stock is on the verge of a massive breakout which might get confirmed above the Rs 500 mark. At this juncture, the trend is very strong and the price action indicates that the possibility of the breakout is very high.

In addition, at this juncture the reward-to-risk ratio looks highly lucrative to go long. Thus, one can accumulate the stock near Rs 480 with a stop-loss of Rs 450 for an upside target of Rs 530 in the two to three weeks.

The proposed mega merger between Housing Development Finance Corp and HDFC Bank has triggered talk of consolidation within the non-banking financial company (NBFC) sector. Industry experts are of the view that in order to sustain on a long-term basis, non-banks, especially small and mid-sized ones, will look at the amalgamation route.

This is because the regulatory arbitrage that was available to NBFCs is nearly absent now after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tightened regulations on non-banks. With this, large NBFCs face regulations almost on a par with that of banks.

“RBI has brought about measures such as increased capital requirements for NBFCs, harmonised NPA (non-performing asset) norms with banks, and liquidity coverage ratio being introduced for NBFCs, among other actions,” Y.S. Chakravarti, MD and CEO at Shriram City Union Finance told Moneycontrol. ”In addition, size matters in the financial services space, and larger players expect to benefit from economies of scale and lower borrowing costs. I believe these have been the primary drivers for NBFC consolidation,” Chakravarti said.

Further, high cost of funds, increasing competition, asset quality pressures, competition to attract high-rated borrowers at low rates and lower spreads could be some reasons for consolidation, Chakravarti said.

This is not the first time that consolidation in the NBFC sector has been talked about. Lower-rated NBFCs have struggled accessing liquidity at cheaper rates since 2018 when the beleaguered Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) defaulted on debt repayment, triggering a slew of liquidity problems for the sector. The introduction of the goods and service tax, demonetisation and the pandemic only exacerbated such lenders’ liquidity woes, analysts said.

The IL&FS event proved that NBFCs are an integral part of India's financial system and the RBI, thus, has increased supervision of such entities. The central bank has grouped NBFCs into different categories based on their size and interconnectedness and has made capital norms stricter.

The bigger ones are grouped in the upper layer with tight supervision while stringent regulations will apply to the middle layer as well. The top layer is reserved for companies that are perceived to carry elevated risks akin to banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework.

The regulator on November 12 also came out with a clarification on upgrading of assets that resulted in a rise in reported gross NPAs of most non-banks in Q3FY22.

Analysts’ take

The RBI’s regulatory actions raise the accountability bar for NBFCs, and also cut them less slack than they used to have.

“The harmonisation of some of the key regulatory requirements of NBFCs with that of banks has reduced the leeway which was available to NBFCs in the past. This along with other factors including improved synergies, product or geographical diversification, better shareholder value, access to liquidity or lower cost of funds are the key reasons for the large merger proposals which are in news over the recent past,” said A.M. Kartik, vice-president and sector head of financial sector ratings at ICRA.

Kartik says that in the case of small and mid-sized NBFCs, it is more about the viability, future growth plans and access to funding that is resulting in mergers with relatively larger NBFCs. Access to funding for NBFCs is going to be a key differentiator going forward, he said, as the sector is highly reliant on the banking sector at present.

Bank’s exposure to the NBFC sector is quite high and near their internal sectoral limits, Kartik added. Incremental funding to NBFCs would be partly dependent on the banking sector’s own growth rate going forward.

“One could expect consolidation or M&A activity more amongst the mid-sized NBFCs with other similar-sized ones or larger entities, including banks, for achieving higher growth and/or for product /geographical diversification,” he said.

Jinay Gala, associate director at India Ratings & Research, says the merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank will likely be used as a test case for all upcoming large-ticket mergers in the NBFC sector.

While there is a possibility of small NBFCs merging with bigger ones to gain scale and associated benefits, NBFCs may also look at acquiring fintechs to upgrade and scale their existing technology infrastructure.

“We foresee that there could be an increase in consolidation in the non-bank sector to avail benefits of a larger franchise, larger product basket and a larger reach so that they could remain competitive to other lenders like banks and small finance banks,” Gala said.",732,0.328034371137619

India’s home-loan market is set for a dramatic change in the coming years as the country’s biggest housing finance company folds into a bank. HDFC Ltd is set to merge with HDFC Bank Ltd in 12-18 months, subject to regulatory approval. HDFC’s market share in overall housing loans was 31 percent in FY21, second only to State Bank of India (SBI), the largest bank in the country.

HDFC’s amalgamation into HDFC Bank would do three key things to the housing loan market. Firstly, the obvious outcome would be a reduction in the market share of housing finance companies (HFC) and a concurrent increase in that of the banking sector. Secondly, it would impact the growth and margins of HFCs as the heft of a large balance sheet coupled with access to low-cost borrowing would be tough to compete with. Lastly, HFCs may be driven towards riskier developer loans, which come with asset quality risks.

HFC market share reduction

Currently, the home-loan market is dominated by banks and housing finance companies. A study by credit bureau Crif High Mark Ltd estimates that the home-loan market size was Rs 22.6 lakh crore in FY21. Of this, the banking sector accounted for 60 percent while HFCs held 38 percent.

As such the top five lenders (both banks and HFCs) account for 80 percent of the market. Within HFCs, being the largest, HDFC Ltd had nearly half the market share. Therefore, after the HDFC’s merger, HFCs would account for just about a quarter of the housing loan market.

HFCs will struggle to grow

Beyond this it will get interesting for players in the market. Ashvin Parekh, a veteran banking consultant and founder of Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services LLP, believes that large HFCs would find it difficult to grow. “For HFCs the future is bleak, particularly for large and medium sized ones. The smaller sized ones, though, may continue to perform,” he said.

This is because the competition for large-ticket home-loans is already intense and will only increase further. Banks have an advantage here due to their access to low-cost funds by way of public deposits. Emboldened by the low cost of borrowings, banks have been able to capture a large share of the home-loan market by pricing loans competitively. In fact, most banks do not charge any spread over their benchmark rate as home-loans are considered the safest asset.

The banking sector’s housing loan portfolio has expanded by 11.8 percent over the past five years on a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) basis. On the other hand, growth has been slow for HFCs as they have had to suffer high borrowing costs, especially during the pandemic. Even before the pandemic, the fall of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) dented confidence among HFCs, making their cost of borrowing shoot up.

“Your cost of funds is a key component. HDFC, even before the merger, had the advantage of a large balance sheet, so their borrowing cost was low and they were more competitive. If they turn into a bank, they will gain more because of (the low) cost of funds,” said Prakash Agarwal, director and head of financial institutions at India Ratings and Research. He, too, expects the going to get tougher for HFCs.

This will hurt lenders such as LIC Housing Finance Ltd, PNB Housing Finance Ltd and perhaps even some banks. As such, HFCs have witnessed pressure on their loan growth after the pandemic.

Margin pressure

For HFCs, it is a double whammy: along with growth, their margins may also come under stress. As such, home-loans are products with thin margins as most banks refrain from adding a spread over their benchmark lending rate and non-bank lenders charge low spreads. HDFC Bank’s entry into mortgages with HDFC’s portfolio would heighten the competition on rates.

Notwithstanding its non-bank origins, HDFC commanded the lowest borrowing cost among non-bank lenders, an advantage that would sharpen after it merges with the bank. Incrementally, borrowers would gravitate towards loans priced lower even as the interest rate cycle turns upwards. Again, the margin pinch would be felt most by large HFCs that operate in the large-ticket-loan segment, comparable to HDFC. Smaller lenders may be able to protect themselves given the relatively mild focus of banks in this segment.

Affordable housing segment threat

Affordable housing has been a rising market segment that most lenders have found lucrative enough to pursue in the wake of dispensations from the government and regulators. Affordable home-loans have a ticket size of less than Rs 35 lakh. Further, as mature real estate markets stagnated in terms of growth, affordable housing provided the required support.

The impact on HFCs here could be mixed. While public sector banks have increased their focus, HFCs still account for more than 40 percent share here. In fact, HFCs have been able to claw back their market share, according to analysts.

That said, HDFC has a sizeable market share in the affordable segment although its focus here is recent. The management has indicated that in the new avatar of HDFC Bank, the thrust on this segment will continue. Ergo, HFCs would see their market share coming under threat.

The developer financing conundrum

What analysts fear is the change in the non-retail book of HFCs, which consists largely of developer financing and construction finance. Though HDFC’s non-individual book is less than a third of its portfolio, it is a big lender to real estate builders. Construction financing is a lucrative business in terms of margins as loans to developers carry a wider spread given the inherent risk in real estate. Lending to real estate by banks is heavily regulated and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) frowns upon an increase in exposure. After the merger, HDFC Bank may either maintain its share of developer finance or prune it, depending on regulatory comfort.

At the same time, other HFCs may load up on riskier developer finance from here on. Such loans would be easy pickings in the wake of general pressure on margins in the retail book. While developer finance is good for margins, such risky loans tend to increase the stress level in the portfolio. This segment has been a source of pain for HFCs such as LIC Housing Finance and PNB Housing Finance during the current downturn.

The movement in share prices of HFCs in the past one month reflects the distinction in the quality of books that investors perceive. Those loaded with retail loans have had an easy pass with investors, while portfolios heavy with developer loans have suffered. Some, such as Indiabulls Housing Finance, have intentionally pruned developer finance and focused on the retail business to gain investor acceptance.

The upshot is that HFCs may have to choose between being niche players or merging with banks because the home-loan market is now firmly in the grip of banks.",1180,-0.4445326129595439

The proposed merger of HDFC Bank and HDFC Ltd will moderately hurt the lender's profitability in the next 2-3 years, driven by higher funding costs to meet the regulatory liquidity norms, global rating agency Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday. The rating agency, however, affirmed all the ratings of HDFC Bank, including the Baa3 long-term local and foreign current deposit ratings and Ba3 (hyb) Additional Tier 1 securities rating.

The rating affirmation with a stable outlook takes account of Moody's expectation that the financial fundamentals of HDFC Bank will remain stable and robust after considering the financial impact of the proposed acquisition of HDFC by the bank, the agency said in a statement. The two entities' solid commercial and retail banking franchises reflected in their status as the largest private-sector bank and largest non-bank finance company in India by assets will support their funding and liquidity, it said.

On April 4, 2022, HDFC Bank and HDFC announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement whereby the business of HDFC Limited will be merged into HDFC Bank in an all-stock transaction. The boards of both entities have approved the merger and expect the transaction to close by the end-2023, upon completion of closing conditions, including regulatory and shareholder approvals, it said.

The proposed transaction will significantly enhance HDFC Bank's product portfolio with a higher percentage of secured and long-duration mortgage loans, the agency said, adding the merger will also improve the bank's ability to cross-sell retail banking products to the customers of HDFC Limited. The increased scale and comprehensive product offering will help the combined group's drive revenue opportunities and support operating and underwriting efficiencies, it said.

""The transaction will moderately hurt HDFC Bank's profitability in the next 2-3 years driven by higher funding costs to meet the regulatory liquidity norms, including cash reserve ratio, statutory liquidity ratio as well as costs associated with compliance with the priority sector lending norms. Further, the share of market funding will increase in the near term,"" it said. Nevertheless, Moody's expects the bank's strong retail franchise and access to low-cost depositors will help mitigate the impact.

The country’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank on Wednesday said it is planning to raise up to Rs 50,000 crore in the next one year by issuing bonds on a private placement basis.

The decision was taken at the bank’s board meeting.

""The bank proposes to raise funds by issuing perpetual debt instruments (part of additional tier I capital), tier II capital bonds and long-term bonds (financing of infrastructure and affordable housing) up to a total amount of Rs 50,000 crore over the period of next 12 months through private placement mode,” HDFC Bank said in a regulatory filing.

The board of directors would consider this proposal at its meeting to be held on April 16, 2022, it added.

Perpetual bonds carry no maturity date, so they may be treated as equity, not as debt.

Earlier this week, HDFC Bank agreed to take over its parent and the country’s largest mortgage lender HDFC Ltd, as part of its strategy to fuel growth, especially in the affordable housing segment.

On April 4, the HDFC twins announced their decision to merge. HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger.

Chairman Deepak Parekh called it a merger of equals. Every 25 shares held by HDFC shareholders will fetch them 42 shares of the bank. The merger is set to create an entity that will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs 17.9 lakh crore.

Analysts and housing finance companies believe that the merger will create a larger customer base, leveraging distribution across urban, semi-urban and rural geographies.

“After the merger, HDFC and HDFC Bank will be the third largest company by market cap in India, occupying a major share in the mortgage sector,” said Atul Goel, MD, Goel Ganga Group & President (Elect.), NAREDCO Pune, apex national body for the real estate and allied industries.

“Hence, a cross-sell opportunity to larger customer base will benefit the company. The mortgage offering would also be more competitive,” Goel said.

The HDFC-HDFC Bank combine will position itself as one of the largest consumer lenders in the emerging markets in Asia, according to a recent report of Morgan Stanley.

The merger will provide better funding franchise for HDFC, eventually leading to greater operational and distribution leverage, particularly given HDFC Bank's strong expansion in interior India over the past 10 years, the report said.

Karthik Srinivasan, an analyst from ICRA said the merger can potentially change the chemistry in the home loan market. “We need to see whether they will be more aggressive or less aggressive, it can be seen after a few years. Their overall portfolio of housing may shift towards bank. Market will become more competitive as HDFC in general has been competitive in their respective segments they have operated,” he said.

The bank has a presence in more than 3,000 cities and towns with about 50 percent of its branches in semi-urban and rural geographies. Through its 6,342 branches, it caters to more than 68 million customers.

While the mortgage lender has assets of Rs 6,23,420.03 crore, turnover of Rs 35,681.74 crore and a net worth of Rs 1,15,400.48 crore as on December 31, 2021, the bank's assets are pegged at Rs 19,38,285.95 crore, turnover (includes other income) at Rs 1,16,177.23 crore for nine months to December 31, 2021, and a net worth of Rs 2,23,394.00 crore, as on December 31, 2021.

Brokerage firm ICICI Direct too said the merger will facilitate larger quantum of credit into the priority sector and enhance wholesale lending. The merger will not only expand their home loan portfolio, but also open up the scope for larger ticket loans, including those for infrastructure. ""There is also a chance that the customers opting for housing finance may get bifurcated,"" the brokerage said.

“The customers from underserved markets would no longer be forced to rely on unorganized moneylenders who charge exorbitant rates of interest. This would have a cascading effect of shattering the debt traps for such customers,” said Pramod Kathuria, Founder and CEO, Easiloan, a digital market place for home loans.

The merger is likely to bring advanced technology infrastructure, Kathuria said.

Analysts said HDFC has always incorporated advanced technology to serve customers. So, it is likely that after the merger, HDFC may even start offering greater hyper-personalised products or services to increase customer loyalty towards the brand, added Kathuria.

HDFC an HDFC Bank merger has been speculated for a while. In fact, back in 2015, HDFC Chairman Parekh had said that his company could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances were in favour. But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent sending the idea to backburner. Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders.

With the parent finally merging the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry.

TT Srinivasaraghavan has spent four decades in Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), including 18 years as managing director of Chennai-based Sundaram Finance. He continues to serve on the board of Sundaram Finance.

He is the one credited with the GQP (Growth, Quality and Profitability) philosophy in the NBFC space. Steady and profitable growth over a long period, as opposed to rapid and aggressive expansion, was his business model. In the last 12 months, he has also been on the advisory panel of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

In this free-wheeling interview with Moneycontrol at his house in Chennai on April 5, Srinivasaraghavan shared his thoughts on the merger between the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), India’s No. 1 housing financier, and HDFC Bank, the biggest private sector bank by asset size, and its implications for the banking and NBFC sectors. Edited Excerpts:

It is often said that small is beautiful. How do you see this merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank?

No doubt, it is a transformational event for the banking industry. There are economies of scale that the merger brings. Cross-sell opportunity (mutual funds / insurance/ mortgage loans) is seen by many as one of the drivers for the merger. But I have a slightly different view. The cross-sell concept, I believe, has been overhyped internationally and domestically. It is unlikely that the cross-sell would have been a prime driver for the merger. Even without the merger, that opportunity would have existed.

What could be the reason then?

I could see some reasons beyond the cross-sell opportunity for this merger. Given their size, there is no great advantage in continuing as an NBFC. HDFC, as an NBFC, does not have access to current account and savings bank account money that the bank has. The relative advantage of remaining as an NBFC is diminishing at that scale. Someday it would have come to a point as to how much they would have been able to leverage through term debt as the lenders would have hit their ‘per-borrower’ ceiling. Now as a bank, HDFC Bank would have access to an endless retail franchise. On the liabilities side, it gives them serious clout.

Do you see any other factors that could have triggered the long-speculated-on merger?

It’s no surprise that the merger has taken place. It has been on the cards for a long while. It was only a question of when it would happen. One of the reasons could have been that of management succession. Many of their top management personnel are around 70 and the question of succession in HDFC would have been an issue. This way, they would have access to a larger pool of managerial talent.

What is the implication of the merger on the NBFC sector as a whole?

As for its impact on the NBFC sector ... HDFC is in a completely different league. I think it would not make a big difference in the NBFC space, especially for the small and mid-sized players. For HDFC Bank, it is a massive portfolio addition. The opportunity to target mortgage loan customers is big. They now have huge distribution reach and the muscle power to go and fight State Bank of India (SBI) in the mortgage loan space. With this, the banking landscape has changed dramatically.

What do you see as a major challenge in this merger exercise?

As with all large mergers, cultural integration will be a challenge. Sometimes, too big a size is not easy to manage. The top management may not always have a feel of the ‘on the ground’ customer experience. There is also a possibility of the customers of HDFC being compromised. Also, as you get bigger, pressure to perform better will be higher. Size will build its own pressure.

In the unfolding context, what is the relevance of NBFCs?

NBFCs have played a phenomenal role in bringing the un-served and under-served into the credit mainstream. If you go back in history to the nationalisation of banks, financial inclusion (although such a terminology did not exist back then) was the real intent behind the move. Fifty years later, all we have done is found new jargon (financial inclusion) but we are still talking about the need to cater to the underserved segment. There is still a long way to go as far as financial inclusion is concerned, and that’s where the relevance of NBFCs comes in.

Banks are indeed large and formidable competitors, but that does not mean that there is no room for anybody else. In fact, I have long believed that this is a model of collaboration rather than confrontation where the banks are wholesalers and NBFCs are retailers. Co-lending, priority sector on-lending and business correspondents are all prime examples of the wholesaler-retailer equation.

It is about understanding these businesses, understanding the opportunities and risks associated with these businesses, and very often this requires ground-level knowledge and expertise. NBFCs have traditionally played this role and will continue to do so in the years to come. No doubt, technology will play a major role in helping navigate some of these complexities and progressively become a significant enabler for lenders and borrowers alike. However, the decades-long expertise that NBFCs have developed in financing micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) is, to my mind, quite unparalleled.

The level of in-depth understanding that NBFCs have, based on the relationships they have built and cultivated over a long period, their expertise in being able to assess credit, their ability to reach out to their customers in a timely fashion, including giving them forbearance during their times of stress, place them in a unique position that cannot be replaced by technology, nor can they be replaced by large banks because the knowledge that is required to assess, lend and thereafter collect from these segments is indeed a specialised skill, built in many cases, over generations.

In my view, the role that NBFCs have played will not only continue but will evolve into newer opportunities and newer areas.

What could be your advice for smaller NBFCs?

NBFCs have a unique model that is not easily replicable. Many of the smaller NBFCs are still family-owned and family-managed and often three or even four generations of knowledge, relationships, expertise have been built up, which no amount of artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning can substitute. Technology is certainly a great support, a great enabler, but in this uniquely diverse landscape with its varied tapestries, it is, in my view, well-nigh impossible to build models that will answer every situation.

The upcoming merger of two mammoth entities from the same group – HDFC and HDFC Bank – has created a buzz that is likely to continue well after the amalgamation takes effect.

HDFC twins’ senior management and other industry experts believe that the deal is a win-win for all stakeholders, but official information on changes for customers, if any, will be clearer only closer to the final merger.

Moneycontrol spoke to five experts in the financial advisory space to understand what the mega merger means for investors and retail customers. Here’s what they said:

Vishal Dhawan, Founder and Chief Financial Planner, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors

Actively-managed mutual funds would underperform due to this merger only if the merged entity's stock price outperforms and mutual funds are unable to participate due to investing limits.

The merger itself will take 12-18 months, as it needs several regulatory approvals. So, mutual funds have enough time to decide what they want to do with the excess holdings that they might have in the merged entity, if its weight in large-cap indices is more than the 10 percent investing limit of mutual funds. As this will impact the entire mutual fund industry, the Association of Mutual Funds in India may approach SEBI to ease the individual stock limits. Also, remember that both HDFC Bank and HDFC were relative underperformers on the stock market in the recent past. So, funds that actually had lower exposure to the two stocks would have benefitted to that extent.

So, we should not read too much into it right now, as there is still a lot of time for the merger to be completed. The final weight of the merged entity, whether in the Nifty 50 or any other large-cap index, would depend on how the two stocks perform from hereon, stock performance after the merger, and how the deal gets finally structured. Whether the weight of the merged HDFC Bank-HDFC entity crosses mutual funds’ investing limit or not, investors wanting to take large-cap exposure should in any case prefer low-cost passively-managed funds to active funds. In the last few years, we have seen that large-cap fund managers have found it difficult to outperform large-cap indices.

The merger of HDFC and HDFC Bank will lead to changes in domestic and global indices, which may result in many fund managers selling their holdings in these two stocks due to regulatory norms and index limitations. Also, investors should not overlook operational, regulatory, and cultural challenges involved in this merger. Synergies of the merger, if any, will be seen in the long term after the merger goes through. Euphoria seen in the stock prices of these two may not last long, as market participants price in these concerns.

Abhinit Kulkarni, Founder and CIO, Tequity Investing

The merger is beneficial from the perspective of stakeholders of both the entities. The country needs stronger and bigger financial institutions to support the flourishing economy. Bigger banks are vital for reducing the cost of capital, promoting credit growth and maintaining asset quality. The Rs 18 trillion combined balance sheet strengthens the bank’s ability to underwrite more. This merger is the beginning of the next phase of growth, not just for the bank, but also for the Indian banking system. It is the bank’s ""stop me if you can moment!"" From the investors’ perspective, short-term volatility cannot be ruled out, but they should be ready to buy at lower prices.

Preeti Zende, Founder, ApnaDhan Financial Services

Since the merged entity will be a bank, interest rates will be linked to an external benchmark. So, the rates could be more competitive compared to an NBFC (non-banking finance company). Current HDFC customers may get a chance to switch to better home loan interest rates after the merger. Things will be clearer closer to the merger completion, which will take considerable time. As far as HDFC depositors are concerned, even after the merger, the interest rate at which the deposits are made will be applicable till their maturity. If customers want to renew the deposit after maturity, then prevailing interest rates offered by the bank at that juncture will be applicable. Usually, the bank's interest rates are lower than that of NBFCs which means that for current HDFC customers, the chances of getting similar or higher interest rates are dim. Bank fixed deposits are covered under deposit insurance which is not applicable to NBFCs. So, after the merger, deposits up to Rs 5 lakh will be covered by DICGC which is a great relief to existing customers.

After the amalgamation, composite services of home loan and banking under one roof will be beneficial for customers of both entities. A possibility of overdraft facility for housing loan may bring a lot of relief for customers with seasonal idle cash, which was earlier not possible with HDFC, as only banks can provide this (facility).

External benchmarking brings not only transparency but also lowers the cost of borrowing over a period of time. Currently, NBFCs do not have to adhere to the external benchmarking regime, but banks have to. The Reserve Bank of India may give some transition time to HDFC Bank to move existing customers of HDFC to interest rates benchmarked to repo rates. But new borrowers will immediately benefit from this move.",1019,0.0008158584435780843

India's largest private lender HDFC Bank's $40 billion acquisition of its biggest shareholder could face regulatory hurdles due to the stake it would give the bank in the insurance sector, analysts said.

Sources told Reuters last year that the Reserve Bank of India, which acts as regulator for the financial industry, wants banks to limit ownership stakes in insurance companies.

HDFC Bank's acquisition of HDFC Ltd, announced on Monday, will create an entity with a combined balance sheet worth $237 billion and will include the target's insurance and other financial subsidiaries.

HDFC Life and HDFC ERGO are among the leading life and general insurance companies in the private sector, and analysts say the RBI is unlikely to be comfortable with the size of the insurance operations the deal will give the bank.

HDFC Bank's management said on Monday that they have asked the regulator for clarity on complying with its rules, but analysts believe it may not be easy to come by.

""Considering there are lot of subsidiaries that need to be merged, there could be some regulatory overhang, particularly in the insurance business where the central bank is not very comfortable with banks increasing their stake,"" said an analyst at a domestic brokerage house.

HDFC Bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday. The RBI also did not respond to a request for comment.

One way of folding the subsidiaries into HDFC Bank could be to create a holding company structure, but that could have a negative impact on the balance sheet in the short term, analysts said.

""If a holding company structure is enforced then the equation changes. Cost goes up as stamp duties and taxes will go up,"" Macquarie said in a note on Tuesday.

In the short term, return on equity (RoE), a key financial metric, will also go down as a result of meeting certain regulatory requirements, the Macquarie note said.

As a shadow bank - a finance company outside the scope of traditional banking regulation - HDFC Ltd has a higher cost of funds compared to the bank.

Post merger, the entity may therefore in the short term also see a higher cost of funds, which could affect its margin, said a portfolio manager at a retail brokerage firm.

""Due to this and other ambiguities regarding the deal and the performance, the stock may not see a big valuation re-rating immediately,"" he added.

HDFC Bank shares fell as much as nearly 3 percent on Tuesday, while HDFC Ltd slipped more than 2 percent. Both stocks had surged around 10 percent on Monday.

If it clears the hurdles to a deal, HDFC Bank will shrink the gap in size with state-run lender and bigger rival State Bank of India, and pull further away from peers such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank.",529,-0.6754146814346313

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB has announced the long-awaited reverse merger of parent HDFCL. The merger should fulfill the implicit RBI policy of 1) not allowing a bank to be owned by an NBFC/HFC, and 2) having its lending business housed mainly in the bank. It should also generate cost/business synergies in the medium-to-long run. Following are the key takeaways from the call and our view: Driving economies of scale and making housing business much more competitive: After the merger, HDFCB’s loan book will cross Rs18tn (USD240bn) and it will become the 8 th largest bank globally by market cap (Rs12.3trn/USD164bn). As per management, nearly 70% of HDFCB’s 68mn customers do not have housing loans, and thus the merger will provide an opportunity to cross-sell mortgage loans, while HDFCL’s customers will be offered banking products. HDFCB’s cost advantage will make the housing loan business much more competitive amid the rising dominance of banks in the segment. For HDFCB, a higher share of the mortgage business (33%) could be gross margin dilutive, but risk-adjusted margins will still be healthy and also increase the tenor of the loan book.



Outlook

We retain our long-term Buy rating on HDFCB given its strong capital comfort, better return ratios vs. peers and reasonable valuations.

As per the plan, HDFC will acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank through the transformational merger. Chairman Deepak Parekh calls it a merger of equals. Every 25 shares held by HDFC shareholders will fetch them 42 shares of the bank. The merger created an entity that will have a market-cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs 17.9 lakh crores.

The announcement came as a surprise to most analysts. Markets cheered the decision.

In his first exclusive conversation with the media after the announcement, Deepak Parekh, the veteran banker who built the iconic mortgage lender over four decades spoke to Moneycontrol on April 5 where he explained why the company decided to merge with the bank now and what are the challenges ahead on culture integration.

Edited excerpts:

The iconic HDFC brand will no longer exist...

We have to merge the culture and all our people are going to be in the bank. So, some rubbing off of the culture will happen. Now, we will have to have a common culture. Now, bank will have to deal in housing loans which is very emotional, personal, family — all these are there. So we have to be very careful with all our customers.

How tough will be that?

Now, if you give a personal loan to someone who speculates and loses, we have to be tough on them. Therefore, the feeling goes as the bank culture is not good. If I take a car loan and he runs away with the car, we have to repossess. So, the business of bank and the business of mortgage finance has different sentimental and emotional issue. The bank has to be tougher.

Why did you choose to merge?

We had to have a larger base of resources with our growth. Indian debt market is not developed yet. For NBFCs to raise large sums of money is not easy and financial sector, home finance, home demand is increasing by leaps and bounds. So, we also have to be careful that we will be able to raise the resources we need for disbursements five years from now. See, today we are very comfortable, tomorrow we will be very comfortable, two years later we are very comfortable but what about the future as the business keeps growing? Housing demand is not going to stop in India for next 50 years.

So is this constraint as an NBFC the primary reason HDFC chose to merge with the bank at this point?

The constraint is that the RBI, over the last few years, removed the arbitrage between a bank and an NBFC; indirectly removed by coming out with NPA (non-performing assets) classification the same as the bank, higher capital adequacy for us. There is higher weightage on housing loans.

The regulator wants big NBFCs to become banks. What are your thoughts?

They have come out with a paper very clearly saying large NBFCs must become banks. Then they are coming with three layers of regulatory requirements for NBFCs — upper layer, middle layer, lower layer. Anyone above Rs50000 crore asset base will be upper layer; we are five lakh crore rupees. We are the highest in the upper layer. And they have very clearly said that the upper layer NBFCs will be monitored, inspected, regulated akin to a bank. So all these regulations…NPAs is the worst. I tell you. If a person is four months in arrears and he pays two months instalment, under NHB (National Housing Bank) we took him out of NPA, because he is below 90 days. Under banking regulation, if he is four months arrear and if he pays 3 months, he is still an NPA. We have assets as security. But still RBI brought these regulations. So the RBI is going to regulate big NBFCs like the banks.

Have LCR rules impacted you too?

The big blow was LCR, Liquidity coverage ratio. So technically, 30-days outstanding, whether it is deposit maturity, whether it is loan repayment, bond repayment—all of that should be kept in a separate bank account. So technically, that increases the cost significantly. So the main motivation of the regulatory changes was that it was very clear that the RBI is concerned about large NBFCs after IL&FS and others. The RBI wants regulation of (large NBFCs) similar to banks.

Do you think the regulator was unfair to the likes of HDFC? Not every NBFC is an IL&FS after all.

But, why have they done it? Because of bad experiences. Because of some black sheeps in the family. There are so many NBFCs that have run down. They take retail and deposits and they don’t pay. As the regulator, you are responsible to the Parliament. There are huge questions asked on how IL&FS collapsed, how Srei Finane collapsed , how Dewan Housing Collapased, what Indiabulls is going through..the number of these small companies…so the regulations need to be tighter and it is not just the RBI, it is all over the world.

So is it correct to say tight NBFC regulations made the merger unavoidable for HDFC?

Not unavoidable. We could have still worked. But there are a number of reasons. Among the number of reasons, this is one of the reasons.",894,-0.4034467488527298

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

The Indian banking space witnessed a historic event today with HDFC Ltd. deciding to merge into HDFC Bank and the transaction would take ~18 months to complete. The rationale of the merger is that regulatory arbitrage between banks and NBFCs has been reducing while the time was opportune owing to a softer interest rate environment coupled with lower liquidity requirements. As at Dec’21, the total loan size of the merged entity would be ~Rs18trn with the share of mortgages expected to increase from 11% to 33%. Since a chunk of HDFC Ltd.’s customers do not have a banking relationship, this would provide tremendous cross-sell opportunities.



Outlook

While the merger makes sense in terms of scale, we are watchful that margins could compress post the merger which could be a drag on the RoE. We maintain multiple at 3.6x but roll forward to FY24 ABV to arrive at a TP of Rs. 2,000. Maintain ‘BUY’.

After surging nine percent in the previous session, shares of HDFC Bank and HDFC fell on April 5 .

HDFC was quoting at Rs 2,640.65, down Rs 38.25 or 1.43 percent, and HDFC Bank was quoting at Rs 1,631.05, down Rs 25.40 or 1.53 percent on the BSE.

HDFC on April 4 said its board had approved merger into HDFC Bank expected by the second or third quarter of FY24.

""This is a merger of equals. We believe that the housing finance business is poised to grow by leaps and bounds due to the implementation of RERA, infrastructure status to the housing sector, and government initiatives like affordable housing for all,"" Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC, had said.

Check out what brokerages have to say about HDFC and HDFC Bank after the merger announcement:

Morgan Stanley

The proposed merger benefits both HDFC Bank and HDFC, while it would be EPS (earnings per share)-accretive in the first full year (FY25), CNBC-TV18 quoted Morgan Stanley as saying.

RoE (return on equity) falls in the near term given capital accretion, while loan growth pick-up would imply pre-merger RoE by FY26, it added.

KRChoksey

This transaction is beneficial to HDFC Bank in terms of increased housing portfolio in the overall loan book, scaling up technological capabilities further, leveraging the lower cost of funds and improved cross-selling opportunity.

We believe the bank will sustain the relative premium valuation compared to its peers due to the significant growth opportunity and strong prospects. Currently, the shares of HDFC Bank are trading at a P/Bv of 3.9x/3.5x/3.0x on FY22E/23E/FY24E.

We are working on the merger synergies and building them into our estimates; till then, we continue to assign a 3.7x P/Bv on FY24E adjusted book value of Rs 540, arriving at a target price of Rs 1,997 per share for HDFC Bank; implying an upside potential of 20.7 percent over current market price. Accordingly, we maintain the rating on the shares of HDFC Bank as “BUY”.

Prabhudas Lilladher

While the merger would seem attractive purely from a scale perspective we need to factor in some key variables. Firstly, the merged entity would need to adhere to CRR/SLR and PSLC requirements which would be a slight drag on the margins.

Secondly, HDFC Bank may not underwrite a chunk of developer loans that HDFC used to onboard which could be countered by addition of below-prime housing customer loans. Hence overall yields might compress. This would be offset by lower cost of funds owing to the bank’s access to CASA deposits.

On an operating level, branches in similar locations might be merged which could save on costs although for branches not present in common locations, transition costs would be incurred. Hence prima facie it seems that RoE for HDFC Bank could drop from current levels, immediately following the merger, although the merger would be positive from a scale and cross-sell standpoint. Rolling forward to FY24ABV we maintain multiple at 3.6x but raise target price to 2,000. Maintain Buy.

Elara Capital

HDFC will benefit the most from the merger as the overhang of succession gets resolved, holding company discount stands behind and RoE suppression is contained as also low-cost funding becomes accessible.

Factoring in the competition, changing lending rate environment and the company’s superior credit management skills, we expect HDFC to post 16% loan CAGR, 2.5% average NIM and 2.2% average GNPA in FY22E-24E.

This may translate into core book RoA of 1.9% and RoE of 12-13% in FY22E-24E.

At the current market price, the core book trades at 1.8x PABV FY24E, which we value at 2.9x PABV FY24E with SoTP-based target price of Rs 3,284. Maintain Buy.

The rally on April 4 helped the market rise to a two-and-half-month high backed by broad-based uptrend, positive global cues and the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger announcement.

The Nifty also surpassed the crucial 18,000 level, climbing more than 380 points to 18,053, forming a bullish candle on the daily chart, while the broader markets Nifty midcap and smallcap gained 1.6 percent each.

The country's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank witnessed the maximum action and was the biggest Nifty50 gainer, rising 10 percent to Rs 1,656.80 after the board members decided to merge HDFC with HDFC Bank.

Among other stocks that were in action include IndiaMART InterMESH which was the third-largest gainer in the futures & options segment, rising 8.3 percent to Rs 4,822.

Here's what Malay Thakkar of GEPL Capital recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank has broken out of a Cup & Handle pattern with a breakaway gap indicating the start of a new bullish trend. The stock formed a bullish candle with open-low formation with an increase in volumes. It also managed to break above the 200-day SMA (Rs 1,517).

The relative strength index (RSI) also confirmed the breakout and has moved above the 70-mark.

One can continue holding the stock, as we expect it to move higher towards Rs 1,785 followed by Rs 1,900; Rs 1,520-1,530 zone will act as an important support on the downside.

IndiaMART InterMESH

On the long term charts, IndiaMART has taken support at the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement (Rs 4,391) of the entire rally (Rs 940-Rs 9,975).

On the daily charts, we can see that the stock has broken above the 20-day SMA (Rs 4,404) and is at its four-week high.

The stock is also giving a falling trendline breakout and the RSI is signalling a positive divergence.

Traders and investors can continue holding the stock and can expect an immediate upside towards Rs 5,240 followed by Rs 5,550, while Rs 4,350-Rs 4,440 will act as a support zone on the downside.

Edelweiss Financial Services

On long-term charts, Edelweiss is moving in a downtrend with lower highs and lows formation. In the past three trading sessions, the stock has seen good price volume action and moved higher by about 25 percent.

Price action and technical parameters are indicating a possibility of a short-term up move towards Rs 68 followed by Rs 74.

We advise traders and investors to use the short-term up move to exit the stock. Downside support for the stock is placed at Rs 59.

Zuari Agro Chemicals

Zuari Agro Chemicals has given a multi-year breakout and is trading at the highest level since June 2019. In the current week, the stock has broken out after taking support from the 200-week SMA (Rs 140) and formed a bullish Marubozu candle on the weekly charts.

The RSI indicator across all timeframes—daily, weekly and monthly—is sustaining above the 60-mark, indicating strong momentum in the counter.

Investors can buy, hold and accumulate the stock and expect upside towards Rs 180 followed by Rs 215. Downside support is placed in the Rs 145-150 zone.

Ujjivan Financial Services

On long-term charts, Ujjivan Financial services is moving with lower highs and lows. Recently, it formed a double bottom near the Rs 100-mark and moved higher with rise in volumes.

As the stock has given a double bottom breakout on short-term charts, a pullback towards Rs 135 followed by Rs 142 looks possible.

Traders and investors should maintain a strict stop-loss of Rs 115 and use the up move towards Rs 135 followed by Rs 142 to exit the stock.

Analysts believe the merger of HDFC Bank with HDFC Investments Ltd and HDFC Holdings Ltd, two subsidiaries of Housing Development Corporation (HDFC), which too is merging with the bank, will have a considerable positive impact on the lender’s customers and the investors and also influence overall banking as well as the lending business of HDFC.

Most analysts are of the opinion that this merger will provide a cross-selling opportunity to the customers of both entities. “The share of longer-tenor secured assets will increase for HDFC Bank as mortgage loans are secured and generally longer-tenor in nature,” said Karan Gupta, director of India Ratings and Research.

In an earlier interview, banking consultant Ashvin Parekh said that if mergers of the banks are done with proper goals planned within a dedicated time frame, it will benefit the system.

Talking about the merger of HDFC twins, he added, “HDFC has been contemplating it for the past few years and they were examining if there could be some relief on the SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) sort of requirement and also on the priority sector kind of lending requirement. They have done it at an opportune time because the NBFC (non-banking financial company) business was coming under more regulatory scrutiny. In that backdrop, HDFC needed to analyse whether it would have been beneficial to continue as an NBFC or become a bank. Both the boards have evaluated it for a long time and worked out on goals and targets.”

Analysts pointed out that the HDFC entities have a huge market capitalisation and HDFC as a group has always rewarded investors well, a trend they see continuing.

“The merger goes well at a time when the economic cycle is going well for India,” said Parekh.

According to several analysts, this merger will be equally beneficial for both customers and the bank. “It could become a more formidable player in the housing finance market with this merger. Moreover, with better cost of funding, it will also help them grow their portfolio. Housing includes long-term assets so it will provide slightly longer stable assets for their portfolio and eventually get better cost of funding for the overall growth. So here is a benefit from the perspective of the bank,” said Prakash Agarwal, director and head, financial institutions, India Ratings and Research.

From the customer’s perspective, there could be some positive aspects that include better implementation of high-end technology to ensure better customer experiences.

“With this merger HDFC Bank gets an unparalleled advantage through the mortgage portfolio providing it a quantum leap in distribution to semi-urban and rural areas with a huge opportunity to cross-sell bank products to a very, very sticky client base.

The combined entity will be able to extract substantial synergy benefits which bodes well for all stakeholders and shareholders,” said Samir Bahl, CEO, investment banking at Anand Rathi Advisors.",479,0.9999748542904854

HDFC Bank has requested the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow it to adopt a phased approach in meeting key regulatory requirements after its merger with Housing Development and Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC).

The requirements include the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), or the percentage of deposits that banks have to invest in government bonds, and the cash reserve ratio (CRR), or the portion of deposits that banks must hold in liquid cash.

SLR is now 18 percent and CRR 4 percent.

The country’s largest private sector bank by asset size has also requested the regulator time to allow it to “grandfather” certain assets and liabilities of HDFC. Grandfathering is essentially exemption from a new regulation that may be introduced for a particular sector.

“The bank has requested Reserve Bank for a phased-in approach in respect of SLR and CRR, priority sector lending and grandfathering of certain assets and liabilities and in respect of some of its subsidiaries. These requests are under consideration by the RBI in terms of their letter to the bank dated April 1, 2022,” HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh said.

In a surprise move on April 4, the HDFC twins announced a long-anticipated merger between HDFC, India’s biggest home loan provider, and HDFC Bank, its most valuable lender.

After the completion of the transaction, HDFC will acquire a 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank and all subsidiaries of the housing financier will be owned by the latter.

Parekh said the rationale behind the merger included less onerous SLR and CCR requirements, a favourable interest rate regime, increased transparency in the realty sector, and giving mortgage customers access to a wider range of services.

“The merger makes the combined entity strong enough not only to counter competition but make the mortgage offering even more competitive,” Parekh said.

Parekh said it will take at least 12-18 months for the merger process to be completed given the need for multiple regulatory approvals.

Asked whether the bank’s subsidiary HDB Financial Services will continue to operate as a standalone unit, HDFC Bank MD and CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan said the bank would like to maintain it as a separate entity, “but if regulatory prescription suggests that we have to have an alternative thought process, we will comply.”

Jagadishan said that with the merger, the share of mortgage loans in HDFC Bank’s overall advances will increase. The bank will also be able to meet its priority sector lending target by focusing on affordable housing.

The bank has 15,000 business correspondents presently and with the addition of five more partners, will be able to expand its services to a larger number of customers.

The potential for cross-selling products to HDFC customers and lower cost of funds for the mortgage business will also be in favour of the bank, the management said.

In terms of asset quality, the merger will have minimal impact on the bank; retail bad loans will fall and non-performing assets (NPAs) extended to corporate customers may rise, Jagadishan told Moneycontrol.

He reckoned that the NPA ratio would be around 1.3 percent to 1.5 percent. As of December- end, the lender’s gross NPA ratio was 1.26 percent.",528,0.5973100304603577

HDFC Bank’s planned merger with its parent HDFC will make the bank twice the size of ICICI Bank, while bolstering market share and diversifying revenues, S&P Global Ratings said on Monday.

In the biggest merger in the corporate history, India’s largest housing finance company HDFC will merge with the country’s largest private lender HDFC Bank to create a banking behemoth.

S&P said the merger will likely result in significant market-share gains for HDFC Bank, given HDFC (the parent) is the largest financier of mortgages in India.

It will raise HDFC Bank’s loans by 42 per cent to Rs 18 lakh crore (USD 237 billion), increasing the bank’s market share to about 15 per cent, from 11 per cent currently.

""While HDFC Bank will remain the second-largest bank in India post-merger, it will be twice the size of ICICI Bank Ltd, the third-largest bank in the country. HDFC Bank’s larger balance sheet could enhance its wholesale lending opportunities,” it said.

State-owned SBI is the largest bank in the country.

The merger is subject to regulatory and other approvals and could take 12-18 months to complete, it said.

""HDFC Bank Ltd’s planned merger with its parent will boost the India-based bank’s market share and diversify its revenues,” S&P said in a statement.

It said HDFC Bank’s business profile will diversify after the merger and the merged entity will have one-third of its portfolio in mortgage loans, compared with a reported 11 per cent now.

S&P said the combined entity’s earnings could improve over the next three to five years and the merger will provide the bank with profitable cross-selling opportunities to HDFC’s large pool of customers.

""The merged bank will benefit from economies of scale and an improved ability to raise funds at competitive rates. It can also leverage HDFC Bank’s digital capabilities and distribution network to drive operational efficiencies,” it said.

S&P expects the combined entity’s capitalization and asset quality to be broadly in line with those of HDFC Bank on a standalone basis. S&P expects the combined entity’s capitalization and asset quality to be broadly in line with those of HDFC Bank on a standalone basis.

About 9 per cent of HDFC Ltd’s portfolio comprises loans to real estate developers, where the asset quality is weaker than for the rest of the bank’s portfolio.

India’s largest housing finance company HDFC is all set to merge with HDFC Bank in an all-stock deal to create a combined entity with a market value of around Rs 12.8 lakh crore.

Top management of HDFC and HDFC Bank as well as industry experts feel the mega-merger is a win-win for the two organisations, stakeholders, customers and even the economy. However, HDFC’s depositors and borrowers are bound to have certain doubts regarding the future of their long-term contracts.

Customers’ interests

What is clear is that the status quo will be maintained until the amalgamation takes effect, which could take anywhere between 12 to 18 months as the proposal will need to be approved by a host of regulators. These include the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), Pension Funds Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) and Competition Commission of India (CCI).

The management has indicated that the merger could take effect by Q3 or Q4 of FY24. “HDFC and HDFC Bank depositors will continue to get the rates that they have been getting. After the merger, there will be a harmonisation at the bank’s card rates,” Sashidhar Jagdishan, MD and CEO, HDFC Bank, told Moneycontrol. That is, depositors will be offered the bank’s rates after the merger comes into effect.

Until then, it will be status quo for borrowers and depositors. Currently, a deposit of less than Rs 2 crore with a tenure of two years and nine months will fetch you interest rates of 6.15-6.35 percent per annum. HDFC Bank offers interest rates of 5.2-5.7 percent per annum for comparable tenures.

HDFC’s distributors say that the top officials have been in touch with them and the transition is likely to be smooth.

“This is not the first time such a merger is set to take place. We have handled such situations before—for example, during Gruh Finance’s (erstwhile HDFC subsidiary) merger with Bandhan Bank, though this merger is on a much larger scale.

""We have been assured by HDFC and I am confident that the management will ensure that the transition is hassle-free. The branches could perhaps be allotted to HDFC depositors on the basis of their current addresses. The companies will work out the logistics,” says Hanoz Patel, Founder Partner, Power Pusher Financial Services LLP.

Depositors will have adequate time to make up their minds on letting their fixed deposits mature or renewing them at that juncture.

A switch to external benchmarking regime?

The home loan portfolio of HDFC, a housing finance company, will move to HDFC Bank, a banking entity.

While both are regulated by the RBI even now, banking rules differ on how retail home loans are benchmarked. Banks’ new floating-rate retail loans (sanctioned after October 1, 2019) are linked to an external benchmark , which in the case of most banks is the repo rate.

Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), on the other hand, do not have to link their retail loans to an external benchmark at present, though competition compels them to offer comparable rates.

“The combined entity will be a banking company, so banks’ regulatory framework will be applicable. So new customers of the merged entity will be offered external benchmark-linked rates. It is possible that HDFC’s existing customers will be given a choice to switch to this regime post the merger. These details will be clearer closer to the merger,” says former banker and financial counsellor VN Kulkarni.",615,0.9996144771575928

About his outlook when it comes to the bank’s fundamentals, Mukherjea told CNBC-TV18, “I have always said in the last three years that HDFC Bank has been stellar in the way it gained market share.

Asked whether the merger would be more beneficial for HDFC shareholders, Mukherjea agreed, saying the proposed merger will help leverage and create meaningful value for various stakeholders.

“HDFC shareholders are benefited due to HDFC Bank’s lower-cost funding base and established distribution network of the bank,” he said.

“Until now, since HDFC Bank didn’t have a mortgage book, they used to sell it to HDFC which needed to rotate it far quicker, and this was a disadvantage when compared with” the functioning of ICICI Bank, he said.

Listing other benefits for HDFC Bank from the merger, Mukherjea said, “HDFC Bank will now retain mortgage loans in its balance sheet. For the given amount of ROE, the cost incurred will be much lower. HDFC Bank holding on to home loans will be a big deal for shareholders.”

HDFC-HDFC Bank merger has been in the news for a while. In fact, back in 2015, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh had said his firm could consider a merger with HDFC Bank provided circumstances are in favour. But, the wait for the merger got longer with the parent putting the idea on the backburner saying the regulatory environment is not conducive.

Parekh had said that the merger makes sense provided there is no loss of value for shareholders and considering the business synergy between two institutions.

HDFC-HDFC Bank Merger LIVE

But, there is a question on the timing of the merger; why did they choose to do it now?

One key reason could be the emerging regulatory approach of the banking regulator to NBFCs. The benefit of continuing as an NBFC is nearly absent now compared with the older times.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been tightening regulations on the NBFC sector over years, grouping these entities into different categories based on size and interconnectedness and making capital norms stricter.

As per an RBI discussion paper released early last year, these layers bracket NBFCs according to their asset size and systemic interconnectedness.

The bigger ones are grouped in the upper layer while stringent regulations will apply to the middle layer as well. The top layer is reserved for companies that are perceived to carry elevated risks akin to the banks under the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework.

If these proposals are accepted as regulations, the top 25-30 NBFCs will have to gradually embrace bank-like regulations. That will minimise the benefit of lighter regulation they have enjoyed so far. NBFCs in the upper layer will have to comply with common equity Tier 1 capital regulations like commercial banks.

They need to maintain a 9 percent CET1 ratio. That apart, these NBFCs will have to comply with large exposure framework and listing regulations.

Clearly, the trigger for the new scale-based approach for NBFCs was aimed at disincentivizing non-banks from growing too big after the IL&FS and DHFL episodes. The regulator doesn’t want a parallel set of financial institutions growing in the financial system at par with the size of banks but enjoying lighter regulation. Also, the RBI wants to bring down the number of NBFCs in the banking system.

For HDFC, which is an NBFC, it makes sense to be part of the bank given the regulatory approach.

So, in a sense, what has aided the merger is the phased regulations from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which has bridged the gap of regulations between banks and non-banking finance companies. Larger NBFCs and banks aren’t very different from a regulatory perspective in terms of scrutiny and capital ratio requirements. Also, as Parekh said in the merger statement, a booming mortgage lending market offers opportunities for home loan lenders.

The Jagdishan factor?

HDFC Bank insiders say compared with the previous boss of the bank, Aditya Puri, his successor Sashidhar Jagdishan was more lenient to the idea of merger. Puri exited the bank in October, 2020. Jagdishan took charge as the new chief in October. “The change in leadership made it easier for the parent to proceed with the merger. At least that’s what the talk is,” said the insider who didn’t wish to be named.

Then there are other factors as well.

Obviously, the merger gives HDFC access to cheaper deposits as well. An NBFC typically raises funds at a higher rate from investors and money markets while a bank has access to public deposits that come at a much cheaper rate through current, savings accounts. That is certainly a beneficial factor for the merger.

What about investors? Prima facie, the deal looks good for investors.

As per the announcement today, every HDFC shareholder will get 42 shares of the bank for every 25 shares they hold.

“Looking from the shareholder’s perspective, it is a positive measure. Because, the shareholders of HDFC Ltd, who was having a holding company discount issue will benefit because the holding company discount will disappear. And for shareholders of HDFC Bank too, the synergy of the combined entity will benefit them,” said J N Gupta, former executive director at the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).

With the parent finally merging the bank, the resultant entity will emerge as a powerhouse in the Indian banking industry. The window for cross selling products and leveraging the strength of the combined balance sheet will give advantage to the combined entity.

Bigger money muscle

The merged entity, with a larger balance sheet will enable HDFC to turn even more aggressive in the market. It will be only second to the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) across all parameters. The combined entity will have a market cap of Rs 12.8 lakh crore and a balance sheet of Rs17.87 lakh crores. It will enable the HDFC Bank to undertake larger underwriting at scale.

HDFC Bank, on a standalone basis, had total advances of Rs 12.7 lakh crore while HDFC had Rs5.25 lakh crore. Of its total advance book, HDFC has 77 percent of its loans in the individual loan category. HDFC Bank, which has 28 percent of its loan book in retail and 26 per cent in corporate, can have the advantage of HDFC’s home loan clients joining the bank’s customers.

It also gives opportunities in cross selling of different products in the unsecured loan segment, insurance, credit cards to HDFC’s existing customers.

When will the merger process be completed?

There is still some time ahead. The merger, as guided by the parent, is expected to get completed by the second or third quarter of financial year 2024. The scheme of amalgamation will need approvals from SEBI, RBI, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) and Competition Commission of India (CCI). It will also require approvals from National Company Law Tribunals and finally will be filed with ROC.

With the HDFC-HDFC Bank merger, another giant is born in the Indian financial sector. SBI, the largest in terms of assets in the Indian banking industry, gets a bigger competitor.

The country’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank on Wednesday said the elevated stress on unsecured loan assets noticed during the COVID-19 pandemic is over, and the bank is upbeat about the segment now.

The unsecured lending book for the bank includes credit cards and personal loans.

According to HDFC Bank’s country head for consumer finance Parag Rao, the next two years present an interesting opportunity to grow in the segment, which is otherwise considered a bit risky.

Acknowledging that his bank also witnessed some elevation in asset quality woes from the unsecured segment during the pandemic, Rao clarified that the same was never at worrying levels.

""A large portion of the issues of the pandemic are gone,” he said, adding that customers seeking loans now are relatively better from the risk perspective.

Developments in the overall economy, where consumption is growing, make this a ""good phase"", and the bank looks at it as a good time to grow in this segment over the next 18-24 months.

Speaking at the launch of a co-branded credit card in association with retailer Shoppers Stop, Rao said the bank is targeting to increase the contribution of co-branded cards in its business over the medium term.

In terms of spends, it is targeting to almost double the share from co-branded cards to up to 30 per cent in the next three years from the present 15 per cent.

In terms of the number of cards, the share of co-branded cards is likely to go to over 35 per cent from the current 12 per cent, Rao said.

He said the bank is in talks with a number of players for partnerships, which include a multi-portfolio conglomerate, a telecom player, and exclusively digital offerings with dining and local mobility player.

At a time when the BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) trend is growing, especially fuelled by the fintechs, Rao said the exclusively digital credit card offering would be like the same.

He, however, said that BNPL’s efficacy for the bank will be limited to acquiring new customers, and it cannot be a tool to build a book.

Rao explained that a two-three month loan product like BNPL, which is driven by consumers’ impulsive buying behaviour, cannot be helpful in growing a book.

At present, the bank has 16 million credit cards, and is growing with the addition of around 5 lakh each month, Rao said, adding that it is on track to achieve its goals stated at the time of restarting credit card issuances after the RBI lifted its regulatory ban.

He said it will take about 6-9 months for the numbers to reflect the gains it is making, and claimed that internal data available to him suggests that they are on the way to achieve the targets on market share by number of cards and spends.

About the deal between Axis Bank and Citi, in which the third largest domestic lender is taking over the consumer business of the American lender, Rao opined that it will not change things much for the HDFC Bank.

About the bank’s partnership with Shoppers Stop, Rao said that his bank is targeting to sell 1 million cards in the next three years.

The retailer has 9 million consumers who can be the prospective users of the co-branded credit cards.

Launched in two variants, one of the cards comes with the annual charge of Rs 5,000, which also offers many freebies.",577,0.7744166718588935

The collaboration will allow Ather Energy customers to avail instant loans from the two private lenders at low-interest rates and with a maximum LTV (Loan-to-value), a release said.

The EV maker said its customers have preferred a 95 per cent LTV option while choosing a financing plan, with 2-3 years being the most preferred period for loan repayment.

The evolving EV industry has recorded significant growth in the past year, the company said, emphasising that it has witnessed a notable surge in demand for its 450 series, registering a sequential rise of 20 per cent.

Stating that finance penetration at Ather has grown significantly over the past two years, the company said it aims to provide a stress-free transition to EV ownership and ease of purchase for its customers.

IDFC and HDFC Bank offer loans to new-to-credit customers (those with no credit history), which account for roughly 20-25 per cent of the overall Ather customer base, it added.

This has become a critical segment since the company is expanding into Tier 2 and 3 cities, according to Ather Energy.

Automobiles in India are largely bought through finance options.

As many as eight out of 10 vehicles sold in India are two-wheelers, and finance plays a critical role in the purchase journey of a customer, the company said.

Finance penetration for two-wheelers in India is close to 50 per cent, Ather Energy said.

As per a recent report, the domestic two-wheeler loan market is expected to grow to USD 12.3 billion by 2025, the company said.

The demand for electric vehicles has grown exponentially over the past year.

The company has a strong focus on understanding consumer needs and providing multiple financing options for an easy transition to EV, said Ravneet Phokela, Chief Business Officer at Ather Energy.

""We are confident that our partnership with HDFC and IDFC First banks will ensure ease of purchase for customers and will boost the confidence of EV enthusiasts to join the electric revolution,” he said.

The company, he said, will continue to partner with leading banks, NBFCs, and financial institutions to provide lucrative financing options to its consumers.

IDFC First bank was an early adopter of the EV market and has established itself as a bankable partner for Ather’s customers, accounting for about 75 per cent of the company’s customer base, the release said.

""IDFC First Bank’s affordable loan offerings and end-to-end digitised customer journey will offer a distinct edge to Ather Energy’s customer financing experience, said Rishi Mishra, Business Head for vehicle loans at IDFC First Bank.

Despite several risks emerged in the second half, the market has delivered solid returns of 19 percent since last Holi festival though it is still 7.5 percent off its record highs reached in October 2021.

Every sector participated in the run with Metal and Power being the largest gainers with 56 percent and 59 percent returns, respectively, followed by IT and Realty that surged 37 percent each. Oil & Gas, Capital Goods, Energy and Healthcare indices gained 16-32 percent, while Auto, Finance and FMCG underperformed others, registering 8-9 percent gains.

Consistent buying by DIIs amid hopes of strong earnings growth and economic growth ahead despite margin pressure in some sectors in the short term on rising commodity prices, and continuity in low interest rate environment still supported the market, though huge FII selling amid expectations of faster policy tightening by global central banks including Federal Reserve, and sharp rising in commodity prices (including oil and metals) and sanctions imposed on Russia by western world after Russian invasion of Ukraine capped the gains in second half.

The broader markets also participated in the run with BSE Midcap index rising 19 percent and Smallcap index climbing 37 percent.

Experts expect the volatility in next few months to continue due to Ukraine-Russia war and sanctions imposed on Russia, but having positive view on the market for the medium-to-long-term perspective, they advised buying quality stocks on every major dip and expect at least 10-15 percent market gains by next Holi.

He further says rather than worrying about the risks, he would use this macro uncertainty to pick up good businesses which continue to grow cash flows, reinvest capital and gain market share. ""There are multiple businesses that are doing this, and our focus would be on the micro.""

Here are nine picks (mix of largecap, midcap, and smallcap) suggested by the market experts and portfolio managers that can be added to your portfolio to gain healthy returns by next Holi:

Expert: Sonam Srivastava, Founder, Wright Research

HDFC Bank

In a rising interest rate environment, banks stand to gain the most as banks and financial organizations have significant cash holdings due to customer balances and business activities that would yield high interest. On a company-specific level, recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lifted all restrictions on HDFC Bank, permitting it to launch new digital initiatives.

As a result, the loan growth has picked up, and an uptick in net interest income (NII) growth is a big positive. We expect a market share in credit cards to stabilize and improve asset quality trends for HDFC Bank.

The bank has a reasonable valuation with high return on equity (ROE) from the valuation perspective. HDFC Bank has maintained a consistent profit growth for many years and has excellent projections.

Tata Elxsi

Tata Elxsi is a multibagger midcap IT stock that outperformed last year. Tata Elexi offers end-to-end engineering solutions to their clients. Tata Elxsi is valued on the pricier side, but the revenue and profit growth is among the highest in the sector for these stocks, and it also maintains a good profit margin.

It has a good ROE and a lot of cash on hand to spend on Capex. Companies across the globe are investing in R&D to produce enticing products, which improves the prospects for an engineering research & development company like Tata Elxsi. Tata Elxsi plans to focus on electric, automated, and connected vehicles (EACV), 5G, Medical Electronics, AI & ML-driven innovative solutions, etc., in the future.

The high-interest rate environment that can inflate the currency Tata Elexi is attractive because of its global exposure.

Tata Steel

Tata Steel has been the buzzing stock for the last year due to the upcycle in metal prices. Tata Steel is one steel sector stock that has outperformed all others. With the rising profitability due to rising steel prices, Tata Steel has cleared a lot of debt from its balance sheet and deleveraged.

The Russia Ukraine crisis has also made this stock attractive as it is serving as an alternate to the Russian-made steel for European customers. Tata Steel has a significant European presence, contributing to a bulk of revenues.

In terms of fundamentals, the valuations are below the industry average, and the profit growth has been exceptional. We expect Tata Steel to have robust prospects with a global focus on infrastructure.

Expert: Divam Sharma, Founder at Green Portfolio

Valiant Organics

The larger the distortion the more attractive the stock is. Valiant Organics has been a story we have been following for several years that is in the specialty chemicals space.

The fundamentals of the company have continuously unravelled, and yet the price has been on a decline. Zooming in, the company is producing negative cash, because the revenues are being ploughed into capex, and this capex will prove to be of tremendous value when the manufacturing begins in these new plants.

Most if not all the capex is oriented to manufacturing chemistries that are in direct competition to what China has been supplying. Solid margins, low debt, extremely comfortable valuations, and upcoming capacity ramp-up support our overall thesis.

KSB

KSB is an MNC available at comfortable valuations. The company manufactures pumps and valves for various industries.

The compelling rhetoric is the utility of these pumps. One of the segments their pipes find utility is in the FGD (flue gas desulphurization system) and nuclear space. The installation of FGD pumps in coal-powered plants is a necessity now and the company staging themselves to be a large beneficiary with the timely capex.

With the company's steady and strong order book; up trending fundamentals; healthy cashflows; and double-digit margins, we have a high conviction on its long-term performance.

Adani Wilmar

Adani Wilmar commands an 18.3 percent market share in edible oil. The company is the biggest oleo synthetic producer in India.

Considering ambitious plans, we expect food and industry essential business to grow for the company over the coming quarters.

The stock looks attractive at current valuations.

Expert: Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services

ICICI Bank

ICICI Bank continues to witness strong growth in retail deposits and has succeeded in building a robust liability franchise over the past few years.

The bank enjoys one of the lowest funding costs among private banks, which enables it to underwrite profitable business without taking undue Balance Sheet risk.

We expect slippages to moderate significantly over FY22-24 and credit cost of 1.2 percent and 1.1 percent in FY22 and FY23 respectively for ICICI Bank.

ICICI Bank continues to remain top pick in the sector given its journey to deliver solid return ratios and growth.

Macrotech Developers

Lodha is one of the largest real estate developers in India, benefitting from the recent demand pick-up and the optimism behind the expected upcycle.

Macrotech Developers is expected to benefit from: a) its around Rs 20,000 crore of completed and near-complete inventory, b) Rs 4,000 crore of QIP money to enable healthy JV/JDA (joint venture/joint development greement) deal addition, c) monetization of industrial land banks and ready commercial projects, and 4) substantial deleveraging potential through robust cash flow.

Lodha is our top pick for its favourable balance between growth potential, improving financial strength, and compelling valuations.

Zensar Technologies

The deal pipeline is strong, comprising a large number of small- and medium term deals, and the management is confident about the deal momentum given the rich demand environment.

The management expects the EBITDA margin to remain in the mid-teens for the next 3–4 quarters before reverting to the high teens as the strategy execution is completed. It further highlighted that decreasing reliance on sub-contractors would be another margin lever.

The addition of 1 client each in the $10 million+ and $20 million+ buckets in Q3 indicates Zensar's progress in diversifying its client base. Since Ajay Bhutoria assumed the reins as CEO, Zensar has doubled its $20 million+ accounts to 4 that was stagnant for last 4 years. Reducing exposure to its top client is also a positive as this lowers the concentration risk.

We believe that its new sales-led strategy should help the company return to the high-teen organic growth path in FY23. We estimate USD revenue growth of 21.8 percent for FY23, up from 15.4 percent in FY22, led by sustained deal inflow and a good exit to FY22.

HDFC Bank, India’s largest private sector lender, is on an aggressive drive to recover lost ground in the credit card business. On March 11, the Reserve Bank of India lifted a ban imposed on the bank in December 2020, allowing the lender to launch digital products.

In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol on March 16, HDFC Bank’s group head of payments, consumer finance and digital banking, Parag Rao, said the bank has used the interim period to relook at fault areas and revamp strategy.

Rao is optimistic the bank can get back lost market share in cards in 2-3 quarters. Rao also spoke about digital initiative plans in FY23 and on forming a digital-only bank. Edited excerpts:

Q: The RBI had barred HDFC Bank from issuing credit cards and launching fresh digital initiatives in December 2020. What are the lessons learned?

A: We are thankful to the RBI for pointing out some of the areas where we needed to improve. HDFC Bank has consistently grown quarter on quarter. I will not delve into our track record of growth… We have set a legacy of good track record of growth and we continue growing and we have aggressive plans to grow.

They key thing that emerged out of this embargo and the comments made by the RBI was that we have no problem with your ambition to grow and you should grow because that is the whole job of financial services players, to spread out financial services to India, but please make sure that you build your systems and invest adequately in your infrastructure to sustain that growth. That is the crux.

Q: How did the bank use the ban period with respect to the digital banking division?

A: We used this time to re-introspect, relook our strategy and revamp. Even during (former managing director Aditya) Puri’s tenure, we had started on our process of digitisation. There are two phases to our chain – first is digitisation and the second is digital journey. Digitisation is essentially taking existing processes and making them digital. And the digital journey is revamping the entire infrastructure, building digital platforms, digital abilities, competencies and getting new types of digital skillsets in terms of the people.

So that, effectively, is what we call our digital transformation Digital 2.0. It is a three-year journey as we have laid out in our roadmap. It is a combination of short-term, medium term and long-term goals and milestones we have laid out.

Q: Could you elaborate more on the preparations?

A: We used this interim period to relook, refurbish a lot of upgrading of systems, which is still work in progress, and digital transformation is still ongoing. It is complex, it is time-consuming because I cannot afford to have a strategy which says shut down one system, wait for some time and then start the new system. You have to fly the plane and you yourself have to fix the plane. That makes the transformation journey a little more time-consuming.

It also makes it complex because you are talking of three or four moving pieces at the same time. One is you are building new digital properties, while the other is that you are modernising existing infrastructure. Nowadays, you have new sets of people coming in who have digital skillsets and ensuring that they synergise and work together, and the fourth bit is you are enhancing ways and means of working towards digital… We are about one-third of the way through the journey and we will complete it.

Q: Should more money go into strengthening digital banking technology?

A: It is not that we were spending less. Even if you take our previous three years’ expenditure from the balance sheet, it is in line with the percentage of opex with most large organisations. I think the key thing was our growth was outpacing investments. And so, on an incremental basis across existing infrastructure, new platforms, skills, competency and people, we will be spending a significantly higher amount over the next three years to build this whole edifice and make us ready for the next 5-10 years.

It is a little difficult for me to share numbers, but it is substantially higher on an incremental basis... on an aggregate basis, the range of increase would be anywhere between 1.25 times to 1.75 times what we did earlier.

Q: Could you throw some light on the new digital initiatives in the offing?

A: We will be launching a completely digital, available on-the-fly credit card with a completely new scalable stack. We have already soft-launched, but we will go to the market in an aggressive way with our merchant app, which is called smart app Vyapar. This will go in the market and become a large engine of growth targeted at medium and small merchants… we soft-launched a very interactive customer layer working with Adobe… we have soft-launched it for internal customers on some products. We want to make it much larger for all the products of the bank and take it to the marketplace.

We are revamping our SMA platform… We are revamping our customer CRM platforms… we will do all of these over the next two to three quarters.

Q: So, the lifting of the RBI embargo is good news…

A: Fundamentally, I am saying that the lifting of the embargo now gives us the freeway to go to the market with these new products and offerings… At the end of three years, we would like to be seen as a completely tech-led digital bank which continues to be the market leader in the Indian space.

Q: How will you make up for lost growth in the credit card business?

A: We were out of the market for, from a calendar perspective, nine months. Now, that is close to a year… Before the embargo, we were 300,000 cards a month, so you can figure out the kind of void in the marketplace. Obviously, other players have stepped in to fill that space and each one’s market share is recalibrated to that extent.

Having said this… we have already started ramping up our numbers. We exceeded our pre-embargo run-rate already. The cards which we have issued in the last six month will now start contributing to the portfolio going forward… over the next two to three quarters you will see us recovering our market share.

Q: Credit cards are unsecured, what is the strategy to limit defaults?

A: We have not changed our strategy. Even pre-embargo, 75 to 80 percent of the sourcing used to happen on our internal existing customers base. Of that 75 to 80 percent, almost 65 percent were salaried persons and the balance self-employed. The balance 20 to 25 percent were sourced through the open market, via multiple channels. In the open market, again the bias was towards salaried customers versus self-employed customers.

Even now, that mix has not changed. It will continue today. That mix has helped us achieve probably one of the best portfolios in the industry in terms of both engagement and spend and also in terms of delinquency, so that strategy continues.

Q: What is your approach to fresh risk when it comes to loan growth?

A: We are growing currently with the same credit policy. There is no additional risk we are taking. We have just ramped up our numbers so the quality of the portfolio in future will be the same, if not better than what we have already. We are not taking incremental risks. That gives us the confidence to tell you that it is a tried and tested credit policy which we have deployed over the years.

Q: Instances of digital frauds are on the rise. Does this worry you?

A: It is an irony that in this digital world, when nimbleness, agility and speed are important, fraudsters are actually faster than everyone else. But having said this, we are a large, regulated entity. It is incumbent upon us, as part of our own regulatory framework, that we build in a significant amount of safety, security, and fraud-prevention measures and that is audited by the RBI. We have a comprehensive 360-degree view of fraud.

Q: Can you explain this a bit more?

A: For example, in our mobile banking app, we are implementing a security wrapper, which cannot allow a fraudster to spoof or create a fake page on your app – it will be rejected. It will also tell you that you are in an area where you have an unsecured Wi-Fi connection, so please change your connection. We ensure that the network on which transactions flow is encrypted completely. It is a completely end-to-end encrypted network… We have a traditional PRM (Partner relationship management) where suspicious transactions are monitored using AML at the backend (Anti-money laundering)… we built in extremely strong KYC (know your customer) and AML features to ensure identity theft and things like spoofing do not happen. These are all inbuilt into our processes and audited by the RBI.

Approximately 20-25 percent of our expenditure goes into risk and fraud-mitigation measures, so it is a substantial amount. And we are constantly on the ball… In the area of spoofing, DDOS (distributed denial of service), attacks which happen on the internet, etc, we have multiple firewalls being laid. In fact, people complain we have so many checks and measures that it slows down the network. But it is a fine balance between security and convenience.

Q: There are reports that say HDFC Bank is keen on forming a digital-only bank…

A: Will I like to get there? The answer is yes. But we do not know, and we are studying the market to see whether India is ready for a neo-bank which is a completely zero-touch, digital bank. In the interim, what we are doing is experimenting with individual products which will be completely digital.

We have the stack ready to launch a neo-bank, but we want to do it carefully, in the right manner. So whether it be a credit card, or an account or a loan, we will give you a completely zero-touch experience.

Once we see the customer response to these products, I need to also service you digitally without a walk-in branch and all I need is to bring them together in one package and it theoretically becomes a neo-bank. So we have plans, although we want to study the market first.",1743,0.44571287356890166

Sharekhan's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank over the weekend communicated through the exchanges that RBI has lifted the restrictions imposed on it, pertaining to new initiatives under digital 2.0. This addresses a key overhang on the stock as the bank was unable to continue its role out of new digital initiatives and there on was losing on market share to its competitors. Previously, RBI in December 2020 had barred HDFC Bank to stop all launches of its upcoming digital business-generating activities and sourcing of new credit card customers after repeated outages at its data centre which impacted operations. The curbs were partially lifted in August 2021, where the bank was allowed to issue new credit cards. However, the bar on the digital front continued. Eventually, this has now been removed. HDFC bank has further added that it has drawn plans to meet the evolving digital requirements of customers during the embargo period. The bank added 2.1 lakh new credit cards m-o-m in January 2022 and it has 1.6 crore cards outstanding. The bank has demonstrated a healthy traction in the loan book growth driven by retail book aided by pick-up in the unsecured segments and commercial baking segment. With the removal of the digital embargo, we believe the bank is poised to grow its assets with much strong aggression.

Outlook

The stock trades at 2.8x/2.4x its FY2023E and FY2024E book value. It has corrected by 20% from the high of Rs. 1,724 which offers a good opportunity at lower levels. Hence, we maintain a Buy with an unchanged price target of Rs. 1,973.

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank (HDFCB) has exhibited a healthy revival in retail loan growth propelled by a pick-up in unsecured segments while the commercial banking segment has also witnessed strong traction. These have enabled a recovery in NII growth and will support Margin/PPoP growth – both of which have likely bottomed out in our view. The bank has been expanding its presence in the Semi-urban and Rural (SURU) regions, which is enabling it to capitalize on the growth opportunities. HDFCB is steadily becoming the largest lender in MSME financing. HDFCB maintains a healthy market share across digital channels – 18% share in POS terminals, 9%/27% in debit/credit card spends, and 23% in o/s credit cards as of 9MFY22. About 96% of the transactions occur digitally that enable a strong control on cost ratios. Asset quality remains robust with credit costs undershooting the long-term trend. HDFCB is thus increasing the contingency buffers prudently, which provide comfort. We expect the bank to deliver a healthy business growth fueled by a pick-up in retail (unsecured products) business and continued strength in commercial banking business.



Outlook

We estimate HDFCB to report ~18% PAT CAGR over FY22-24, with an RoA/ RoE of 2.0%/17.5% in FY24E, respectively. The stock has undergone a significant correction and is trading at ~2SD below its 10- year average valuations, while the growth and earnings outlook remains robust. HDFCB continues to be our high conviction BUY in the banking space and we retain our TP of INR2,000 (premised on 3.4x FY24E ABV + INR127 from subsidiaries). Our TP implies 51% potential upside from the current level.

Equity market capitalisation dropped to a seven-month low in February, with the top 10 companies losing a whopping Rs 3,33,307.62 crore in market valuation last week. The total equity market capitalisation (m-cap) in February 2022 stood at Rs 2,49,97,053.39 crore.

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has quashed a SEBI order against HDFC Bank, whereby the regulator had imposed a penalty of Rs 1 crore on the lender in a case pertaining to invoking securities pledged by stockbroker BRH Wealth Kreators.

In addition, the regulator had directed to transfer Rs 158.68 crore along with seven per cent interest per annum into an escrow account till the issue of settlement of clients’ securities is reconciled.

These directions were issued by SEBI in January 2021 as HDFC Bank invoked securities pledged by BRH Wealth Kreators in violation of the regulator’s interim order passed in October 2019.

Following the SEBI’s order, HDFC Bank moved to SAT.

In its order on Friday, SAT said the bank was justified in invoking the pledge made by the broker BRH.

While invoking the pledge the bank did not violate any direction contained in SEBI’s interim order.

""The appellant (HDFC Bank) could invoke the pledge under Depositories Act and is not required to approach any forum or Court of law for invocation of the pledge. The assets of the broker do not include pledge of the shares created by the sub-broker,” SAT said.

The tribunal noted that the pledge was created by the broker BRH under the Depositories Act in favour of HDFC Bank.

According to SAT, once a pledge is validly created by the broker in favour of the appellant (HDFC Bank) and the appellant is recorded as the beneficial owner in the records maintained by the depository, the beneficial owner becomes the registered owner.

Consequently, if a default is committed by the broker, the appellant gets a right to invoke the pledge under the agreement, it added.

""Nothing has come on record to indicate that the invocation of the pledge by the appellant was wrongly done as there was no default committed by the broker,” SAT said.

Accordingly, the tribunal said that SEBI’s order ""cannot be sustained and is quashed"".",327,-0.7084753513336182

Srikanth Nadhamuni has tendered his resignation as the Non-Executive (Non-Independent) Director on the Board of HDFC Bank and it shall be effective from February 18.

In a letter addressed to the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the bank, Nadhamuni cited reasons of conflict of interest that may arise with the bank and a company in which he is interested and hence he decided to resign from the post.

""There may be potential future transactions/ arrangements which may materialize in the near future between the Bank and a company in which I am interested. I have disclosed this interest to the Bank in terms of the

relevant laws and the same has been noted by the Board.

In the spirit of the highest corporate governance principles of the Bank, I would like to step down as director of the Bank in order to preclude any instances of potential conflict of interest which may arise on account of such transactions/ arrangements as regards my directorship with the Bank"", his letter read.

HDFC Bank has also taken cognizance of Nadhamuni's resignation in a BSE filing. ""Nadhamuni’s resignation letter has been duly noted by the Board of Directors at its meeting held today.

Fintech Slice said on February 14 that it had completed its maiden employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) buyback worth Rs 65 crore. Around 60 of both former and existing employees are eligible for the buyback, the startup added.

The Tiger Global-backed startup currently provides a Visa card focused on millennials which allows customers to pay for their purchases in three instalments. Slice's card issuance spiked from 20,000 in January 2021 to 200,000 per month currently led by the growing appetite for credit in India.

Slice founder and CEO Rajan Bajaj said, ""Our team's relentless passion and hard work has been instrumental in our rapid growth. This buyback plan is our little way of saying 'thank you' to our teams who have not only contributed to Slice but also to the larger financial ecosystem.""

Slice said that an average of Rs 1.2 crore has been paid out to eligible existing and former employees in this initiative.

Startups issue ESOPs as a tool to attract and retain talent. It has become all the more significant in the current context, amid the unprecedented war for talent.

As part of the budget announcements, startups had sought relief on the tax structure for ESOPs which was not granted. It is now taxed twice- during the time of exercise and time of sale. The startup ecosystem had sought that they be taxed only at the time of sale and not at the time of exercising.

While ESOPs faced flak for not providing enough liquidity, 2021 bucked the trend. Multiple startups in India including Cred, Swiggy, Byju's, Meesho, BharatPe, UpGrad, among others announced ESOP buybacks cumulatively worth $440 million, an eight-fold jump compared to the previous year, according to data from Entrackr.

In November 2021, Slice entered the unicorn club after raising $220 mn in its Series B fundraise co-led by Tiger Global and Insight Partners. The startup says it has registered a 40 percent month-on-month growth and has over 7 million registered users.

Slice's 'super card' serves as a simpler alternative for credit cards with lower credit limits making more people eligible to avail the benefits of paying later. The company's monthly issuance is now in-line with leading banks like HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank that issue anywhere between 2,00,000 to 3,00,000 credit cards per month.

The Bengaluru-based startup plans to invest in technology and product design and add more products starting with Unified Payments Interface (UPI) which is slated for launch in 2022.

The New Umbrella Entity (NUE) which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had accepted applications for in March 2021 is delayed, but the plan is still on, clarified Governor Shaktikanta Das.

After applications poured in from consortiums comprised of top conglomerates, payments players and banks, RBI has shared no updates on the evaluation of the applicants.

""I agree there has been some delay on that. That is primarily because the same officials who are dealing with that issue (NUE) are preoccupied with other works. We are evaluating it,"" said Das in his interaction with the media after the monetary policy announcement.

The NUE, like the NPCI is supposed to be responsible for setting up, managing and operating new retail digital payment systems. It will also manage clearing and settlement systems and undertake initatives to strengthen the digital payments ecosystem in the country. The RBI has received applications from around six consortiums for setting up the entity.

The first consortium includes Facebook, Google, SoHum Bharat along with Jio Platforms. The Tata Group, too, is leading a consortium with Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, Airtel Digital, Flipkart, Mastercard and PayU.

The third consortium includes e-commerce giant Amazon, with ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Visa, Pine Labs and BillDesk. Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma had confirmed that the payments player is also in the fray with Ola Financial, Policybazaar, IndusInd Bank, among others.

However, there have been a few concerns around the data storage and localisation norms, besides the lack of clarity on what revenue model will the new entity have.

NPCI functions as a not-for-profit organisation and both the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and RuPay debit cards attract Zero-MDR as per government norms, i.e. banks, payment service providers, UPI players and NPCI do not earn any share from transactions through these modes.

A competing entity charging MDR for any different products may not be able to compete, and will have to adhere to the Zero-MDR norm if it decides to share the load of UPI transactions, according to industry sources.

""There is still some clarity needed on the revenue model. If there is no revenue, how will there be competition? Plus, there are concerns around the data security and storage norms. So that is why there has been a delay, these questions are on the minds of the regulator as well as applicants,"" said a source within the banking industry on the condition of anonymity.

According to the draft framework by the RBI, the NUE shall have a minimum paid-up capital of Rs 500 crore and no single promoter or promoter group shall have more than 40 percent investment in the capital of the NUE. A minimum net worth of Rs 300 crore shall be maintained by the entity at all times.",471,-0.9999894499778748

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank reported in-line PAT of Rs103bn, up 18% yoy. However, core margins remained flat qoq at 4.1%. This has been an irritant in the past few quarters, mainly due to slow retail growth and an unfavorable portfolio mix. Core fee growth was also relatively moderate, but largely offset by better treasury gains/bad debt recovery. Credit growth improved further to 16.7% yoy/5% qoq, mainly led by commercial & rural banking (up 29% yoy/6%) and bounce-back in corporate book (7.5% yoy/4.5% qoq). Retail growth remains sub-optimal at 14% yoy/4.5% qoq, dragged by VF. That said, the pick-up in PL and card business in Q3 is positive, and might support NIMs, going forward. Asset quality continued to improve, with the GNPA ratio down by 9bps qoq to 1.26%, while NNPA remained industry-best at 0.4%. The RSA pool has come off by Rs28bn to Rs175bn/1.4%, of which nearly 50% was contributed by slippages. The bank expects limited relapse risk from RSA pool, with economy opening up and better customer quality.

Outlook

The stock has underperformed after the management change, more so due to the RBI's embargo on its card/digital initiatives and Covid-induced disruption. With growth trends improving and asset-quality well under control with strong buffers in place, we expect HDFCB to report healthy return ratios (RoE @ 17-18%). Retain Buy/OW in EAP with a TP of Rs2,050 (3.5x Dec FY23E ABV + subs valuation of Rs76).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB’s PAT at Rs103.42bn was marginally higher than estimate (PLe: R101.53bn), led by a better than expected NII growth of 13% YoY on the back of healthy loan growth of 16.5% YoY. NII traction remained lower than loan growth for some time now due to high B/S liquidity & non-retail focus. In our view, HDFCB has faced challenges in maintaining loan growth momentum leading to slower NII growth. Said that, improving traction in retail and commercial & rural banking is expected to improve loan & fees coupled with contained slippages will lead to improvement in overall earnings.

Outlook

We believe that bank has a strong balance sheet with PCR of 70% and ability to absorb higher credit losses, comfortable contingency provisions and restructured stock at <1.5%. With higher earnings visibility leading to superior ROEs of 17-18% over FY23-FY24E, HDFCB stands as one of the best placed in the industry. We reiterate BUY with unchanged TP of Rs1,870 retaining our target multiple at 3.6x Sep-23 ABV.

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB reported an in line quarter, with NII/PPOP growth of 13%/10.5% YoY. PAT grew 18% YoY to INR103.4b (in line). Profitability stood stronger despite the bank creating additional provisions of INR9b, taking the total buffer to ~INR86.4b (~70bp of loans). The bank witnessed a healthy pickup in business as loans grew 5.2% QoQ. The Retail segment grew 13.3% YoY, while Commercial and Rural Banking rose at a robust 29.4%. CASA deposits grew 24.6% YoY and the mix now stands at 47.1% (+30bp QoQ). On the asset quality front, GNPA/NNPA ratio improved by 9bp/3bp QoQ to 1.26%/0.37%, with slippages at INR46b (1.6% of loans). The restructured book moderated to ~1.4% of loans (v/s 1.5% in 2QFY22). The management said the net impact of the restructured book on NPAs is likely to be 10-20bp. Healthy provision coverage, along with a contingent provision buffer, provides comfort on asset quality.

Outlook

Healthy provisioning coverage and a contingent provision buffer provide comfort on asset quality. Pick up in loan growth, particularly Retail, would aid NII and margin, which would drive profitability in the coming quarters. We estimate HDFCB to deliver ~20% PAT CAGR over FY22-24E, with a RoA/RoE of 2.1%/18.1% in FY24E. We maintain our Buy rating with a TP of INR2k (3.6x Sep’23E ABV + INR119 from its subsidiaries).

HDFC Bank Ltd, India’s most valuable private sector lender is on its way back to delivering above-average balance sheet growth with pristine asset quality it is known for. That does not mean the lender would reach its destination without breaking a sweat.

HDFC Bank’s Q3FY22 was a mixed bag with core operating performance yet to reach its past prime. Net interest income growth remained around 14 percent, a decelerated expansion level post the pandemic. Operating expenses were up 14 percent sequentially which analysts believe has scope to reduce in the coming quarters. To be sure, the bank should be cut some slack here as the expenses were towards beefing up digital capabilities to capture growth. Given the expenses and more muted earnings, operating profit growth of 10.5 percent didn’t exactly elicit excitement. That said, the bank reported a healthy 18% net profit growth on a reduced provisioning level. The upshot is that the bottomline growth remained stable.

What has analysts worrying is the tepid fee income growth. This is where the lender is yet to alleviate all concerns. Fee income growth of 9 percent was disappointing for the December quarter, point out analysts. “We are a tad disappointed by just 9% YoY growth in fees that was dragged by lower credit card fees - especially lower revolver/ drawdown fees, but management expects growth to improve with improved card-usage following lifting of RBI's embargo,” wrote those at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd in a note.

Analysts at CLSA believe that the bank would be able to reverse this in the coming quarters. HDFC Bank gets about a quarter of its fee income from its credit card business. With the ban lifted in August by the regulator, the bank has seen a jump in its credit card issuances but spends are yet to improve significantly. For Q3FY22, credit card outstanding grew by 11 percent year-on-year and 8% sequentially. In short, the bank is getting customers but not big borrowers. What’s more, this is yet to show up on fees.

The outlook on card spends is unclear given the resurgence in COVID infections and the regional restrictions in activity. But that should not discourage the lender’s investors. Overall the loan book grew at a healthy 16 percent for Q3FY22 mostly driven by retail and small business loans. Notably, HDFC Bank saw its commercial banking segment growth jump to 30 percent. Indeed, the management commentary had enough enthusiasm to ward off worries over growth. Chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan said that the bank foresees strong growth in almost all loan segments. “We will continue to capture market share,” he said on an analyst call on Saturday post the results.

True, HDFC Bank needs to fix its core and fee income growth but for now its loan book expansion has enough to cheer about. Further, buttressing profitability is its asset quality. Gross bad loans were down to 1.26 percent of loan book from 1.34 percent a year ago. The bank’s restructured loan pile fell 2.8 percent sequentially to Rs 17,500 crore. Lower stress entails lower provisions. That said, its provisioning coverage ratio stands in excess of 70 percent and analysts believe that along with contingency provisions, HDFC Bank is well insured against future risks.

HDFC Bank saw its premium tag chip away in 2021 because of the pandemic and a ban on the most lucrative credit card issuance. The lender is back on the card market but it still needs to look out for pandemic risks.",585,0.4321057200431824

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company:

Macquarie

The research house has kept an outperform call with a target of Rs 2,005 as the numbers were in line, driven by lower provisions.

The bank is a top pick in the sector and the research house is not worried about weak pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) growth.

Nomura

The brokerage house has maintained a buy call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,955 as asset quality is better, recovery continues, while core PPoP was weak.

Nomura forecast 17.7 and 15.2 percent EPS and BV CAGRs over FY21-24 respectively.

Credit Suisse

It has kept an outperform rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1,950 as it believes the company is well-positioned for delivering healthy earnings.

Growth recovery and benign asset quality is driving up return on equity.

It tweaked FY22-24e EPS by 1% adjusting for lower credit cost and fees.

JPMorgan

JPMorgan has kept overweight rating and raised the target price to Rs 2,100.

The operating profit was a miss, offset by lower provisions, while net interest margin can have an upside in FY23.

Overall, there is a good earnings print with traction improving on loan growth, while valuations at below long cycle mean P/B & P/E levels are attractive.

The bank should continue to deliver low-risk sustained compounding.

CLSA

Broking firm CLSA has maintained a buy rating with a target price of Rs 2,025 as the asset quality beat forecast but small core fee was a miss.

The commentary indicates retail and commercial growth will continue to remain strong. CLSA forecast an 18% earnings CAGR over FY22-24

Sharekhan

We believe that the bank is on an accelerated path with robust advances growth aided by retail and commercial segments and better asset quality.

Advances are likely to clock a CAGR of 17% over FY22E to FY24E. The continuous building up of digital infrastructure and franchise network is likely to bode well for growth.

We believe that the bank now has sufficient drivers in terms of asset quality, reasonable provision buffers and appropriate asset mix to drive growth. We maintain a buy rating with a revised price target of Rs 1,973.

Motilal Oswal

The bank continues to deliver strong business growth versus its peers, resulting in market share gains. This was led by a healthy pickup in the retail segment, while growth in commercial and rural banking remains robust.

Earnings were in line, despite additional contingent provisions. Asset quality ratios have improved, while the restructured book too moderated to 1.4% of loans.

We estimate HDFC Bank to deliver 20% PAT CAGR over FY22-24E, with a RoA/RoE of 2.1%/18.1% in FY24E. We maintain our buy rating with a target price of Rs 2,000 (3.6x Sep’23E ABV + Rs 119 from its subsidiaries).

LKP Research

HDFC Bank is expected to outperform the sector led by 1) healthy growth in operating income, 2) much higher provision than regulatory requirement in the balance sheet, 3) strong capital cushion of 17.4% at CET1 level and d) best in class underwriting and risk management practices.

Given these strengths, we expect HDFC Bank to remain one of the best among all the lending business. Thus, we continue to maintain buy rating on the bank with a target price of Rs 2,039 (based on 4xFY23E Price to Adjusted Book Value).

At 09:17 hrs HDFC Bank was quoting at Rs 1,550.55, up Rs 5.30 or 0.34 percent on the BSE.

Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital

After a correction of around 12 percent from the top of 18,604 levels, the Nifty has bottomed out near 16,400 - 16,370 zone which coincides with 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of previous advance from 14,151 – 18,604 levels and moved up with the formation of Higher Top Higher Bottom pattern. Also it has sustained above its 5-week high which indicates the Nifty has resumed its uptrend.

On the daily charts, the Nifty has sustained above all important moving averages like 20, 50, 100 & 200 days which gives confirmation of the bullish sentiments for the medium to long term.

However, the momentum indicator like RSI (relative strength index) is sustaining above 60 mark on all the time frames which indicate market has strong positive momentum for the medium to long term.

We believe, the Nifty will face strong resistance at 18,210 and 18,604 mark. On the flip side, the support levels would be placed at 17,380 and 16,830 levels.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Pidilite Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,646 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,530 | Target: Rs 2,845-3,003 | Return: 7.5-13.5 percent

In the current week, the stock has given a strong breakout at Rs 2,532 levels with huge volume confirmation and made a fresh Life time high at Rs 2,662 levels and it has sustained at record high levels which indicates strong bullish undertone of the stock.

The momentum indicator RSI has sustained above 65 levels on all the time frames which confirms strong positive momentum of the stock for the medium to long term.

Looking at the prices action and the momentum indicators and other technical parameters we believe this stock has a lot of upside potential left.

The stop-loss for this trade set up would be Rs 2,530 levels of closing basis.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,539.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,400 | Target: Rs 1,725-1,804 | Return: 12-17 percent

HDFC Bank has made a Double Bottom price pattern near strong support zone of Rs 1,400 – Rs 1,370 levels and bounced back. Currently the stock is sustaining above its 5-week's high which shows strong bullish sentiments of the stocks for medium to long term.

The weekly RSI is placed above 50 mark also the stock has settled above its 20-week SMA (Rs 1,559) (simple moving average).

As per the momentum indicators and the technical indicators all point towards the possibility of the prices moving higher towards the Rs 1,725 mark (life-time high). If this level is breached, we might see the prices move towards Rs 1,804 (50 percent extension level of Rs 738 – Rs 1,641 projected from Rs 1,353).

The stop-loss for this trade set up would be Rs 1,400 levels of closing basis.

Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,514.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,330 | Target: Rs 3,835-4,102 | Return: 9-17 percent

The momentum indicator like RSI is sustaining above 60 mark on all the time frames indicating strong positive momentum of the stock.

As per price pattern, we feel that the stock prices gain momentum and move higher toward the Rs 3,835 (78.6 percent extension level of Rs 2,260 – Rs 3,505 projected from Rs 2,857) levels and eventually towards Rs 4,102 (100 percent extension level of Rs 2,260 – Rs 3,505 projected from Rs 2,857).

Investors can accumulate the stock at this point and hold for a target of Rs 3,835 and Rs 4,102 with a stop-loss of Rs 3,330 on closing basis.

Vishal Wagh, Research Head at Bonanza Portfolio

The bulls roared on Dalal Street as the Nifty closed above 17,900. Except IT, pharma, and power, all other sectoral indices ended in the green with auto, bank, metal, realty and oil & gas indices up 1-2 percent. The BSE Midcap index added 0.36 percent, while the Smallcap index ended on a flat note. The Nifty50 closed at 17,925 and the BSE Sensex at 60,233.

The Nifty has given a breakout of descending broadening wedge formation and the next resistance will be around 18,000-18,050 levels. On the downside, supports have been now placed at 17,750-17,800. The index is traveling above its short and medium-term moving averages which is a positive sign and the participation from largecap counters is what gives confidence to investors.

Though the global markets had mixed cues ahead of the release of the US Federal Reserve meeting minutes, on the domestic front traders are more hopeful with the RBI's decision to keep the reverse repo rate unchanged in the next policy amid an increase of corona cases.

The major contribution has come from Bank Nifty which has given nearly 4,000 or 12 percent from the recent bottom in the last couple of weeks. The move seems to continue if it breaks and sustains above 38,000 levels.

Here are two buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Radico Khaitan: Buy | CMP: Rs 1,266.75 | Stop-Loss: 1,140 | Target: Rs 1,434 | Return: 13.2 percent

The Radico has given strong move in October. Post that it has seen a strong consolidation in last two weeks. Stock has shown breakout in last week of December and through back seems completed now. Stock seems ready for next round of up move.

Relative strength index (RSI) (14,9) is currently reading around 67 and sustaining above the moving average. It has created a higher bottom near 61 levels. At the same time, moving average convergence divergence (MACD) (9,24,9) is also sustaining in Bullish mode. On a relative basis, it is consistently outperforming the major indices.

The said up move will be as equal to the area of consolidation which is around 220 points from the high of Rs 1,214. So the given target will be Rs 1,434.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,564.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,496 | Target: Rs 1,664 | Return: 6.3 percent

HDFC Bank has shown a strong bounce back from December low. It has managed to break out above the downward sloping trend line. It has also broken above all major 20, 50 & 100 DEMA. It is a heavy weightage stock from Nifty as well as Bank Nifty. It is currently outperforming both indices.

RSI (14,9) is currently reading around 65 and sustaining above the moving average. It has successfully sustained above the major resistance level of 45. At the same time, MACD (9,24,9) is also in Bullish mode.

As HDFC Bank is resuming uptrend the target will be of a new high. But there is small resistance around Rs 1,664 levels which will be tested first in the next couple of weeks.

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank reported healthy but in-line credit growth of 16% yoy/5% qoq in Q3FY22 (total loans stood at ~Rs12.6tn). This looks much more balanced and broad based. Retail loans grew by 13.5% yoy/4.5% qoq, commercial & rural banking were up 30% yoy/6%, while corporate growth reaccelerated to 7.5% yoy/4.5% qoq. HDFCB continues to hold a relatively larger housing portfolio from HDFC Ltd, totaling Rs74.6bn (Rs71bn in Q2FY22/Q3FY21). Adjusted for portfolio buyouts too, overall credit growth was 16.5% yoy/5% qoq. Notably, the bank has started regaining market share in cards, and should see further acceleration, along with PL, subject to absence of or partial lockdown situation. Deposit growth has moderated a bit to 14% yoy/3% qoq, while CASA deposit growth remained stronger at 25% yoy, partly benefiting from the RBI's directive to maintain current accounts with only the main lender. The CASA ratio remains high and healthy at 47%, leading to better CoF. This, coupled with better LDR (up 200bps qoq to 87%), should support NIMs, which otherwise remain under pressure due to the higher share of corporate/mortgage book and interest reversal on NPAs. We expect overall NPAs to trend down due to better collection efficiency, mainly in the retail segment. However, agri NPAs would be the main monitorable. Moreover, asset-quality outcomes at its NBFC subsidiary, HDB Financial Services, will also be closely monitored, in view of the relatively risky customer/credit profile.

Outlook

However, we believe that the bank has built reasonable Covid buffers (0.8% of loans) and should be relatively resilient. After the recent correction, the stock is trading at a reasonable valuation (2.9x FY23/2.5x FY24 ABV). We have a Buy rating on HDFCB with a TP of Rs2,050, given its proven track record in managing asset quality across cycles, strong franchise/capital profile, and the ability to deliver superior return ratios.

HDFC Bank share price edged higher intraday on January 5 after Morgan Stanley maintained its ""overweight"" call on the stock, with a target of Rs 2,050, an upside of 32 percent from the current market price.

The global research firm is of the view that HDFC Bank's initial update points to strong growth in loans and retail deposits. Loan growth was broad-based across its lending segments, it said.

The stock was trading at Rs 1,552.50, up Rs 24.10, or 1.58 percent, at 12.05 pm. It touched an intraday high of Rs 1,553.50 and an intraday low of Rs 1,529.

According to Emkay Global Financial Services, the stock has underperformed by its own standards as well as that of the peers after the management change, more so due to the RBI's embargo on its card, digital initiatives and Covid-induced growth and asset-quality disruption.

The risk of fresh Covid wave-induced lockdowns could once again disrupt business as well as asset-quality normalisation.

The retail deposit trend was healthy, with the bank witnessing a sequential improvement in its CASA ratio to 47 percent, it said.

""Improvement in asset mix, robust CASA growth, and strong resumption in credit card issuances will aid margin recovery, which has been under pressure over the past few quarters. We maintain our buy rating with a target of Rs 2,000 per share (3.6x Sep’23E ABV for the core bank),"" it added.

The RBI on Tuesday said state-owned SBI, along with private sector lenders ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank continue to be Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) or institutions which are 'too big to fail'.

SIBs are perceived as banks that are 'too big to fail (TBTF)'. This perception of TBTF creates an expectation of government support for these banks in times of distress. Due to this perception, these lenders enjoy certain advantages in the funding markets.

''SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank continue to be identified as Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs), under the same bucketing structure as in the 2020 list of D-SIBs,'' the Reserve Bank said in a statement.

The additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement for D-SIBs was phased-in from April 1, 2016 and became fully effective from April 1, 2019.

The additional CET1 requirement will be in addition to the capital conservation buffer.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had announced SBI and ICICI Bank as D-SIBs in 2015 and 2016.

Based on data collected from banks as on March 31, 2017, HDFC Bank was also classified as a D-SIB.

The current update is based on data collected from banks as on March 31, 2021.

The framework for dealing with D-SIBs was issued in July 2014.

The framework requires the RBI to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs starting from 2015 and place these lenders in appropriate buckets depending upon their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).

Based on the bucket in which a D-SIB is placed, an additional common equity requirement has to be applied to it.

The Additional Common Equity Tier 1 requirement as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) in case of SBI is 0.6 per cent, and 0.2 per cent for ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.",297,0.9999994039535522

When deftly managed, they can be a big source of income. But errors in risk assessment invariably lead to stains on the balance sheet. For banks, credit cards have given the occasional heartburn but the pandemic has tested lenders on this business.

Credit cards are instruments to avail unsecured interest-free loans with an average tenure of 30-45 days. A delay in repayment triggers the interest rate charge which can be as steep as 25 percent at times.

It is clear that the lender earns more if you default on your credit card payments on the due date, or convert your outstanding into equated monthly instalments (EMIs). The trick for the bank is to get the money with the interest back. This is where lenders find themselves in a tough spot.

The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) financial stability report (FSR) shows that public sector banks saw delinquencies in their credit card portfolio surge to double digits by March 2021.

As of September, credit card defaults stood at 12.7 percent for these banks. That is close to the high bad loan ratios seen in the previous cycle involving corporate loans (see chart).

So are banks staring at a credit card crisis?

There is clearly an increase in distress. As pointed in our story, a high proportion of unsecured retail loans including credit cards outstanding is causing trouble for lenders.

As such, the FSR showed that demand for consumer credit has grown the fastest among the subprime category of borrowers. Subprime refers to borrowers having low credit scores and one of the riskiest to lend to. To be sure, lenders seem to be wary of this category.

“From an origination standpoint, the preference of this category is still low suggesting lending standards are still quite tight which has led to a drop in approval rates,” wrote analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a note. What’s more, the migration of borrowers across weaker risk tiers suggests that underlying stress in consumer credit is far more than what headline numbers show.

Credit card spends along with unsecured personal loans have seen the fastest growth in the past three years (see chart). But this is waning in recent months. Some of the slowdowns in spending could be attributed to the regulator’s ban on HDFC Bank from issuing fresh cards for eight months. As such, discretionary spends have remained tepid post the pandemic.

A recovery in card spends is now under risk as the new coronavirus variant limits Indians from discretionary consumption. The upshot is that Indians won’t be bingeing on credit at the pace expected earlier. That said, a bigger worry for banks is the asset quality of the portfolio than growth. Delinquency rates need to be curbed.

Note that public sector banks have higher loan approval rates in consumer credit than private-sector lenders. This has coincided with high delinquency rates as well. Public sector lenders need to tighten their underwriting rules. Other lenders must also watch out for risk.",503,-0.76852186024189

A memorandum of understanding was signed between HDFC Bank and IPPB to cater to the majority of over 4.7 crore customer base of IPPB.

About 90 per cent of IPPB customers reside in rural areas, which may benefit from this tie-up.

HDFC Bank said the strategic alliance will enable IPPB to provide affordable and diversified offerings, including access to finance, to its customers through its innovative Doorstep Banking Service.

With nearly 2,00,000 postal service providers (Postmen and Gramin Dak Sevaks) equipped with micro ATMs and biometric devices, IPPB caters to the needs and requirements of various customer segments.

With this partnership, HDFC Bank aims to further strengthen its financial inclusion drive by leveraging the robust and extensive distribution network of IPPB’s 650 branches and over 136,000 banking access points across India, the bank said on Monday.

The scrip was trading at Rs 1866 as of writing, up 0.5% from its previous close. Meanwhile, Sensex fell 0.71% to 56,906.63 points.

Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd have achieved this milestone in market capitalisation in the past.

Infosys , whose stock has jumped over 52% so far this year, will announce its December quarter earnings on 12 January.

Cloud adoption and digital transformation will support strong demand for IT services over the next 3-5 years, said analysts. Infosys is among the best-positioned companies to benefit from strong demand, backed by its strategic investments in scaling up digital capabilities, winning market share, and expanding presence in Europe, they added.

“Infosys is well-placed to deliver industry-leading organic growth among large peers in the medium term. Margins are expected to remain under pressure due to supply-side challenges, roll-out of wage hike for senior employees, and weak seasonality, which will be partially offset by strong growth in digital business, operational efficiencies, and currency tailwinds,” brokerage firm Sharekhan said in a note to investors.

“The stock trades at 30x/26x its FY2023E/FY2024E earnings, which is justified, given strong growth potential, robust deal pipelines, robust execution, and improving ROCE (return on capital employed). We like Infosys because of its superior digital capability, consistent investments in talents, stable management, a strong capital allocation policy, and a healthy balance sheet,” the note added.

The brokerage firm expects 18.6% year-on-year growth in FY2022 and a 12.4% conpound annual rate over FY2022-FY2024E for Infosys, given broad-based demand, robust deal wins, and a healthy deal pipeline.

Last quarter the company increased its FY2022 revenue guidance to 14-16% on a constant currency basis from 12-14% earlier. The firm maintained its operating margins guidance at 22-24%.

Operating profit for the quarter increased by 14% YoY to INR 15,807 cr was in line with our estimate of INR 15,886 cr. Other income for the quarter grew strongly by 22% YoY/18% QoQ to INR 7,401 cr. Provisions for the quarter decreased sequentially by 19% to INR 3,925 cr. As a prudent strategy, Bank has made INR 1200 cr additional provision in Q2FY22 and carries total cumulative (floating + contingent) provision of INR 9,207 cr (0.8% of loans). Headline NPA ratio improved by 12bps QoQ due to lower slippages and better recoveries but higher restructuring was disappointing.

Outlook

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB reported a slight miss on profits at Rs88bn (est: Rs89bn) in Q2FY22, mainly due to lower NIMs (4.1%), higher staff expenses and accelerated contingent provisions (Rs12bn). The headline NPA ratio improved by 12bps qoq to 1.4% due to lower slippages and better recoveries, but higher restructuring at 1.7% of loans (mainly in PL) was slightly disappointing. Credit growth improved to 15.5% yoy/4.5% qoq due to better traction in retail loans (up 13% yoy) and commercial loans (up 28% yoy). Wholesale loan growth moderated to 6% yoy, but the bank sees improving growth opportunities in the corporate segment. It expects NIM to improve in H2FY22 as retail growth accelerates led by strong demand and receding risk aversion. On-time Recovery (OTR) has improved to pre-Covid levels at 97.5%, leading to moderate net slippages. HDFCB has adopted liberal restructuring (borrower-wise) in the retail segment, but expects a low relapse rate (10-20bps of overall loans). It carries reasonably healthy contingent + floating provisions at 0.8% of loans, which should keep incremental LLP in check.

Outlook

We believe growth acceleration and the lifting of an embargo on the credit card business are positive factors, while further relief on Digital 2.0 initiatives is awaited. Retain Buy with a revised TP of Rs2,050 (valuing core bank at 3.5x Dec'23E ABV and subs at Rs65/share), given its ability to deliver superior return ratios across cycles.

Motilal Oswal's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB reported an inline quarter with NII/PPoP growth of 12%/14% YoY and PAT growth of 18% YoY to INR88.3b (inline). Profitability came in strong despite creating an additional contingent provision of INR12b, thus taking the total buffer to ~INR78b (~0.65% of loans). The bank witnessed a healthy pickup in business momentum as deposits / loans were up 4.5% QoQ each. Retail segment grew ~13% YoY while Commercial and Rural Banking grew robustly at 27.6% YoY. CASA deposits grew 29% YoY and the ratio now stands at 46.8% (+130bp QoQ). On the asset quality front, GNPA/NNPA ratio improved by 12bp/8bp QoQ to 1.35%/0.4%, with slippages moderating to INR53b (1.8% of loans). On the other hand, the restructured book increased to 1.5% of loans (v/s 0.8% in 1QFY22). The management said the net impact of the restructured book on NPAs is likely to be 10-20bp. Higher provision coverage, along with a contingent provision buffer, provides comfort on asset quality.

Outlook

Our estimates remain unchanged at 20% PAT CAGR over FY21-24E, with a RoA/RoE at 2.1%/18.3% in FY24E. We maintain Buy and roll-forward our estimate to Sep'23E with a revised TP of INR2,000/share (3.6x Sep'23E ABV + INR120/share from subsidiaries).

HDFC Bank, India’s largest private sector lender, may report standalone profit growth of 15 percent in the second quarter of this financial year, experts said.

Growth in all the bank’s key parameters is expected in double digits and its asset quality will likely be stable in the three months ended September 30.

Profit, which increased 18.4 percent to Rs 7,513 crore in the September quarter of last year, may grow with support from other income, pre-provision operating profit, net interest income and stable asset quality. Loan loss provisions are expected to remain slightly elevated compared to a year ago, but lower than in the June quarter.

The HDFC Bank stock surged in late trade on October 14 and closed at a record Rs 1,685.90, a gain of 2.86 percent, ahead of the quarterly earnings scheduled on October 16. The bank’s shares have gained 13 percent since the start of the September quarter.

Net interest income, the difference between the interest earned and expended, could rise by about 10 percent YoY on loan growth of 15.4 percent, with the net interest margin likely unchanged at 4 percent.

“We expect net interest income growth at around 11 percent YoY led by loan growth of around 15 percent YoY (weaker auto sales and lower credit card receivables growth offset by higher SME growth). We expect net interest margin to be unchanged at 4 percent. Revenue growth would be aided by non-interest income, primarily aided by a lower base,” said Kotak Institutional Equities, which expects profit to increase 15.5 percent from a year earlier.

Prabhudas Lilladher expects 15.5 percent growth in profit and 10 percent increase in net interest income.

Advances at about Rs 11.98 lakh crore as of September grew by 15.4 percent YoY, following a 13 percent growth in retail loans, 27.5 percent growth in commercial and rural banking loans, and 6 percent growth in other wholesale loans, HDFC Bank said on October 4 while disclosing provisional numbers. Loan growth on a sequential basis was 4.4 percent.

Deposits increased 14.4 percent to Rs 14.06 lakh crore as of September from a year earlier, with growth of 17.5 percent in retail deposits and 2 percent in wholesale deposits. Quarter-on-quarter growth in deposits was 4.5 percent provisionally.

Current and savings account (CASA) deposits grew 28.6 percent to Rs 6.58 lakh crore in the second quarter. The bank’s CASA ratio was about 47 percent in September against 41.6 percent a year earlier and 45.5 percent in June.

According to Kotak, pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) growth could be about 12 percent YoY as business growth is still not normal. Prabhudas Lilladher also expects the same growth in PPoP.

Asset quality

Analysts expect a fall in slippages at HDFC Bank with better loan recovery. Asset quality is likely to improve or remain stable compared with the previous quarter.

“We expect the gross non-performing loan ratio to decline, led by lower slippages (2 percent) and better recovery (expect a bullish commentary of the recovery environment). Near-term focus would be on growth recovery of segments that would drive this growth,” said Kotak.

Asset quality in agri/unsecured book, slippages due to the second Covid-19 wave, and commentary on credit cards and fee income traction are key, said Motilal Oswal.

Karan Pai, Technical Analyst at GEPL Capital

For the past three weeks, the Nifty50 has been witnessing profit-booking the moment it reaches close to the 18,000 mark. Similarly buying pressure has seen between the 17,300 and 17,500 levels.

The price action and momentum indicators point towards the possibility of the index witnessing a fatigue near the 18,000 mark.

On the open interest (October 14, 2021 option) front, good participation and open interest addition was seen in the 18,000 Call and 17,800-17,700 Put contracts. Thus, we can expect the broader range of the index to be 17,700-18,000.

We can expect the index to move in a range of 17,300-18,000 levels as long as the prices do not break above the 18,000 level. Once this level is breached, we might see the prices moving higher towards 18,100 and eventually towards 19,046.

The bullish view will be negated if the prices breach below the 17,300 mark.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,610.50 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,547 | Target: Rs 1,837 | Return: 14 percent

HDFC Bank has been moving higher ever since it was out of a consolidation in the week ended August 30. Looking at the price action and the momentum indicators and other technical parameters, we believe this stock has a lot of upside potential left.

Going ahead, we expect bullish momentum to accelerate if the prices breach above the previous swing high of Rs 1,641. If this level is breached, we might see the stock move towards Rs 1,733, followed by Rs 1,837.

The stop-loss level will be Rs 1,547 mark on closing basis.

HDFC: Buy | LTP: 2,727 | Stop Loss: Rs 2,640 | Target: Rs 3,059 | Return: 12 percent

After testing a high of Rs 2,875, the stock entered into a consolidation phase and moved lower towards Rs 2,689, which coincides with the 50-day SMA (simple moving average). For the past three weeks, the prices have been finding support near the same.

If this level is held intact, we might see the prices gaining momentum and moving higher towards the previous swing high of Rs 2,893 and eventually towards Rs 3,059.

Investors can accumulate HDFC at this point and hold with a target of Rs 2,893 and Rs 3,059 and maintain a stop loss of Rs 2,640 on closing basis.

Bandhan Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 328.55 | Stop Loss: Rs 300 | Target: Rs 424 | Return: 29 percent

Bandhan Bank, for the past couple of weeks, had been moving in a range. On October 6, the stock managed to gain momentum and breach above the 20-week SMA. Good volume build-up was seen as the prices moved higher, indicating participation in the upmove.

The momentum and technical indicators all point towards the possibility of the prices moving higher towards the Rs 424 mark immediately. If this level is breached, we might see the prices move towards Rs 432 level eventually.

The stoploss level will be Rs 300 on closing basis.

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank reported better-than-expected credit growth of 15% yoy/4% qoq (total loans at ~Rs12tn), mainly driven by re-acceleration in retail growth (up 13% yoy/5% qoq) and commercial & rural banking (up 28% yoy/7.5% qoq). However, corporate growth has moderated to 6% yoy/0.5% qoq. HDFCB retained a relatively higher housing portfolio of Rs71.3bn from HDFC Ltd (Rs30.6bn in Q2Y21; Rs55bn in Q1FY22). Adjusted for portfolio buyouts too, overall credit growth was 15% yoy/4% qoq. We believe that the acceleration in retail credit could be mainly contributed by VF, cards and housing portfolios. In a media interview, HDFCB's group head for commercial & rural banking had indicated better disbursements in transportation financing (CV/CE) during Jul-Aug'21. Deposit growth was healthy at 14% yoy/4% qoq, while CASA deposit growth was stronger at 29% yoy - a phenomenon likely to be seen across large banks, partly benefiting from the RBI's directive to maintain current accounts with the main lender only. The CASA ratio remains high and healthy at 47%, leading to better CoF. This, coupled with acceleration in retail loans, should lead to better margins qoq, which dipped to a low of 4.1% in Q1.



Outlook

Currently, we have a Buy rating on the stock with a TP of Rs1,850, given its proven track record in managing asset quality across cycles, strong franchise/capital profile and delivering superior return ratios.

The bulls are roaring, helping the benchmark indices to hit historic highs and maintain the uptrend for the fifth consecutive week as of September 24.

The BSE Sensex decisively surpassed the 60,000 mark and the Nifty 50 drew closer to 18,000. However, a similar momentum was absent in the broader markets, as the BSE MidCap Index gained 0.59 percent and the SmallCap Index rose 0.06 percent.

Both the benchmark indices closed at a record. The BSE Sensex jumped 1,032.58 points, or 1.75 percent, to 60,048.47 during the week and the Nifty 50 climbed 268.05 points, or 1.52 percent, to 17,853.20.

Given the significant rally over the past one month, experts suggest that investors book timely profits and avoid aggressive buying. According to them, the next resistance on the Nifty 50 is expected at 18,000, with support at 17,600.

“Our markets had a remarkable comeback in the last four sessions as we not only managed to recover from lows but also went on to clock fresh highs,” said Sameet Chavan, chief analyst – technical and derivatives, at Angel Broking. “We have clearly outperformed global peers because despite a relief move in last two days, they are still trading well below their highs.”

He said the recovery beyond 17,600 was certainly surprising but the market was superior.

“Ideally, after the market surpassed previous highs, our cautious stance should have been negated, but there are a few time-wise projections as well as negative divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI)-smoothened oscillator, clearly holding us back,” he said.

As far as levels are concerned, every 100 points from here can be seen as an immediate resistance, i.e., 17,900-18,000. On the flipside, 17,700-17,650 are to be seen as key supports, Chavan said.

He advised traders to continue with a stock-specific approach but keep booking timely profits and avoid carrying aggressive overnight bets. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the global markets and on how the banking index, which could probably decide the next path of action for the markets, he said.

Here are 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on September 24 closing prices:



Sameet Chavan, chief analyst - technical and derivatives at Angel Broking



TThis stock had been consolidating for five to six months without any real momentum. However, the price suddenly took off after surpassing its sturdy wall of Rs 890. This move was accompanied with sizable volumes, providing credence to the move.

Pricewise, the daily chart now exhibits a bullish cup and handle pattern and we expect a decent move in this stock in the forthcoming week.

We recommend buying on a decline towards Rs 890-880 for a short-term target of Rs 960. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 853.

ONGC: Buy | CMP: Rs 136.10 | Stop Loss: Rs 129.80 | Target: Rs 149 | Return: 9.5 percent

This Maharatna company failed to live up to expectations for the past seven years. Even in the ongoing bull run, it did not participate much. But now, with crude oil prices trading at a three-year high, ONGC is showing some strength.

Last week, ONGC shares surpassed the key 200-day simple moving average on the weekly timeframe chart for the first time since May 2019. In addition, the average directional index (14) indicator has started displaying an upward trajectory. One can look to buy this stock for a near-term target of Rs 149. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 129.80.



Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities



After moving in a narrow high-low range for the past few weeks as per the weekly timeframe chart, the fertilizer stock showed an upside breakout at Rs 58.50 on September 24. The larger degree higher tops and bottoms are intact and the present upward move could be in line with the expected new higher top formation.

The stock price is currently placed above the hurdle of the 10- and 20-week exponential moving average at about Rs 59. Hence, a sustainable move above this area could open a sharp upside momentum in the stock price. Buying can be initiated in NFL at Rs 60, add more on dips to Rs 57, wait for the upside target of Rs 67 in the next three to four weeks, and place a stop-loss of Rs 55.

The Phoenix Mills: Buy | CMP: Rs 945.50 | Stop Loss: Rs 880 | Target: Rs 1,060 | Return: 12.1 percent

This realty stock witnessed a sharp upside breakout of the larger consolidation pattern on the weekly timeframe chart at Rs 900 and closed higher. The formation of consistent higher bottoms, as per the weekly timeframe chart, signals the intact medium-term uptrend in the price. Volumes expanded during the upside breakout and the weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication.

One may look to buy The Phoenix Mills at the current market price, add more on dips to Rs 910 and wait for the target of Rs 1,060 in the next three to four weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 880.

Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research (retail) at Kotak Securities

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | CMP: 779.45 | Stop Loss: Rs 750 | Target: Rs 850 | Return: 9.1 percent

The auto index made a strong comeback in the previous week after hitting the 200-day SMA support level. M&M made an exceptional recovery after hitting the lower boundary of the current trading range of Rs 740-Rs 850.

Technically, it seems the stock has formed a higher bottom at Rs 740 and is heading for the upward boundary, which is at Rs 850, with major resistance at Rs 790, where it has the hurdle of the 200-day SMA. Buy at current levels and add more on dips with a final stop-loss at Rs 750.

LIC Housing Finance: Buy | CMP: Rs 429.25 | Stop Loss: Rs 420 | Target: Rs 470 | Return: 9.5 percent

LIC Housing has decisively crossed the swing high at Rs 429 with a rise in volumes. After two months, the stock closed above the 200-day SMA, which is positive for the medium term. Reality stocks are rallying and that would help housing finance companies in the near term.

Sun Pharma: Buy | CMP: Rs 770.45 | Stop Loss: Rs 730 | Target: Rs 870 | Return: 12.9 percent

Technically, the stock is forming a symmetrical triangle. It has a bullish consolidation after rallying to Rs 804 from Rs 650. It is the biggest outperforming stock in the pharma basket and should be bought at current levels and more on dips to about Rs 750.

Protect long positions with a final stop loss at Rs 730. On the higher side, Rs 800 and Rs 830 would be major hurdles.

Ashis Biswas, head of technical research at CapitalVia Global Research

HDFC Bank: Buy | CMP: Rs 1,601.55 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,520 | Target: Rs 1,720 | Return: 7.4 percent

The stock has been following an uptrend. We have observed a major breakout above Rs 1,600. Indicators like the MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) and RSI suggest the momentum in the stock is likely to continue. We recommend a buy in HDFC Bank above Rs 1,605 with a target of Rs 1,720. Investors are advised to maintain a stop-loss of Rs 1,520.

HPCL: Buy | CMP: Rs 274.80 | Stop Loss: Rs 244 | Target: Rs 300 | Return: 9.2 percent

HPCL has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern. We expect a bullish movement in the stock from the support and the momentum to continue. It has taken support at the 200 DMA line. We recommend a buy above Rs 276 with a target of Rs 300 and a stop-loss of Rs 244 for a medium-term perspective.

JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals: Buy | CMP: Rs 1,835.80 | Target: Rs 2,050 | Return: 11.7 percent

The stock has reversed from near the support of the 100 DMA. We have observed a breakout from the cup and handle formation above Rs 1,800. We recommend a buy above Rs 1,840 with a target of Rs 2,050 and a stop-loss of Rs 1,695 for a medium-term perspective.

On September 7, HDFC Bank inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) to offer credit support to MSMEs across the country.

HDFC Bank will provide MSMEs tailored schemes and extend support to MSME projects, the bank said.

Under the arrangement, the bank will accept loan applications forwarded by NSIC and sanction it on merit and as per lending norms of the bank, it said. HDFC Bank will finance projects related to the MSME sector at different places where its branches are located or at important industrial centres.

In an interview to Moneycontrol in February this year, Shukla had said that HDFC Bank did not expect the NPAs (non-performing assets) in its wholesale division to worsen.

Banks have been reasonably prudent in their approach towards lending. There is an enormous focus on governance. Tight regulatory framework, increased supervision as well as board oversight have had a very positive impact, Shukla said.",327,0.33376097679138184

The HDFC Bank stock has failed to live up to its name this year so far, as the second wave of the pandemic aggravated concerns over the asset qualities of banks.

Year-to-date (YTD), shares of HDFC Bank have gained just 10 percent against a 24 percent jump in the benchmark Sensex.

However, brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services now sees a 14 percent upside in the stock from hereon.

The brokerage firm has maintained a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,800.

India's largest private sector bank by assets and by market capitalisation, HDFC Bank has now got the relief from the RBI, which has partially lifted the restrictions placed on it and allowed the bank to source new credit cards.

The bank now is looking to regain its lost market share across card segments in the next three-four quarters, media reports suggest.

""This addresses a key overhang as HDFC Bank is the largest credit card issuer in the country, and this segment is key to the bank’s overall profitability,"" Motilal Oswal said.

""In recent quarters, HDFC Bank reported moderation in fee income or NII, impacted by the restriction, as this segment contributes 25–33 percent to its total fee income. Thus, the lifting of restrictions before the start of the festive season is a positive development as HDFC Bank is usually aggressive during this time, offering various discounts on consumer products,"" Motilal Oswal pointed out.

In the April-June quarter of the financial year 2022 (FY22), the bank delivered healthy growth in advances despite a challenging environment due to the second wave of COVID-19.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal expects a strong uptick in growth in the second half of FY22 even as growth in the first half could remain soft.

""We estimate loans to grow by 15 percent and 17.5 percent in FY22E and FY23E, respectively. Deposit growth remains strong, led by CASA, which would support the margin trajectory. Its fee income profile was impacted by muted business activity in 1QFY22. As lending picks up, with a revival in economic activity, fees would reflect improving trends,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Strong cost control, led by further digitalisation, is likely to drive an overall improvement in the bank's return ratios. Although margins have moderated, the brokerage firm expects a gradual increase on account of lower cost of funds and a strong and granular liability franchise.

""Strong capitalisation and liquidity levels should help HDFC Bank sustain its growth momentum over the next few years. This renders the bank better placed to tide over the crisis and gain incremental market share,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Motilal Oswal expects growth trends to revive in retail, especially in the unsecured lending segment in coming quarters.

The bank understands that the threat of COVID-19 still looms and it has taken steps to mitigate the impact of the future wave of the pandemic.

""HDFC Bank continues to make additional contingent provisions to further strengthen its balance sheet against any potential COVID-19 impact and expects stress to remain controlled,"" Motilal Oswal observed.

HDFC Bank and Paytm, on September 20, announced a plan to launch a range of credit cards powered by VISA. The partnership aims to provide a range of offerings across customer segments, with special focus on millennials, business owners and merchants, the bank said in a press release.

This is the first co-branded credit card launch by the country's largest private sector lender after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lifted a ban on the bank on new credit card launches in August this year. The RBI had imposed the ban on the bank in December last year following a series of digital outages.

""The credit cards will be customized to meet distinct needs of retail customers, from new-to-credit users to affluent users and offer one of the best-in-class rewards and cashback for users. The new cards offering will also facilitate small business owners,"" the bank said.

The launch is planned in October 2021 to coincide with the festive season to tap into potentially higher consumer demand for credit card offers, EMIs and Buy Now Pay Later options, with the full suite of products to be on offer by the end of December 2021, HDFC Bank said.

Among the lenders that have recently raised funds through AT1 Bond issues are State Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank and HDFC Bank. The coupon rate on these bonds differs as per market conditions. Why do banks use these instruments? What are the benefits and risks for investors? Here is a primer:

What are AT1 bonds?

AT1 bonds, as these instruments are popularly known, are a type of perpetual debt instrument that banks use to augment their core equity base and thus comply with Basel III norms. These bonds were introduced by the Basel accord after the global financial crisis to protect depositors.

How are these bonds different from other debt instruments?

These bonds are perpetual in nature — they do not carry any maturity date. They offer higher returns to investors but compared with other vanilla debt products, these instruments carry a higher risk as well. If the capital ratios of the issuer fall below a certain percentage or in the event of an institutional failure, the rules allow the issuer to stop paying interest or even write down these bonds, as happened in the Yes Bank case. These bonds are subordinate to all other debt and senior only to equity.

What can investors do with AT1 bonds?

As mentioned above, AT1 bonds do not have a maturity date. Banks have a call option that permits them to redeem these bonds after a certain period.

Are they safe for investors?

Since these bonds can be written down by banks under the directions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the event of an institutional failure, they are seen as high-risk instruments. If the bank reaches the point of non-viability, AT1 bonds are the first part of debt that will be written down. AT1 bonds worth Rs 8,414 crore were written off fully during the Yes Bank reconstruction scheme in March 2020. Those AT1 investors are still locked in a court battle with the RBI and the bank seeking the return of their investments. In this backdrop, it is fair to say that AT1 bonds are high-risk instruments for investors, especially retail investors.

Why do the banks tap the AT1 bond route?

Banks periodically raise money issuing such bonds. At one point, lenders used to even pitch these to retail investors as an attractive option, often with returns higher than a traditional fixed deposit would offer. Indeed, there used to be significant retail interest in AT1 bonds till the Yes Bank episode.

The market for AT1 bonds took a hit after the Yes Bank write-off, as part of the State Bank of India-led bailout in March 2020. Investors have begun to look at these instruments with caution since then.

Which banks have taken the AT1 Bond route to raise funds recently?

State Bank of India (SBI) and Axis Bank are the lenders to have most recently raised money through AT1 bonds. Axis Bank recently raised $600 million through an AT1 Bond issue, while State Bank of India announced on September 1 that it had raised Rs 4,000 crore of the Basel-compliant bonds. The country’s largest lender raised the amount at a coupon rate of 7.72 percent. In August, HDFC Bank, too, raised $1 billion by selling AT1 bonds to overseas investors.",567,-0.9979617595672607

Know your AT1 Bonds

What are AT1 Bonds?

Additional Tier 1 Bonds, or AT1 Bonds, as these financial products are popularly known as, are a type of perpetual debt instruments that banks use to raise to increase their core capital base. These bonds are perpetual in nature—that simply means these do not carry a maturity date like trasitional bonds. While AT1 Bonds are a lucrative investment option for investors (as they offer higher returns compared with other comparable instruments), these carry high risk. If the capital ratios of an issuer falls below a certain percentage or in the event of an institutional failure, rules allow the issuer to stop paying interest or even write down these bonds.

The bank took the embargo period as an opportunity to relook into the strategy, product portfolio and customer spends to ensure the HDFC Bank card becomes the preferred card for the customers to spend, Rao said.

As an immediate target customer base to source new cards, it would be our internal customer base, 70-75% will be salaried and rest self-employed, Rao added.

Regain lost market share

Rao explained that the bank has set on its card strategy. First, the bank aims to hit the card run-rate to pre-Covid levels. In November 2020 pre-embargo period the bank was issuing around 300,000 cards.

The second milestone, in the next two quarters the bank aims to hit half a million cards, and in the next three-four quarters, to regain the entire market share lost, said Rao.

The bank continued to add 400,000 liabilities accounts every month since the RBI had introduced the embargo. These customers who have shown good credit behavior would be a good pool for us to issue new credit cards, he added.

On the underwriting standards for new issuances, Rao explained that the bank’s conservative approach to customer acquisition will continue and we will not dilute risk standards but use digital methods to underwrite on fly.

Alliances & Relook Product Portfolio

The bank is looking to create strategic alliances across categories and relook at its product portfolio.

Rao said, We will be relooking at product portfolio and value proposition and plan to restage and relaunch existing products.

The strategic alliances cut across large institutions, fintech, auto sector and many important sectors relevant in card and retail space, he said.

HDFC Bank is looking to launch new products and cards to tap new segments where there are gaps in the existing portfolio. Rao said, we will be also doing restaging existing products – strengthening old products and spruce them up with relevant changes. Our strategy will be combination of new products and relaunching exist products, he added.

Digital 2.0 Initiatives

The bank has planned activities under Digital 2.0 is to digitize the whole bank, create new platforms and set competence.

As the RBI ban continues under Digital 2.0, Rao said, “We have been in constant touch with the regulators, at different levels on day-to-day and weekly basis. We have submitted short-term, medium-term and long term plans to remediate the observations raised by RBI and third-party auditor.”

He added, we have submitted plans with concrete time-lines and most short-term plans have been closed, medium terms are in process and long term plans are in place and interaction with RBI continues to happen.

HDFC Bank is looking at winning back the market share by number of cards in the next one year, a senior official said on Monday.

The largest private sector lender by assets was allowed to issue new credit cards by the RBI last week, over eight months after being banned from doing so due to concerns over repeated technological outages.

Parag Rao, its group head for payments and consumer finance, digital banking and IT told reporters that the bank has set some milestones for itself as it seeks to re-enter the market.

The first is to achieve monthly new credit card sales to 3 lakh, the number right before the ban in November 2020, Rao said, adding that the same will be achieved in three months.

Two quarters after that, it aims to take the monthly new card sales to 5 lakh a month, Rao said, adding that in three to four quarters from now, it plans to regain the market share by number of cards.

Rao added that during the ban, the bank lost its market share by number of cards but was able to maintain the market share on initiatives taken to prod users to spend.

It can be noted that as per data, the bank''s market share by number of cards had come down by around 2 percentage points to under 25 percent, as smaller rivals including ICICI Bank and SBI Cards seized the opportunity to close the gap.

After the lifting of the ban, HDFC Bank had spoken about coming back with a bang.

Rao said spends on credit cards are 60 percent higher in April-June quarter on its card portfolio.

The bank will depend on its internal set of customers to grow the number of cards and is also looking at partnering with key players like Paytm announced earlier in the day, to increase its sourcing.

Rao also said that the conservative approach on the credit front will continue for the bank even as it goes aggressively on the new business sourcing.

ICICI Bank had aggressively pushed new digital initiatives like iMobilePay which provides payments services to customers of other banks too.

Bernstein Research said, “Is HDFCB building a digital-native bank within the bank? This is what it seems like from public posts of a startup called Zeta (private). Zeta’s pitch is to be the cloud-native 'Omni-Stack' for banks – a single software solution for cards, loans, deposits with customizable web and mobile interfaces.”

Servicing 25 mn customers and new customer acquisition?

Zeta, a bank-tech company had posted a job position on its website for its project Plutus which is a strategic partnership between Zeta and HDFC Bank.

According to the plan, Plutus will serve the bank’s 25 million customers, drive new customer acquisitions by using Tachyon which is a cloud-native integrated core banking platform.

The Bernstein report said, “The partnership aims to deliver a digital bank and payments offering initially targeted towards India's young and digitally-savvy and help the bank expand the customer franchise.”

The bank is also ready with Digital expansion plan, Digital 2.0. In June the bank had said in a statement that it would be setting up a Digital Factory and Enterprise factory to roll out digital products and services which will be pivoted on APIs (Application Programming Interface), data and cloud.

There is a large customer base to which they can cross sell and next catalyst is full ban being lifted, which is just a matter of time, Macquarie added.

HDFC Bank has underperformed and has been range bound over last couple of months owing to pressure on NII growth and margins. The lifting of these RBI restrictions thus addresses the key overhang. Further, we also expect growth trends to revive in retail especially in unsecured lending segment in coming quarters.

Overall, the bank continues to make additional contingent provisions to further strengthen its balance sheet against any potential COVID-19 impact and thus expects stress formation to remain under control.

At 09:17 hrs HDFC Bank was quoting at Rs 1,559.05, up Rs 44.20, or 2.92 percent on the BSE.

HDFC Bank on August 18 said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed the lender to source new credit cards.

""We wish to inform you that the RBI vide its letter dated August 17, 2021 has relaxed the restriction placed on sourcing of new credit cards. The Board of Directors of the Bank has taken note of the said RBI letter,"" the bank said in a BSE filing.

HDFC Bank said the restriction on new digital launches planned under Digital 2.0 will continue till further review by the central bank.

""We will continue to engage with RBI and ensure compliance on all parameters,"" HDFC Bank said.

In December 2020, the RBI had asked HDFC Bank to put all new digital launches and issuance of new credit cards on hold, following instances of outages in the internet banking / mobile banking/ payment utilities of the lender over the past two years.

In a separate statement to the media, HDFC Bank said strategies for its credit cards business will be rolled out in due course.

""As stated earlier, all the preparations and strategies that we have put in place to 'come back with a bang' on credit cards will be rolled out in the coming time,"" HDFC Bank said.

CNBC-TV18 reported that the RBI asked HDFC Bank to submit a board-approved letter of commitment towards continued compliance.

""The bank is required to submit a board-approved letter of commitment towards continued compliance and also to achieve full compliance with the remaining observations of RBI’s IT examination report. The restrictions lifted as above is conditional upon abiding by the letter of commitment furnished to RBI,"" the banking regulator said in the communication.

The RBI has allowed HDFC Bank to source new credit cards as per a letter sent to the bank on August 17, CNBC-TV18 reported.

In December last year, the RBI had asked HDFC Bank to put all new digital launches on hold till the bank resolve the tech issues. HDFC was barred from launching any new digital products or services and issuing new credit cards as a penalty for repeated instances of outages in its online platforms.

HDFC Bank's chief executive officer Sashidhar Jagdishan had said a month ago on July 17 that the RBI ban on new digital launches over tech issues has impacted the business. He had further said that HDFC is ready to bounce back and launch new products once the ban is lifted, but it will take around 12 to 15 months to complete the technology transformation.

Laying the blame of the outages on capacity issues, he had said: “We realised as a company, we have been victims of our own success. What one would have envisaged is that from a base level you normally size up for four-five times the capacity. We realise the volumes have gone even beyond the five times capacity that we had originally sized up. So, it is more of a capacity issue.”

Starting December 2020, HDFC brought in better monitoring systems and a more resilient system of shifting to disaster recovery mode, Chief Information Officer Ramesh Lakshminarayanan had said earlier this year. After the embargo on digital launches came into force, HDFC took a set of actions, including bringing an external auditor for its systems. The audit went on between February and April. “The reports have been submitted to the regulator. We are awaiting further directions from the regulator in this matter,” Lakshminarayanan had said.

Pointing out the differences between outages that had occurred before the RBI embargo on new digital launches and those that took place after, he said: “We have had outages in December, in March, and one yesterday (June 16, 2021) …. We process record numbers of transaction volumes. Having said that, none of these issues has been on account of capacity. We’ve had issues like a hardware failure somewhere, sometimes some components may not have worked effectively.”",390,-0.5130657851696014

The bank is expected to raise up to USD 1 billion from these dollar denominated bonds.

""We hereby inform you that the bank had approved the issuing of debt instruments in the form of the notes, subject to market conditions,"" HDFC Bank said in a regulatory filing.

An offering memorandum (OM) has been prepared and shall be made available to the prospective investors in relation to the contemplated issue of notes, it said.

The notes will not be offered or sold in India under the applicable laws, including the Companies Act, 2013, as amended from time to time, it added.

Earlier in April, the bank had informed that it is planning to raise up Rs 50,000 crore during the next 12 months through issuing bonds.

""The bank proposes to raise funds by issuing perpetual debt instruments (part of additional tier-I capital), tier-II capital bonds and long-term bonds (financing of infrastructure and affordable housing) up to a total amount of Rs 50,000 crore over the period of the next 12 months through the private placement mode,"" HDFC Bank had said.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB’s earnings profile of Rs77.3bn was lower than estimates (PLe: Rs79.8bn) led by a much weaker than expected NII growth of 9% YoY despite a loan growth of 14% YoY. NII profile has remained weaker than loan growth for some time now but unfavorable mix on high liquidity & non-retail focus is reflecting much higher. In our view, HDFCB will continue to face near term setbacks with difficult operating environment leading to weaker cross cycle NII of 12% YoY, higher slippages of 200bps and volatile earnings of 17-18%. Although, bank has a strong balance sheet with PCR of 67-70% and ability to absorb higher credit losses, 60bps of contingency provisions and restructuring <1%.

Outlook

HDFCB earnings should improve as visibility remains high post pandemic leading to superior ROEs of 17-18% over FY23-FY24E and is best in the industry. We retain BUY with revised TP of Rs1,872 (from Rs1,735) as we roll over to Sep-23 ABV and retain our multiple of 3.6x.

ICICI Bank, on July 20, announced the launch of a co-branded credit card with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), continuing its push in the credit cards segment.

Earlier this month, the private sector lender said that it has issued over 2 million Amazon Pay-ICICI Bank credit cards, since its launch in October 2018, making it the fastest co-branded credit card to have crossed this milestone in the country.

The ICICI Bank-HPCL Super Saver Credit Card will offer rewards and benefits to customers on their spend on fuel as well as other categories, while paying electricity and mobile bills, and in departmental stores like Big Bazaar and D-Mart, and e-commerce portals.

The bank said that, typically, similar credit cards offer accelerated benefits on spends in one category alone. “This card breaks that barrier as it enables customers to save on every transaction they make. We believe that this card will empower customers to save more while enjoying the convenience of digital payments,” said Sudipta Roy, Head, Unsecured Assets, ICICI Bank.

ICICI Bank has been among the leading issuers of credit cards in recent months, especially after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) barred its larger rival, HDFC Bank, from issuing new credit cards in December 2020. ICICI Bank held a 70 percent share in new credit cards issued in December 2020.

In FY21, ICICI Bank gained the highest incremental market share of 32.4 percent, followed by SBI Card at 30.6 percent, according to a recent report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL).

ICICI Bank is focusing on the credit card category from the perspective of increasing profits from customers who revolve or stagger their payments, it told analysts on April 24. “The credit card is a very profitable portfolio and on credit card you make some money on spends and some money on revolvers,” said Anup Bagchi, Executive Director, ICICI Bank.

“Our approach is not just growing the book on credit card. We would want to have a healthy mix of making customers primary, having not only large spenders but also episodic revolvers,” Bagchi added.

HDFC Bank, however, continues to be the market leader in terms of card spends. On June 30, the bank said it is preparing to ensure that it takes back the pole position in terms of cards in force and also increases its spend on market share, once the embargo is lifted.

“We’ve utilised our very large sales force and refocused on the portfolio customers and we’ve rescaled and honed our skill sets in terms of being able to manage customer expectations, focusing on a lot of upsell, cross-sell, better customer service, etc.,” said Parag Rao, Group Head,Payments, Consumer Finance, Digital Banking & IT, HDFC Bank.",458,0.9088445504506429

These petitions are likely to come up for hearing on 22 July, according to a person familiar with the development.

""SBI has moved a writ petition and another one by a group of banks including HDFC Bank, Axis and ICICI Bank. Both argue against the directive to disclose information under RTI,"" said the person.

Banks have questioned the disclosure of inspection report details under RTI will be breach of privacy of the clients. Also, RTI is supposed to be answered by government organisations and not private banks, banks argued. An earlier Supreme Court order said banks' inspections reports will have to made public under the RTI Act. Banks have moved courts against this but the SC has so far refused to recall the earlier ruling.

In July, the SC had refused the prayers made by Punjab National Bank and Union Bank of India to stay the RTI notices issued to them by the Reserve Bank of India to disclose information with respect to defaulters and inspection lists etc. Banks have been arguing that revealing sensitive individual customer information and inspection reports to the general public will harm the confidentiality in the transactions.

Interestingly, on 8 July, the Central Information Commission (CIC) has stayed the order of the First Appellate Authority (FAA) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which had directed the disclosure of information on non-performing assets (NPAs) and top defaulters of the Saraswat Co-operative Bank Limited.

Should RBI disclose bank information?

There is a larger question here. According to a senior industry official, there is no harm in RBI disclosing all information with respect to the functioning of banks including the inspection reports and list of defaulters because public have a right to know about what's going on in banks. Banks are ultimately guardians of public money, the official said.

""Banks will oppose disclosure of information only if they have something to hide,"" said the official quoted above. ""As such, the RBI takes client confidentiality very seriously. But, there is a Supreme Court direction,"" the official said.

Why are banks worried about such disclosures?

Banks fear that revealing the finer details of inspections and defaulter details will affect the relations with large corporate clients and will be sensitive to investors in the market. The Supreme Court has always maintained that the RBI must disclose details of defaulters in the public interest but banks have opposed it strongly.

In March 2016, the RBI gave a list of defaulters to the SC but requested not to reveal the names. ""Disclosing details of accounts where defaults have been found irrespective of the reasons for no-repayment may have adverse impact for business and in a way may accentuate the failure of business rather than nursing it back to health,"" the Reserve Bank of India said in an affidavit submitted along with the list of defaulters.",523,-0.9846612811088562

HDFC Bank share price fell over 2 percent at open on July 19 after the company declared its Q1 results.

The country's largest private sector lender on July 17 reported a 16.1 percent year-on-year growth in standalone profit at Rs 7,729.64 crore for the quarter ended June 2021 despite elevated provisions.

Higher other income and pre-provision operating profit along with NII supported profitability. The bank reported a profit of Rs 6,658.62 crore in Q1 FY21.

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew by 8.6 percent to Rs 17,009 crore compared to the year-ago quarter, with loan growth of 14.4 percent and a core net interest margin of 4.1 percent. Deposits, at Rs 13.45 lakh crore grew, by 13.2 percent YoY.

The bank, in its BSE filing, said its continued focus on deposits helped in the maintenance of a healthy liquidity coverage ratio at 126 percent, well above the regulatory requirement.

The stock was trading at Rs 1,480.70, down Rs 41.00, or 2.69 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,491.00 and an intraday low of Rs 1,475.00.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after Q1 earnings:

Goldman Sachs | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,803

The company reported better-than-expected operating performance with core PPOP 5 percent ahead. However, higher-than-expected provisions led to PAT miss.

Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 2,000

The brokerage firm is of the view that Q1F22 EPS was 1 percent below its estimates. ""NIM missed our estimate but was offset by higher fees. Bad loan formation was elevated given second Covid wave. Provisions broadly in-line adjusted for contingency provisions. Reduce EPS estimates by 2 percent,"" it said.

CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,850

The bank reported manageable asset quality but weak NII trends. NII growth of less than 10 percent YoY was weak and reflects a big loan mix shift. ""Commentary on retail and SME asset quality is comforting Loan and NII growth trends will be key to watch. No update on credit card ban which will remain a near-term overhang,"" it added.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,800

HDFC Bank reported an in line performance, though margin fell by 10bp QoQ on higher interest reversals, unfavorable asset mix, and lower revolving balances on credit cards. Advances growth stood at 14 percent YoY, led by healthy trends in the commercial and rural banking portfolio, while retail growth was muted due to a sharp decline in the credit cards portfolio, which was affected by RBI’s restriction on sourcing of new credit cards and lower revolving balances.

Asset quality deteriorated marginally, with GNPA/NNPA ratio increasing by 15bp/8bp QoQ. Total slippages in 1QFY22 stands elevated. Also, restructured loans rose to 0.8% of loans (v/s 0.6% in FY21). We broadly maintain our earnings estimates for FY22E/FY23E and maintain our buy rating.

Arihant Capital | Rating: Accumulate | Target: Rs 1,721

Covid 2.0 has impacted the bank’s operation resulting into spike in slippages. However, it remained pretty much under control. With the easing of lockdown and decline in covid cases, business activity has started picking up and bounce rates also holding up well. We believe, bank should bounce back from Q2FY22 onwards as normalisation starts.

We continue to maintain our positive stance on HDFC Bank due to its best-in-class deposit franchise, well cushioned balance sheet, comfortable capital level and expect growth rate to bounce back. We cut our earnings estimates by 3%/1% for FY22/23E and maintain our accumulate rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1,721 (earlier Rs 1,683), valuing the bank at 3.7x FY23E P/ABV.

A close look at the quarterly numbers reported by India's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank shows not all is well on the asset-quality front.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis (QOQ), the asset quality has deteriorated. The gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) at the end of June 30 jumped to 1.47 percent of the gross advances in the first quarter of FY22 against 1.32 percent in Q4 of FY21, while net non-performing assets (NPAs) jumped to 0.48 percent from 0.40 percent.

In absolute numbers, GNPAs stood at Rs 17,098 crore at the end of Q1, up 13.33 percent from Rs 15,086 crore in the preceding quarter. The figure would be higher if one takes into account the loans written off in the June quarter (Rs 3,100 crore) and sold (Rs 1,800 crore.)

A loan becomes an NPA if there is no repayment of interest or principal for 90 days. Loans are written off once the bank is convinced that there is no immediate chance of recovery. Non-performing loans are sold to outside agencies to take some burden off the book. Both steps indicate stress in the system. A bank needs to make higher provisions while writing off loans.

Logically, HDFC Bank’s provisions, the money set aside to cover likely losses, increased to Rs 4830.84 crore from Rs 46,93.70 crore sequentially. Higher provisions impact the profitability of a bank.

Covid stress

In the notes attached to the result, HDFC Bank's CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan acknowledged the pain and impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the bank's balance sheet and the continuation of the stress over Covid uncertainty.

The impact of COVID-19, including changes in customer behaviour and pandemic fears as well as restrictions on business and individual activities, has led to significant volatility in global and Indian financial markets and a significant decrease in global and local economic activities, Jagdishan said.

""The disruptions following the outbreak, have led to a decrease in loan originations, the sale of third party products, the use of credit and debit cards by customers and the efficiency in collection efforts. This may lead to a continued rise in the number of customer defaults and consequently an increase in provisions there against,"" Jagdishan said.

Further, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the group's results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain, including any new information concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any action to contain its spread or mitigate its impact whether government-mandated or elected by the bank, the CEO said.

This is an open and honest admission that the bank has no clue on how the scenario will pan out.

Traditionally, HDFC Bank is known for keeping the asset quality under control even during the toughest of market scenarios. But the spike in bad loans highlights the severity of problems on the ground even for the biggest private bank.

What lies ahead?

For HDFC Bank, a jump in NPAs may not pose any immediate concerns as it has the ability to absorb the impact. But, there is a larger signal here about the state of the banking industry.

This will be more pertinent for smaller banks and those with poor track record of recovery and have corporate-heavy books.

The impact could be harder once regulatory relaxations are rolled back and the normal recovery cycle kicks in. The recent regulatory relaxations and rule exemptions can only delay the pain if the economic recovery doesn't catch up. Vaccination is the key to containing the dreaded virus swiftly.

So far, we have seen two waves of Covid. The first wave hit the world, then largely unprepared, in 2020. The second one happened this year characterised by the different variants and more severe infections. The preparedness was better this time. Nevertheless, the severity of the spread and infection led to a loss of livelihood and pushed most states to go for localised lockdowns against a nation-wide containment in 2020.

Lockdowns have not really ended. As HDFC Bank said while the national lockdown was lifted by the government regional lockdowns continue to be implemented in areas with a significant number of Covid-19 cases.

Now, there is a warning of a “third wave” from a section of medical experts.

Till now, the real impact of Covid lockdowns has not been felt on the bank’s balance sheets. That is because two rounds of loan restructuring announcements and moratorium schemes have been announced since last year for different segments of borrowers. The real worry will emerge when the period of regulatory dispensations get over.

The Reserve Bank of India's July edition of Financial Stability Report (FSR) had suggested that banks' GNPA ratio may rise to 9.8 percent in the baseline scenario by March 2022 and can go up to 10.36 percent and 11.22 percent under scenarios of medium and severe stress, respectively. This is an improved outlook from earlier But the caveat is that sharp deviations in the expected Covid trajectory can upset all such calculations.

HDFC Bank's chief executive officer Sashidhar Jagdishan on July 17 said the ban imposed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in last December on the new digital launches has impacted the business. The bank is prepared to bounce back once the ban is lifted, Jagdishan said.

The RBI-appointed third party audit on bank's IT audit is complete and HDFC Bank is awaiting the final decision from the regulator on withdrawal of the ban, Jagdishan said at the bank's Annual General Meeting (AGM) on Saturday.

In December last year, the RBI asked HDFC Bank to put all new digital launches on hold till the bank resolve the tech issues.

Jagdishan said there was a valid reason why the RBI imposed the ban on HDFC Bank's time for recovery from tech outages were not meeting global standards. Jagdishan said the bank has resolved most of the issues in its technology platform.

The bank is prepared to launch new products once the ban is lifted, Jagdishan said. It will however take 12-15 months to complete the technology transformation, he added.

The bank has prepared a roadmap for technology transformation under the Digital 2.0 plan.

The bank has a number of digital launches planned across various business verticals under the initiative including the launch of an auto portal, which the bank calls a one-stop shop for all vehicle loans. The bank describes Digital 2.0 as “the next phase of our digitisation journey.”

Other initiatives include My Account My Choice where current account, savings account (CASA) customers can choose any account number of their choice when they sign on as an HDFC client. It will offer card-less cash withdrawals, WhatsApp Banking and smart slips that enable customers to fill in cash deposit, withdrawal and cheque deposit slips through NetBanking, using a reference ID, and complete the transaction at a banking outlet. Some of these services have already been launched.

HDFC Bank is one of the biggest card issuers in the country with 15 million credit cards and 33.8 million debit cards as of December-end.

Earlier, HDFC Bank Chairman Atanu Chakraborty said the bank has created a new business segment of commercial (MSME) and rural banking to capture the next wave of growth. ""This will not only reinforce the Bank’s top position in the MSME segment but also strengthen efforts to serve customers in both India and Bharat and even consumer segments like the tech savvy and Millennial, going forward,"" Chakraborty said. The creation of this vertical is under the 'future ready' project of the bank.

The delivery channels will be complemented with digital marketing, even as the bank leverages the branch channel and virtual relationship channel, the Chairman said.

""As, number of active cases come down and vaccination gathers pace, we estimate India’s economy to grow at a fair clip in near and medium term,"" Atanu Chakraborty said at the bank's annual general meeting (AGM) on 17 July.

This is Chakraborty's first AGM as HDFC Bank Chairman. In April this year, the RBI approved the appointment of Chakraborty as the new Chairman of the bank. The appointment is for a period of three years and follows the exit of previous chairperson, Shyamala Gopinath in December last year. Chakraborty is a 1985 batch IAS officer from the Gujarat cadre.

HDFC Bank has seen major changes at the top last year. Aditya Puri, the managing director of the bank for the last 26 years, retired in October handing over the baton to Sashidhar Jagdishan for the top job at the bank. Along with this, there have been a series of changes at the top level.

Pandemic impact

Chakraborty said the economy was hit by multiple waves of the pandemic that has induced a general risk- aversion. ""That has translated into lower discretionary spending by people, at large. This coupled with mobility restrictions has impacted the aggregate demand, which is quite unlike regular boom and bust cycles,"" Chakraborty said.

Chakraborty said the bank has created a new business segment of commercial (MSME) and rural banking to capture the next wave of growth. ""This will not only reinforce the Bank’s top position in the MSME segment but also strengthen efforts to serve customers in both India and Bharat and even consumer segments like the tech savvy and Millennial, going forward,"" Chakraborty said. The creation of this vertical is under the 'future ready' project of the bank.

The delivery channels will be complemented with digital marketing, even as the bank leverages the branch channel and virtual relationship channel, the Chairman said.

Chakraborty apologised to the bank's customers ""for the times when we have not been able to live up to customers’ expectations,"" and said going ahead the bank's primary goal is serving the customer, ""with utmost humility, care and efficiency."" This comment assumes significance in the context of bank facing challenges on the technology front. Following multiple digital outages, the RBI had barred the HDFC Bank in December last year from launching new digital products. The ban stays even now.

A closer look at the first quarter (April-June) numbers of India’s largest private lender shows that the resurgence of COVID-19 has taken a toll on its books. Business growth has slowed down. There is abundant caution over the selection of new loans, including retail assets.

On the other hand, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) audit on the bank’s IT infrastructure is over, and the bank is hopeful that it will be free soon to launch new digital products. Overall, HDFC Bank is going through tough times since the exit of its former CEO Aditya Puri last year. Its new chief, Sashidhar Jagdishan, is striving to chart out a fresh path. But Jagdishan has multiple issues to tackle.

There is a clear pressure on loan growth, compared with the bank's performance in good times. The loan growth has slowed down to 14.4 percent on a year-on-year basis (YOY), while on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, it fell to 1.3 per cent.

Among loan categories, retail loans grew by around 9 percent over June 30, 2020, and were lower by around 1 percent, as compared to March 31, 2021. Also, commercial and rural banking loans grew by around 25 percent over June 30, 2020, and around 4 percent over March 31, 2021.

HDFC Bank has adopted a cautious approach, much like most of its peers, ever since the start of COVID. That stance continued in Q1 as well. The second wave of COVID wasn’t an expected one for the banking sector but, thankfully, most banks had jacked up their provisioning cushion (money set aside against potential losses), learning from the first wave and taking cues from the RBI's repeated calls to guard against the COVID impact.

Hence, the damage is lesser than expected--something RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, too, said in his opening remarks in the recent financial stability report.

Moderation in credit momentum

Analysts have acknowledged the loss of business momentum. “Overall, we believe that HDFC Bank's credit momentum has moderated a bit in Q1, dragged mainly by continued weakness in the retail segment. The bank has well managed its asset quality after the second COVID wave, but new stress formation in CV, SME and PL due to back-to-back disruptions will be a key monitorable,” said Anand Dama, senior research analyst at Emkay Global.

“As a prudent measure, the bank carries a reasonable contingent buffer (Rs 68 billion; 0.6 percent of loans) as of Q4FY21 and could keep credit cost in check,” Dama said.

The COVID-19 trajectory, going ahead, will be crucial for the bank to decide its loan growth pace. The progress of the vaccination drive will be key for the whole banking sector as the ability of borrowers to repay existing borrowings and that of fresh borrowers to seek fresh loans will closely depend on containing the COVID-19 scenario at the earliest.

Questions over technology platform

But for HDFC Bank, COVID is only one part of the problem. The problems with its IT infrastructure, despite the many assurances by the bank that it has addressed the problem areas, still continues. The bank reported a mobile banking outage even recently.

There are questions over the capacity of its technology platform to handle large volumes of digital transactions and new launches. An RBI-appointed third-party audit is over in the bank and the new team, under Jagdishan, is awaiting clearance from the central bank. The RBI is, at present, inspecting the audit report. The regulator's view will be the key.

The RBI, in December 2020, barred HDFC Bank from new digital launches and issuing new credit cards after repeated outages hit the bank’s digital channels. “We are constantly in discussions and talks with the RBI. They had indicated areas in which they would want us to make changes in processes, investments in technology, etc. We’ve been through (this) in a very interactive manner in the last six months with the auditors appointed by the RBI,” said Parag Rao, Group Head–Payments, Consumer Finance, Digital Banking & IT, HDFC Bank, in a recent interaction with the press.

The RBI ban has hit its market share, the bank had admitted a while ago. The bank has lost its market share by a couple of percentage points because of the ban, but the actions taken internally have ensured that it continues to hold on to the market share by spends, the bank's IT head had said.

To sum up, at this point, the country's biggest private bank is fighting two battles simultaneously--the COVID impact and its own internal issues on the technology front--under the new team headed by Jagdishan. The approaching quarters will tell us how successful the outcome will be.",776,-0.5476399687203494

With the senior citizen special FD scheme offered by SBI, HDFC, ICICI, and Bank of Baroda extending till September 2021, here are other alternatives as well that the senior citizenry can explore for financially securing the twilight years of their life.

The pandemic has undoubtedly been disproportionately cruel to the elder citizens, leaving them vulnerable, both health-wise and money-wise. To safeguard the older population against the ravages of COVID-19, the banks have been offering additional returns on top of the special rates applicable for senior citizens.

The scheme, which has been subject to various extensions since its inception in May 2020 and ending in September this year, is applicable on FDs with a tenure of 5 years or more.

As per the 2011 census, there are nearly 100 million elderly persons in the country aged 60 and above, and if United Nations Population Fund and HelpAge India estimates are to be believed, this figure is expected to reach 173 million by 2026.

SBI’s “Wecare '' term deposit scheme for senior citizens, which offered an additional 30 bps interest rate on top of the 50 bps already being allotted to FDs of senior citizens exceeding 5 years or more, stands extended till September 30, 2021.

For the general public, which avails an interest rate of 5.4 percent on their FDs, senior citizens will avail additional benefits with a rate of 6.2 percent effective January 8, 2021.

The HDFC Bank senior citizen care FD offers 75 bps extra returns over the prevailing rates. Based on the current FD rates of the bank, which went into effect in May 2021, a senior citizen is eligible for around 6.25 percent under this scheme.

""An additional premium of 0.25% (over and above the existing premium of 0.50%) shall be given to Senior Citizens who wish to book the Fixed Deposit less than 5 crores for a tenure of 5 (five) years One Day to 10 Years, during special deposit offer commencing from 18th May'20 to 30th Sep’21,” the bank website mentioned.

Under the ICICI bank Golden Years FD scheme, the beneficiary will get an extra 0.8 percent above the normal FD rates. With the current FD interest rate for a 5-10 year FD tenor being 5.5 percent, senior citizens will earn 6.3 percent under this scheme.

BoB (Bank of Baroda) is offering an additional percent for senior citizens over its normal FD rates, taking the cumulative rate applicable to around 6.25 percent. ""1.00% for ""above 5 years to up to 10 years"" tenor and valid till 30.09.2021,"" the bank’s website mentioned.

However, there are other viable investment avenues that can be explored as well. With NPS, Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY), which offer interest in the range of 6-8 percent, senior citizens can be assured of a regular source of income along with the safety of their money

Anirudh (name changed), a Delhi-based personal finance advisor, advocates for better investment options like mutual funds instead of vanilla FDs for senior citizens. “It is important to examine senior citizens' investment avenues in the present. Previously, once a person crossed 60 years of age, they were advised to not put money in risky instruments like mutual funds and equity. But thanks to improved medical facilities, life expectancy has increased another 20-25 years. Thus, it is important to participate in market action. Debt funds and Index funds are safe options for investing for senior citizens who prefer less risk and more fund stability.”",597,0.002957254648208618

The RBI's ban on selling new credit cards has impacted market share on an incremental basis, HDFC Bank said on Wednesday, promising to get back to the market ""with a bang"" once the ""temporal"" embargo is lifted and recoup the losses.

The bank's head of consumer finance, digital banking and information technology, Parag Rao, said that it has used the last six months to ""introspect, re-engineer and innovate"" about the cards business, where it has 15.5 million customers.

The bank has lost its market share by a couple of percentage points because of the ban, but the actions taken internally have ensured that it continues to hold on to market share by spends, he said.

In December, the RBI acted against repeated technological outages at HDFC Bank over two years by slapping unprecedented penalties, which included a ban on any new credit card issuance and also prohibition on launching new digital initiatives.

""We have got very aggressive plans to get back in the market with a big bang... You will rapidly see HDFC Bank not just regaining market share but also significantly increasing our spend market share,"" Rao said.

Without sharing any details over when he expects the ban to be lifted, Rao said within 3-4 months of the ban getting lifted, one should expect a correction in the incremental market share back to the pre-ban levels, launch of new products and features and also partnerships which have been forged during this period.

""We were very clear that this is at best a temporal situation. During the six months when we were not issuing new credit cards, we increased our merchant acceptance base, our liability franchise increased and today we are sitting on a large base of already analytically data mined customers who have already kept ready and pre-approved,"" he said.

The ""large sales force"" has been trained, re-skilled and primed for the aggressive play ahead and backend processes for them have also been made more streamlined, Rao said.

He admitted that rivals have seized up on the opportunity once HDFC Bank stopped issuing the cards, amidst reports on how ICICI Bank and SBI, among others have grown. It can be noted that HDFC Bank's credit card customers decreased by 4.67 lakh between December and April, when they stood at 14.9 million, while SBI has gained over 6 lakh new cards and ICICI gained 10 lakh.

The bank has been in constant discussion with RBI ever since the ban was imposed and has upgraded its systems as per the indications from the regulator, Rao said, adding that it has now presented a plan which focuses on the immediate, short term, mid-term and long term plan to the central bank.

""We are awaiting the comments from the RBI. We are hopeful that RBI will be satisfied with the plan which we had submitted,"" he said.

Rao said the bank's investments in technology were already at par with global standards, but the recent regulatory action will see higher spends on technology over the next two or three years.

Reiterating its focus outlined earlier, he said outages do happen and they happen with rivals as well, but the important aspect will be how it manages its way out of a crisis.

HDFC Bank, the country’s largest private bank by assets, said on June 30 it has shared its short to long-term growth strategy with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and was waiting to hear from the regulator.

The RBI in December 2020 barred HDFC Bank from new digital launches and issuing new credit cards after repeated outages hit the bank’s digital channels. The RBI has subsequently conducted an audit of the IT infrastructure of the bank. The embargo is yet to be lifted.

“We are constantly in discussions and talks with RBI. They had indicated areas in which they would want us to make changes in processes, investments in technology, etc. We’ve been through (this) in a very interactive manner in the last six months with the auditors appointed by the RBI,” said Parag Rao, Group Head–Payments, Consumer Finance, Digital Banking & IT, HDFC Bank.

The bank had submitted to the RBI its short, mid our long-term strategies with the single ""goal of saying that HDFC Bank will continue to grow and is ambitious and aggressive about the segments where we are (present)”, Rao added.

In the last six months, the bank worked on strengthening its infrastructure and competency to match its growth ambition. “We are awaiting the comments of RBI and, like I said, we are hopeful and confident that RBI will be satisfied with the kind of changes we’ve shown immediately and in the short term,” Rao said.

The private lender has in the last six months lost market share in the issuance of incremental credit cards, even as it has been able to hold on to its leading share in spends, Rao said.

The bank is preparing itself to ensure that it takes back the pole position in terms of cards in force and also increases its spend market share once the embargo is lifted.

The bank acquired a “significant number” of customers on the liabilities and assets sides. The strategy to target 75-80 percent of internal customers for the card base would continue, Rao said. “We have pre-approved them, we have seen six months of behaviour of these customers on these products. So we’ve got all of that ready,” Rao said, outlining the levers that would drive the bank’s ability to recoup card market share.",420,0.6734691063563029

But, Jagdishan's total takeaway may be higher than this considering the compensation in his previous role.

In his previous role as group head and 'change agent' of the bank, Jagdishan earned an annual salary of Rs 2.91 crore. In his previous role, Jagdishan earned a salary increase of 6.6 percent in FY 21, the report showed.

In the case of Sashidhar Jagdishan and executive director Kaizad Bharucha, fixed pay includes salary, allowances, retiral benefits as well as value of perquisites excluding ESOPs.

Bharucha earned a salary of Rs 6 crore for FY 21.

Jagdishan, as group head, used to handle Finance, Human Resources, Legal & Secretarial, Administration, Infrastructure, Corporate Communications, and Corporate Social Responsibility in his previous role. He took over as new MD&CEO succeeding Aditya Puri on October 27, 2020. The former managing director Aditya Puri took home a total remuneration of Rs 18.9 crore in the fiscal year 2019-20.

The country's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank has identified corporate banking, lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME), government banking, retail assets and payments as key focus areas going ahead and the growth strategy will be aided by digital channels, the bank’s MD & CEO said in the integrated annual report for 2020-21.

“We have clearly identified our growth engines: Corporate Banking, Commercial Banking (MSME) and Rural, Government and Institutional Banking, Private Banking, Retail Assets and Payments to be driven by our delivery channels of Branch Banking, Tele-Sales/Service/Relationship and Digital Marketing,” Jagdishan said in a message included as part of the report.

These growth engines would be powered by HDFC Bank’s technology and digital platforms. They will also account for the bulk of the bank’s future investments and can be broadly classified as business verticals and delivery channels, Jagdishan said.

Jagdishan said the bank’s strategy will have the ability to adapt and evolve without losing the core. “We are building upon our stated strategy of expanding our distribution footprint leveraging the Branch Channel and Virtual Relationship Channel with the addition of Digital Marketing as a key channel,” Jagdishan said. This will enable the bank to capture the growth potential in both urban and rural India as also different consumer segments, such as the tech-savvy and millennials, going forward.

While HDFC Bank continues to focus on the corporate cluster and government business to increase penetration, it has created a new business segment of commercial (MSME) and rural banking to capture the next wave of growth. “We will continue to strengthen our leadership position in the payments business and retail assets business and have added Wealth Management and Private Banking as a core focus area for us,” Jagdishan said in the report.

In a recent call with investors, Jagdishan had said that HDFC Bank plans to expand its SME banking platform, which now accounts for 20 percent of its loan book, as the key growth driver in the next three to five years. “The recent changes in the management structure were aimed to facilitate a far more focussed approach towards execution here... Bank is cognisant of the asset quality risks associated with this segment and hence will keep underwriting and collection teams tighter,” investment bank Jefferies said in a report dated June 10.

Jagdishan further added that while the bank had taken a cautious view on the impact of COVID on its staff over the past couple of months, the falling infection rates and vaccination are supporting the opening-up of the bank. “On the client side, the bank is largely comfortable as (1) 85 percent of retail clients work with AA and above rated corporates where job losses have been low, (2) SMEs were better prepared than in the past, and (3) larger corps. have better liquidity in their balance sheet,” Jefferies said.

Jagdishan said in the integrated annual report that all the core business areas would be supported by further strengthening HDFC Bank’s foundational capability in the technology and digital domains.

The RBI-appointed third party audit of country's largest lender, HDFC Bank's IT systems has got over and the audit report has been submitted to the regulator for a final decision, said HDFC Bank's managing director and CEO, Sashidhar Jagdishan in the bank's integrated annual report 2020-2021.

In December last year, the RBI had banned HDFC Bank from new digital launches, including issuing new credit cards and proceeding with the so-called Digital 2.0 plan following a series of technical glitches reported over the last two years. Subsequently, the RBI also initiated a third party audit of the bank's IT systems. ""This audit is now over and the report has been submitted to the regulator. We now await the decision from RBI,"" said Jagishan in the report.

“As a Bank we are certainly sorry for what has happened. And have taken this as an opportunity to improve and redouble our efforts to fix this problem for good. We have now embarked on a scale changing technology adoption and transformation agenda to help drive our ambitious future growth plans,” Jagdishan said.

In the annual report, Jagishan laid out some of the specific initiatives that the bank has planned on its technology transformation agenda even as the regulator is awaiting the final nod on new launches from the RBI.

The plan

As part of this, the bank has invested in the infrastructure scalability, Jagdishan said. “We have invested heavily in the scale up of our infrastructure to handle any potential load for the next 3/5 years. We are also in the process of accelerating our cloud strategy to be on the cutting edge leveraging best-in-class cloud service providers,” Jagdishan said.

Further, the bank has strengthened its disaster recovery resiliency, the CEO said. “We have strengthened our process of monitoring our Data Centre (DC) and have shifted key applications to a new DC. This includes key consumer facing ones. We have strengthened the Disaster Recovery trials and processes so as to bounce back to serve our customers faster and quicker,” Jagdishan said.

One of the reasons often cited by the experts for HDFC Bank’s technology outages was lack of capability in the data centre. In this context, the bank’s announcement is significant.

Further, the bank has strengthened the security enhancements over the IT systems, Jagdishan said. “We have strengthened our firewalls further. We have to be scanning the horizon for potential security issues and be ever prepared to face them. We haven’t had any security issues in the past. But this is always an important area of focus and action plans are underway for further robustness,” the CEO said.

Jagdishan also spoke about the monitoring mechanisms that bank has put in place to avoid further likely issues. “An enhanced application monitoring mechanism has been put in place across the board to enable us to keep our IT systems always on,” Jagdishan said.

Jagdishan’s moves

Under Jagdishan, HDFC Bank wants to claw back lost ground in the digital business, overcome legacy issues that have put the lender under a cloud in the past two years and team up with new technology partners to cement its position as the country's preeminent bank.

Part of the plan is to build a ""digital bank within the bank,"" according to a June 2 report by Bernstein Research titled HDFC Bank: A digital bank within the bank with Zeta? The report outlined a plan for a major revamp within the bank to create a digital bank for new customers, eventually encompassing its entire retail customers base.

“Is HDFCB building a digital-native bank within the bank? This is what it seems like from public posts of a startup called Zeta (private). Zeta’s pitch is to be the cloud-native 'Omni-Stack' for banks – a single software solution for cards, loans, deposits with customizable web and mobile interfaces.” Berstein Research said.

It said the planned entity would be first targeted at digital-first users that would gradually evolve into a scalable platform for the entire retail franchise of HDFC Bank. Bernstein referred to a fundraising announcement by Zeta that talked about a partnership with HDFC Bank to ""re-define banking in India.""

HDFC Bank has, according to its annual report, a total of 56 million customers, which would include individuals, small and medium enterprises and corporate entities. “The 25 million customer base quoted by Plutus suggests it may be a retail/individual-focused solution,” the report said.

Digital 2.0

Already, HDFC Bank has drawn up a digital expansion road map--what it calls a Digital 2.0. The bank has a number of digital launches planned across various business verticals under the initiative including the launch of an auto portal, which the bank calls a one-stop shop for all vehicle loans. The bank describes Digital 2.0 as “the next phase of our digitisation journey.”

Other initiatives include My Account My Choice where current account, savings account (CASA) customers can choose any account number of their choice when they sign on as an HDFC client. It will offer card-less cash withdrawals, WhatsApp Banking and smart slips that enable customers to fill in cash deposit, withdrawal and cheque deposit slips through NetBanking, using a reference ID, and complete the transaction at a banking outlet. Some of these services have already been launched.

HDFC Bank is one of the biggest card issuers in the country with 15 million credit cards and 33.8 million debit cards as of December-end. HDFC Bank’s retail portfolio had grown by around 7% in the year ended March. Within the retail franchise, HDFC Bank expanded its credit cards business by 12% and home loans by around 10%.

HDFCB could first launch Plutus for a digital-first audience and subsequently scale this for its entire retail bank operation, Bernstein Research said. “Digital banks in emerging markets offer interesting case studies in customer acquisition and growth– Banco Inter (covered by Autonomous' Geoffrey Elliott), NuBank (private). Building a digital bank within a bank could be a smart way to build within Indian regulatory constraints,” the report said.

The ban has presumably benefitted its rivals, including ICICI Bank Ltd, by offering them an opportunity to gain customers. ICICI Bank has aggressively pushed new digital initiatives including IMobilepay, a mobile banking app that provides payments and banking services to customers of any bank. In the March quarter, ICICI Bank’s cardholder base grew by 672,911; HDFC Bank’s portfolio contracted by 322,999 in the same period.",1096,0.7054110434320238

HDFC Bank on June 22 said that it is setting up a digital factory and an enterprise factory to roll out new digital products and services. The factories, which will help augment the bank’s IT infrastructure, will be pivoted on application programming interfaces (APIs), data and cloud.

The dual approach of building the digital factory along with an enterprise factory is part of HDFC Bank’s technology transformation agenda. The bank plans to strengthen its capabilities by hiring up to 500 people over the next two years, from diverse backgrounds such as data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), design thinking, cloud and DevOps.

The Digital Factory will build new business and new solutions riding on new tech stacks and applications and high resiliency and monitoring capabilities. This will be backed by the ability to support large volume growth and plan for upgrading technologies. The bank is also be developing future-ready IP technologies and moving to a native cloud architecture in collaboration with niche technology companies, fintech and large IT companies. The enterprise factory will upgrade legacy infrastructure, decouple existing systems and build its own capabilities by embracing open-source to build resilience and scale.

“The Digital and Enterprise Factories will help us realise the strategy of ‘running’ the bank, while ‘building’ the bank for the future,” said Parag Rao, Group Head – Payments, Consumer Finance, Digital Banking & IT, HDFC Bank. “We are poised to capitalize on opportunities that higher digital adoption will bring in India,” Rao said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had barred HDFC Bank in December 2020 from launching new digital platforms and issuing new credit cards as a penalty for repeated outages on its digital banking channels. The embargo is yet to be lifted. HDFC Bank said last week that an external firm has conducted an audit of its IT systems and the report has been submitted to the RBI.

HDFC Bank said its board has given its approval to buy more than 3.55 crore shares in group firm HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company for over Rs 1,906 crore from the parent company Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC).

""The board of directors of HDFC Bank at its meeting held on June 18, 2021 has approved the purchase of 3,55,67,724 equity shares of Rs 10 each, representing 4.99 per cent of the outstanding issued and paid-up capital of HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company Ltd from HDFC Ltd,"" HDFC Bank said in the filing.

HDFC is the promoter and related party of the bank.

The purchase is to happen at a price determined on an independent evaluation report, subject to receipt of necessary approvals including regulatory approvals and approval from shareholders of the bank, it said.

""The aggregate consideration for purchase of 3,55,67,724 shares of HDFC ERGO is Rs 1,906.43 crore, i.e. Rs 536 per share,"" it said further.

HDFC ERGO General Insurance had a gross written premium of Rs 12,444 crore for the year ended March 2021. The company''s net worth stood at Rs 2,927 crore.

The private sector general insurer is one of the fastest growing companies among the peers with its gross written premium growing at a 35 per cent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last 13 years.

""The proposed transaction enables the bank to participate in the growth opportunity of HDFC ERGO and augment HDFC ERGO''s growth prospects leading to long-term value creation by HDFC ERGO to its shareholders,"" it said.

The bank has been a distribution partner of the insurer since 2009.

The transaction, indicative to be closed by September this year, will require approval from insurance sector regulator Irdai and banking regulator RBI.

HDFC Bank on 17 June said there is no clarity yet on when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will lift the embargo on new digital launches but said the bank is in touch with the regulator on this issue. Asked by when the bank hopes to come out of the ban, Chief Information Officer Ramesh Lakshminarayanan refused to share a timeframe.

In December 2020, the RBI had barred HDFC Bank from launching any new digital products or services and issuing new credit cards as a penalty for repeated instances of outages in its online platforms.

Starting December 2020, the bank has brought in better monitoring systems and a more resilient system of shifting to disaster recovery mode, Lakshminarayanan said. After the embargo on digital launches came in December, HDFC Bank has taken a set of actions, including bringing an external auditor for its systems. The audit went on between February and April. “The reports have been submitted to the regulator. We are awaiting further directions from the regulator in this matter,” Lakshminarayanan said.

Lakshminarayanan sought to distinguish between the outages that had occurred before the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) embargo on new digital launches and those that took place after. “We have had outages in December, in March and one yesterday,” Lakshminarayanan said, adding, “We process record numbers of transaction volumes. Having said that, none of these issues has been on account of capacity. We’ve had issues like a hardware failure somewhere, sometimes some components may not have worked effectively.”

Earlier, in January 2020, the management of the bank had attributed older instances of outages to capacity issues. “We realised as a company, we have been victims of our own success. What one would have envisaged is that from a base level you normally size up for four-five times the capacity. We realise the volumes have gone even beyond the five times capacity that we had originally sized up. So, it is more of a capacity issue,” Sashidhar Jagdishan, then executive director, HDFC Bank, had told analysts in a conference call.",387,-0.8887368440628052

HDFC Bank's public notice on June 17 about refunding GPS device commission to auto loan customers is following a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directive to the bank to that effect, according to two sources familiar with the development.

""The RBI directed the bank to refund the GPS device fee to auto loan customers after conducting an examination of the issue. Subsequently, the bank has complied with this directive,"" one of the sources quoted above said. Both declined to be named.

The bank, in a newspaper advertisement, on June 17 said it would refund the GPS device commission to auto loan customers who had availed of such device as part of the auto loan funding during the period financial year 2013-14 to financial year 2019-20. The bank asked the customers to contact within a period of 30 days.

The refund will be credited to the customer's repayment bank account as registered with the bank, HDFC Bank said in a notice published in the Times of India news paper on June 17.

This brings an end to a controversy surrounding alleged misselling of GPS devices to HDFC Bank's auto loan customers during the term of former CEO, Aditya Puri.

RBI penalty

On May 28, the RBI imposed a monetary penalty of Rs 10 crore on HDFC Bank for violation of certain rules and said his action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance.

This was after an examination of documents in the matter of marketing and sale of third-party non-financial products to the bank’s customers, arising from a whistle blower complaint to RBI regarding irregularities in the auto loan portfolio of the bank, revealed contravention of the aforesaid provisions of the Act and the regulatory directions, the RBI said.

In furtherance to the same, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed for contravention of the provisions of the Act/directions, the RBI said.

After considering the bank’s reply to the show cause notice, oral submissions made during the personal hearing and examination of further clarifications/documents furnished by the bank, RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charge of contravention of provisions of the Act was substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty, the RBI said.

Auto loan division controversy

The irregularities in the auto loan portfolio pertains to the charges including bank’s executives forcing the borrowers to buy GPS devices bundled with the auto loans and even insisting that loans will not be sanctioned unless they buy these devices.

The devices, manufactured by a Mumbai firm, Trackpoint GPS, cost about Rs 18,000 a piece.

The allegations first surfaced on social media. The bank responded to the charges with the statement only after a sustained social media campaign by one of the whistleblowers against the alleged irregularities and subsequent reports in the mainstream media.

The misconduct by the bank officials was acknowledged by Puri in the bank’s AGM when he said an internal probe was conducted against a few erring employees and appropriate action was taken.

In July 2020, the bank had sacked six executives over allegations of corruption and breach of corporate governance standards. The private sector lender fired six senior and mid-level officials after an internal investigation found that they were involved in corrupt practices.

""We had received some whistle-blowing complaints, internal enquiries carried out in the matter on the complaints received has not brought out any conflict of interest issue nor does it have any bearing on our loan portfolio,"" HDFC Bank’s former chief Puri said at the company's annual general meeting (AGM) on July 18.

""Enquiry did bring out another aspect related to personal misconduct exhibited by a set of individuals for which appropriate disciplinary actions have been taken,"" Puri added.",636,-0.925013467669487

The country's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank on June 15 said its mobile banking app was facing some technical glitches but the issue is now resolved.



Please note the issues around mobile banking app is now resolved. Customers can now use NetBanking and mobile banking app for transactions. We regret the inconvenience and thank you for your patience.

— HDFC Bank News (@HDFCBankNews) June 15, 2021

Earlier today, the bank had informed customers that the mobile app is experiencing some issues and requested that they use the net banking services for transactions. ""We are experiencing some issues on the MobileBanking App. We are looking into this on priority and will update shortly. Customers are requested to please use NetBanking to complete their transaction. Regret the inconvenience caused,"" HDFC Bank tweeted.

The latest technical glitch happened at a time when the bank's IT infrastructure is already under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) audit for a series of technical problems reported.

In December last year, the RBI clamped down on the bank, prohibiting it from proceeding with any new digital launches in the backdrop of a series of glitches in its digital channels over a period of two years.

An RBI-appointed third party-audit of the bank's IT infrastructure is currently underway. The ban has presumably benefitted its rivals, including ICICI Bank Ltd, by offering them an opportunity to gain customers.

ICICI Bank has aggressively pushed new digital initiatives including IMobilepay, a mobile banking app that provides payments and banking services to customers of any bank. In the March quarter, ICICI Bank’s cardholder base grew by 672,911; HDFC Bank’s portfolio contracted by 322,999 in the same period.

Even as the bank awaits RBI clearance, the lender has big plans for the digital space. Under new chief executive officer (CEO) Sashidhar Jagdishan, HDFC Bank wants to claw back lost ground in the digital business, overcome legacy issues that have put the lender under a cloud in the past two years and team up with new technology partners to cement its position as the country's preeminent bank, Moneycontrol reported on June 9.

“With reference to the Regulations, we wish to inform you that the Board of Directors of HDFC Bank Limited (“the Bank”), at its meeting scheduled to be held on June 18, 2021, shall inter alia consider a proposal for recommendation of dividend on the equity shares of the Bank for the financial year ended March 31, 2021, in view of the notification of the Reserve Bank of India pertaining to declaration of dividend by banks released on April 22, 2021,” the lender said in a notification to the exchanges.

On April 22, the RBI issued a circular in which it partially modified the instructions contained in its May 4, 2005 circular. The central bank allowed banks to pay dividend from the profits for FY21, subject to the quantum of dividend being not more than 50 percent of the amount determined as per the dividend payout ratio prescribed in the 2005 circular.

“In view of the continuing uncertainty caused by the ongoing second wave of COVID-19 in the country, it is crucial that banks remain resilient and proactively raise and conserve capital as a bulwark against unexpected losses,” the RBI had said on April 22.

The regulator also said that, while declaring dividend, it would be the responsibility of the bank’s board to consider the current and projected capital position of the bank vis-à-vis the applicable capital requirements and the adequacy of provisions, taking into account the economic environment and the outlook for profitability.

HDFC Bank has big plans for the digital space as it battles to emerge from a central bank ban on the launch of new digital financial products and services because of frequent outages that have bedeviled India’s most valuable lender.

Under new chief executive officer (CEO) Sashidhar Jagdishan, HDFC Bank wants to claw back lost ground in the digital business, overcome legacy issues that have put the lender under a cloud in the past two years and team up with new technology partners to cement its position as the country's preeminent bank.

""This initiative is part of long-term planning, maybe for the next 10 years or so,"" a senior executive at HDFC Bank said on condition of anonymity.

Part of the plan is to build a ""digital bank within the bank,"" according to a June 2 report by Bernstein Research titled HDFC Bank: A digital bank within the bank with Zeta? The report outlined a plan for a major revamp within the bank to create a digital bank for new customers, eventually encompassing its entire retail customers base.

On its website, Zeta has posted job positions for a project called Plutus. The job postings describe Plutus as a strategic partnership between Zeta and HDFC Bank to build a digital bank from scratch. Plutus. according to the plan, will serve HDFC Bank's above 25 million customers and help drive customer acquisition, using Tachyon, a cloud-native integrated core banking, processing, and payments software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform.

Plutus will be responsible for creating a digital bank from scratch, the Bernstein report said. ""The partnership aims to deliver a digital bank and payments offering initially targeted towards India's young and digitally-savvy and help the bank expand the customer franchise,"" it said.

An RBI-appointed third party-audit of the bank's IT infrastructure is currently underway. Sashidhar Jagdishan, Aditya Puri’s successor at HDFC Bank, inherited the leadership with legacy problems on the technology front.

Until HDFC Bank can convince the regulator that it indeed has the digital capabilities to serve existing customers, the RBI ban will stay, an analyst said on condition of anonymity. “Till they don’t set right their systems, the instructions are likely to be in place. Their issues have been dragging on for a long time,” the analyst said.

The country's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank has withdrawn its earlier communication sent to some of its customers cautioning against using the bank's services in trading in cryptocurrencies in the wake of the regulator's clarification on the matter.

The bank has now sent fresh emails to customers asking them to ignore the earlier email in view of the clarification from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on May 31 that the RBI's 2018 circular on virtual currencies is invalid post a Supreme Court order.

The bank had sent emails dated May 28, 2021, to some of the customers with the subject 'Caution Advice for dealing in virtual currency' probably due to the high risk involved in such transactions. However, the RBI on May 31 issued a clarification saying banks and other regulated entities cannot cite its 2018 circular on cryptocurrencies as it has been set aside by the Supreme Court (SC) in March 2020. The circular is not valid from the date of the SC order and cannot be cited or quoted from, the RBI said.

The central bank, however, asked banks to carry out the necessary customer due diligence process in line with regulations governing standards for Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT), and obligations of regulated entities under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, (PMLA), 2002.



Also, banks need to ensure compliance with relevant provisions under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) for overseas remittances, the RBI said. The RBI circular, called Customer Due Diligence for transactions in Virtual Currencies (VC), came shortly after major Indian banks have started warning customers against using their services to trade in cryptocurrencies.

The total value of India’s top 100 brands has increased by 2 percent, from $162.1 billion in 2020 to $164.9 billion in 2021, according to the latest Brand Finance India 100 2021 report.

This uplift in brand value over the course of the first year of the pandemic is an impressive feat given the global economic crisis following the implementation of lockdowns in March 2020, when business activity was brought to a halt, affecting both production and consumption.

Sectors including IT, healthcare, utilities, chemicals, edutech, banking, and construction have proved their efficiency in supporting the economy.

This, paired with the government and the Reserve Bank of India monetary and fiscal policy measures, has helped support vulnerable firms and households, expand service delivery, cushion the impact of the crisis over the course of 2020, and establish a benchmark for this year’s response.

Ajimon Francis, Managing Director - Brand Finance India, said:

“Despite being one of the worst hit nations throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Indian brands have shown remarkable resilience to the challenges that have ensued since the first lockdown in March 2020. Over the past year, the nation’s top 100 most valuable brands have recorded a 2 percent uplift in total brand value, showcasing their strength.

""Yet the current national health emergency presents an even greater challenge than last year’s lockdown. In these trying times for all of India, brands will need to play their part in supporting recovery.”

Tata Group has retained the title of India’s most valuable brand by a considerable lead with a brand value of $21.3 billion. Operating in more than 100 countries across six continents and employing over three-quarters of a million people, TATA Group is a force to be reckoned with on the global stage. With 30 companies under the TATA Group umbrella, ranging from Tata Steel and Tata Motors to TCS and Tata Consumer Products, the brand has managed to protect itself from COVID-19 damage – this year recording a 6 percent uplift in brand value.

There are eight further conglomerate brands 2021 ranking, which account for over a quarter of the total brand value, making it the most valuable brand category in India.

Sitting behind conglomerates, banking is the nation’s second most valuable sector, with its 16 brands accounting for 16% of the total brand value in the ranking. Indian banks have bucked the global sector trend, recording a cumulative brand value growth of 8 percent year-on-year.

HDFC Bank has become India’s most valuable banking brand, up 11 percent to $6.6 billion and claiming 5th spot in the ranking, ahead of last year’s most valuable Indian banking brand State Bank of India (down 9 percent to $5.8 billion) which sits in 7th.

ICICI claimed the spot of India’s third most valuable banking brand, brand value up 23 percent to $3.5 billion.

The Union Bank of India saw the fastest year-on-year brand value increase in the ranking, growing by 163 percent to $1.2 billion and ,simultaneously, soaring 39 places to claim 31st spot.

The amalgamation between Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank is primarily responsible for this growth - borne as part of a nationwide effort to consolidate India’s banking space. This success is also mirrored at the national level.

The third most valuable sector in India is IT services. Behind TCS (up 11 percent to $14.9 billion) which contributes a significant proportion of TATA Group’s conglomerate brand value, Infosys is the highest ranked standalone IT services brand and 3rd in the overall Brand Finance India 100 2021 ranking, jumping up one place from 2020 following a solid 19 percent brand value growth to $8.4 billion.

Even before the pandemic, Infosys’s leadership recognised the importance of focusing on its service offering, including data security and cloud services.

This focus, paired with key acquisitions to bolster the brand’s end-to-end customer experience offerings, has propelled Infosys to a position where it consistently wins larger transformation, consulting, data management, and cloud service projects.

LTI is the fastest-growing IT services brand this year not just in India but also globally, recording an impressive 68 percent brand value growth to $982 million.

HCL (up 13 percent to $5.5 billion), Tech Mahindra (up 11 percent to $2.3 billion – included in Mahindra Group’s conglomerate brand value), and Mphasis (up 13 percent to $536 million), have all recorded healthy uplifts in brand value this year.

Tech Mahindra continues to work towards accelerated growth through building on its healthy pipeline deals and embracing new 5G opportunities.

Another IT major, Wipro (down 1 percent to $4.3 billion), has dropped one rank, but remains a formidable player in the IT services space. A notable challenger brand in the market, Hexaware has swiftly risen through the ranks, moving 10 spots up since 2020.

Hexaware has also improved its brand strength rating this year to AA-, having scored particularly well on employee and on CSR-related brand equity metrics, such as community and environment. The long-term building of brand equity coupled with technical expertise in automation, innovation, and digital transformation can help Hexaware grow customer preference and successfully compete with the industry's incumbents, ultimately resulting in increased brand value.

HDFC Bank has become India’s most valuable banking brand

Strongest brand

Jio has claimed the title of India’s strongest brand as well as the world’s strongest telecom brand, with a Brand Strength Index score of 91.7 out of 100 and the elite AAA+ brand strength rating, says the report.

Savio D’Souza, Valuation Director - Brand Finance, commented:

“The dominance of the Jio brand across the nation is evident from the results of Brand Finance’s original market research. Jio scores highest in all metrics – consideration, conversion, reputation, recommendation, word of mouth, innovation, customer service, and value for money - compared to its telecom competitors in India. The brand has no major weaknesses within the sector, and unlike many telecom brands globally, Jio has shown that it has broken the mould, and enjoys genuine affection from consumers.”

HDFC Bank share price fell in the early trade on May 31 after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a penalty of Rs 10 crore on the private lender for deficiency in ""regulatory compliance"".

""We wish to inform you that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed, by an order dated May 27, 2021, a monetary penalty of Rs 10 crore on HDFC Bank,"" the company said in its release.

This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers, the RBI said.

The penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers vested in RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Section 46(4)(i) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (Act), for marketing/sale of third party non-financial products in contravention of provisions of Section 6(2) and Section 8 of the Act.

The country's largest private sector lender reported an 18.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in its standalone profit at Rs 8,186.5 crore for the quarter ended March 2021 (Q4FY21). The profit in Q4FY20 stood at Rs 6,927.69 crore.

Net interest income (NII), the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew 12.6 percent to Rs 17,120.15 crore in Q4FY21 compared to Rs 15,204.06 crore in the year-ago period.

At 0922 hours, HDFC Bank was quoting at Rs 1,497.15, down Rs 4, or 0.27 percent, on the BSE.

The share touched a 52-week high of Rs 1,650 on February 24, 2021 and a 52-week low of Rs 848.90 on May 26, 2020.

As the RBI action shows, the regulator has identified clear violations in the bank’s processes and rule compliance.

Imposing the Rs 10 crore penalty, the RBI said an examination of documents “in the matter of marketing and sale of third-party non-financial products to the bank’s customers, arising from a whistle blower complaint to RBI regarding irregularities in the auto loan portfolio of the bank, revealed contravention of the… provisions of the Act and the regulatory directions.”

“After considering the bank’s reply to the show cause notice, oral submissions made during the personal hearing and examination of further clarifications/documents furnished by the bank, RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charge of contravention of provisions of the Act was substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty.

To put it in simple language, it means the charges alleged against the HDFC Bank with respect to the auto loan irregularities have been proved beyond doubt during the RBI’s investigations. One shouldn't judge the RBI action by the size of the penalty alone (the amount may not be significant) but what is important is the underlying message from the RBI to the bank.

The allegations related to the auto loan disbursals first surfaced on social media and HDFC Bank initially refused to admit the charges. It responded with a statement only after a sustained social media campaign by one of the whistleblowers and subsequent reports in the mainstream media.

The allegations mainly pertained to misselling of GPS products. Bank’s executives allegedly forced the borrowers to buy GPS devices bundled with the auto loans and even insisting that loans will not be sanctioned unless they buy these devices. The devices, manufactured by a Mumbai firm, Trackpoint GPS, cost about Rs 18 000 a piece.

As Moneycontrol highlighted in an earlier piece, for an institution of HDFC Bank’s stature, such irregularities do not augur well. Misselling or forced selling of products is a crime in the eyes of the banking regulator and selling a non-financial product by the bank, if indeed happened, is a sin.

To be fair to the bank, the misconduct by the bank officials was acknowledged by former CEO Aditya Puri in the bank’s AGM when he said an internal probe was conducted against a few erring employees and appropriate action was taken. In July last year, the bank had sacked six executives over allegations of corruption and breach of corporate governance standards after an internal investigation found that they were involved in corrupt practices.

But, in the eyes of the regulator, those steps weren't adequate as evidenced by today's action. Remember, this isn’t the only issue where the bank had invited the wrath of the regulator in the recent past. There is an ongoing audit of the bank's IT department following customer complaints of frequent digital outages in HDFC Bank's internet, mobile banking services. Although, these two events are unrelated, both issues add challenges to the new management of the bank.

So, what is the message to the new team under Shashidar Jagdishan?

At some point, the good governance practices were compromised and the action of a handful of erring employees were probably a result of the fundamental flaws in the system. Today's penalty is a strong cue from the banking regulator to the bank that it needs to identify the deeper fault lines within its corporate governance framework and correct those fundamental flows.",587,-0.6852070604051862

HDFC Bank penalty: What is RBI's message to India's largest private lender?

In furtherance to the same, a notice was issued to the bank advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed for contravention of the provisions of the Act/directions, the RBI said.

After considering the bank’s reply to the show cause notice, oral submissions made during the personal hearing and examination of further clarifications/documents furnished by the bank, RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charge of contravention of provisions of the Act was substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty, the RBI said.

The irregularities in the auto loan portfolio pertains to the charges including bank’s executives forcing the borrowers to buy GPS devices bundled with the auto loans and even insisting that loans will not be sanctioned unless they buy these devices.

Leading private sector banks have started disabling the payment feature in unused cards. The move, they say, is in compliance with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines.

“We have observed that you have not used your debit card for the last two years or more for online payments (E-commerce)/Contactless payments. To prevent any misuse of the card and to comply with the RBI guidelines, these payment features will be disabled after 10 days of this notice,” HDFC Bank said in its mail to customers, recently.

An ICICI Bank spokesperson says, “In line with the regulatory guidelines, we periodically assess risk based on the usage of the debit and credit cards across various channels. Depending on the outcome of the review, we may deactivate the online usage of the card.”

“The sole objective of this exercise is to safeguard the interest of the customer by preventing any fraudulent transaction on a channel which is not used regularly,” the spokesperson said.

What are the RBI guidelines on card usage?

“For existing cards, issuers may take a decision, based on their risk perception, whether to disable the card not present (domestic and international) transactions, card present (international) transactions and contactless transaction rights,” RBI’s circular issued in January 2020 stated. “Existing cards, which have never been used for online (card not present) / international / contactless transactions shall be mandatorily disabled for this purpose,” it further stated.

Also read: How many credit cards should you have?

Will it affect ATM withdrawals, transactions at point of sale (PoS) terminals?

No. The cards have just been disabled for those transactions where your physical card isn’t available. If you wish to make a withdrawal from your ATM or swipe your card at a physical merchant sale points (PoS terminals) as usual, there will be no restrictions.

What happens after the blockage?

If you do not make any new online/contactless payments in the specified timeframe, the bank would automatically de-activate the online payments feature. But there is no need to worry. You can log on to your internet banking service and re-activate the debit card for online transactions.

ICICI Bank allows you to check the status of your cards on the bank’s mobile app. “If needed, the customer can instantly activate the online usage of the card by using the app, internet banking or IVR,” the ICICI Bank spokesperson says.

Incidentally, payment and banking solution providers offer the technology that allows customers to turn on or switch off their Debit/ATM cards. The usage of cards across ATMs, PoS terminals and E-commerce portals can be restricted as desired, thus preventing any form of fraudulent transactions. Customers can also set channel-specific transaction limits that are lower than those set by the bank.

Why is this being done?

Frauds related to online transactions have been on the rise, especially during the pandemic. The move is expected to minimise fraudulent activities. Therefore, cards unused for certain types of purchases for long are disabled for specific channel transactions. Experts say that this feature helps people in rural areas and senior citizens to protect themselves from frauds. Since the volume and value of transactions made through cards have increased manifold over the years, the RBI has initiated several measures to improve the security of card transactions.",575,0.9999517202377319

India’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank is exploring a potential bid for the assets of Citi Bank India and may join a bevy of suitors eyeing the retail operations of the global banking behemoth, sources with knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol.

“ Citi Bank India has a good quality book, low provisioning and NPA’s and good quality customers. It represents an opportunistic buy for a player like HDFC Bank and it can use the portfolio to sell many more products,” said one of the individuals cited above without specifying whether the latter would be keen on the entire portfolio or select assets.

On 16 April, in a move which shook the industry, Citibank said it will exit consumer/retail operations in 13 countries across Asia and Europe, including India to focus on the institutional and wealth management business in these markets. In India, the financial powerhouse had close to 30 lakh customers in retail, 22 lakh credit cards and 12 lakh bank accounts, as of March 2020.

“It is undoubtedly a quality target with a lot of interest. These are early days and HDFC Bank may evaluate it,” said a second individual adding that the preliminary interest may or may not culminate into a final bid.

On April 20th, Moneycontrol had reported that the likes of DBS Bank, HSBC, Kotak Mahindra Bank & ICICI Bank are eyeing Citi’s assets.

Any sale of the consumer /retail assets of Citi India would be subject to an RBI approval, the bank’s officials had earlier told Moneycontrol.

Recently, a Macquarie report had mentioned a number of names as potential suitors for Citi's assets. These include SBI Cards, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, RBL Bank, IndusInd Bank and IDFC First Bank.

According to reports, Macquarie has also estimated a value of $6.3 to $8 billion for Citibank's consumer business across ten of the 13 markets in the Asia-Pacific region. The Indian business which is also part of these ten markets could fetch between $1.91 billion $2.15 billion, according to the brokerage.

HDFC BANK & TECH OUTAGES

Will banking regulator RBI’s diktat in December which barred HDFC Bank from new digital launches and issuances of fresh credit cards pose a hurdle in the lenders potential pursuit of this deal?

“ Regarding the cards component, this proposed transaction is not about issuing new cards, but about taking over existing cards. A substitution of sorts. Typically, in such takeover situations, one is allowed to use the target’s brand for a few months during the transition phase,” elaborated the first individual cited above.

But some analysts feel HDFC Bank, which has the largest credit card base in the nation, may face deal hurdles due to the current regulatory restrictions.

In a recent analyst call, HDFC bank said the third party audit of its’ IT infrastructure by an RBI-appointed auditor is still underway. Once the audit is over, the RBI will take a call based on the feedback from the auditor, the bank said. There is no clarity on how long this process will continue.

On April, 19, HDFC Bank’s managing director and CEO, Sashidhar Jagdishan wrote to employees to alleviate concerns on recent multiple technology glitches and said the bank is working with them ( regulators) “closely to overcome the current situation."" In the letter, Jagdishan said the bank had embarked on a Technology Transformation agenda , strengthened its firewalls further & would tighten processes linked to monitoring its Data Centre.

The RBI action was triggered by frequent outages in HDFC Bank’s digital services reported over the last two years. To be sure, HDFC Bank isn't the only bank which has reported technology problems. It's PSU rival, State Bank of India too has reported frequent technology glitches.

BANKING M&A INVOLVING FOREIGN LENDERS

On the interest from foreign suitors, a third individual who closely track the financial services industry said, “ The banking regulator’s stance in such deals is crucial regarding transfer of domestic branches and other related aspects.”

This is not the first time that a foreign bank has decided to put its India assets on the block. Back in July 2010, HSBC had announced that it would acquire select retail and commercial assets in India owned by Royal Bank of Scotland. Back then RBI had given the green signal for the portfolio sale but was against the automatic transfer of RBS’s branch offices in India to HSBC, according to media reports.

All the three individuals above spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity.

In response to an email query from Moneycontrol on the interest in Citi’s assets and the regulatory overhang, an HDFC Bank spokesperson said, “As a matter of policy we do not comment on market speculation and rumours.” Citi India declined to comment.

“Citi's exit from India will be an opportunity for players in India to either acquire the existing stock of clients and/ or gain market share in segments like credit cards, deposits and retail loans,” said Jefferies in a report released earlier this month.

In November 2020, RBI had announced a draft scheme to amalgamate ailing Lakshmi Vilas Bank into DBS Bank India, which is owned by Singapore based DBS Bank. In March 2019, DBS Bank adopted the wholly owned subsidiary model in India which makes expansion flexible for overseas banks and treats them at par with local lenders. State Bank of Mauritius also follows the same model.

A CLOSER LOOK AT CITI INDIA’S OPERATIONS

As mentioned earlier, Citi Bank had close to 30 lakh customers in retail, 22 lakh credit cards and 12 lakh bank accounts, as of March 2020. It had around six percent market share of credit card spends in December 2020, but this percentage would have declined further since then.

The bank had advances of Rs 66,507 crore and deposits of Rs 1,57,869 crore. Citi's retail revenue contributed 30 percent to the total in March, 2020, while corporate pitched in with 50 percent. In 2018-19, retail contributed 34 percent and corporate 46 percent, according to the details available. Thus, the retail business had been struggling.

The percentage of non-performing assets (NPAs) to net advances has gone up to 0.56 percent as of March, 2020 from 0.51 percent in the previous year.

Return on assets slightly moderated to 2.55 percent from 2.57 percent and business per employee improved to Rs 43.6 crore in FY20 from Rs 37.6 crore in the previous year. Interest income declined to 6.73 percent from seven percent during the period.

Compared with this, Citi’s local rivals have been increasing share of retail business increasingly using digital channels. For instance, HDFC Bank’s retail portfolio has grown by around 7 percent as on March, 2021 from the year-ago period. Within the retail portion, HDFC Bank grew its credit cards business by 12 percent and home loans by around 10 percent. Similarly, Axis Bank has increased the share of retail loans by 9 percent on a year-on-year basis as per the data available till December, 2020.

The Mobile ATMs are expected to cover three to four stops in one day. People are expected to form a queue to withdraw cash while the machine is deployed in their vicinity while maintaining strict social distancing.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

Despite stable NIMs and higher fees leading to a beat on PPoP, the bank reported slightly lower PAT at Rs81.8bn (up 18% yoy) vs. est. of Rs83bn, mainly due to additional contingent provisions of Rs8bn amid raging second Covid wave and Rs5bn for interest-on-interest waiver. Retail credit growth remained subdued at 8% yoy due to the bank’s cautious stance and the RBI’s suspension of new card acquisition. Corporate growth remains very strong, leading to retail share slipping to 47%. As a strategy, the bank would continue to capture market share in corporate loans and has built a strong SME portfolio (20% of the total portfolio). It expects this to be a strong earnings driver, going forward. Reported NPAs were lower qoq at 1.3% vs. 1.4% (pro forma) in Q3, but the bank sees rising incidence of EMI bounces in the system due to localized lockdowns implemented after Covid19 second wave. The bank remains confident of its superior portfolio quality but as a matter of prudency, it carries a reasonable contingent buffer (Rs68bn; 0.6% of loans) after consuming Rs36bn in Q4, as NPA recognition has begun.



Outlook

We maintain Buy on the bank with a TP of Rs1,850 given its cross-cycle best asset-quality, strong franchisee/capital profile, better growth outlook and superior return profile. However, the RBI’s suspension of new card acquisition due to continued tech outages remains an overhang on the stock.

Arihant Capital's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank has posted good performance during Q4FY21 results with stable asset quality. In Q4FY21, there was a beat on NII and operating profit front but profit came in lower than our estimates due to contingency provision of INR 1300 cr made by the bank. Net interest income stood at INR 17,120 cr, increasing by +13% YoY/+5% QoQ as compared to our estimate of INR 16,742 cr. Operating profit for the quarter grew by 20% YoY/2.3% QoQ to INR 15,533 cr vs. our estimate of INR 14,849 cr. Profit for the quarter grew by 18% YoY to INR 8,187 cr against our estimate of INR 8,849 cr. Provisions for the quarter stood at INR 4,694 cr as against INR 3,414 cr in Q3FY21. Provisions includes INR 1300 cr of contingency buffer comprising of INR 800 cr towards additional contingent provisions and INR 500 cr on interest on interest reversal. With this the bank carries cumulative (floating + contingent) provision of INR 6,812 cr (0.6% of loans). On business growth front, the bank’s loan book grew by +14% YoY/+5% QoQ to INR 11.32 lakh cr while deposits grew strongly by +16% YoY/+5% QoQ to INR 13.35 lakh cr on account of bank’s strong customer loyalty. The advances growth was primarily driven by corporate lending at +22% YoY while retail loan growth stood at +7% YoY.



Outlook

We revise our earnings by 3%/6% for FY22/23E and maintain our Accumulate rating on the stock with a revised target price of INR 1,683 (earlier INR 1,647), valuing the bank at 3.6x FY23E P/ABV. But we would like to keep an eye on current wave of covid and its impact specially on SME and retail going forward. The RBI’s suspension of new card acquisition due to tech outages remains an overhang for the near term.

Dolat Capital Market's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank reported in-line NII and PPoP growth of 13% and 20% YoY respectively. PAT growth at 18% was impacted by higher contingent provisions of Rs 13bn including Rs 5bn towards compound interest waiver. Annualized slippages trended lower and were in line with expectations at 1.66% (ex of pro forma slippages in previous quarters). The bank added another Rs8bn to its standard provisioning buffers, which continue to stand at over 0.6% of advances. Restructured portfolio stood at 0.6% of loans. NIM at 4.2% was tad below expectations led by sequentially higher investment book and surplus liquidity, even as improved cost of funds aided NIM. Lack of clarity over the timeline of RBI embargo on digital launches and new credit card issuance remains a key overhang over the near term. The bank’s subsidiary, HDB Financial, reported a 200 bps sequential decline in GNPA to 3.9% (vs pro forma numbers reported last quarter). Sequential loan growth of 4.7% was well distributed between retail and corporate. Key growth drivers for retail were business banking, home, PL and agri loans. Rising CASA share in deposits with CASA ratio at 46% against 43% a quarter ago, have been aiding the bank’s CoF. CASA deposits grew at 27% YoY and 13% QoQ. The bank acquired over 2.5mn corporate salary relationships during the year. Large unutilized contingent provision buffers, along with strong capital position and exposure to top end customers across segments continue to provide significant comfort to earnings profile despite overhang of the RBI ban.



Outlook

Improving operating metrics and lower tax rates remain key levers for improvement in normalized RoAs, which should inch higher by 20 bps to ~2.1%. Marginally tweaking our forward estimates, we maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a SOTP-based TP of Rs1800 (Rs 1,750 earlier), implying 3.7x FY23E P/ABV. The stock currently trades at 2.9x Sep-22E ABV.

Banking regulator, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which barred country’s largest private bank, HDFC Bank from new digital launches and issuances of fresh credit cards in December last year, is yet to lift the ban on the bank. The RBI action was triggered by frequent outages in HDFC Bank’s digital services reported over the last two years.

In a recent analyst call, the bank said the third party audit of bank’s IT infrastructure by an RBI-appointed auditor is still underway. Once the audit is over, the RBI will take a call based on the feedback from the auditor, the bank said. There is no clarity on how long this process will continue.

On December 3, HDFC Bank announced that the RBI had asked the lender to temporarily stop all launches under its Digital 2.0 initiative and stop sourcing new credit card customers. This was an unusual step on the part of the regulator.

The announcement came after the bank experienced multiple outage in its internet banking, mobile banking and payment utility services over the past two years. The RBI also asked the Board to look at the issue and strengthen the technology framework.

To be sure, HDFC Bank isn't the only bank which has reported technology problems. It's bigger rival, State Bank of India too has reported frequent technology glitches.

Digital 2.0 in limbo?

The RBI ban put the HDFC bank's future digital expansion plans on a slow track. HDFC Bank has a number of digital launches planned across various business verticals under the Digital 2.0 initiative including the launch of an auto portal, which the bank calls a one-stop shop for all vehicle loans.

The bank describes Digital 2.0 as “ the next phase of our digitisation journey.” Under this, other initiatives include My Account My Choice where CASA customers can choose any account number of their choice while opening an account, Card-less cash withdrawal, WhatsApp Banking and smart slips that enable customers to fill in cash deposit, withdrawal and cheque deposit slips through NetBanking using a reference ID, and complete the transaction at a banking outlet. Some of these services are already launched.

HDFC Bank is one of the highest credit card issuer in the country with 1.5 crore cards and about 3.38 crore debit cards as at end December. This is ahead of SBI (around 1.1 crore) and ICICI Bank (less than a crore). HDFC Bank’s retail portfolio has grown by around 7 per cent as on March, 2021 from the year-ago period. Within the retail, HDFC Bank grew its credit cards business by 12 per cent and home loans by around 10 per cent.

The ban on new digital launches and on fresh credit cards have not impacted the lender significantly since majority of the business is sourced from existing customers, said a person tracking the developments at the bank. “The bank has grown its portfolio of cards and other retail products over a period of time. Short-term issues will not have much impact on HDFC Bank,” said the person requesting anonymity.

Digital outages

In the last 28 months, HDFC Bank has had five instances of downtime. Following this, the RBI acted in December 3 imposing a ban on the bank and later followed up by appointing an auditor to look at HDFC Bank’s IT infrastructure in February this year. This external professional IT company was asked to to conduct a detailed audit of HDFC Bank’s IT Infrastructure and submit a report at the earliest. This process is ongoing.

In his letter to employees on Monday, HDFC Bank CEO, Jagdishan said the bank is working with the regulator to resolve the technology issues. “While we execute this Technology Transformation agenda, there will sometimes be pain and outages beyond our control. We must doubly resolve to reach out proactively to our customers / stakeholders and explain the path that we are traversing to make their experience with us smoother, faster and better,” Jagdishan said in the letter.

Moneycontrol has a copy of the letter. “It is in this context, one has to see the advisories and strictures by the regulators calling for accelerated adoption and process changes. We are working with them closely to overcome the current situation,” Jagdishan said.

Further, HDFC Bank has embarked on several digital transformation initiatives, Jagdishan said. “We have invested heavily in the scale up of our infrastructure to handle any potential load that we will encounter for the next 3/5 years. We are also in the process of accelerating our cloud strategy to be on the cutting edge leveraging best in class cloud service providers,” the CEO letter said.

Also, the bank has strengthened its process of monitoring our Data Centre (DC) and have shifted key applications to new DC, the letter said. Thirdly, the bank has strengthened the firewalls further, Jagdishan said. “We have to be scanning the horizon for potential security issues and be ever prepared to face them. We haven’t had any security issues in the past. But this is always an important area of focus and action plans are underway for further robustness,” the CEO said. Besides, “HDFC Bank has also enhanced application monitoring mechanism across-the-board to enable us to keep our IT systems always on,” Jagdishan said.",881,-0.34451772107018364

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB’s earnings of Rs81.8bn saw a 6% miss from our estimates (PLe: Rs86.8bn) on higher contingency provisions of Rs13.0bn (Rs8.0bn for asset quality) and slightly slower NII. Although, PPOP saw a 5% beat led by good other income (treasury/recovery from w.off) and controlled opex growth. Asset quality was steady sequentially, although added Rs8.0bn to COVID contingency provisions (non PCR related) to take it to Rs58.0bn or 60bps of loans. High level financial indicators like cash flow improvements, increase in spends and increased customer additions continue to show robustness. While, certain deterrents have occurred like higher cheque bounces and few states pulling down collections. HDFCB remains a strong franchise with solid cross cycle asset quality and superior return ratios.



Outlook

We retain BUY with revised TP of Rs1,735 (from Rs1,690) based on 3.6x Mar-23 ABV. Out TP increase has been led by 2-3% increase in BV as bank has not declared any dividend for FY21 similar to FY20 and will await RBI guidelines on same.

ICICI Direct's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank’s performance was stable on various parameters like business growth, asset quality and profitability. Business growth continued to show improvement for past three quarters as advances were up 4.7% QoQ, 14% YoY to Rs 1132837 crore. Loan growth was led by wholesale book, which was up 27.1% YoY while retail book increased 6.7% YoY. Within the retail book auto and home loans have shown a sequential pickup while credit card business trajectory has shown a decline due to RBI’s curb on sourcing of new customers. Deposit accretion was healthy at 16.3% YoY and 5% QoQ increase to Rs 1335060 crore. CASA deposits reported even stronger growth of 27% YoY. As a result, the CASA ratio increased from 43% in the previous quarter and 42.2% in previous year to 46.1% in Q4FY21.

Outlook

We broadly maintain our earnings estimate and maintain our BUY rating with an unchanged target price of Rs 1700/share, valuing the core bank at ~3.7x FY23E ABV and adding Rs 50 in lieu of subsidiaries.

And we shall rise to the occasion as we usually do by implementing cutting edge technology solutions across all lines of our businesses,” Jagdishan said.

On December 3, HDFC Bank announced that the RBI had asked the lender to temporarily stop all launches under its Digital 2.0 initiative and stop sourcing new credit card customers. The announcement came after the bank experienced multiple outage in its internet banking, mobile banking and payment utility services over the past two years.

In his letter, Jagdishan listed five instances where bank’s technology platforms failed and explained the reasons behind each incident.

Digital outages and reasons

November 2018: Crash of the New Mobile Banking App

Reason: “We faced an unprecedented demand to download the new mobile app. We have learnt and since refined our processes of managing the mobile banking app and has never faced any such challenges later. After the Nov 2018 initial launch, we have upgraded our mobile app seven times over the last two years and in all these instances it has been a smooth affair with no downtime or customer inconvenience whatsoever,” Jagishan said.

December 2019: Outage with Mobile Banking App

Reason: All banking systems are complicated and interconnected and each component has to work efficiently for us to deliver our promise to our customers. In this instance, one of the vendors system upgrade patch issue was faulty and the same has been addressed adequately. We have and will continue to reinforce vendor patch application.

November 2020: Outage at Data centre

Reason: A third party human error lead to the downtime. To remove this risk completely, we have taken several actions to mitigate such instances in future.

March 1, 2021: Net Banking/Mobile Banking downtime

Reason: The issue here occurred on account of a faulty signature on our HIPS (Host Intrusion prevention software). This was an issue acknowledged by the manufacturer which impacted several global clients as well. The faulty signature resulted in slowing down response on Net banking and mobile banking. This has, since, been rectified.

March 31, 2021: Net Banking/Mobile Banking downtime

Reason: The issue occurred on account of a hardware component failure in one of our database servers resulting in a slow response to some of our customers. A large number of our customers were able to carry out their NB/MB activities in this period and we saw only a marginal dip in the number of transactions that day.

Digital transformation initiatives

HDFC Bank has embarked on several digital transformation initiatives, Jagdishan said.

“We have invested heavily in the scale up of our infrastructure to handle any potential load that we will encounter for the next 3/5 years. We are also in the process of accelerating our cloud strategy to be on the cutting edge leveraging best in class cloud service providers,” the CEO letter says.

Further, the bank has strengthened its process of monitoring our Data Centre (DC) and have shifted key applications to new DC, the letter said.

Thirdly, the bank has strengthened the firewalls further, Jagdishan said. “We have to be scanning the horizon for potential security issues and be ever prepared to face them. We haven’t had any security issues in the past. But this is always an important area of focus and action plans are underway for further robustness,” the CEO said.

Besides, “HDFC Bank has also enhanced application monitoring mechanism across-the-board to enable us to keep our IT systems always on,” Jagdishan said.

Performance outlook

Jagdishan said this year, too, the bank will follow its normal practice in so far as compensation cycle is concerned. “In the current financial year, there will be some pandemic related challenges for sure. The beauty of this organisation is the ability to rally around, tap the opportunities and grow. The story of the bank will not be any different in this financial year and in the coming times,” Jagdishan said.

Jagdisan added that broad macro opportunities continue to present themselves across the retail, MSME and Corporate Banking. “We will continue to invest our resources to grow in the identified segments / sectors and geographies,” Jagdishan said.

HDFC Bank share price fell nearly 4 percent in the early trade on April 19 after the company reported better than expected numbers in the quarter ended March 2021.

The company reported an 18.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in its standalone profit at Rs 8,186.5 crore for the quarter ended March 2021 (Q4FY21) on account of low base in the corresponding period. The profit in Q4FY20 stood at Rs 6,927.69 crore.

Here is what brokerages have to say on the stock and company after Q4 earnings:

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,735

The company' earnings of Rs 8,186.5 crore saw a 6% miss from our estimates (PLe: Rs 86.8 billion) on higher contingency provisions of Rs 13.0 bn (Rs 8.0 billion for asset quality) and slightly slower NII. Although, PPOP saw a 5% beat led by good other income and controlled opex growth.

The bank remains a strong franchise with solid cross cycle asset quality and superior return ratios.

ICICI Direct | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,700

Focus on business growth with strong revival in retail advances remains positive. Healthy deposit franchise is seen keeping margins at ~4.2%, with a strong recovery in fee-based income and steady operational efficiency to support core performance.

Robust asset quality performance amid tight underwriting standard and contingency buffer of ~60 bps provide comfort against uncertainties in the current environment. Beefing up technology and enhancing digital capabilities is underway to address outage issues.

Dolat Capital | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,800

Large unutilised contingent provision buffers, along with strong capital position and exposure to top-end customers across segments continue to provide significant comfort to earnings profile despite overhang of the RBI ban.

Improving operating metrics and lower tax rates remain key levers for improvement in normalised RoAs, which should inch higher by 20 bps to ~2.1%.

LKP Research | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,666

HDFC Bank is expected to outperform the sector led by 1) healthy growth in operating income, 2) much higher provision then regulatory requirement in the balance sheet, 3) strong capital cushion of 17% at CET1 level and d) best in class underwriting and risk management practices.

Given these strengths we expect HDFC Bank to remain one of the best among all the lending business.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,800

HDFC Bank has delivered steady growth trends in both loans and deposits, with business activity showing signs of healthy revival across retail segments. CASA trends remain robust, enabling improvement in the CASA ratio to 46%. The bank’s operating performance remains steady, aided by healthy revenue growth, stable margins, and controlled opex.

Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,810

Considering the challenging times, we expect resilience and strong business model will be all the more important, which is what is seen in HDFC Bank’s strong balance sheet and likely higher residual capital than most which are positives. This bank is well capitalised, which ensures that its best-in-class franchise can support an adequately large balance sheet after medium-term challenges.

The bank’s consistency is buoyed by its robust underwriting capability and risk measurement standards, which provide support for valuations. We find management’s indications for stable NIMs and a structurally improving cost-income ratio encouraging, while the high provisioning buffer should provide support to asset quality and profitability.

Yes Securities | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,870

Stringent and high‐quality underwriting in FY21, robust capital position (Tier‐1 17.6%), high core PCR (70% ‐ Covid 1st round stress fully addressed) and a healthy additional provisioning buffer (65 bps of Adv.) makes HDFC Bank’s balance sheet stronger than ever.

Since current lockdowns are localized and less stringent, and job scenario is stronger, the credit cost impact of this pandemic round should be much lesser than the first one (80‐90 bps). The bank has displayed tremendous capability to carve out efficiencies from the cost lines (core C/I at 39% in FY21 v/s 41% in FY20), and most of the gains will be sustained in medium term.

Arihant Capital | Rating: Accumulate | Target: Rs 1,683

HDFC Bank continued with its strong performance despite the challenging environment. With strong asset quality outcome, best-in-class deposit franchise, well cushioned balance sheet, comfortable capital level and gaining market share position, we maintain our positive

outlook on the bank.

We would like to keep an eye on current wave of covid and its impact specially on SME and retail going forward. The RBI’s suspension of new card acquisition due to tech outages remains an overhang for the near term.

Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 2,000

Company reported strong earnings with improved coverage & capital ratio, while COVID resurgence poses the near-term uncertainty.

Morgan Stanley expect sustained market share gains & further rise in profitability as cycle turns, while earnings estimates remain unchanged.

Credit Suisse| Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 1,700

There was a robust growth, while asset quality outcomes were in-line. It raise FY22/23 earnings by 4%/1% on slightly lower credit cost. The growth & profitability remain ahead of peers, while there is no visibility on timelines for curbs to be lifted by RBI due to tech issues.

JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,800

The core performance remains robust, while earnings miss was on contingent provision increase. JPMorgan cut EPS estimate by 9%, but expect the bank to retain a 2% RoA. The expected EPS growth is 19% over FY20-23.

CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,825

The Q4 results were strong & with pro-forma slippage of just Rs 4,700 crore. The bank portfolio has remained pandemic proof and limited visibility on RBI lifting of ban, which is a near-term constraint.

Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,860

The Q4 profit was tad below estimate as higher provisions offset operating profit a beat. The retail lending momentum has normalised and CASA growth of 27% YoY is a key positive.

The slight rise in cheque-bounce rate in April is a concern. It tweak earnings a bit with 18% profit CAGR over FY21-24.

At 09:25 hrs, HDFC Bank was quoting at Rs 1,384.20, down Rs 44.25, or 3.10 percent on the BSE.

The share touched a 52-week high of Rs 1,650 and a 52-week low of Rs 826 on 24 February, 2021 and 19 May, 2020, respectively.

Currently, it is trading 16.11 percent below its 52-week high and 67.58 percent above its 52-week low.

Private sector lender, HDFC Bank, has provided around Rs 500 crore to refund the interest-on-interest amount to borrowers on the moratorium loans. The bank will, however, await a final decision from Indian Banks Association(IBA) on this concerning the methodology to calculate this amount, said a person in the know.

""The bank has estimated around Rs 500 crore to compensate borrowers for compound interest. This has been recognised and provided already,"" said the person quoted above. He didn't want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media.

On April 7, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had issued a circular which mandated all lending institutions to immediately put in place a Board-approved policy to refund/adjust the ‘interest on interest’ charged to the borrowers during the moratorium period, i.e. March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 in conformity with the Supreme Court judgement.

The Supreme Court, on March 23, ruled that banks have to waive the compound interest to all borrowers during the moratorium period. The RBI announced a six-month moratorium for all term loans last year to help the stressed borrowers who suffered hardships during the COVID-19 lockdown period.

In order to ensure that the above judgement is implemented uniformly in letter and spirit by all lending institutions, methodology needs to be finalised by the IBA in consultation with other industry participants, the RBI had said in the circular.

""The Bank has however estimated the said amount and recognised a charge in its Profit and Loss Account for the year ended March 31, 2021,"" HDFC Bank said announcing its results today.

For the banking industry, the total cost of the compound interest waiver is estimated to be around Rs 15,000 crore, according to some private estimates. But banks have already paid part of it for borrowers with loans under Rs 2 crore. Hence, the remaining burden will not be huge. It is estimated to be between Rs 7,500 crore and Rs 8,000 crore. This figure can change after a final assessment.

Cautious approach

HDFC Bank has taken a cautious approach in the January-March quarter to guard against the potential stress on its books due to the prolonged COVID situation. It has set aside more money, called provisions, to cover likely losses going ahead.

The numbers have come below expectations. In percentage terms, the Gross NPAs (non-performing assets) has jumped from 0.8 percent to 1.32 percent on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis. But, the right away to look at this is comparing with Q3 proforma NPAs, which includes the NPAs that the bank couldn’t tag as bad due to an earlier Supreme Court stay. Comparing to the proforma NPA levels in Q3, at 1.38 percent, the Q4 GNPA numbers are better.

Provisions have jumped. Compared with Rs 3,414 crore in December quarter, it has gone up to Rs 4,693.7 crore in March but that includes a build of approximately Rs 1,300 crore in contingent provisions.

In all, the bank held floating provisions of Rs 1,451 crore and contingent provisions of Rs 5,861 crore as on March 31, 2021 to cover COVID-19 impact.

Total provisions stood at 153 percent of the gross non-performing loans as on March 31, 2021.

""The provisions they carry is quite strong enough. I do not expect an earnings shock going ahead,"" said Siddharth Purohit, analyst at SMC Global Securities in Mumbai.

The bank reported an 18.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in its standalone profit at Rs 8,186.5 crore for the quarter ended March 2021 (Q4FY21) on account of low base in the corresponding period. The profit in Q4FY20 stood at Rs 6,927.69 crore.

Higher other income and pre-provision operating profit aided profitability during the quarter, but provisions and tax expenses restricted net income growth.

Net interest income (NII), the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew 12.6 percent to Rs 17,120.15 crore in Q4FY21, compared to Rs 15,204.06 crore in the year-ago period, driven by credit growth of 14 percent, and core net interest margin of 4.2 percent for the quarter.",677,0.05201224237680435

The luxury apartment has a carpet area of 6,770 sq ft and a balcony area of 273 sq ft, registration documents shared by Zapkey.com said.

The deal is the latest in a series of real estate transactions that have occurred in Mumbai. In order to boost the stagnant real-estate market hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra government on August 26, 2020, decided to temporarily reduce stamp duty on housing units from 5 percent to 2 percent until December 31, 2020. Stamp duty from January 1, 2021, until March 31, 2021, was 3 percent.

On March 31, 2021, the Maharashtra government decided not to extend the stamp duty waiver on property registrations and kept the Ready Reckoner Rates (or circle rates—the minimum designated price per sq ft for land or property at which transactions have to be registered) unchanged for the financial year 2021-22. Regular rates of 5 percent are applicable from April 1 onwards.

During the pandemic, several businessmen, bankers, and owners of listed companies bought high-value luxury properties, indicating that stock market money may be finding its way back into real estate.

In December 2020, HDFC vice-chairman and CEO Keki Mistry, bought an ultra-luxury apartment in Mumbai in the same project worth Rs 41.23 crore. The residential deal in India’s financial capital took place as homebuyers scrambled to register properties before the deadline of the 3 percent stamp duty cut expired on December 31, 2020.

The same month, former HDFC Bank boss Aditya Puri’s family purchased a Rs 50 crore property in Mumbai. The unit, located in Lodha Seamont on Malabar Hill, near Raj Bhawan in Walkeshwar, is on the 19th floor and came with seven car parking spaces.

Raheja Artesia has 55 floors. The monthly rent for an apartment of the size bought by Mistry is around Rs 14 lakh per month, local brokers said.",498,-0.8587523102760315

Quarterly updates reported by a few banks so far show a clear trend: A notable uptick in deposits in Q4 and a mixed performance in advances, with smaller banks struggling to increase loans.

Let’s look at the numbers first. HDFC Bank, the largest private lender, said its advances grew by 14 percent year on year basis in the last quarter of FY21, while deposits grew 16.3 percent. These are good numbers considering the industry average.

Yes Bank won back its lost trust from depositors. Its deposits grew 55 percent on a year-on-year basis and 11.4 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis. However, on advance growth, Yes Bank has managed just 0.8 percent on a year-on-year basis and 1.8 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Yes Bank’s gross advances, as on March 31, 2021, stood at Rs 1,72, 850 crore compared with Rs 1,71,443 crore in March, 2020 while its deposits jumped to Rs 1,62, 947 crore as compared with Rs1,05,364 crore in the year-ago period.

Last month marked a year of Yes Bank’s bail-out. The bank has smartly come back on deposits mobilisation, but loan growth continues to be sluggish, which can be attributed to the Covid-hit economy and the new management’s aversion to the risk of wholesale loans. Another small player, RBL Bank, also did well on deposit growth, logging 26 percent growth on year-on-year but y-o-y loan growth crawled up just 2 percent. There is an improvement on the Current Account and Savings Account (CASA) ratio from 29.6 percent to 31.8 percent. Banks have realized safer retail business is better than high-risk wholesale.

Among other banks, Federal Bank has reported a 13 percent year-on-year growth on deposits at Rs 1,72,655 crore compared with Rs 1,52, 290 crore a year ago while total advances grew 9 percent to Rs 1,34,876 crore. CASA has grown 26 percent over the year and now constitutes 34 per cent of the total deposits. This is much better than, for example, Yes Bank, which has a CASA ratio is 27 percent. In the case of CSB bank, total advances grew by 26.7 percent on a year-on-year basis while total deposits grew at 21.21 percent of which CASA growth has been an impressive 34 per cent. CASA as a percentage of total deposits stand at 32 percent compared with 29 per cent in the year-ago period.

High growth in bank deposits can be attributed to volatility in equity markets and other investment classes which would have prompted more people to move to safer deposits. On loans, big banks have managed to sustain high growth of both advances and deposits but smaller ones, like Yes and RBL are struggling to grow the loan book in a challenging environment. Two components that have helped banks achieve credit growth are Government’s ECLGS (emergency credit line guarantee scheme) and retail loans. Retail participation will be key going ahead also as recovery of industries on the ground will likely take longer.

What will be the scenario going ahead? The key factor to watch out is how the Covid scenario is shaping up. States like Maharashtra and Delhi have reintroduced restrictions on movement of people to control the spread of infections. If there is another nationwide lockdown, banks will be under pressure as the recovery in loan demand seen in recent months would suffer again.",567,-0.004495732486248016

HDFC Bank's advances registered nearly 14 per cent growth by end of March 2021 at Rs 11.32 lakh crore, while deposits were up by over 16 per cent at Rs 13.35 lakh crore, the lender said on Monday.

""The bank's advances aggregated to approximately Rs 11.32 lakh crore as of March 31, 2021, a growth of around 13.9 per cent over Rs 9.93 lakh crore as of March 31, 2020, and a growth of around 4.6 per cent over Rs 10.82 lakh crore as of December 31, 2020,"" HDFC Bank said in a regulatory filing.

The domestic retail loans at end of March 2021, were up by around 7.5 per cent and the domestic wholesale loans grew by around 21 per cent year-on-year, said the private sector lender.

On the deposits front, it witnessed around 16.3 per cent growth on the year at Rs 13.35 lakh crore as on March 31, 2021.

The Reserve Bank has decided to extend the timeline for the stakeholders to migrate to the framework for processing of e-mandates on recurring online transactions by six months to September 30, 2021. The deadline was set to expire on March 31.

But, the central bank decided to extend the deadline as the framework is not fully implemented by banks and to prevent any inconvenience to the customers because of lack of preparedness by the system, the RBI said.

""This non-compliance is noted with serious concern and will be dealt with separately. The delay in implementation by some stakeholders has given rise to a situation of possible large-scale customer inconvenience and default,"" the RBI said, adding any further delay in ensuring complete adherence to the framework beyond the extended timeline will attract stringent supervisory action.

What does the RBI rules on recurring transactions mean to you if you have an auto-debit arrangement? Here’s a simple explainer on this new rule.

What is this issue all about?

Over years, the RBI, which is the banking regulator, has been pushing banks to safeguard third party customer transactions and make sure all payments are secure. Here, the RBI essentially said banks need to inform the customer each time an auto debit is made on third-party merchant websites so that the customer knows what’s happening in his/her bank account. In this context, the RBI issued two circulars, one in August 2019 and the second in December 2020, on new auto-debit rules. The second one was basically a reminder to banks on the original one. What this essentially means is that banks will have to seek customer’s permission or seek additional authentication before executing each transactions involving third-party recurring payments.

Does it apply to all types of payments?

The new rule will apply to all types of auto-debit payments using credit card, debit card, UPI, PPI, including wallets. This will include payments of utility bills, subscription renewals and any other recurring payments involving third-party services providers. For instance, small ticket payments of OTT service platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, iTunes, Google, Gaana, postpaid mobile, and insurance payments use their own merchant websites to accept online payments. These may get affected. Also, automatic premium deductions by insurance companies and utility bill payments (gas, electricity) using merchant websites may also get affected by the new RBI rules.

What doesn’t change?

Any payments made through net banking channels will remain unaffected. As mentioned above, the problem is only with third-party merchant websites. This means, your regular EMI payments on home loans, auto loans or mobile and gas bill payments using bank websites will not get affected. The issue is only with direct recurring payments on third-party merchant websites.

But why did the RBI do this?

As indicated above, the RBI fears that auto-debit transactions on third-party merchant websites are susceptible to fraudsters. Hence, the regulator wants banks to have a control over the auto-debit payments on merchant sites and customers to know about the payments each time. Typically at the time of making a third-party payment using a credit card or debit card, the third-party merchants ask the customer if he/ she would like to make a standing instruction for automatic deductions. Many a times, customers opt for this. The RBI thinks these transactions are beyond the scrutiny of banks.

Okay, what is the impact on customers?

From October 1, for recurring payments through third-party merchant websites, the bank needs to send a communication to the customer five days in advance and at least 24 hours before the payment date intimating the customer about the scheduled payment and asking if he/she wants to opt out or part-pay the amount. If the customer wants to opt out of the standing instruction arrangement, he/she can do that. Customers will have to do a one-time registration for third party payments. Else, customers will have to go to the bank websites and make payments directly.

What about high-value transactions?

For auto-debits above Rs 5000, an additional one-time password is required. This is an additional security measure.

Will this change lead to disruptions in auto-payments in October?

Some of your auto-debit payments on third party sites such as Netflix, Amazon monthly renewal or utility bill payments on merchant websites may not happen automatically following the RBI’s new rule. But, you can make the payments through net banking channels.

According to an FAQ issued by HDFC Bank, ""As customers, one permits various merchants to auto-charge our credit card / debit card on a recurring basis (monthly / quarterly / annually) for various services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, iTunes, Google, Gaana, Postpaid mobile, Insurance payments, etc. These recurring payments will not be allowed from 1st October 2021 onwards, without meeting new conditions prescribed by RBI.""

What is the banks’ response?

Banks are not happy with the RBI rule for two reasons. One, for this to happen, merchant sites will have to first share the payment information with banks. Merchant sites aren’t comfortable sharing payment information to banks as they fear competition will come to know about subscriber details. Second, informing the customer every month about an auto debit for which he/she has already given consent is unnecessary, banks feel. But, the RBI rules are final. So, banks are in talks with payment service providers such as Billdesk (or/and others) to work out an alternative platform so that Billdesk will undertake the task of informing the customers about auto debit every month and pass confirmation to the banks.

How prepared are banks for this transition?

According to HDFC Bank, the new conditions prescribed by the RBI require a cohesive effort by all stake-holders including Card Issuing banks, Merchant Acquiring Banks, Card Networks and Merchants. All constituents have to complete development, integration and deployment of a COMMON platform, which is fully compliant with the RBI guidelines. Such a common industry-wide platform has been recently developed and HDFC Bank has completed its internal development and integration. ""We are now working jointly with merchants for making this live for customers at the earliest,"" the bank said.

Will this mean that you have to pay an additional charge on auto-debit transactions?

That is a possibility. According to banking industry sources, banks may initially absorb the cost of facilitating or to operationalise an additional platform such as Billdesk to do this but may eventually charge the customer. There is no certainty on this yet.

Okay, so what you should do starting October to make sure your third party recurring payments happen?

The best way is to go to your bank website and make the payment from there. If there is no facility for that with your third-party service provider, write to your bank on how to go about the monthly payment, said bankers.

According to HDFC Bank FAQ, there are three ways in which you may continue to enjoy uninterrupted service:

One, re-register for each service such as Google, Netflix, Gaana etc (provided they have integrated the new RBI prescribed system), giving permission to the merchant / service provider to charge your card for recurring payments. This is a one-time registration which has to be done for each service, on or after September 30, 2021.

Two, in the interim, until they are not yet live on the new RBI compliant platform, the merchant / service provider may initiate recurring transaction payment requests, either in-app or on-website, or through links, etc., which would have to be approved by you with OTP / other AFA (Alternate Factor of Authentication). Direct charge to card without OTP / other AFA would not be allowed. Alternatively, you may go to the merchant site and initiate a payment yourself, if such an option is available.

Three, alternatively, you can use the bank's Netbanking portal to register for recurring payments under categories like Electricity / Water / Gas / LPG / Landline telephone / Postpaid mobile / DTH / Broadband / Insurance, etc.",1339,-0.9152651876211166

HDFC Bank’s digital woes somehow seem to continue, even after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) gave a hard rap on the knuckles last December following a series of digital outages, barring it from new digital launches till it resolves the technology issues. The December action from the RBI was supposed to be a strong warning for the new management under Shashidhar Jagdishan to get the technology capabilities ready and avoid further slips.

On March 30, HDFC Bank again reported a problem. It said some of its customers are facing intermittent issues in accessing its digital banking channels. Later in the day, an HDFC Bank spokesperson said the bank has resolved the snag. “The issue faced by some of our customers in accessing net banking/mobile banking stands resolved. We apologise for the inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience,” the spokesperson said.

But the recurring technology issues raise a question.

Recurring problem

This isn’t the first time HDFC Bank is facing technical snags. And, to be fair, it isn’t just HDFC Bank but many banks have faced such problems. The country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), has reported problems on the digital channel, YONO. There are other lenders too which have reported technology issues on digital banking channels.

What’s troubling the bank technology front? Is it high volumes of transactions or yet another glitch in its data centre? There is no clarity yet on this issue.

More checks needed

“More checks and balances need to be built into the system before it is offered to the public. More extensive UAT (user acceptance trial) is needed so that the system remains bug-free,” Naresh Malhotra, senior banking consultant, stated.

“Some of the banks are in too much of a hurry to put newer products and utilities into the system. Sometimes, glitches like the ones that happened in quite a few banks over the period of last one year do take place.”

Banks often call technical glitches a routine problem. But, Malhotra doesn’t buy this argument. “If it is a routine technical problem, then it shouldn’t happen at all because the routines are quite well known,” he said.

“Banks have to ramp up their technology capabilities to deal with the high volume of digital transactions and a lot of additional features. They need to make sure slips do not happen. As we have seen in some of these cases, banks have not been very proactive,” said Ashvin Parekh of Ashvin Parekh Advisory.

“These systems were built for a fewer number of customers in the past. But that scenario has changed in the last few years and COVID has accelerated the volumes. And also, it is expected that the regulator is fairly proactive,” Parekh added.

On December 3, HDFC Bank said the RBI asked it to temporarily stop all launches under its Digital 2.0 initiative and stop sourcing new credit card customers. The announcement came after the bank experienced multiple outages in its internet banking, mobile banking and payment utility services over the past two years.

Later, the bank said it has submitted a detailed plan to resolve the technical glitches, Moneycontrol reported on January 19. The short-term plan is aimed at fixing the technical issues that led to recent multiple outages on HDFC Bank’s digital banking channels, the report said.

It couldn’t be immediately ascertained whether the RBI has reverted to the bank following this plan. In a letter to customers, HDFC Bank’s CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan, in December, said the bank will comply with the RBI regulations and will wait for the regulator’s clearance before launching new products. HDFC Bank’s digital outages are credit negative, global rating agency Moody’s said on December 7.

“Banks like HDFC Bank has had uninterrupted growth in the past. They were early adopters of digital technology platforms. However, investment in front office and digital channels are not balanced by investment in mid office and back office,” said Jaya Vaidhyanathan, CEO, BCT Digital.

Aggressive digital push

Banks are now turning aggressive on digital banking channels to reduce the dependency on traditional brick-and-mortar models and catch the younger generation who are more tech-savvy. As against traditional banking, digital transactions are more convenient and most of these can be done round the clock.

Following the multiple reports of digital outage, the RBI had looked at the matter and sought details from the bank. Recently, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that banks must invest more in building robust IT platforms to fortify public confidence in digital banking.

Digital transactions are gaining momentum. Recently, the RBI had made the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) available round the clock on all days from 12.30 am on December 14. With this, India became one of the few countries in the world to operate its RTGS system round the clock throughout the year.

This came within a year of operationalising NEFT 24x7 by the RBI, the central bank said. Transactions worth a minimum of Rs 2 lakh or more can be done via RTGS with no maximum ceiling as per RBI.

“Digital channels and growth in the number of customers have been given a lot more importance by banks than investments in fundamental software and technology capabilities. The more you keep adding weight on the top on a weak foundation, it will collapse eventually. It is not collapsed yet, but it will at some stage,” Vaidhyanathan observed.",909,-0.3587142303586006

The bank has communicated the problem to its customers.

The lender said the issue had not affected its balance sheet in any way, claiming that the bundling was an act by some people who, along with the GPS vendor, had possibly made some gains, the report said.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

HDFC Bank did not respond when contacted by The Economic Times.

""The RBI had sent the bank a show-cause notice a few months ago to which HDFC Bank had replied and asked for an in-person hearing,"" a source told the publication.

Five regional managers and two central officials were fired after an inquiry into the matter found evidence of impropriety and links with the vendor, the report said.

In July 2020, media reports suggested that some executives at HDFC Bank had forced car loan customers to buy GPS devices costing Rs 18,000-19,000 each. The bank had a tie-up with Trackpoint GPS.",232,

Earlier, US-based IT major Cognizant said it would vaccinate 6 lakh people in India, including over 2 lakh employees and their dependents in the country.

The company said it will also vaccinate 50,000 people, comprising contingent staff such as contract, support, and security personnel, and their families.

India’s largest IT firm TCS, too, announced that it would likely cover COVID-19 vaccination costs for its employees following its peers Infosys and Accenture.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

The move comes on the back of the government encouraging domestic manufacturing of lighting solutions and planning a PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme for LED lights as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative.

Syska Led Lights Private Ltd is part of Pune-based SSK Group, which is a key distributor for Samsung phones in India.

“Syska Led’s business was hit due to the outbreak of COVID-19 and HDFC Bank as lead lender is now trying to find a buyer for the firm due to its debt burden. Alternatively, the firm may also explore a fund raise through the private equity route by selling a minority stake, though this has been attempted earlier,” said one of the persons cited above. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the exact indebtedness of Syska Led.

Another person privy to the talks said early feelers have been sent to strategic suitors for the proposed deal. ""Though this transaction, an existing player in the segment can use Syska Led’s wide retail distribution network, save on distribution costs and improve margins or they can plug gaps in their portfolio, in case they are weak or not present in the LED lights space,” this person said.

Key players in the domestic LED lighting segment include Havells, Bajaj Electricals, Crompton Greaves Consumer, Wipro Lighting and Philips.

Two other persons confirmed the sale plans.

All four spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity.

In response to an email query from Moneycontrol, a spokesperson for Syska said , “At the onset, Syska LED has not mandated HDFC Bank for any negotiation / deal. Additionally we would like to affirm that HDFC Bank does not hold any stake in Syska LED as the Company is fully owned by its promoter’s family. Syska LED business EBIDTA has almost doubled during FY 21 as compared to FY 20. Hence the story is not only misinformative but also damaging for our organization Syska that is currently on a growth trajectory.""

“In response to an email query from Moneycontrol, an HDFC Bank spokesperson said, “We would like to clarify that the Syska Led Lights Private Ltd account is entirely regular in our books. There is no question of the Bank exploring any move, including a stake sale, to recover the debt.”

Syska Led was founded in 2012 and its portfolio also includes smaller verticals like accessories, consumer home appliance, wires, cables and personal care products. The company had gained popularity after a successful TV advertising campaign featuring late Bollywood actor Irrfan Khan.

In November 2019, there were reports that Syska Led was in talks with private equity firms to sell a minority stake and deleverage the firm’s balance sheet.

THE GOVERNMENT’S LED PUSH

In 2015, the government launched the UJALA (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable Lighting for All) scheme to reduce LED bulb prices along with the Street Lighting National Programme, which has replaced more than 13 million conventional street lights.

Budget 2021 raised the customs duty on the import of LED light components as the government sought to nudge the lighting market players in India to shift to procuring components locally and boost the ‘Make in India’ programme. However, the ELCOMA ( Electric Lamp & Component Manufacturer’s Association) wants duties to also be imposed on completely imported LED lights, according to a February 8 report by Moneycontrol.

A report dated February 27, 2020 on group company Shree Sant Kripa Appliances Private Limited by Acuite Ratings & Research said “the group has a strong pan India presence with more than 1,000 distributors and over 1,00,000 dealers across the country. Acuité believes the long standing relation with its wide-based distributors and dealers will help the company distribute its own products under 'SYSKA' brand such as LED lights, mobile accessories and other products.”

In recent times, there has been a gradual shift in consumers who are warming up to eco-friendly and energy-efficient lighting options like LED lights. According to industry estimates, the Indian LED lighting market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24.3 percent between 2020 and 2025.

Just State Bank of India, HDFC and ICICI Bank will have to offload equity worth Rs 1.21 lakh crore if the central bank goes ahead with its reported plan to make banks cap their stakes in insurance arms at 20 percent, says a report.

Quoting unnamed RBI officials, a media report earlier this week said the monetary authority is not comfortable with banks owning controlling stake in non-core businesses like insurance ventures which are capital guzzlers and wants banks to cap ownership in insurance arms/ companies at a maximum of 20 percent.

It was also reported that the RBI recently approved Axis Bank’s plan to buy Max Life only after it agreed to directly hold only 10 percent and also capped the overall holding at 20 percent.

Current regulations allow banks to own over 50 percent stake in insurance arms.

If the RBI forces promoter banks/NBFCs to lower their stakes to 20 percent, this can significantly increase free float in the four listed insurance arms of HDFC, ICICI Bank and SBI worth Rs 1.2 lakh crore alone, Kotak Securities said in a report on Thursday.

HDFC owns 50 percent in HDFC Life and bringing it down to 20 percent would mean offloading equity worth Rs 44,100 crore at today’s market value, while in case of ICICI Prudential Life which is 51 percent owned by the bank, it will be Rs 22,100 crore worth of shares flowing into the market, and Rs 21,700 crore worth of shares from ICICI Lombard in which the bank owns 52 percent.

SBI which owns 55 percent in SBI Life will have to sell shares worth Rs 32,200 crore.

The total value their excess holding is worth Rs 1,20,100 crore, says the report.

Almost all state-run banks and large private sector banks also have unlisted life and non-life insurance ventures.

Calling for maintaining the status quo, the report said banks owning insurance companies has been a win-win for all and that there are many positives in that structure such as insurance stake sales have supported banks’ provisioning in challenging times.

Large value unlocking in insurance companies have helped banks earnings in challenging quarters and provide buffer against bad loans, says the report, adding HDFC and ICICI Bank have made large gains from stake sales in their life and general insurance arms and these gains were used to create provisioning buffers.

During FY16-18, HDFC used over 40 percent of such gains to create provisions, and for ICICI Bank such capital gains contributed around 40 percent of annual provision.

HDFC has since 2016 sold stake in life and non-life arms for Rs 10,900 crore, while ICICI Bank gained Rs 15,300 crore and SBI made Rs 12,670 crore so far.

Banks also get a good fee income from insurance distribution to the tune of 2-3 percent of overall revenue and 5-15 percent of their pre-tax profit, which for Axis Bank stood at 15.7 percent, 6.4 percent for HDFC Bank, 7.3 percent for ICICI Bank and 5.7 percent for SBI in FY20.

Bancassurance has emerged as a strong channel for distribution of insurance products with this model getting as much as 54 percent of insurance sales in FY20.

While bancassurance models can be successfully run even without ownership, historic experience suggests that insurance companies with bank ownership have been more successful than others, says the report.

Also that the RBI fear that insurance is a capital guzzling business and this jeopardise the interest of bank depositors is not supported by evidence, especially in regard to life insurance companies, it stated.

The RBI can secure banks by making prior regulatory approval for investments in insurance arms mandatory.",618,0.7099093539374215

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has stayed a Sebi order which imposed a fine of Rs 1 crore on HDFC Bank for invoking securities pledged by stock broker BRH Wealth Kreators, till further orders.

Sebi had imposed the fine and also directed the bank on January 21 to transfer Rs 158.68 crore along with 7 per cent interest per annum into an escrow account till the issue of settlement of clients' securities is reconciled.

""The fact that the circulars have been violated or not and whether the securities have been rightly invoked by the appellant requires consideration,"" the tribunal said in an order dated February 19 while giving three weeks time to Sebi to file a reply.

The tribunal in its order noted that HDFC Bank is one of the largest private sector bank and as per balance sheet it has assets of Rs 1,654,228 crore and therefore has sufficient financial strength and ability to furnish the amount as per the impugned order.

It is not a case where the bank will run away or will become insolvent, it added. ""We accordingly stay the effect and operation of the impugned order till further orders of the Tribunal subject to the condition that appellant will give an undertaking to SEBI that they will abide by the result of the appeal and the directions given therein within four weeks from the date of the disposal of the appeal. Such undertaking shall be given by a responsible officer of the appellant to be filed before SEBI within two weeks from today,"" the tribunal said.

It noted that ""at some length prima facie we find that an ex parte restraint order dated October 7, 2019 does not operate against the appellant (HDFC Bank)"". In fact, the interim order notes that certain securities were pledged by BRH to the appellant but no restraint order was directed against the appellant restraining them from encashing the pledged securities.

It has been specifically asserted that the securities so pledged were that of BRH and were not of BRH clients and therefore there has been no violation of the circulars of Sebi which has been issued from time to time, the tribunal noted. The proceedings of Sebi had arisen on account of non-conformity by HDFC Bank with the directions contained in the interim order issued by Sebi against BRH Wealth Kreators and other entities on October 7, 2019.

Through the interim order, Sebi had directed BRH to cease and desist from undertaking any activity in the securities market and further, its assets would be utilised only for the purpose of payment of money and/ or delivery of securities, as the case may be, to the clients or investors under the supervision of the concerned exchanges or depositories. As such, the expression ""assets"" was extended to all properties of BRH, including securities, that were pledged by it against which funds were raised from HDFC Bank and other financial institutions, Sebi noted.

Further, the depositories and banks were directed not to make debits from the demat as well as bank accounts of BRH. Sebi found that HDFC Bank on October 14, 2019 invoked the pledge of securities to the extent of Rs 158.68 crore and thereafter, sold most of the securities and appropriated the sale proceeds towards the outstanding under the various credit facilities advanced by the bank to BRH.

The private sector lender had granted credit facilities to BRH and BRH Commodities aggregating to Rs 191.16 crore and Rs 26.61 crore, respectively. ""I find the invocation of pledge of client securities available in the two demat accounts of BRH… by the noticee (HDFC Bank), was not in conformity with the directions contained in the interim order,"" Sebi Whole Time Member G Mahalingam said in an order passed on January 21.",642,0.9999980926513672

COVID-19 has presented unprecedented challenges to the Indian banking sector. As a precautionary step, most banks have hiked their provisions on COVID-19 to guard against a likely spike in bad loans. Lenders are also extremely cautious in choosing borrowers to avoid fresh slippages.

HDFC Bank, the country’s largest private lender, said it did not expect the NPAs (non-performing assets) in its wholesale division to worsen. In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Rahul Shukla, HDFC Bank’s Group Head, Wholesale Banking, said he doesn’t expect “a lot of bad news coming” in the industry.

In a freewheeling chat, Shukla also spoke on a range of issues including the idea of proposed Bad Bank, the trend in bad loans, the bank’s outlook on wholesale NPAs, and his views on the 2021 Union Budget.

Edited excerpts:

What is HDFC Bank's wholesale loan strategy going forward?

It is our core belief that the extension of credit leads to progress, growth and poverty alleviation. It has to be kept in mind that credit extension needs to be done within the approved framework of each bank/institution and prudential guidelines. India remains an under-served market in banking service and credit extension. Credit penetration is low. We look at extending credit where needed, with a deeper penetration into the semi-urban and rural markets. In our country, with enormous potential, it may be better to look at responsible growth rather than operate within artificial barriers. A combination of retail and wholesale business strategy has served the bank well in delivering sustainable growth rates.

Will banks shying away from large corporate loans and companies moving to money markets for funds be the norm henceforth?

Banks have not shied away from lending. If you look at our advances growth rates, that itself is one indication. The recent tepid growth rate in bank credit in the system has to be seen in the following context. There has been a move towards deleveraging by large corporates. Secondly, the pandemic did reduce credit needs temporarily, and third, the ample liquidity has pushed corporates towards accessing CP (commercial paper) and bond markets. Banks have participated in many cases by increasing their investment book thereby continuing credit flow to corporates. To the extent possible within the constraints of liquidity and capital availability and risk appetite, the banking sector has been a stabilising force during the pandemic by remaining devoted to serving the nation.

What about smaller companies which don’t have high ratings. Will banks open doors for them?

Our bank has continued to serve micro, small, and medium enterprises and is today the largest private-sector MSME bank. India is a nation not only of a few thousand corporates but has around 60 million small enterprises spread across 730 districts which keep the wheels of enterprise running thereby creating jobs. Digitisation, formalisation and in-house as well as third party data analytics have transformed the sector in terms of availability of credit. Formalisation, which began with GST implementation, accelerated during the pandemic. It is the formalised economy that has done very well given the scale of the pandemic.

Banking is required to be done on the basis of character of the counterparty, capacity to service and repay debt, and collateral structure. If followed, the obsession with a rating driven approach to lending is obviated.

What is the trend seen on corporate loan restructuring requests at HDFC Bank?

I don’t see large scale requests on wholesale banking for COVID resolution. As mentioned before, thematically, large and small corporates have focused on remaining liquid, cutting unneeded capital expenditure plans, and reducing costs - including financial costs. As a result, corporate balance sheets have continued to repair and become stronger.

It must be said that the liquidity and interest rate management has supported the corporate, banking and para-banking segments. The 20 percent ECLGS scheme was timely and helpful in supporting small firms – the factory and jobs engine of the country. Other than these two signature moves, Atmanirbhar packages announced by the finance minister have kept the setup of commerce in the country in a reasonably good shape, from where we are now looking at the next fiscal year with optimism.

What is the outlook on NPAs in the wholesale division going ahead?

I do not expect NPAs in the wholesale banking segment in the bank to deviate from our past performance trends. I also do not expect a lot of bad news coming in the industry. Banks have been reasonably prudent in their approach towards lending. There is an enormous focus on governance. Tight regulatory framework, increased supervision as well as board oversight have had a very positive impact.

What is your assessment on Union Budget 2021?

The budget presented by the finance minister reflects the confidence in New India. It is bold and ambitious and bets on growth, a clear move away from survival to revival. The finance minister has kept it very simple by providing a very gradual five-year fiscal consolidation glidepath, changing the nature of spending towards non-inflationary gross-fixed capital formation and in spelling out long-term framework for funding infrastructure.

We believe the next couple of quarters will continue to benefit from consumption revival and public sector capital expenditure. I expect private sector capex revival towards the second half of the coming fiscal year. In our economic history, this budget will go down as one of the boldest in terms of its bet on growth and reforms.

Is a bad bank, one of the key proposals, a good idea?

I spent a lot of time in far-east in my career. If we look at China and what was done in the banking sector around the turn of the century, very simplistically, bad loans to the tune of $50 billion were taken out into holding companies, thereby improving valuation and creating strengthened balance sheets in the listed vehicle. Followed by raising capital of the order of 3x from international capital markets. So, the concept is very good and it is good that the proposed bad bank is not being funded by public money. If you also see from the experience of Citi Holdings - an internal bad bank – created under the leadership of Vikram Pandit after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, it is a very good idea if executed well.

A large number of strong banks, not hobbled by bad loans, is a very positive move for the economy. We have to see the execution next steps.

The Budget talks about a DFI concept.

First of all, the NIP envisages 7,400 projects over 2020-25 aggregating an outlay in excess of Rs 100 lakh crore. This entails a funding requirement in excess of Rs 20 lakh crore per year. Money is available with banks, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds and internationally as well. However, infrastructure projects require support in terms of making them bankable. The creation of a DFI will be supportive in that direction and create a multiplier effect for infrastructure financing. DFI will be able to provide risk capital as well as extend guarantees.

Beyond the specifics, infra spending is to achieve something. We are moving towards the prime minister’s dream of a $5 trillion Indian economy. That will require the banking sector to double from the current Rs 200 lakh crore. That will require us to tap savings internationally. The sustained effort being made by the government towards ratings stability and inclusion in global bond indices will strengthen the institutional framework underpinning growth outcomes.",1260,0.5442647059758504

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has appointed an external professional IT company to conduct an audit of HDFC Bank’s IT Infrastructure and has sought a report from the company at the earliest, said a person familiar with the development.

“The RBI has appointed a third party to conduct an audit of the IT infrastructure,” said an official in the bank who didn’t want to be named.

This is part of the RBI’s inspections to examine if the bank had improved on it digital capabilities following the recent issues, the person said.

The HDFC bank has also informed the exchanges that the RBI move is in the backdrop of incidents of outages in the internet banking/ mobile banking/ payment utilities of the Bank over the past two years, including the recent outages in the Bank's internet banking and payment system on November 21, 2020 due to a power failure in the primary data centre.

“As an update to the above Intimation, kindly note that RBI has appointed an external professional IT firm for carrying out a special audit of the entire IT infrastructure of the Bank under Section 30 (1-B) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 ('the Act'), at the cost of the Bank under Section 30 (1-C) of the Act,” the bank told the Exchanges. Further, the Bank shall accordingly extend its cooperation to the external professional IT firm so appointed by RBI for conducting the special IT audit as above, the bank said.

On January 19, Moneycontrol reported that the lender is preparing a two-pronged strategy to address the issue of digital outage reported in the recent past. The lender expects to implement a short-term plan to fix the digital outage over the next 10-12 weeks.

The short-term plan is aimed at fixing the technical issues that led to recent multiple outage on HDFC Bank’s digital banking channels. Once the short-term plan is implemented, the bank hopes to get a reprieve from the regulator on new digital launches, said a person aware of the plan, the report said.

On December 3, HDFC Bank announced that the RBI asked the bank to temporarily stop all launches under its Digital 2.0 initiative and stop sourcing new credit card customers. The announcement came after the bank experienced multiple outage in its internet banking, mobile banking and payment utility services over the past two years.

Recently, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that banks must invest more in building robust IT platforms to fortify public confidence in digital banking.

“More investment is required by all stakeholders for building robust IT platforms and technologies for operational purposes as well as for fortifying public confidence in digital banking, especially when the financial landscape is rapidly embracing new technologies,” Das wrote in the foreword of RBI Financial Stability Report (FSR).

Acknowledging that information technology platforms and digital payment systems have provided considerable support for business continuity and smooth functioning during the pandemic, Das said digital technologies have been identified as a bright spot in India’s economic prospects.

HDFC Bank is not the only lender which has faced digital outage. Recently, State Bank of India’s YONO app, which is a platform for various digital transactions, too faced prolonged technical glitches. The bank has addressed the problem subsequently.

More banks are now turning aggressive on digital banking channels to reduce the dependency on traditional brick and mortar models and catch the younger generation who are more tech-savvy. As against the traditional banking, digital transactions are more convenient and most of these can be done round the clock.

Recently, the RBI had made the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) available round the clock on all days from 12.30 AM December 14. With this, India became one of the few countries in the world to operate its RTGS system round the clock throughout the year.

This came within a year of operationalising NEFT 24x7 by the RBI, the central bank said. Transactions worth a minimum of Rs 2 lakh or more can be done via RTGS with no maximum ceiling as per RBI.

Digital transactions have picked up in the recent past. Digital transactions exhibited a sustained recovery and momentum picked up in November 2020, supported by both wholesale and retail transactions, RBI data showed in December.",718,-0.04623731970787048

The Assam Microfinance Bill has begun to show its impact on the books of not just microlenders, but also that of commercial banks. The impact on the credit culture on the ground has reflected in one of the major markets of microfinance in the north-eastern parts of the country.

Bandhan Bank is among the banks which have felt the heat. In the third quarter, Bandhan’s proforma gross non-performing assets (NPAs) grew to 7.12 percent, a good chunk of which has come from delayed microloan payments. While the bank has guided that it will recover from the impact in a period of 2-3 months, some experts aren’t too sure of an immediate recovery. Much will depend on how the local law will be implemented.

The state government recently promulgated a law called - The Assam Microfinance Institutions (Regulation of Moneylending) Bill, 2020 - following a series of reports of coercive lending.

The law mandates MFIs to register within a period of 30 days and collect dues only at gram panchayat offices or public places. These rules have affected the microlenders who say compliance to these norms is difficult.

The problem is not just about the Assam Microfinance Bill. The calls from local politicians to borrowers not to pay back loans too have added to the problem, spoiling the credit culture in the state’s microlending industry. Though the law is primarily targeting MFIs, it will have impact both on banks and MFIs on account of the deterioration in credit culture on the grounds, experts said.

A major market of small loans

Assam is critical for microfinance business. According to rating agency Crisil, Assam’s microfinance portfolio (including banks and non-banks) was estimated at Rs 12,400 crore as on September 2020, or about 5 per cent of such loans in the country.

“The legislation is the latest in a string of events affecting microfinance lenders in Assam: economic stress in the tea plantation industry in October 2019, agitation over the Citizenship Amendment Bill that December, and the COVID-19 pandemic that hit the entire nation,” Crisil said in a note on January 22.

The MFI Bill has the potential to increase asset-quality challenges for microfinanciers, Crisil said. “Additionally, any loan waivers announced would make matters worse due to their potential impact on repayment discipline,” Crisil said, adding “certain provisions in the Bill that pose operational hurdles could trigger collection challenges and end up dissuading lenders from seeking incremental business in the state.”

Banks’ exposure bigger than MFIs

According to P Satish, Executive Director of Sa-Dhan, an industry lobby of microlenders, banks have a bigger share of the market in Assam than MFIs themselves. “Of the Rs 12,000 crore outstanding, just about Rs 2,000 crore is with pure MFIs. Banks like Bandhan Bank, HDFC Bank and small finance banks together have around Rs 7,000 crore loan exposure at the end of September. Bandhan has the biggest share,” Satish said.

According to a note by analysts at Emkay Global, as per Bandhan Bank management, collection efficiency in Assam was 89 percent in January, 2021, mainly hit by waiver pronouncements by political parties in the run-up to elections.

“Based on current assessment, the bank expects a potential 10 percent loss in the portfolio,” Emkay said.

Bandhan Bank management, in a con-call post the result announcement, said share of Assam in MFI portfolio is around 14 percent. “This is first time in last 15 years that Assam has seen some disruption. For Assam, given the situation it will continue to be very cautious on disbursements,” the bank said.

The performance of loan portfolio in the state will depend on how the Assam state government plans to implement the law. Industry associations are engaged in dialogues with the state government on the difficulties caused by the law to microlenders and institutions engaged in pure microlending.

“There is a temporary setback to credit culture in Assam,” said Alok Misra, CEO of Microfinance Institutions Network, another industry body. “We are in dialogues with the state government,” Misra said.

The Assam Microfinance Institutions (Regulation of Moneylending) Bill, 2020, was enacted to “protect and relieve the economically vulnerable groups and individuals from the undue hardship of usurious interest rates and coercive means of recovery by Micro Finance Institutions or Money Lending Agencies or Organizations…,” the state government said.

The law intends to create an effective mechanism to regulate the MFIs including the NBFC-MFIs that are regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

How will the Law harm the sector?

According to industry officials, stipulation to collect dues at gram panchayat offices or other places approved by local authorities will prove detrimental to the industry because of likely political intervention and involvement from local officials. “Why would a borrower go to panchayat office to pay up his dues? This is exactly what happened in AP too,” said one of the officials who didn’t want to be named.

Also, registration within 30 days could pose challenges to many existing MFIs, Puli said. Assam is a key state for microfinance industry in the eastern part of the country although the concentration of MFIs is less compared to southern states like AP and Karnataka.

The Assam Bill also puts a cap of Rs 30,000 to 50,000 for tea plantation workers and Rs 1,25,000 for other borrowers. According to Macquarie, the Bill will have a medium to potentially long-term impact on the growth of Bandhan Bank in the state since its business is concentrated in the region.",919,-0.9355802357196807

The country's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank on Friday said Sebi has asked it to deposit Rs 158.68 crore along with interest in an escrow account with regard to BRH Wealth Kreators case.

On Thursday, Sebi imposed a penalty of Rs 1 crore on HDFC Bank for invoking securities pledged by stock broker BRH Wealth Kreators in violation of the regulator''s interim directions. The lender was also asked to deposit money in an escrow account.

The instant proceedings have essentially arisen on account of non-conformity by HDFC Bank with the directions contained in the interim order issued by Sebi against BRH Wealth Kreators and other entities on October 7, 2019, as per the regulator.

""The bank has been directed... to transfer an amount ofÂ Rs 158.68 crore along with interest from October 14, 2019 till date, calculated at the rate of 7 per cent per annum to an interest bearing escrow account in any nationalised bank, by marking a lien in favour of Sebi, until the issue of settlement of clients'' securities (clients of the stockbroker) is reconciled,"" it said in a regulatory filing.

Sebi had found that HDFC Bank on October 14, 2019 invoked the pledge of securities to the extent of Rs 158.68 crore and thereafter, sold most of the securities and appropriated the sale proceeds towards the outstanding under the various credit facilities advanced by the bank to BRH.

The private sector lender had granted credit facilities to BRH and BRH Commodities aggregating to Rs 191.16 crore and Rs 26.61 crore, respectively.",266,

SEBI on Thursday imposed a penalty of Rs 1 crore on HDFC Bank for invoking securities pledged by stock broker BRH Wealth Kreators in violation of the regulator's interim directions.

In addition, the bank has been directed to transfer Rs 158.68 crore along with 7 percent interest per annum into an escrow account till the issue of settlement of clients' securities is reconciled, SEBI said in an order.

The instant proceedings have essentially arisen on account of non-conformity by HDFC Bank with the directions contained in the interim order issued by SEBI against BRH Wealth Kreators and other entities on October 7, 2019.

Through the interim order, SEBI had directed BRH to cease and desist from undertaking any activity in the securities market and further, its assets would be utilised only for the purpose of payment of money and/ or delivery of securities, as the case may be, to the clients or investors under the supervision of the concerned exchanges or depositories.

As such, the expression ""assets"" was extended to all properties of BRH, including securities, that were pledged by it against which funds were raised from HDFC Bank and other financial institutions, SEBI noted.

Further, the depositories and banks were directed not to make debits from the demat as well as bank accounts of BRH.

SEBI found that HDFC Bank on October 14, 2019 invoked the pledge of securities to the extent of Rs 158.68 crore and thereafter, sold most of the securities and appropriated the sale proceeds towards the outstanding under the various credit facilities advanced by the bank to BRH.

The private sector lender had granted credit facilities to BRH and BRH Commodities aggregating to Rs 191.16 crore and Rs 26.61 crore, respectively.

SEBI said the interim order was not an ultimate determination of the rights of recovery of the bank but rather intended to ensure a freeze on the assets of BRH until completion of the investigation or forensic audit and that the investors' interests are not compromised in any manner whatsoever.

""I find the invocation of pledge of client securities available in the two demat accounts of BRH...by the noticee (HDFC Bank), was not in conformity with the directions contained in the interim order,"" SEBI Whole Time Member G Mahalingam said.

Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has imposed a penalty of Rs 1 crore on HDFC Bank and the fine shall be payable within a period of 45 days.

In addition, the private sector bank has been asked to keep the Reserve Bank of India informed about the order within a week.",441,-0.9704533815383911

The RBI said this while announcing the 2020 list of D-SIBs.

The RBI had come with the list of D-SIBs first in 2015 including SBI and ICICI Bank. HDFC Bank’s name was included later in September, 2017. 'Too-big-to-fail' lenders are banks whose failure could impact the financial system as a whole because of their size and interconnectedness. This list is published every year.

Such lenders will have to comply with additional capital requirements. The additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement for D-SIBs was phased-in from April 1, 2016 and became fully effective from April 1, 2019.

As per this, the additional common equity Tier 1 requirement as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) for SBI is 0.6 per cent and that of other two lenders is 0.2 per cent, according to RBI.

The RBI had issued the framework for dealing with D-SIBs on July 22, 2014. The D-SIB framework requires the Reserve Bank to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs starting from 2015 and place these banks in appropriate buckets depending upon their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).

Based on the bucket in which a D-SIB is placed, an additional common equity requirement has to be applied to it.

“In case a foreign bank having branch presence in India is a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB), it has to maintain additional CET1 capital surcharge in India as applicable to it as a G-SIB, proportionate to its Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) in India, i.e., additional CET1 buffer prescribed by the home regulator (amount) multiplied by India RWA as per consolidated global Group books divided by total consolidated global Group RWA,” the RBI said.

Based on the methodology provided in the D-SIB framework and data collected from banks as on March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, the Reserve Bank had announced State Bank of India and ICICI Bank Ltd. as D-SIBs on August 31, 2015 and August 25, 2016, respectively.

Based on data collected from banks as of March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, the Reserve Bank had announced State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd. as D-SIBs on September 04, 2017 and March 14, 2019, respectively.

Current update is based on the data collected from banks as of March 31, 2020.",420,

YES Securities' research report on HDFC Bank

We are revising FY21/22/23 earnings estimates by 10%/3%/4% respectively and ABV estimates by 1.5‐2% for these years, after having upgraded these numbers even towards the end of November in our collection feedback report. Earnings revisions thus could be sharper for the consensus. The stand‐alone bank trades at 2.8x P/ABV and 16x P/E on FY23 estimates, adjusted for the valuation of its holdings in HDB Financial and HDFC Securities. Valuation is palatable and can move higher as it stands just above the long‐term mean on 1‐yr rolling fwd. basis and the probability of 20% earnings CAGR over FY20‐23 has improved substantially. Also, the bank trades at significant discount to KMB despite better growth delivery.



Outlook

Upgrading earnings estimates again, now building 20% CAGR over FY20‐ 23 ‐ Valuation will get a lift; upgrade 12m TP to Rs1,870.

Dolat Capital Market's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank reported in-line NII growth of 15% YoY, though higher PPoP growth of 17% YoY benefitted from elevated treasury gains and superior fee lines. NIM improved by ~10 bps QoQ to 4.2%. Pro forma slippages and gross NPA remained below expectations at 1.86% (annualized) and 1.38% (stable QoQ) respectively. Loan restructuring is expected to be at 0.5% of advances, mostly from retail segment, part of which is also included in pro forma NPAs. Additional contingent provisions of ~Rs24bn were made during 3QFY21, mainly towards pro forma slippages. Pro forma credit costs stood at 116 bps for the quarter. Total excess provision buffers including floating and contingent provisions at ~Rs69bn or 0.6% of advances (ex of those made against pro forma NPAs over last two quarters) remains largely unutilized. Sequential loan growth was broad based, with both retail and corporate segments growing at ~4% each. Total ECLGS disbursements (including 1.0 and 2.0) stood at ~2% of bank’s net advances. Management remained optimistic on asset quality trends with superior bureau scores of new acquisitions relative to industry, improving SMA-1 portfolio over the last few months (for >5cr exposures), and further reduction in anticipated stress for the SME book (at 2.75% from 3% earlier). Lowering our slippages and credit cost estimates and factoring in higher fee income, earnings have been revised upwards by 17%/12% for FY21E/22E. Unutilized contingent provisions at 0.6% of loans along with strong capital position and exposure to top end customers across segments provide significant comfort to earnings profile.



Outlook

We maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a SOTP-based TP of Rs 1,750 (from Rs 1,650 earlier), implying 3.8x Dec-22E P/ABV. The stock currently trades at 3.2x Sep-22E ABV.

HDFC Bank, India’s largest private lender, is preparing a two-pronged strategy to address the issue of digital outage reported in the recent past. The lender expects to implement a short-term plan to fix the digital outage over the next 10-12 weeks. The details of this plan will be submitted to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) soon.

The short-term plan is aimed at fixing the technical issues that led to recent multiple outage on HDFC Bank’s digital banking channels. Once the short-term plan is implemented, the bank hopes to get a reprieve from the regulator on new digital launches, said a person aware of the plan. But, the final decision on this should come from the RBI after an inspection.

“We are looking at 10-12 weeks to work on the short term action plan and submit to the regulator. From thereon, it is upto the regulator and its prerogative to give us the go ahead,” said the person requesting anonymity.

While the short-term action plan is the first stage, this will be followed up with a long-term plan on cloud computing, architectural efficiencies, disaster recovery processes, which could take 12 to 18 months, the person said. The bank has taken the recent instances of digital outage seriously and would want to avert similar incidents going ahead.

On December 3, HDFC Bank announced that the RBI asked the bank to temporarily stop all launches under its Digital 2.0 initiative and stop sourcing new credit card customers. The announcement came after the bank experienced multiple outage in its internet banking, mobile banking and payment utility services over the past two years.

Rating agencies have taken note. Multiple digital outage reported by the bank are credit negative, global rating agency Moody’s said on December 7. In a letter to customers, HDFC Bank’s CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan said the bank will comply with the RBI regulations and will wait for the regulator’s clearance before launching new products.

Following the multiple reports of digital outage, the RBI had looked at the matter and sought details from the bank. Recently, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that banks must invest more in building robust IT platforms to fortify public confidence in digital banking.

“More investment is required by all stakeholders for building robust IT platforms and technologies for operational purposes as well as for fortifying public confidence in digital banking, especially when the financial landscape is rapidly embracing new technologies,” Das wrote in the foreword of RBI Financial Stability Report (FSR).

Acknowledging that information technology platforms and digital payment systems have provided considerable support for business continuity and smooth functioning during the pandemic, Das said digital technologies have been identified as a bright spot in India’s economic prospects.

HDFC Bank is not the only lender which has faced digital outage. Recently, State Bank of India’s YONO app, which is a platform for various digital transactions, too faced prolonged technical glitches. The bank has addressed the problem subsequently.

More banks are now turning aggressive on digital banking channels to reduce the dependency on traditional brick and mortar models and catch the younger generation who are more tech-savvy. As against the traditional banking, digital transactions are more convenient and most of these can be done round the clock.

Recently, the RBI had made the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) available round the clock on all days from 12.30 AM December 14. With this, India became one of the few countries in the world to operate its RTGS system round the clock throughout the year.

This came within a year of operationalising NEFT 24x7 by the RBI, the central bank said. Transactions worth a minimum of Rs 2 lakh or more can be done via RTGS with no maximum ceiling as per RBI.

Digital transactions have picked up in the recent past. Digital transactions exhibited a sustained recovery and momentum picked up in November 2020, supported by both wholesale and retail transactions, RBI data showed in December.

In the retail segment, national electronic funds transfer (NEFT) transactions volume grew 24.6 percent YoY in November 2020, much higher than the growth (13.9 percent) recorded a month ago. The growth in the value of NEFT transactions in November 2020 (27.9 percent) was higher than that recorded in October 2020 (20.1 percent), the RBI data showed.

In value terms, UPI transactions to the tune of Rs 3.9 lakh crore happened while IMPS transactions worth Rs 2.76 lakh crore happened. Also, RTGS transactions worth Rs 79.8 lakh crore and NEFT worth Rs 22.18 lakh crore were reported, data showed.",765,0.2870931128660838

The earnings of HDFC Bank (CMP: Rs 1,493, Mcap: 823,174 crore) in the third quarter of FY21 were the most awaited by the Street because of a couple of reasons. First, it was the maiden quarter of the bank’s new CEO after Aditya Puri, who led the bank since its inception in 1994, retired in October last year.

HDFC Bank share price rose in the early trade on January 18 after the country's largest private sector lender reported a standalone profit of Rs 8,758.3 crore for the quarter ended December 2020, rising 18.1 percent year-on-year.

The growth was led by non-interest income and pre-provision operating profit with improved asset quality performance. The numbers, released on January 16, beat the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate which had was pegged the profit at Rs 8,264.8 crore.

Its net interest income (NII), the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew by 15.1 percent to Rs 16,317.6 crore in Q3FY21 compared to the year-ago period, driven by advances growth of 15.6 percent and a core net interest margin for the quarter of 4.2 percent.

Here is what brokerages have to say on the stock and company after the December quarter results:

Yes Securities

We are revising FY21/22/23 earnings estimates by 10%/3%/4%, respectively, and ABV estimates by 1.5-2 percent for these years, after having upgraded these numbers even towards the end of November in our collection feedback report. Earnings revisions could be sharper for the consensus. The stand-alone bank trades at 2.8x P/ABV and 16x P/E on FY23 estimates, adjusted for the valuation of its holdings in HDB Financial and HDFC Securities.

The valuation is palatable and can move higher as it stands just above the long-term mean on one year rolling forward basis and the probability of 20 percent earnings CAGR over FY20-23 has improved substantially. Also, the bank trades at a significant discount to KMB despite better growth delivery.

Prabhudas Lilladher

HDFC Bank’s earnings were in-line at Rs 87.6 billion (PLe: Rs 87.5 billion), with NII growing slightly slow at 15 percent, though NIM improved by 10bps to 4.2 percent. Better treasury gains helped PPOP and made additional Rs 26 billion of contingent provisions.

Contingency plus floating provisions now stand at 100bps of loans (70bps in Q2FY21), which is quite adequate, given the normalisation in slippage and lower restructured book of 50bps of loans (Rs 54 billion). Collections also have normalised to pre-COVID levels of 97 percent but yet varies product-to-product, making growth aspects slightly cautious.

With the return of normalisation, it will re-gain in retail credit, while turn aggressive in small/medium business lending from being cautious, in turn improving NIMs path. We retain buy with a revised target price of Rs 1,690 (from Rs 1,645 based on 3.6x (from 3.5x) Mar-23 ABV.

Sharekhan

HDFC Bank trades at 3.7x/3.2x its FY2022E/FY2023E ABVPS, which we find is reasonable. We believe the bank’s consistency is buoyed by its robust underwriting capability and risk measurement standards, which provide support for valuations. We find management’s indications for stable NIMs, and a structurally improving cost-income ratio encouraging, while the high provisioning buffer should provide support to asset quality and profitability.

We have finetuned our estimates and the target multiple for the bank considering the improving earnings visibility. We retain a buy rating on the stock, with a revised price target of Rs 1,810.

LKP Research

HDFC Bank is expected to outperform the sector led by 1) a healthy growth in operating income, 2) much higher provisions than regulatory requirement in the balance sheet, 3) strong capital cushion of 17 percent at CET1 level and best in class underwriting and risk-management practices. Given these strengths, we expect HDFC Bank to remain one of the best among all the lending business.

Thus, we continue to maintain buy rating, with a target price of Rs 1,643 (based on 3.7xFY22 Price to Adjusted Book Value).

Motilal Oswal

HDFC Bank has delivered strong business growth as the economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 shock. Business activity has picked up, as reflected from the revival in retail loan growth, and disbursements across multiple segments are now higher than pre-COVID levels.

The bank’s operating performance remains steady, aided by healthy revenue growth, improving margins, and controlled opex. The asset quality impact due to COVID-19 remains under control, with total restructuring at 0.5 percent of loans and proforma slippages at Rs 49 b (for 3QFY21).

The bank holds a sufficient additional contingent provision buffer to manage residual stress. We marginally increase our earnings estimates and expect a 20 percent PAT CAGR over FY20–FY23E – with ROA/ROE of 2.1%/18.2% for FY23E. Maintain buy, with revised target price of Rs 1,720 (3.7x Sep’22E ABV).

ICICI direct

Digital initiatives and increasing economic activity are seen propelling retail credit growth ahead. This, coupled with healthy traction in corporate disbursement, will keep the business momentum ahead of the industry.

Healthy collection at 97 percent and contingent provision at around 90 bps of advances provide a cushion against asset-quality volatility. Capital adequacy of 18.9 percent and operational efficiency provide confidence on future earnings growth. Thus, we remain positive on the bank. Rolling on FY23E estimates, we maintain our buy rating with a revised target price of Rs 1,700 a share, valuing the core bank at around 3.7x FY23E ABV and adding Rs 50 in lieu of subsidiaries.

Credit Suisse

Credit Suisse has maintained outperform call and raised target to Rs 1,700 from Rs 1,400.

The bank remains well-capitalised and growth is expected to continue to outpace the industry. It increases EPS for 2021-23 by 2-7 percent on the back of lower credit costs, reported CNBC-TV18.

At 0918 hours, HDFC Bank was quoting at Rs 1,490.55, up Rs 23.90, or 1.63 percent, on the BSE.

Private sector lender HDFC Bank on January 16 announced its quarterly earnings for the October-December period of 2020. It was the first company among banks to release quarterly results.

HDFC Bank shares surged 33 percent during the December quarter of 2020, thereby underperforming the Bank Nifty that gained 46 percent during the same period. However, the stock rose 13 percent in the year 2020, thus displaying a much better performance than Bank Nifty, that corrected 2.8 percent during the said period.

Here are 10 key highlights of earnings:

Profit

After providing Rs 3,013.6 crore for taxation, the bank earned a net profit of Rs 8,758.3 crore for the quarter ended December 2020, an increase of 18.1 percent over the quarter ended December 2019. The CNBC-TV18 poll had estimated a profit of Rs 8,264.8 crore.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income - interest earned less interest expended - for the quarter ended December 2020 grew by 15.1 percent to Rs 16,317.6 crore from Rs 14,172.9 crore in the corresponding period, driven by advances growth of 15.6 percent, and a core net interest margin for the quarter of 4.2 percent. The bank's persistent focus on deposits helped in the maintenance of a healthy liquidity coverage ratio at 146 percent, well above the regulatory requirement.

Advances

Total advances as of December 2020 were Rs 10.82 lakh crore, an increase of 15.6 percent over December 2019. Domestic advances grew by 14.9 percent over December 2019. As per regulatory [Basel 2] segment classification, domestic retail loans grew by 5.2 percent and domestic wholesale loans grew by 25.5 percent, the bank said.

Deposits

Total deposits as of December 2020 were Rs 12.71 lakh crore, an increase of 19.1 percent over December 2019. CASA deposits grew by 29.6 percent with savings account deposits at Rs 3,74,639 crore and current account deposits at Rs 172,108 crore, said the bank, adding time deposits were at Rs 7,24,377 crore, an increase of 12.2 percent over the corresponding period, resulting in CASA deposits comprising 43.0 percent of total deposits as of December 2020.

Non-Interest Income

Other income or non-interest income was Rs 7,443.2 crore at 31.3 percent of the net revenues for the quarter ended December 2020 as against Rs 6,669.3 crore in the corresponding quarter.

The four components of other income for the quarter ended December 2020 were fees & commissions of Rs 4,974.9 crore (up 9.9 percent over the corresponding period), foreign exchange & derivatives revenue of Rs 562.2 crore (up 7 percent over the corresponding period), gain on sale/revaluation of investments of Rs 1,109.0 crore (up 17.9 percent over the corresponding period) and miscellaneous income, including recoveries, of Rs 7,97.1 crore (down 15.2 percent compared with the corresponding period), HDFC Bank said.

Pre-Provision Operating Profit

The pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) at Rs 15,186.0 crore in Q3FY21 grew by 17.3 percent over the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

""The cost-to-income ratio for December quarter 2020 was at 36.1 percent as against 37.9 percent in the corresponding period,"" HDFC Bank said.

The total credit cost ratio was at 1.25 percent, as compared to 1.41 percent in the quarter ending September 2020 and 1.29 percent in the quarter ending December 2019, it added.

Provisions

Provisions and contingencies for the quarter ended December 2020 were Rs 3,414.1 crore (consisting of specific loan loss provisions of Rs 691.2 crore and general and other provisions of Rs 2,722.9 crore) as against Rs 3,043.6 crore (consisting of specific loan loss provisions of Rs 2,883.6 crore and general and other provisions of Rs 159.9 crore) for the quarter ended December 2019.

Total provisions for the current quarter included contingent provisions of approximately Rs 2,400 crore for proforma NPA, said the bank.

Asset Quality

The gross and net non-performing assets were at 0.81 percent of gross advances and 0.09 percent of net advances as of December 2020 respectively, against 1.08 percent and 0.17 percent in the corresponding period.

The restructuring under the RBI resolution framework for COVID-19 was approximately 0.5 percent of advances, said the bank.

The Supreme Court directed banks that accounts that were not declared NPA till August 2020 shall not be declared NPA until further orders. However, ""if the Bank had classified borrower accounts as NPA after August 2020 using its analytical models (proforma approach), the proforma gross NPA ratio would have been 1.38 percent as on December 2020, as against 1.37 percent as on September 2020 and 1.42 percent as on December 2019. The proforma net NPA ratio would have been 0.40 percent,"" said HDFC Bank.

The bank further said it continued to hold provisions as of December 2020 against the potential impact of COVID-19 based on the information available at this point in time and the same are in excess of the RBI prescribed norms.

The bank held floating provisions of Rs 1,451 crore and contingent provisions of Rs 8,656 crore as of December 2020, it added.

Capital Adequacy Ratio

The bank's total capital adequacy ratio (CAR) as per Basel III guidelines was at 18.9 percent as of December 2020 (18.5 percent as of December 2019) as against a regulatory requirement of 11.075 percent, HDFC Bank said.

Tier 1 CAR was at 17.6 percent as of December 2020 compared to 17.1 percent as of December 2019, it added.

Network

As of December 2020, the bank's distribution network was at 5,485 branches and 15,541 ATMs/cash deposit & withdrawal machines across 2,866 cities-towns as against 5,203 branches and 14,533 ATMs / CDMs across 2,787 cities-towns as of December 2019.

""50 percent of our branches are in semi-urban and rural areas. The number of employees was at 1,17,560 as of December 2020 as against 1,13,981 as of December 2019,"" the bank said.",958,0.9973424077033997

The third quarter results of HDFC Bank, the largest private lender, shows overall improvement across key components. Loan and deposit growth numbers are healthy and asset quality showed improvement. Loan book, the bank said, increased by 15.6 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis at Rs 10.82 lakh crore and deposits by 19.1 percent YoY to Rs 12.71 lakh crore at the end of December quarter 2020.

According to the bank’s disclosures, the restructuring under the RBI’s resolution framework for COVID-19 was approximately 0.5 percent of the advances. This is much less than what was initially projected by analysts. The lower percentage of loan recast figures indicate that the stress among corporations may not be as big, at this stage, as initially projected. But much will depend on future economic recovery.

But, one aspect that needs a closer look is the asset quality figures. What is the actual non-performing asset (NPA) numbers on its books?

The bank has said its gross NPAs, as a percentage of gross advances, fell 27 bps sequentially to 0.81 percent for the quarter ended December 2020, while net NPA declined to 0.09 percent in the quarter ended December 2020, compared to 0.17 percent in September quarter 2020.

But, that’s excluding the portion not tagged as NPAs following a Supreme Court (SC) interim order. Banks cannot classify NPAs that are standard as on August 31 until a final SC order is issued.

If HDFC Bank had classified borrower accounts as NPAs after August 31, the proforma Gross NPAs would have been 1.38 percent as on December 31 as against 0.81 percent reported.

Similarly, the net GNPAs would have been at 0.4 percent as against the reported 0.09 percent. The difference in GNPA numbers is 57 basis points and that of gross NPA figures is 31 bps. One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point. What this shows is that without the SC dispensation, the actual NPAs would have been notably higher.

For HDFC Bank, even after adjusting this component, the overall NPAs are one of the lowest in the banking system. There is no major concern. Also, HDFC Bank has provided more than required to cover the likely shock from COVID impact on its loan book.

Going by the bank’s declaration, it held total floating provisions of Rs 1,451 crore and contingent provisions of Rs 8,656 crore as at end December. Total provisions, it said, were 260 percent of the reported gross NPAs or 148 percent of proforma gross NPAs as on December 31.

But the widening gap between actual and proforma NPAs gives an indication of the larger bad loan trend in the banking industry. The key question arises here is this—what is the actual picture of NPAs in the banking industry excluding the regulatory dispensation availed as part of COVID measures announced by the central bank and SC intervention?

One needs to wait for the earnings cards of other banks to get a clear pattern on the actual asset quality trend in Q3.

The RBI has cautioned of a significant spike in NPAs this year even in a base case scenario. The report, a key document on the macroeconomy, suggested Indian banks’ gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) could grow to 13.5 percent of the total loans by September 2021 in a base case scenario and 14.8 percent in a worst-case scenario. The gross NPAs of banks stood at 7.5 percent in September 2020. This means NPA levels will nearly double even going by the base case scenario.

HDFC Bank, the country's largest private sector lender, has reported a standalone profit of Rs 8,758.3 crore for the quarter ended December 2020, rising 18.1 percent year-on-year, thus beating the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate which was pegged at Rs 8,264.8 crore. The growth was led by non-interest income and pre-provision operating profit with improved asset quality performance.

Its net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew by 15.1 percent to Rs 16,317.6 crore in Q3FY21, compared to the corresponding period, driven by advances growth of 15.6 percent, and a core net interest margin for the quarter of 4.2 percent. The NII was below the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of Rs 16,370.4 crore for the quarter under review.

""The persistent focus on deposits helped in the maintenance of a healthy liquidity coverage ratio at 146 percent, well above the regulatory requirement,"" said the bank.

The lender said its loan book increased by 15.6 percent YoY to Rs 10.82 lakh crore, and deposits by 19.1 percent YoY to Rs 12.71 lakh crore at the end of December quarter 2020.

The CASA ratio as of December 2020 jumped to around 43 percent compared to 39.5 percent at the end of December 2019 and 41.6 percent as of September 2020.

Asset quality of the bank has seen improvement in Q3FY21, with gross non-performing assets (NPA) as a percentage of gross advances falling 27 bps sequentially to 0.81 percent for the quarter December 2020, while net NPA declined to 0.09 percent in the quarter ended December 2020, compared to 0.17 percent in September quarter 2020.

Provisions and contingencies increased 12.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,414.13 crore in Q3FY20, but the same declined 7.8 percent sequentially, which was largely on expected lines. ""Total provisions included contingent provisions of approximately Rs 2,400 crore for proforma NPA,"" said the bank.

The RBI directed banks that accounts that were not declared NPA till August 2020 shall not be declared as NPA until further orders, but HDFC Bank said if the bank had classified borrower accounts as NPA after August 2020, the proforma gross NPA ratio would have been 1.38 percent in Q3FY21, against 1.37 percent in Q2FY21, and its proforma net NPA ratio would have been 0.40 percent in Q3FY21.

Pending disposal of the case, the bank, as a matter of prudence, has made a contingent provision in respect of these accounts, it added.

The restructuring under RBI resolution framework for COVID-19 was approximately 0.5 percent of advances, the lender added.

The total credit cost ratio at 1.25 percent in the quarter ended December 2020, declined from 1.41 percent in previous quarter and 1.29 percent in the corresponding period, the bank said.

Non-interest income (other income) grew by 11.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 7,443.22 crore in the October-December quarter of 2020, driven by fees & commissions and sale/revaluation of investments.

Fees and commissions at Rs 4,974.9 crore grew by 9.9 percent YoY in Q3FY20 and foreign exchange & derivatives revenue at Rs 562.2 crore in the same period increased 7 percent compared to the corresponding period, while the bank reported gain on sale or revaluation of investments at Rs 1,109 crore, rising 17.9 percent YoY.

Pre-provision operating profit was better than analysts' expectations, rising 17.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 15,186.02 crore for the quarter ended December 2020.

HDFC Bank, the country's largest lender by market capitalisation, is expected to report more than 15 percent year-on-year growth in profit for the quarter ended December 2020. The likely marginal increase in provisions and improved NII growth backed by loan growth may support profitability.

The company will announce its quarterly earnings on January 16.

The net interest income for the quarter is also likely to see more than 15 percent year-on-year growth driven by credit growth and likely stable net interest margin.

The bank, on January 5, already announced the loan growth of 16 percent at Rs 10.82 lakh crore and deposits growth of 19 percent at Rs 12.71 lakh crore for the quarter ended December 2020 YoY.

""We expect NII growth at around 15.3 percent YoY led by solid loan growth of around 16 percent YoY. Operating profit growth to be slower at 11 percent. We expect NIM unchanged at 4.1 percent. We expect a strong commentary on disbursements,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 16.9 percent YoY profit growth for the quarter.

The brokerage had expected the strong CASA ratio. And as expected, HDFC Bank last week said the CASA ratio as of December 2020 stood at around 43 percent, compared to 39.5 percent as on December 2019 and 41.6 percent as on September 2020.

The loan loss provisions could see a marginal increase of 2-3 percent year-on-year, but sequentially the same may decline 15-16 percent, according to Kotak and Prabhudas Lilladher.

Asset quality on the sequential basis may be weak for the quarter ended December 2020. Kotak expects gross NPL ratio to rise sharply led by higher slippages from the retail portfolio, while Motilal Oswal sees gross non-performing assets rising by 20 bps QoQ to 1.3 percent and net NPAs by 10 bps to 0.3 percent.

With HDFC set to acquire 41 percent stake in HDFC Bank, the merger between the two is finally a reality, which is likely to create the third-largest entity in India in terms of market capitalisation.

In an exchange filing, HDFC announced that the company will merge itself with HDFC Bank following a union of subsidiaries HDFC Holdings and HDFC Investments. A similar announcement was made by HDFC Bank in a separate exchange filing.

This merger between HDFC Bank (CMP: Rs 1,639) and housing finance giant HDFC (CMP: Rs 2,738) had been talked about for a very long period. Ever since the merger of ICICI Bank and its parent ICICI in 2001, there is speculation that the fate of HDFC and HDFC Bank may be similar.

While the talks of a possible merger between the two keep surfacing time and again, a report by an Internal Working Group of the Reserve Bank of India re-ignited such speculations. The IWG recommending that well-run large NBFCs may be considered for conversion into banks heightened the case for the HDFC Bank–HDFC merger.

Once the merger process gets complete, it promises to create a financial behemoth with a loan book size of Rs 15 lakh crore and an asset base of Rs 21.5 lakh crore.

The managements of both entities have always maintained that a merger is possible in the long run if regulatory hurdles are sorted out and if the move is beneficial to all stakeholders.

As per current structure, HDFC owns 21.5% equity in HDFC Bank. Since it was set up in 1994, HDFC Bank under the leadership of Aditya Puri has overshadowed its parent HDFC in terms of growth and performance and has been the Street’s favourite.

Nonetheless, the current structure of two separate entities has worked remarkably well for several years. This gets validated by the fact that the combined market cap of HDFC twins is more than that of Reliance Industries - the country’s most valuable company. And if we take the combined market cap of all the 4 listed companies in the HDFC group, it is just shy of the market cap of the entire Tata group which has over 20 listed companies.

So the moot question is: Why consider a merger?

Create a funding advantageHDFC has done exceedingly well in managing its spreads across interest rate cycles. However, its cost of borrowings, despite being the best among NBFCs, stood at around 7.20% in the second quarter of FY21. In contrast, HDFC Bank’s cost of funding stood below 5%.

Though HDFC’s funding cost has declined in the current fiscal, the reduction has not been proportionate to the fall in interest rates. That’s because HDFC’s deposit book stands at Rs 148,330 crore, constituting 35 percent of total borrowings as at end-September. Though deposits are stickier, interest paid on deposits is generally higher compared to funds accessed from bond markets.

Overall, HDFC being largely a wholesale financier is relatively more exposed to volatility in interest rates and liquidity than HDFC Bank. A merged entity will have a more sustainable and favorable funding profile.

While funding benefits will be real and known for years, the regulatory cost of merging into the bank has been the biggest impediment. However, the RBI is increasingly moving towards reducing the regulatory arbitrage between a bank and an NBFC which makes the environment more conducive for merger.

Reducing regulatory arbitrage supports mergerThe norms on regulatory asset-allocation for banks are quite stringent as they need to allocate 40 per cent of assets towards priority sector loans in addition of setting aide cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR). This makes banks’ asset mix much more inefficient versus non-bank lenders.

The RBI, in 2014, scrapped reserve requirements for infrastructure lending and funding affordable housing through long- term bonds, eliminating the widely-known and biggest stumbling block for the merger. The other regulations like NPA recognition, provisioning, risk weights are almost identical for banks and housing finance companies (HFCs).

Loans to individuals constitute around 75 per cent of HDFC’s loan book as at end-September and it is increasingly targeting the economically weaker section (EWS) and lower income group (LIG) segments in affordable housing since a couple of years. For instance, in the first half of this fiscal (H1 FY21) around 18 per cent of home loans in value terms have been to customers from the EWS and LIG.

With relaxation from RBI on affordable loans, efficiency of a merger between HDFC’s assets with that of HDFC Bank has improved considerably.

The merger makes sense for HDFC on many counts, but what’s the incentive for HDFC Bank?

Merger will entail diversified loan mix and higher capital efficiency for the bankHome loans constitute only 6 per cent of HDFC bank’s loan book as at end-September. The proportion is much higher in case of peer banks. As per the current arrangement, HDFC Bank sources home loans from HDFC for a fee.

Source: Company, data as of end September'20

Source: Company, data as of end September'20

With HDFC Bank incrementally focusing on corporate loans and being cautious on unsecured lending (personal loans and credit cards), the loan book is likely to tilt in favour of corporates.

A potential merger will not only lead to a well-diversified loan mix but will also help meet priority sector requirements. The merged entity’s capital efficiency will be higher as housing loans carry less risk weights as compared to other retail loans. Moreover, HDFC Bank’s growing capital requirements can be met by small stake sales in the group’s other key businesses.

Source: Company, data as of end September'20

Additionally, HDFC has 7.7 million customers and around 2.1 million depositors. A merger will help unify the customer base and also increase cross-sell opportunities for the bank.

Merger can create room for more foreign holdingForeign holding in HDFC Bank is capped at 74 per cent and it has already crossed 71 per cent in November ’20. Due to limited room for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to buy HDFC Bank stock domestically, the bank’s ADR trades at significant premium (over 15%) to its domestic share price.

Foreign shareholding of HDFC stands at around 70 percent of its paid-up share capital and accordingly HDFC’s stake of around 21 per cent in the HDFC bank is deemed as indirect foreign shareholding. A merger can open up the window for FPIs as the foreign holding in a merged entity may fall below the current limit of 74 per cent increasing the room for more buying in the merged entity.

A win-win for bothDespite the synergies on cost and capital front, the merger won’t be a smooth ride. Since only part of HDFC’s loans is towards affordable housing (assuming 40-50 per cent of individual loans), the merged entity will have to allocate funds for CRR and SLR on remaining portfolio. This will adversely impact margins and profits. The merger could also lead to a potential loss of some bancassurance tie-up.

But with benefits outweighing the cost, the merger can be a win-win situation for both entities. The exact benefit to the shareholders of HDFC twins will depend on the swap ratio.

While HDFC twins have already created a lot of shareholder wealth individually, it wouldn’t be over the top to say that the merger of HDFC Bank and HDFC will increase shareholder value manifold.

The country’s largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, has cleared the name of Atanu Chakraborty for the post of new part-time chairperson of the bank and has sent the recommendation to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for its approval. Chakraborty is a former economic affairs secretary of the Government of India and is a veteran IAS officer.

“Chakraborty’s name has been cleared by the Board. Once the RBI approves it, he will take charge as the next chairperson,” said a person in the know requesting anonymity. The tenure of the existing part-time chairperson of the bank, Shyamala Gopinath, will end on January 1, 2021.

HDFC Bank has seen major changes at the top this year. Aditya Puri, the managing director of the bank for the last 26 years, retired in October handing over the baton to Sashidhar Jagdishan for the top job at the bank. Along with this, there have been a series of changes at the top level.

“We wish to inform you that pursuant to the recommendations of the Nomination & Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors of HDFC Bank Ltd (“the Bank”) at its meeting held today, has recommended the appointment of the Part-Time Chairperson of the Bank and has submitted its recommendation to the Reserve Bank of India for approval under Section 35B of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. Further disclosure in this regard will be made after receipt of communication from the Reserve Bank of India,” HDFC Bank informed the stock exchanges on December 28.

Till the time the new chairperson is appointed, the board of directors of the bank shall, pursuant to Section 104 of the Companies Act, 2013, elect amongst themselves an independent director to chair the meetings of the board and relevant committees, the bank said.

Chakraborty is a 1985 batch IAS officer from the Gujarat cadre. He has a post-graduate diploma in business finance and an MBA from the UK.

Chakraborty served as the managing director and executive director of Gujarat State Petronet Limited from November 6, 2014, to April 11, 2016. He served in the districts of Vadodara and Sabarkantha, and was collector of Amreli.

Chakraborty has a wide experience of over 22 years working in various state as well as central government departments including revenue, finance, home, water resources and education departments and public sector undertakings.",398,

With just about three weeks left to register properties before the deadline for the recent stamp duty cut in Maharashtra expires, Vinod Jatia, a well-known businessman from Mumbai, has bought a premium apartment worth Rs 27.7 crore located in Peninsula Carmichael Residences, Mumbai, local brokers said.

The project, by KBK Group and Peninsula Land, is located in Tardeo. The property is a 4BHK unit measuring 3,080 sq ft.

The apartment located on the 13th floor was registered on November 24, local brokers said. It has four parking lots.

The property attracted a stamp duty of Rs 55.4 lakh, the brokers said.

Registration data accessed by Zapkey.com indicates that the unit was bought for Rs 27.7 crore.

The project has a total of 28 apartments with one unit located on each floor, the brokers said.

While the capital value of these apartments is around Rs 90,000 per sq ft, rental values are around Rs 6.5 lakh per month, local brokers told Moneycontrol.

The Jatias are a well-known business family from Mumbai. Vinod Subhkaran Jatia is the managing director of Makalu Trading Pvt Ltd. He is also on the boards of Helmet Traders Ltd. and Insco Steels Ltd.

In the past, Jatia has been chairman and managing director at Supreme Holdings & Hospitality (India) Ltd.

Jatia could not be contacted for the story.

Of late, homebuyers, including uber luxury property buyers, have been rushing to register their properties before December 31 to save money by availing the stamp duty cut in Maharashtra.

On December 4, Moneycontrol reported that former HDFC Bank boss Aditya Puri’s family purchased a Rs 50-crore property in Mumbai.

On December 6, it reported that HDFC vice-chairman and CEO Keki Mistry has bought an ultra-luxury apartment in Mumbai worth Rs 41.23 crore.

After the stamp duty cut announced by the state government in August, the stamp duty collection in September alone stood at Rs 900 crore in Mumbai, of which 40 percent came from luxury transactions.

Local brokers said most of these properties were bought during the under-construction stage and are being registered now. “The savings in terms of stamp duty cut as well as the saving on GST (which is 5 percent since the project has received an occupation certificate) is around 8 to 10 percent,” one of the brokers said.

In order to boost the stagnant real-estate market hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Maharashtra government on August 26 decided to temporarily reduce stamp duty on housing units from 5 percent to 2 percent until December 31, 2020.

Shares of HDFC Bank fell 2 percent and traded among the top losers of the 30-share pack Sensex in morning trade on BSE on December 7.

Shares of the lender fell after global rating agency Moody’s said that multiple digital outages reported by HDFC Bank are credit negative.

The regulators' action is in response to weaknesses in HDFC Bank's digital infrastructure and operational resilience and is credit negative because the bank is increasingly relying on digital channels to source and service its customers, Moody’s said.

Sameet Chavan, Chief Technical & Derivatives Analyst at Angel Broking, said the longer-term view on HDFC Bank remains bullish but on a smaller timeframe chart, there are some signs of exhaustion, which may also be interpreted as a profit-booking after a gigantic rally.

""During the latter half of the week, the stock prices started sulking a bit after some unfavorable news flow. This is getting reflected in the stock price as we can witness a slightly bigger bearish candle on the weekly chart. In fact, on the daily timeframe, it's challenging the key 20-day EMA placed at Rs 1,380 – 1,370. The moment we see this stock sliding below Rs 1,370, we may see extended profit-booking in this stock,"" Chavan said.

The high-end realty market in Maximum City seems to be getting back on track with uber luxury homebuyers coming forward to register their properties this festive season. In fact, quite a few properties in the range of Rs 35 crore-Rs 55 crore have been registered in Mumbai after the state government decided to reduce stamp duty.

On November 25, former HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri's daughter Amrita Puri and wife Anita Puri jointly bought an uber luxury sea-facing unit in Mumbai’s Malabar Hill area for Rs 50 crore.

Actress Amrita Puri made her film debut with the ensemble romantic comedy-drama Aisha (2010).

Aditya Puri is now a senior advisor at The Carlyle Group.

The unit, located in Lodha Seamont on Malabar Hill, near Raj Bhawan in Walkeshwar, is on the 19th floor and comes with seven car parking spaces.

Registration data accessed by Zapkey.com indicates that the unit was bought for Rs 50 crore and stamp duty worth Rs 1 crore was paid on the same.

The unit is located in a 22-storey building overlooking Raj Bhavan, the state governor's official residence. The development offers a limited selection of 3- and 4-bed residences and the homes afford stunning views of the Queen’s Necklace (Marine Drive) and the Arabian Sea.

An email query sent to the Lodha Group remained unanswered.

Local brokers told Moneycontrol that the size of the ‘jodi’ apartment bought by the Puris is likely to be around 3,800 to 4000 sq ft.

Homebuyers, including uber luxury property buyers, are rushing to register their properties before December 31 to save money by availing the stamp duty cut.

“A reduction of 1 percent to 2 percent is a big amount for high-value apartments,” says Ritesh Mehta, Senior Director & Head – West India, Residential Services, JLL India.

A day after falling 2 percent, shares of HDFC Bank climbed 0.59 percent to close at Rs 1,385.15 on BSE on December 4 after the private lender said it was working on a war footing to strengthen its IT infrastructure.

With this, the stock snapped its losing run of the last three consecutive sessions.

After the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) halted the launch of all-new digital products of HDFC Bank, its newly inducted CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan on December 3 said the bank would comply with the central bank's regulations and will wait for clearance before launching new products.

The notice to the bank spooked investors. However, the counter started to see traction after brokerages kept faith in the stock.

Brokerage firm CLSA maintained a ""buy"" call on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 1,700.

CLSA, as per CNBC-TV18, said that RBI got tough on system outages and while the business impact was manageable, a long-term fix was important.

""If restrictions stay for over three-six months, then there could be some impact in FY22,"" CLSA said.

CLSA underscored that banks like ICICI and SBI, too, faced outages but these were less severe.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services also maintained a ""buy"" call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,500.

""HDFC Bank indicated that the RBI order will not have an impact on its existing credit cards business and operations of the bank. However, this order could likely delay the launch of the digital auto loan financing portal, which the management has guided for during 2QFY21,"" Motilal Oswal said.

The timeline of lifting the orders would be a key monitorable and ""we remain watchful on future developments in this regard"", it said. ""At the current juncture, we do not see any meaningful risk to our estimates and continue to maintain our buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,500 (3.3 times Sep’22E ABV),"" Motilal Oswal added.

Edelweiss Securities also maintained a buy call with a target price of Rs 1,490 and said the stock continued to be among its top two sectoral picks.

""We continue to put a premium on resilience, which is what HDFC Bank offers—a strong balance sheet and likely higher residual capital than most,"" Edelweiss Securities said.

""This higher residual capital ensures that its best-in-class franchise can support an adequately large balance sheet after this crisis and fulfill its earnings potential. In terms of the gap between reported net worth and ‘true residual equity’, the bank is in the top quartile in our coverage universe,"" the brokerage firm said.

Brokerage firm JM Financial also maintained a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,440.

""We believe that RBI is indicating a non-tolerant stance towards technological lapses in the banking infrastructure. Given HDFC Bank’s dominant status in payments/credit cards and its strong commitment to tech-enabled growth, this development comes as a negative surprise,"" JM Financial said.

The brokerage firm added that it continues to believe HDFC Bank should be able to resolve the issues and assuage the regulatory concerns satisfactorily over the medium term.

Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities pointed out that after a sharp uptrend rally from Rs 1,150 to Rs 1,320, the stock is now consolidating near its all-time high level.

""The momentum indicators indicate that the stock is in an overbought zone and there are high chances of a short-term correction if it starts trading below the Rs 1,440 resistance level,"" Chouhan said.

However, Chouhan added that on the daily as well as weekly charts, the stock is still in a strong uptrend, so any meaningful correction should be the opportunity for the investor to add long positions near important support levels.

""For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,440 should act as a key resistance level. If it trades below the same, then the correction could take the stocks towards Rs 1,350-1,340. On the flip side, Rs 1,440 would be the immediate hurdle for the bulls, and if trades consistently above the same, then the trend could well take the stock towards Rs 1,525,"" said Chouhan.

The S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty hit fresh record highs on December 3 but witnessed profit-taking towards the close of the trade.

Let’s look at the final tally on D-Street – the S&P BSE Sensex rose 14 points to 44,632 while the Nifty50 closed with marginal gains of 20 points to 13,133.

Sectorally, the action was seen in the public sector, metals, oil & gas, power, and auto stocks while profit-taking was visible in IT, Finance, and Banks.

On the broader markets front – the S&P BSE Midcap index rose 0.8 percent while the S&P BSE Smallcap index was up 0.68 percent – outperforming benchmark indices.

Stocks which were in focus on Thursday include Tata Chemicals which rose more than 6 percent, Maruti Suzuki that rallied more than 7 percent and HDFC Bank which fell more than 2 percent.

We have collated views of experts on what investors should do when the market resumes trading on 3 December:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities

Tata Chemical: 425 should be the trend decider level

On December 3, the stock made a fresh all-time high of Rs 464.85. In this quarter so far, it has rallied over 50 percent and the important point is that the stock not only surpassed its previous 52-week high of Rs 342.30 but comfortably managed to sustain above the same.

The sharp uptrend rally surprised most traders as well as investors. On daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a breakout continuation pattern, which is grossly positive for Tata Chemicals.

However, on the short-term time frame, the momentum indicators suggest that the stock is in an overbought zone and there are high chances of a quick short-term price correction if the stock trade below Rs 424.

For the next few trading session, Rs 425 should be the trend decider level for the bulls. And if it sustains, we can expect a continuation of the uptrend towards Rs 505. On the flip side, a close below Rs 425 could possibly trigger short-term correction up to Rs 390.

Maruti Suzuki: Stay put for a target above Rs 8000

The stock has rallied over 7 percent on December 3. It opened with a gap on the upside and quickly surpassed the Rs 7350 important resistance mark with strong volume activity.

Despite tepid market conditions, Maruti maintained strong momentum throughout the day. On the short-term time frame, the stock has formed a strong price volume breakout pattern.

The texture of the pattern suggests that breakout action will continue in the near-term if the stock succeeds to trade above the Rs 7350 level.

For the swing traders, Rs 7350 should be the sacrosanct level, trading above the same we can expect an uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 8450.

HDFC Bank: Rs 1440 should act as a key resistance level to watch

After a sharp uptrend rally from Rs 1150 to Rs 1320, the stock is now consolidating near its all-time high level. The momentum indicators indicate that the stock is in an overbought zone and there are high chances of a short-term correction if it starts trading below the Rs 1440 resistance level.

However, on the daily as well as weekly charts, the stock is still in a strong uptrend, so any meaningful correction should be the opportunity for the investor to add long positions near important support levels.

For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1440 should act as a key resistance level. If it trades below the same, then the correction could take the stocks towards Rs 1350-1340.

On the flip side, Rs 1440 would be the immediate hurdle for the bulls, and if trades consistently above the same, then the trend could well take the stock towards Rs 1525.

In a stinging note, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked private-sector lender HDFC Bank to stop all “digital business generating activities planned under Digital 2.0”, in a bid to get the bank to first get its overall internet banking system in place.

What is Digital 2.0?

Started in 2018-19, it is part of the bank’s elaborate strategy to transform itself into a bank of the future. As per the bank’s annual report for last year, it wants to embark on the Digital 2.0 journey, standing on four main pillars: one, reimagine customer experience; two, use analytics to power customer interactions and develop new applications; three, empower virtual banking offerings, and, four, bring in innovation to shape up customer preferences.

The bank’s digital journey so far

HDFC Bank has been proactive on the digital front right from the onset. What started with net banking and ATMs has now moved into chatbots, video KYC and many others. As of 2019-20, the bank website received around 55 million visitors per month. Queries handled by the AI chatbot assistant have grown to 23 lakh, as per data shared by the bank.

The bank has onboarded 17 lakh merchants through QR codes, mobile PoS terminals and others. The bank has also helped the government in digitising large projects like the Pune Metro project and eNAM (electronic agriculture marketing).

Further, in terms of digital payments, HDFC Bank is one of the leading payment processors, along with SBI, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank. In terms of UPI transactions, the bank has processed 179 million transactions in October alone, just after SBI and Axis.

Video KYC and other changes

On its way forward, the bank had made elaborate plans to use technology in multiple aspects of banking to make the customer journey and the bank’s understanding of its customers better.

The bank has brought in a video KYC journey for its customers so that they can open and fund their accounts completely remotely. This has assumed significance at a time when the pandemic has driven people to the confines of their homes.

Further, the bank is also digitising its internal processes, so that applying for a loan from a branch and any online platform takes the same amount of time. The bank is also keen on doubling down on its analytics capabilities so that they can cross-sell to their customers better and process pre-approved loans faster.

The bank has also been strengthening its digital assets in order to serve its customers better. It has two products here, Smartbuy and PayZapp. Through Smartbuy, the bank encourages its customers to buy from online platforms which have partnered with the bank.

This helps HDFC Bank keep track of where its users are spending and what they are consuming.

Secondly, the bank is also on a journey to build up API integrations with third-party service providers to ensure that multiple banking activities, which might originate from those platforms will be settled through the bank itself.

Further, the bank has plans to offer real-time loans to ‘new to credit’ customers. These are customers who have never taken a loan from a formal channel previously.

As part of the overall customer journey, the bank is on the path of digitising the entire journey, right from video KYC for customer onboarding up to using virtual bots to service them as well.

RBI diktat

Now, the bank will have to halt all new product and innovation launches which were planned for this year as part of its Digital 2.0 initiative.

In a statement to customers, Sashidhar Jagdishan, chief executive officer of the bank, said that they are working with technology experts and the regulator to strengthen the systems and ensure such outages do not happen in the future.

Further, the bank has also been asked to stop onboarding new credit card customers, which means till things become normal, other credit card players like SBI Cards and others have headroom to grow aggressively during this period.

As per numbers shared by the bank, as of 2019-20, there are 1.45 crore credit cards issued by HDFC Bank. Overall, there are around 5.8 crore credit cards issued in the country.

Industry insiders also pointed out that going forward, the API journey for the bank could be under higher scrutiny, where partnerships will be well-thought-out before execution.

As the bank mentioned in its annual report how it is relying on partnerships to ensure that its products can be accessed and used outside the HDFC Bank environment, across popular e-commerce portals as well.

Now, going forward, the bank will have to first strengthen its internal systems before engaging with other platforms, industry sources said.",779,0.705956868827343

After the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) temporarily stopped launch of all new digital products of HDFC Bank, its new CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan on December 3 said the bank will comply with the RBI regulations and will wait for the regulator’s clearance before launching new products.

“We had two outages, one in November 2018 and second in December 2019. We have taken help of external expertise, understood what needs to be done further and have substantially implemented the inputs to strengthen our IT infrastructure and systems,” Jagdishan said in a letter to customers.

“Unexpectedly another incident happened on November 21,2020, and the primary reason for the same is the power outage in our primary data centre. We are working on war footing to strengthen this area also now,” Jagdishan said.

Jagdishan assured customers that there is no reason to worry. “You can continue to transact with the bank without any concern,” he said.

Jagdishan apologised for the digital outage to customers. “We realize that as our valued customer, you expect us to maintain a very high standard of service quality and experience. And sometimes, we have not been able to live up to your expectations. For that, please accept our sincere apologies,” the CEO said in the letter.

The RBI asked HDFC Bank to temporarily halt sourcing new credit cards and stop the launch of its digital business-generating activities planned under Digital 2.0 and other proposed business generating IT applications.

The RBI issued the order dated December 2, 2020, to HDFC Bank.

The central bank on November 23 had sought an explanation from HDFC Bank after its digital services faced disruptions on the evening of November 21 till November 22 morning - for over 12 hours.

The order also states that HDFC Bank’s board must examine the lapses and fix accountability.

“The above measures shall be considered for lifting (the restrictions) upon satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations as identified by the RBI,” it added.

New launches after RBI’s clearance

Jagdishan said the bank will now launch its digital initiatives after getting the RBI’s approvals.

“Some of our strategic digital initiatives to improve the front-end digital experience, improve digital origination, straight through processing, next generation of mobile and internet banking, API-based banking on the edge etc would now be readied and launched post the approval and clearance from the regulator,” the CEO said in the letter.

Further, the bank will work with experts and the regulator to fortify the identified areas for improvement. “Internally, we are looking at this as an opportunity to further improve ourselves and emerge stronger,” Jagdishan said.

Banks are under immense pressure because of the competition to come up with new digital banking products, often without proper testing and leading to such failures, said senior bankers. “There is intense competition from industry and new players such as payments banks to keep introducing new products. In their anxiety to remain at the top, banks often come with digital banking products that are not fully tested. Banks need to be careful to make sure they have enough technology capabilities to back such products,” said Naresh Malhotra, a senior banking consultant.

To be fair, technical glitches aren’t limited to HDFC Bank alone. Other banks too have been facing problems on the technical side, with the latest instance reported on State Bank of India’s (SBI's) mobile banking application, YONO, in the last two days with customers complaining on Twitter that they are unable to login to the application following an error. This issue has not been resolved yet.

In October, some of the customers of another leading private lender, ICICI Bank too took to social media complaining of issues with the bank’s online payment systems and mobile app.",638,-0.011582061648368835

The murmurs around HDFC Bank facing stress on its digital banking channels came out to the fore when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) slapped a notice on the bank, asking it to stop acquiring new credit card customers and putting on hold all digital business generating activities.

Further, the order stated that only when the bank complies with the RBI’s critical observations in this regard will it be allowed to resume business.

Moneycontrol spoke with bankers and tech experts in the financial services world to find out what causes these outages and what should banks of the scale of HDFC Bank do in order to ensure a smooth digital banking experience.

What led to the RBI action?

HDFC Bank has been in the news for its digital banking failures for quite some time now. Back in 2018, its new mobile banking app failed. In 2019, RBI officials carried out an inspection of the bank after reports came out around its net banking systems facing outage.

This year, on November 21, the bank faced a power failure in the central data centre, thereby causing all net banking transactions to temporarily halt. Given the size and importance of the bank, and the continuous technical issues, the RBI stepped in, asking it to stop all new launches of its digital businesses.

Why do internet and mobile banking transactions tend to fail in the beginning of every month?

The beginning of the month is when the maximum number of banking transactions are recorded. That is when consumers need to settle bills, make payments, pay EMIs, take out cash and so much more. Banks also process pension payments, a bulk of which happen in the first few days of the month. Remember the queues outside government bank branches in the first week every month?

Now that has moved onto digital channels.

Just like branches becoming overcrowded and tempers flying around between cashiers and customers in queue, a similar breakdown is being noticed in the online banking channels nowadays.

On December 1 and 2, around 14 crore UPI transactions were processed, 2 crore NEFT and 1.2 crore IMPS transactions were recorded. This shows the volumes which banks process in the beginning of every month.

That has always been the case. Why did they aggravate over the last few months?

You can blame COVID for this. The pandemic has pushed up digitisation across multiple channels as consumers are scared of a bank branch. Just as an example, UPI payments jumped to 2.2 billion in October from 1.3 billion in May, an 83 percent jump in less than six months. Such a massive jump in digital banking channels was not expected by most lenders. Hence, many are facing trouble.

For HDFC Bank, the problem seems to have become very acute.

To go a little more technical, every server has a load-balancing technique, which distributes work between multiple servers and ensures that excess load on one does not cause it to trip. Hypothetically, if a bank made provisions for 100 transactions on a normal day, it will ensure that even 1,000 transactions on a few days will still be supported. But then, if this number shoots up to 10,000, problems occur.

“This is what has happened with the current banking ecosystem. The top banks have so many digital channels that they are not being able to manage the load. There is a need for a complete overhaul,” said S Sundararajan, executive director at i-exceed, a Bengaluru-based technology company.

Also, when a primary data centre fails, the secondary and disaster recovery site needs to kick in. But to ensure that the transition happens smoothly, systems need to function well. Sources indicate in case of the power failure in the primary data centre, for HDFC Bank, the transition to the next site might not have happened smoothly.

So banks are not investing enough to scale up their systems. Why is it so?

This is the million-dollar question. The latest RBI directive to HDFC Bank is a shove to get its systems in place before acquiring fresh customers through its digital channels.

But bankers point out that bringing in modifications and changes to the core banking system is not easy. Take for instance, the case of HDFC Bank trying to launch a new mobile banking app. It did not work and they had to get their customers back to the old app. It took months for the bank to balance out between the new app and the old app and finally migrate the customer base.

Secondly, making these modifications takes time. The jump in digital banking channels has been faster than the speed at which banks could scale up their systems. While sources say that banks are serious about their digital channels and are trying to ramp up capacity, it will take a few months to manage the load.

Third is the cost. Scaling up server capacities is not cheap but there is hardly any money to be made from digital channels. Last year, the government made UPI and RuPay transactions free of cost. Now, for a banker justifying massive investments to support UPI transactions at a time when there is no revenue from core payments becomes very difficult.

Fourth is the challenge to tinker with the core banking system, which is already handling a few million transactions every day. As one banker put it, it is like an ‘open heart surgery’. There are massive risks involved in starting everything fresh and can cause even bigger damage to the technical structures.

But banks are entering into partnerships with all types of startups…

This is where bankers are in a tough spot. Imagine closing doors to fintech partnerships. That will mean loss of business opportunities and also loss to the brand value. Also, partnering with many fintechs would mean transactions flowing in from multiple doors, be it payments, lending, investments and so many others. All these service requests get processed by fintechs but the ultimate settlement happens at the banks’ Core Banking Solution (CBS).

So the CBS needs to be as robust to be able to support this incoming load. Ideally, banks will need to strike a fine balance between how many partnerships are valuable and how many are viable.",1066,-0.9526544749736786

Kapil Wadhawan, promoter of crisis-ridden mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL), has moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking participation in the committee of creditors' (CoC) meeting to be part of the discussions for finding a bidder.

Wadhawan has filed a petition in the Mumbai NCLT against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-appointed administrator in the matter.

Wadhawan has also requested access to data on DHFL's assets.

So far, there is no clarity on the bidding process for the troubled lender which was caught in a series of alleged financial irregularities.

Lenders to DHFL are likely to call for another round of bids, seeking higher value for its assets.

The bidders to DHFL include Adani Group, Piramal Enterprises, US-based Oaktree, and Hong Kong-based SC Lowy.

SC Lowy had submitted 10-70 percent higher price for either a stake in the company or buying out some of its assets.

Oaktree Capital has raised its bid price for the entire portfolio to Rs 33,000 crore from Rs 27,800 crore earlier.

There is a possibility that lenders may seek fresh bids seeking higher value.

Earlier, in a letter to administrator on November 11, Wadhawan had requested the RBI-appointed administrator to allow him to participate in the next meeting of the CoC so that he could “put forth some of these thoughts to the CoC on the video conference to constructively aid in the resolution process of DHFL”.

“I’m presently handicapped as I have no access to the records of the company to ascertain the present position, and I’m constrained to rely on the newspaper reports as well as my knowledge and experience of having run the business for more than 15 years,” Wadhawan said.

If given access to the records, he can make a proposal setting out the necessary upfront and deferred payment components, which will provide maximum value realization for all stakeholders, Wadhawan said.

DHFL is the first financial services company which has been sent to the NCLT under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC).

In his letter, Wadhawan repeated his offer to pay up the entire principal amount to all creditors without any haircut, besides letting all creditors convert part of their debt to equity.

“Even today, I am willing to stand by the principle of 100 percent repayment of principal amounts to all the creditors without any hair cut as I do believe, from DHFL’s business, that such recovery is possible,” Wadhawan said in the letter.

DHFL is facing claims of Rs 87,031 crore from financial creditors.

Its large lenders include State Bank of India (including SBI Singapore) with Rs 10,083 crore exposure, Bank of India Rs 4,125 crore, Canara Bank Rs 2,681 crore, NHB Rs 2,434 crore, Union Bank of India Rs 2,378 crore, Syndicate Bank Rs 2,229 crore, and Bank of Baroda Rs 2,075 crore, Indian Bank Rs 1,552 crore, Central Bank Rs 1,389 crore, IDBI Bank Rs 999 crore, and HDFC Bank Rs 361 crore.

DHFL posted a net loss of Rs 2,122.65 crore in the quarter ended September, 2020, as compared with a net loss of Rs 6,640.62 crore in the corresponding quarter in the previous year.

It had posted a profit of Rs 70 crore in the first quarter.

Total assets of the company stand at Rs 83,638 crore as of September-end, compared with Rs 85,926.95 crore in the March quarter. Total liabilities stood at Rs 91,250.13 crore in the September quarter as against Rs 91,326.19 crore in the preceding quarter, the company informed exchanges on November 26.

A day after gaining 3 percent, HDFC Bank shares looked set to extend the gains into the second session as the stock rose about 2 percent in the morning trade to hit a record high of Rs 1,464 on BSE on November 25.

The zooming share price saw the private lender's market-capitalisation cross the Rs 8-lakh-crore-mark for the first time, making it the country's third-largest company in terms of m-cap after Reliance Industries and TCS.

Global brokerage firm CLSA has maintained a ""buy"" call on the stock and raised the target from Rs 1,525 to Rs 1,700.

CLSA said the macro-environment had improved after the lockdown and a better use of data analytics was leading to lower retail stress against PAT cycles.

In the medium-term, OPEX efficiency had room for improvement and the private bank remained among its top picks, the brokerage said.

Besides, the recommendations of the Reserve Bank of India's internal working group, announced days ago, are largely related to ownership guidelines and corporate structure of Indian private sector banks. And if these recommendations get implemented, then experts believe the market share of private banks could increase significantly in the coming years.

India's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank's entire payment stack went down on November 21, scores of customers said on Twitter.

Customers said transactions through HDFC's credit/debit cards, internet banking, UPI, IMPS, and other modes of payment were failing, due to which they could not proceed with their banking-related services.

The bank on November 22, however, informed that it had restored the services and said an unexpected outage at one of its data centres led to the transaction failures.

""Dear Customers, the services impacted following the outage have been restored. While you may face intermittent issues as the system stabilizes there is no reason to worry now! Our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused. Thank you for bearing with us during this period,"" HDFC said in its tweet on Sunday.

HDFC Bank revises interest rates for fixed deposit

An HDFC Bank official, who didnt want to be named, told Moneycontrol that ""yesterday's technical glitch was due to a power outage in DAKC data centre, which has several banks as clients.""

Similar incident took place in December 2019, with customers complaining that they were unable to pay their loan EMIs or settle credit card bills on time. Following this, RBI deputy governor MK Jain had said the regulator had taken into account the outage and deployed a team of experts to investigate into the matter.

Later, it was found out that the December outage took place because the lender ""underestimated"" growth in payment volumes and the disruption was more of a capacity issue.

Private sector lender HDFC Bank has named Ramesh Lakshminarayanan as its new group head of information technology and chief information officer (CIO). Laskhminarayanan will be responsible for heading the bank’s technological transformation and his role will cut across different verticals of the bank, the bank said in a statement.

Lakshminarayanan’s appointment comes about four months after the resignation of former CIO Munish Mittal and is the first major top level change after new CEO Sasidhar Jagdishan took charge in October. Mittal resigned saying he wants to pursue higher studies abroad. He was with the bank since 1996.

There have been several senior-level exits from the bank in the last three years. At least 18 executives have exited HDFC Bank since FY17. Many of them had been with the bank for over a decade and were part of the private lender’s unparallelled growth story. These include Group heads like Munish Mittal, Ashok Khanna, Abhay Aima, Nitin Chaugh and Rajesh Kumar Rathanchand, all of whom spent 18-25 years in the bank.

HDFC Bank has always been favourite among investors. Recently, there has been a change at the biggest private sector bank by market-cap. Aditya Puri retired as MD & CEO of the bank on October 26 after a 25-year journey.

Sashidhar Jagdishan has taken over Puri at the bank.

Today, the bank is valued at Rs 6.7 lakh crore in terms market capitalisation, which was just Rs 440 crore in 1995.

The country's largest private sector lender achieved Rs 10,000 crore in market-cap in 2003, Rs 1 lakh crore in 2010, Rs 2 lakh crore milestone in 2014, Rs 3 lakh crore in 2016, Rs 4 lakh crore in 2017, Rs 5 lakh crore in 2018, and Rs 6 & 7 lakh crore in 2019.

Aditya Puri created strong structure and system for HDFC Bank, which has not failed even in times of crises. The bank increased its deposit share to 7 percent now with over Rs 13 lakh crore of asset size given the trust created among depositors.

The stock has given 303-fold return in Puri's tenure.

Experts feel HDFC Bank can join the Rs 10-lakh-crore club, in terms of market capitalisation, during the tenure of Sashidhar Jagdishan, who took over as the MD & CEO of the bank with effect from October 27. Oil-telecom-to-retail major Reliance Industries and India's largest IT company TCS are the only two firms that have crossed Rs 10 lakh crore in market-cap.

""Aditya Puri and his team have built a very strong fort and this is the reflection of years of continuous efforts and dedication. As Sashi is with bank since 1996, he will run the existing business process well and improve also, hence we believe HDFC Bank market cap would cross Rs 10 lakh crore under his tenure,"" Jaikishan Parmar, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

Fund managers owned more than Rs 78,000 crore worth of holding in HDFC Bank and that is largely due to bank's strong liability franchisee, deepening presence in digital banking, continuous decline cost to income ratio and target of 35 percent in 3 to 5 years, historical return on equity (RoE) greater than 15 percent, bank has a provision that is higher than regulatory required which provides comfort against any asset quality shock.

""Being a high weightage stock in most benchmark indices and being the highest weight stock in the highest weight financial sector along with outperforming the peers in terms of Balance sheet structure and Profitability, HDFC bank has been the favourite essential of most mutual fund schemes.

Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors feels that with the recent move towards tapping the rural & semi urban market, HDFC Bank can consistently increase its market share further and can still double the balance sheet over the next 5-6 years.

His predecessor, Aditya Puri, who retired on October 26, leaves behind an impressive legacy, of having built the country’s largest private bank.

Puri, who took over as MD in September 1994, oversaw the bank’s listing on the Bombay Stock Exchange on May 19, 1995. On his watch, HDFC Bank crossed the market capitalisation of Rs 7 lakh crore. The stock has given a return of more than 30,000 percent—jumping from Rs 3 levels in 1995 to Rs 1,200 in 2020.

Today, HDFC Bank has the second-highest weightage in the Nifty50 and highest in the financial sector. The stock is also held by most mutual funds as well as FIIs, given its strong fundamentals and balance-sheet structure.

""Being a high-weightage stock in most benchmark indices and being the highest weight stock in the highest weight financial sector along with outperforming the peers in terms of balance-sheet structure and profitability, HDFC bank has been the favourite of most mutual fund schemes,"" Vineta Sharma, Head of Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors told Moneycontrol.

Of these, top 16 schemes, including from SBI, ICICI Prudential, UTI MF, Axis, Kotak, HDFC, Aditya and Mirae AMCs, hold 47 percent or nearly 30 crore shares from among total mutual funds' shareholding.

""Mutual funds are buying purely based on fundamentals and it is one of the best companies to have from the large company universe. Mutual funds prefer a company with stability and predictability, which the HDFC group provides,"" Jaikishan Parmar, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

Puri and his team built a very strong fort and it is the outcome of years of effort and dedication, Parmar said, adding Jagdishan has been with the bank since 1996 and knows the business processes well and will only improve them.

SBI ETF Nifty 50 tops the list among mutual funds schemes, holding 6.71 crore shares of HDFC Bank followed by SBI ETF Sensex with 2.97 crore shares and SBI Bluechip Fund 1.94 crore shares.

""Fund managers like HDFC Bank owing to (a) strong liability franchisee, (b) deepening presence in digital banking, (3) continuous decline cost to income ratio and target of 35 percent in 3 to 5 years, D) historical return on equity (RoE) greater than 15 percent, e) the bank has a provision that is higher than regulatory required which provides comfort against any asset quality shock,"" said Parmar.

HDFC Bank has consistently maintained its strong financial performance with stable asset quality, which helped it during crises also. It also reflected in its numbers. The stock has rallied 303-fold from the year 1995.

""Consistently performing better than peers in terms of growth and quality has earned HDFC Bank high valuation multiples by the market. We feel that the company, with its recent move towards tapping the rural and semi-urban market, can increase its market share further,"" Sharma said.

HDFC Bank's deposit share is 7 vis a vis SBI, which is 23 percent and with consistent efforts to tap the rural–semi urban opportunity, HDFC Bank balance sheet can double over the next six years, she said.

Puri took over as the Managing Director in September 1994 and his tenure at HDFC Bank has been illustrious.

Puri was instrumental in building the bank into India's largest private lender. Under his leadership, HDFC Bank held on its own through various crises and intense competition from rivals. The bank has been consistently delivering on growth and rewarded investors.

HDFC Bank was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange on May 19, 1995 and since then the bank's assets have grown from Rs 3,394 crore to over Rs 16 lakh crore.

HDFC Bank blazed a trail during Puri's tenure, here are Top 5 milestones:

The stock's journey

On October 16, 2006, the stock hit the Rs 100-mark for the first time, data available with Ace Equity showed. It took another nine years to get to the Rs 500-mark, on January 16, 2015.

Thereafter, it took only three years for the stock to hit the Rs 1,000-mark. On January 31, 2018, the stock hit the Rs 1,000-mark for the first time.

Also read: HDFC Bank gave 303-fold return during Puri's tenure, will the good run continue under Jagdishan?

Market cap

As per Ace Equity data, on May 29, 1995, HDFC Bank's market capitalisation was Rs 431.75 crore on BSE. On March 1, 1997, it touched Rs 1,055 crore.

On July 6, 2005, the m-cap stood at Rs 20,130 crore. Two years later, on September 27, 2007, it rose to Rs 50,660.26 crore.

On August 18, 2010, the m-cap touched Rs 1 lakh crore for the first time. After eight years, on January 18, 2018, the bank hit the Rs 5-lakh-crore-mark and on November 21, 2019, it jumped to Rs 7 lakh crore.

As of October 26 close, the m-cap of HDFC Bank on BSE was Rs 6.68 lakh crore.

Stock-split

As per the data available with Moneycontrol, HDFC Bank has split the face value of its shares twice—in 2011 and in 2019.

HDFC Bank last split the face value of its shares from Rs 2 to Rs 1 in 2019. The share has been quoting on an ex-split basis from September 19, 2019.

A stock split means the division of a company's shares into multiple new shares. A company may decide to split its shares to boost liquidity and to make it affordable for investors who are not able to buy it due to high prices. After the stock split, the number of outstanding shares increases, the market capitalisation of the stock remains the same as pre-split. While the number of shares increases, prices per share decreases.

Outperformed Sensex in return CAGR

As per Ace equity data and adjusting the inception value of HDFC Bank's stock at Rs 4, during Puri's 25-year period, the stock's return CAGR is 26 percent against the 11 percent CAGR of Sensex.

Latest shareholding pattern

As per the BSE filing on October 9, the bank's promoter and promoter group held a 26.02 percent stake in HDFC Bank while public shareholding was at 73.98 percent at the end of the September quarter of FY21.

Among the public shareholders, mutual funds held a 13.95 percent stake while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) held a 37.43 percent stake in the company.

LIC held a 3.79 percent stake in HDFC Bank at the end of the September quarter.

Puri's departure marks the end of an era for the bank. Analysts are of the view that Puri is handing over the charge to Sashidhar Jagdishan on a strong note. However, there are challenges too. The biggest one perhaps is ensuring that it does not lose the edge over competition in a tough market scenario.

Aditya Puri's astute leadership defined HDFC Bank in the last 25 years and it reflected in the share price that made several investors millionaires and continues to be a favourite pick.

From Rs 4 in 1995, the stock jumped to Rs 1,213 on October 26 (the adjusted price for all relevant corporate actions happened so far), the day MD & CEO Puri retired from HDFC Bank.

From October 27, Sashidhar Jagdishan takes over as the MD and CEO of the bank and the question everyone is asking is will the good run continue?.

The stock saw a 303-fold increase during Puri's 25 years with HDFC emerging as the largest private sector lender in the country by market capitalisation, total loan book and interest income. It not only emerged on top of the heap but also widened the gap with the closest rival ICICI Bank.

The increase in the share price has been incredible even higher than that of the country's biggest bank, State Bank of India (SBI), which grew more than 12-fold in the same period.

HDFC's market cap of Rs 6.67 lakh crore is double that of ICICI Bank and even higher than that of ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank put together. In fact, it also beats State Bank of India, which has assets more than double—2.5 times—those of HDFC Bank.

The performance, standards and structure made for HDFC Bank by Puri also helped the lender get the highest weightage in the financial sector and the second-highest in the Nifty50.

Asset management companies through mutual funds schemes held more than Rs 78,000 crore worth of shares in HDFC Bank, while foreign portfolio investors held over 37 percent equity stake in the bank.

Experts are upbeat on Jagdishan as well. The say the bank will continue on its growth path and it will reflect in stock price too, as Jagdishan is an insider and well aware of the bank's structure. He has been with HDFC Bank since 1996 and has played an integral role in shaping the bank.

During Puri's tenure, the bank set high standards for processes, built consistent growth and an impressive track-record on asset quality.

""The appointment of Sashi as MD has two benefits (a) He has been with the bank since 1996, joined as manager in finance function, and reached to MD level. So, Sashi is well aware of the HDFC bank process and working style, which will help him to run bank in a smooth manner. (B) The current top management working style will match with him,"" Jaikishan Parmar, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

Jagdishan's experience, strong balance sheet and excess provisioning coverage will continue to support growth for the bank, he said.

Started in 1994, the bank is now the largest private sector lender with an assets base of over Rs 13 lakh crore. With most lenders exposed to the troubled NBFC and real estate segment, HDFC Bank has managed its assets very well keeping the NPA contained and yet increase its market share.

Vineta Sharma, Head of Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors, feels that there is still enough room for the company to grow.

""The total deposit market share is around Rs 126 lakh crore out of which rural and semi-urban is around Rs 35 lakh crore and the private banks share is mere Rs 5 lakh crore. This leaves enough room for private banks, especially with good pedigree, to improve their market share,"" she said.

To tap this rural opportunity, the bank is running sustainable livelihood initiatives, wherein it is creating VLE centers with tie-ups with various organisations. The bank will use this network to offer retail products and services to the citizens across the country, she said.

HDFC Bank has a strong liability franchisee, deepening presence in digital banking, has been showing continuous decline in cost to income ratio with a target of 35 percent in three to five years, has return on equity (RoE) greater than 15 percent and has a provision that is higher than regulatory required which provides comfort against any asset quality shock.

For investors, it is very important to understand Jagdishan's thought process, his priorities for the next few years as well as for the long term, Jaikishan Parmar said.

Aditya Puri’s exit from HDFC Bank after serving 26 years as Managing Director is certainly a big event in Indian banking. The private-sector lender grew to become a powerhouse under Puri’s watch. Consistent years of growth and performance track-record on the asset quality front made HDFC Bank an outlier in an otherwise messy financial system.

But, when it comes to the question of what next for HDFC Bank, one shouldn't read too much into Puri's exit alone. A behemoth of HDFC Bank’s size and scale isn’t just a CEO’s creation. Puri had a strong team of professionals who helped him achieve the kind of growth the bank has exhibited so far.

Why the exits matter

It is in this context that a series of senior-level exits from the bank in recent years assume significance. Most of these executives were part of the bank’s senior leadership team. According to an Ambit Capital report, since FY17, there have been at least 18 senior-level exits from the bank, including key vertical heads who were with the bank for over a decade.

This means many in the founding team are gone already, and the new MD, Sashidhar Jagdishan, needs to rework the foundation to step to the next level of growth.

These include Group heads like Munish Mittal, Ashok Khanna, Abhay Aima, Nitin Chaugh, Rajesh Kumar Rathanchand, all of whom spent 18-25 years in the bank.

The list also includes Paresh Sukthankar, Deputy Managing Director, who was rumoured to be Puri’s successor at one point, K Manohara Raj (Business Head and Senior SEVP), Neil Percy Francisco (Group Head), Philip Mathew (Group Head), Ravi Narayan (Group Head), Aseem Dhru (Group Head), Govind Pandey (Business Head/SEVP), K Balasubramanian (Group Head), Nitin Subramanya Rao (Group Head), Rajendar Sehgal (Group Head), Deepak Maheshwari (Group Head), Harsh Dugar (Business Head and EVP), Kartik Jain (Business Head and EVP).

With Puri retiring and the new CEO taking charge, more exits cannot be ruled out, Ambit said in a note dated July 21.

Jagdishan era begins

Jagdishan will have to keep the core team intact, analysts say. That process, according to insiders, is already underway. The exercise assumes even greater significance in the face of some recent challenges on the corporate governance front. The bank has been dragged into multiple class action suits by a few US law firms after allegations surfaced on the lack of disclosures and irregularities in its auto loan division.

Allegedly, the bank’s auto loan sales team forced customers of the bank to purchase GPS devices as a precondition to sanction loans. The bank subsequently sacked a few officials following an internal probe. HDFC Bank has denied the allegations saying it intends to defend itself vigorously in the lawsuit. “The bank expects its response to the lawsuit to be due in early 2021,” HDFC Bank said in a statement to exchanges early this year.

These allegations are seen as a worrying factor for HDFC Bank’s investors, among other things. The bank’s stock has taken a beating, falling 2.5 percent so far this year.

A late entry

The uncertainty about who would be taking over after Puri’s exit continued for a good four to five months till the RBI finally cleared the name of Jagdishan, an HDFC Bank veteran, in the first week of August.

Jagdishan is a safe bet for the bank.

Senior banking industry officials, including former colleagues of Puri, think Jagdishan is unlikely to ruffle feathers at the top. Also, being an insider, he can hit the ground running. Shashi, as he is called by colleagues in HDFC Bank, joined the institution in 1996 as a manager in the finance function.

HDFC Bank wasn’t a very well-known name back then. Jagdishan joined the bank after a stint in Deutsche Bank as senior officer in its Country Financial Control Division in Mumbai. His entry into HDFC Bank came two years after outgoing CEO Aditya Puri joined the bank in 1994.

“Maintaining the average 18-20 percent growth rate and keeping the core team intact during the top level management transition will be key for Jagdishan,” said Jaikishan Parmar, an analyst at Angel Broking. “Also, the commentary from the new CEO will be watched closely by markets to understand his priorities,” said Parmar.

Under Puri, HDFC Bank has had a great run. HDFC Bank was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange on May 19, 1995. Between then and now, the market capitalisation of the bank has grown to Rs 6,77,808.6 crore from Rs 440 crore. During this period, total assets have grown to Rs 16 lakh crore from Rs 3,394 crore. Total deposits grew to Rs 12.29 lakh crore in March from Rs 642 crore in March 1995 and total advances swelled to Rs 1,0.38 lakh crore, from Rs 98 crore.

As Puri steps down this month, he goes with an unbreakable record as the longest serving CEO of a private bank. That record is unlikely to be broken since a new rule from the Reserve Bank of India caps the tenure of private bank CEOs .

Asset quality challenges

But beyond reorganising the core team and getting ready for the post-Puri era, the bank has other challenges ahead. Among those, the big one is how to tackle the Covid pandemic.

NPAs are likely to increase going ahead as more loans will likely come under stress . In Q2, the bank’s proforma gross NPA ratio and proforma net NPA ratio would have been 1.37 per cent and 0.35 percent, if one adds the impact of the Supreme Court order that stayed tagging fresh NPAs post August 31. The reported NPAs in Q2, hence, do not reflect the full picture.

The bank has disclosed that loans worth Rs 15,743 crore were put under the moratorium and the benefit was extended (post May) to loans worth around Rs 4,639 crore. How these loans perform going ahead remains to be seen. The bank has guided that there is a likelihood of higher NPAs and resultant provisions ahead, even with a slight improvement in the economic situation. “The slowdown may lead to a rise in the number of customer defaults and consequently an increase in provisions,” said the bank in the Q2 earnings note.

The loan growth in retail has come down to just 5.3 percent, while the domestic wholesale loans grew by an unusually high 26.5 percent in the quarter. Wholesale loans are an easy bet to grow the book quickly but a dangerous gamble during a steep economic downturn.

Still, HDFC Bank is relatively better positioned to withstand the Covid impact compared to many of its peers. The bank has made aggressive provisioning (money set aside to cover likely losses from bad loans) and imposed controls over the quality of fresh disbursals. Even then, the Covid-effect would be hard to predict.

KRChoksey's research report on HDFC Bank

Advances grew 16.8% YoY (+3% QoQ) driven by wholesale loans growing 30% YoY. Deposit grew 20.3% YoY (3.4% QoQ) with CASA improving to 41.4%, higher by 190 bps. The C-D ratio fell 950 bps QoQ to 84.5%. The bank maintains its strategy to continue to scale its deposit franchise despite higher liquidity. NIMs were lower by 20 bps QoQ to 4.1% driven by the higher share of wholesale book and liquidity. The bank’s GNPA were lower by 30bps to 1.1% on account of standstill levied by the SC. Ex the same would have been 1.37% and NNPA would have been 0.35% vs 0.1% as reported. The bank has nevertheless provided for the same. The provisions were lower at INR 3,704 Cr as the bank front ended the provisions in the previous quarter. The bank’s PCR stood at 195% (after considering all categories of provisions). PAT grew steadily by 12.8% QoQ and 18.4% YoY.

Outlook

We expect the premium in valuation to continue. We maintain our target of INR 1,427 per share, an upside of 18.5% over the CMP; implying a P/B multiple of 3.5x to FY22E ABV of INR 402. Accordingly, we reiterate our “BUY” rating on the shares of HDFC Bank.

Aditya Puri, the outgoing CEO of HDFC Bank is optimistic about India’s economic prospects. Pointing out that growth slowdown was “inevitable even before the pandemic,” he told CNBC-TV18 that there was “no cause for worry.”

“We should forget about 9 percent growth. That will take a while… the pandemic has slowed our growth but we were slowing before that,” Puri pointed out.

He was optimistic, “Some slowdown in growth is inevitable. Do not worry, we will get our mojo back. Yes, the business was hit, but recovery is happening as well. We need a lot of positivity so that sentiment improves. If the country gets the execution right, India has a bright future.”

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Speaking about HDFC Bank’s business strategy, Puri said, moves are towards continuous changes in technology to boost digital services and strengthening of presence in the semi-urban and rural areas – segments from which he expects 30 percent and 30-25 percent growth in business to come from, respectively.

Noting that 60 percent of India’s population lives in rural and semi-urban areas, Puri said a large base would drive growth.

HDFC Bank reported in-line NII growth of 17% YoY, though higher PPoP growth of 18% YoY benefitted from elevated treasury gains and improved fee lines. Reported NIM declined by ~20 bps QoQ to 4.1% driven by excess liquidity and rising share of lower yielding corporate portfolio. Gross NPA would be marginally higher QoQ at 1.37%, if not for the NPA standstill. The bank has made additional contingency provisions of Rs11bn against this. Additional contingent provisions of ~Rs12bn were made during 2QFY21, with total provision buffers at Rs69bn or 0.7% of advances (ex of those made against NPA standstill).

NIM during the quarter contracted by 20bps QoQ at 4.1%, largely due to increased growth in corporate segment book against the retail book’s growth and excess liquidity. The advances growth was driven primarily by the substantial growth in the corporate lending at +27% YoY while retail loan growth slowed to +5% YoY owing to the bank’s strict credit lending measures and visible growth in corporate segment.

HDFC Bank’s second quarter results show overall improvement across key parameters, but there is a high caution over the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic going ahead. Notably, there is a clear shift to wholesale loans, at least going by the loan growth numbers.

The asset quality has improved, provisions are on the expected lines, and there is a realistic guidance on the COVID-situation and its likely impact on the loan book.

Let’s take a look at the NPA (non-performing assets) figures. The gross NPAs in the September quarter declined to 1.08 per cent from 1.36 per cent in the preceding quarter and 1.38 per cent in the year-ago quarter. Net NPAs fell to 0.17 per cent from 0.33 per cent in the preceding quarter and 0.42 per cent in the year-ago period.

Like other lenders which have announced the results so far, HDFC Bank too has followed the Supreme Court interim order barring banks from classifying accounts that are standard as on August 31 as NPAs.

However, the bank has clarified that even if those numbers are adjusted, the bank’s proforma gross NPA ratio and proforma net NPA ratio would have been 1.37 per cent and 0.35 per cent, respectively, which is almost in line with the preceding quarter.

The bank has disclosed that loans worth Rs 15,743 crore were put under the moratorium and the benefit was extended (post May) to loans worth around Rs 4,639 crore. The bank made a total provision of Rs 620 crore on these loans.

The bank has guided that there is a likelihood of higher NPAs and resultant provisions ahead even with slight improvement in the economic situation.

Clearly and expectedly, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the business. While there has been some improvement in economic activities during the current quarter, the continued slowdown has led to a decrease in loan originations, the sale of third-party products, the use of credit and debit cards, and the efficiency in collection efforts, the bank said.

“The slowdown may lead to a rise in the number of customer defaults and consequently an increase in provisions,” said the bank.

Loan growth tilts to wholesale

A look at the loan growth data of the bank in the quarter shows a strong focus on the wholesale book. While the domestic retail loans grew by just 5.3 per cent, the domestic wholesale loans grew by an unusually high 26.5 per cent in the quarter. Total advances as of September 30, 2020, were Rs 1,038,335 crore, an increase of 15.8 per cent over September 30, 2019. Domestic advances grew by 15.4 per cent over September 30, 2019.

The lender has taken adequate precaution against the likely impact on the books on account of the pandemic. The Bank held floating provisions of Rs 1,451 crore and contingent provisions of Rs 6,304 crore as on September 30, 2020. Total provisions were 195 per cent of the reported gross NPAs or 154 per cent of proforma gross NPAs as on September 30, 2020.

Overall, the bank has had a good quarter in a tough business environment; also the last quarter earnings before the retirement of Managing Director Aditya Puri, who will hang up boots later this month.

HDFC Bank is expected to report over 16 percent growth in profit as well as net interest income (NII) in Q2 FY21. Asset quality may weaken a bit sequentially.

Profitability of the country's largest private sector lender may be hit by higher provisioning on expected restructured accounts (COVID-19 related), but lower tax rate may support earnings growth.

The bank had earlier reported a 16 percent year-on-year growth in Q2 advances at Rs 10.37 lakh crore, while deposits grew 20 percent to Rs 12.29 lakh crore.

""NII is expected to be moderate to 16 percent YoY on account of lower NIM, with the bank carrying excess liquidity. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the same is seen around 3 percent on account of the lockdown imposed in certain states and conservative approach of banks,"" Narnolia Financial Services said.

The slowdown in retail loan growth is on account of weak volume growth in the auto and unsecured portfolio, it added. It means the credit growth is largely expected to be driven by corporate portfolio.

Pre-provision operating profit growth for the quarter could be in the range of 10-12 percent due to lower other income.

Asset quality is expected to increase sequentially. ""We expect gross non-performing loans ratio to be around 1.5 percent of loans, which implies a marginal QoQ increase.

Managing Director and CEO Aditya Puri of India's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank has assured employees that their jobs and bonuses are secure.

Even as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, Puri, who retires later this month, said the bank is doing well, has sufficient capital and does not have any strain on the loans that it has made.

He also hinted that the bank may post a strong set of quarterly numbers in the recently ended July-September period and quarters ahead as well.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in job losses, especially in the organised sectors, as businesses suffered due to economic activity coming to a halt in lockdowns.

HDFC Bank and its private sector competitors have met hikes and bonuses commitments since the start of the pandemic.

""Not only are your jobs secure, your increment is also secure. Your bonus and your promotion are secure,” Puri told over 1.15 lakh employees of the bank, in a video message last week.

Puri, who has led the bank for over 25 years since its inception, said he is giving the assurance on behalf of the management team including his successor Sashidhar Jagdishan.

""The bank is doing well. We have all the capital that we need. Our portfolio is not under strain. We are aggressively using our distribution and technology advantage,” he said.

He urged employees to work as a team, follow the vision the lender has set out for itself and beat competition.

Puri was speaking ahead of the launch of festive offers by the lender in its second edition.

Competing banks have also launched similar aggressive offerings, eyeing larger share of transactions amid slowing consumption.

He said the bank has not accepted defeat in the face of the coronavirus outbreak and delivered good results for two quarters. Puri stated that projections for the upcoming quarters also say the same.

Asking the employees to share messages about the festive offers on their social media handles and promised a 10-minute video chat with the employee securing the highest number of 'likes' on a post.

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

Credit growth was healthy at 3% qoq/16% yoy (1% qoq/21% yoy in Q1) to Rs10,370bn, largely in line with our expectation. Overall growth seems to be better than the industry, primarily due to a pick-up in retail loans as indicated by our channel checks, and continued momentum in corporate loans (mainly working capital). Mortgage loan portfolio buyout (Retention) from HDFCL was up at Rs30.3bn vs. Rs13.8bn in Q1FY21 but still lower than Rs71.5bn in Q2FY19. We believe that low portfolio buyout could be partly due to lower PSL requirement with moderation in the bank's overall growth. Deposit growth has moderated a bit - up 3% qoq/20% yoy to Rs12,290bn, but the CASA ratio has improved qoq to 42% as incremental qoq deposit growth of Rs396bn has been largely through CASA deposits and thus, should support margins.



Outlook

Overall business momentum for HDFCB remains healthy compared to the industry, but we believe that the asset quality trend and management transition will be the key things to watch out for in the near-to-medium term. Currently, we have a Buy rating on the stock with a TP of Rs1300, given its strong stress management capability across cycles and superior return ratios.

Emkay Global Financial's report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB has built a strong retail-cum-corporate bank with market share gain across businesses, which the designate MD intends to strengthen by focusing on techno-banking, capturing B2B/B2C ecosystem and gaining market share at a pace faster than the past. The retail business is now at 80% of the pre-Covid level and should benefit from its strong rurban presence with agri doing well. The bank has a high share of the corporate book built around working capital and >AA corporates, where the deal pipeline is also building up well. The bank is well-capitalized, courtesy of higher internal returns v/s RWA growth. Retail collection efficiency is ~80-90% across products. The bank believes that NPAs may not cross the peak seen post-GFC at 2% (2010). Reducing cost ratios and better operating level should continue to support superior RoAs of 1.8-2%.

Outlook

We retain Buy/OW stance in EAP with a TP of Rs1,300 (based on 2.8x core bank Sep P/ABV + Subs value of Rs53), given its strong stress management capability and superior return ratios.

HDFC Bank is targeting a ten-time increase in the number of small merchants it serves to 20 million in the next three years, sources at the largest private sector lender have said.

The bank started targeting merchants about 18 months ago with solutions on accepting payments, providing value-added services like creating a simple website for them, taking care of their inventory and lending based on cash flows, through a single app.

The merchant relationships accrue in fees as the services are charged, in interest income for the lending and also in low-cost current and saving account (Casa) deposits.

""We are serving two million merchants at present and aim to take it to 20 million in three years by the end of FY23,"" a bank source told PTI.

Having a bigger number of merchants will help the bank's analytics engines gather more intelligence and deploy suitable solutions, the source said.

Therefore, right now, the focus is more on building the base, the source said, adding the merchant acquisition business is a ""strategic pillar"" for the bank.

When contacted, the bank was not immediately available for a comment.

The bank is fusing payments solutions, which include an acceptance infrastructure for customers to pay a merchant and also for the merchant to pay a supplier, with the basics of banking like lending and having an account at the back end.

Interest to serve the merchants has been growing since digitisation started at the merchants' end and the government has also been pushing banks to serve this community better and make them a part of formal financial channels, the source said.

It can be noted that interest about what happens in the merchants' space has been very high especially after the recent deals struck by the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Retail and Jio Platforms.

HDFC Bank processes 48 percent of the overall spends through cards and about a fourth of the UPI spends happening at the merchant ends, and the merchant uses the app for a variety of uses including buying, selling and launching promotional campaigns as well, the source said.

""We have the brand recall and a physical network of branches which is helping us get to the merchants as per a locality,"" the source said.

When asked if it is competing with financial technology firms, it was clarified that it is more about ecosystem play and the bank is partnering with many of them who have done innovations.

It is early days of using analytics but the bank has already given loans to 5 lakh of the merchants out of 20 lakh merchants it currently serves, the source said.

The insurance regulator has identified Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) Re and New India Assurance as domestic systemically important insurers (D-SIIs) for 2020-21.

Here, D-SIIs refer to insurers of such size, market importance and domestic and global inter-connectedness whose distress or failure would cause a significant dislocation in the domestic financial system.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) said the continued functioning of D-SIIs is critical for the uninterrupted availability of insurance services to the national economy.

LIC is the largest insurer in the country with a balance sheet of Rs 31.2 lakh crore. GIC Re is the country's sole reinsurer, while New India is the country's largest general insurance company.

GIC Re and New India are listed insurers while LIC is in the process of listing on the stock exchanges through a disinvestment by the government. All three entities are owned by the government.

IRDAI said D-SIIs are perceived as insurers that are ‘too big or too important to fail’. This perception and the perceived expectation of government support will amplify risk taking, reduce market discipline, create competitive distortions, and increase the possibility of distress in the future.

""These considerations require that D-SIIs should be subjected to additional regulatory measures to deal with the systemic risks and moral hazard issues,"" said the regulator.

Among the other financial regulators, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has identified State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank as systematically important banks.

In order to identify too-big-to-fail insurers and to put such insurers to enhanced monitoring mechanism, IRDAI has developed a methodology for identification and supervision of D-SIIs.

The parameters include the size of operations in terms of total revenue, including premium underwritten and the value of assets under management. It also includes global activities across more than one jurisdiction.

Further, it also includes lack of substitutability of their products and/or operations.

These parameters were assigned weights to cover various aspects of their operations. IRDAI said it will identify D-SIIs on an annual basis and disclose the names of these insurers for public information.

As D-SIIs, the three insurers LIC, GIC Re and New India have been asked to raise the level of corporate governance. These insurers also have to identify all relevant risk and promote a sound risk management culture.

The insurance regulator has also clarified that these D-SIIs will also be subjected to enhanced regulatory supervision during this period.",436,-0.9987821578979492

After State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank too has come out with FAQs on its website with respect to the details of one-time loan restructuring scheme launched as part of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) resolution framework for the COVID-19 pandemic-hit loans.

The FAQs have details on eligibility to avail the scheme and the process that needs to be followed. The section also has information about the different options with respect to the restructuring scheme.

Earlier, SBI had launched an online tool to help borrowers understand the resolution scheme for the COVID-19 pandemic-hit loans. All banks are likely to come out with similar details on their websites soon.

According to the details put out on its website, individuals and entities that are classified as standard, but not in default for more than 30 days with the bank as on March 1, 2020, and continue to remain as standard across all its loans/facilities till date are eligible for restructuring.

The customer has to be impacted financially by the COVID-19 pandemic in the form of reduction/loss of income or cash flows.

According to the FAQs, the reduction of income and its financial impact on the customer will be reviewed by the bank basis the documents/information provided, which does show the drop in cash flow due to the COVID-19 impact.

“The bank will assess the viability of the customer to pay the restructured EMIs basis the documents provided, before granting the restructuring. Apart from the viability calculations, the repayment track record of the customer, and the responses given by the customer while availing moratorium earlier will also be factored in the restructuring decision,” it said.

What is the scheme?

According to the scheme, the balance tenure of the loan can be extended by maximum of 24 months to ease the customer's monthly EMI repayment burden. The bank will levy a charge to the borrower who avails the scheme, it said.

What should customers do?

Customers can visit the bank’s website for the application link to fill the application form and submit the relevant details, or approach the relationship managers. The bank will put out the link for application on its website shortly, the bank said.

The borrower will have to submit documents giving details about the current status of his/her employment or business.

For salaried borrowers - salary slips and bank statement may be required. For self-employed borrowers/entities - bank statement, GST returns, income tax returns, Udyam certificate, etc may be required, the FAQs said.

Will it affect the credit rating?

As per the regulatory guidelines, loan/credit facility will be reported to the credit bureau as “Restructured”, the bank said.

“As per the guidelines, restructuring has to be reported at a borrower level to the credit bureaus and hence all the facilities/loans of the borrower with the bank will be classified and reported as “Restructured” even if the borrower has taken restructuring for only one loan,” the bank said.

As per regulatory and legal requirements, all borrowers/co-borrowers of the original loan need to agree and sign on any changes in the loan structure, including the restructuring agreement, the HDFC Bank FAQs said.",531,-0.9736857116222382

HDFC Bank has increased the late payment fees and interest rates on revolving balances across its credit card portfolio, Bloomberg has reported.

According to the report, this move by India’s largest lender and issuer of credit cards could lead to others following suit.

The report states that the late payment fees for credit cards other than Infinia range has been raised by Rs 150-350, with effect from September 1. According to the statement of charges and fees on HDFC Bank's website, the bank was charging a flat fee of Rs 950 on late payment by customers with an overdue balance of Rs 25,000 and above till August 31.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

From September 1, however, those with a credit card balance between Rs 25,000 and 50,000 will have to shell out Rs 1,100 on late repayments. Those having a balance more than Rs 50,000 will pay Rs 1,300, the report suggests.

The bank has also raised interest rate on 'revolver balances' on some credit cards from 3.49 percent monthly to 3.6 percent monthly, Bloomberg reported.

According to Macquarie Research, late payment fees form an average 22 percent of any card issuer's total fee income, not to mention 30 percent of the operating profit. The research house said that, on an average, 15-20 percent card-carrying customers are in default for up to 30 days.

""Once moratoriums end, card issuers will resume charging late payment fees. It is easier to convince customers who have a small amount overdue to pay up by reminding them of disincentives for missing payments – large upfront penalties over and above the 3-4% monthly interest rates,"" Macquarie said, according to the report.

Number of customers preferring to buy high-value products through instalments stood at an ""all-time high"" during the coronavirus pandemic, the country's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank said on September 8.

Even as concerns get raised about asset quality given the high job losses and salary cuts, the bank said it is ""bullish"" on the credit card equated monthly instalment (EMI) products, said Angshuman Chatterjee, head (consumer credit cards and digital acquisitions) at HDFC Bank.

According to some think-tanks, job losses are high in the organised segment, which has been a traditional favourite for the banks. As part of the EMI product, HDFC Bank ties up with merchants or product manufacturers to help a customer get a cheaper deal along with the ability to spread repayments over a period of time. There are reports of demand having been hit severely in the economy, which has been driven by the consumption in the past few years.

""Credit card EMIs are at an all-time high. So, customers are choosing to do larger spend by breaking them up into simple EMIs. That is helping the consumption,"" Chatterjee said in a video message for bank employees. He added that the trend is visible across all segments of card holders, including the newly launched millennia cards targeted at the younger users.

On the 'millennia' line of cards launched in August 2019, the bank has added 15 lakh customers having the credit, debit and prepaid cards as against its target of reaching 20 lakh customers in two years, he said.

The 'millennia' is driving a bulk of new card acquisitions and accounts for a big part of the customer portfolio now, he said adding that the proportion of cards sourced digitally in the new line is three times that for others.

Chatterjee said that over 70 per cent of its customers are right now using e-commerce as against 47 per cent earlier, which shows a shift to online shopping during the pandemic, he said.

Once the restrictions are lifted through things like the arrival of a vaccine, there will be a huge surge in consumption, Chatterjee said.

HDFC Bank on Friday launched a special farm loan product targeting the armed forces. The product will be linked to the RuPay Card and is expected to benefit about 45 lakhs customers, HDFC Bank Managing Director and CEO, Aditya Puri said in a conference call.

The landholding requirement to avail this loan has been reduced to two acres as compared to the normal requirement of five acres, the bank said. The rate of interest will be up to 7 percent.

The maturity of the loan will be up to five years but the tenure can depend on the requirement of the borrower, Puri said. The loan will also come with an insurance cover of Rs 10 lakh as against normal Rs 2 lakh, the bank said.

The loan has been designed primarily to help armed personnel who typically have difficulties to avail such loans on account of the nature of their work, the bank said. Customers can avail this loan by contacting the bank through a tollfree number.",184,0.9999184608459473

A lot has been achieved in the 26-year old journey of HDFC Bank but the ""best is yet to come"", the lender's outgoing Managing Director Aditya Puri said. Puri expressed satisfaction that he was passing on the baton to Sashidhar Jagdishan, who is the ""worthiest person"" to lead the bank.

Earlier this month, HDFC Bank appointed Jagdishan as the managing director with effect from October 27, when Puri turns 70.

""I haven't been happier than I'm now as I write this. I've always maintained our best is yet to come, and with Sashi now at the helm I have no doubt that our best will come.

""I wouldn't go into the qualities he possesses because most of us would know that. Suffice to say that in him you have the best person to lead and I have the worthiest person to hand over the baton to,"" Puri said in an e-mail to the lender's employees.

Puri, who joined as the first employee of HDFC Bank, said, ""If I look back, 26 years seems like yesterday. From my first office with broken chairs to now, what we've achieved in this time is incredible and doesn't have too many parallels globally.""

The veteran banker has been instrumental in building the bank from scratch and turning it into the largest private sector lender of the country.

""Sample some of our achievements that I am very proud of-- We truly are a world-class Indian Bank today and one of the largest in independent India in terms of outreach, balance sheet, number of customers, and market capitalisation. We have brought 1.11 crore families out of poverty through our Sustainable Livelihood Initiative (SLI),"" he said.

Besides, he said, the bank has made a difference to the lives of over 7.8 crore Indians through its corporate social responsibility initiative Parivartan.

""We've come to be recognized as one of the country's best wealth creators and we have emerged as one of the largest employers in independent India,"" he added.

The bank over the 26 years has built an employee strength of about 1.16 lakh. It has a branch network of 5,326 and 14,996 ATMs across 2,825 cities and towns of the country.

Giving credit to employees for the success, he said, ""Like I've always said I'm just the face of the success called HDFC Bank. It's you that the real credit goes to. We wouldn't be what we are today without you. So take a bow and keep showering on Sashi the same love and affection that you've showered on me all these years for which I'm going to remain eternally grateful to you.""

Jagdishan has been with the bank since 1996 and joined as a manager in the finance function.

He was appointed as a 'change agent' recently and heads the finance, human resources, legal and secretarial, administration, infrastructure, corporate communications and corporate social responsibility functions.

Under Puri, the bank's net profit has grown from Rs 80 lakh in 1994-95 to Rs 26,257 crore in 2019-20.

Puri, an ex-Citibanker, emerged as the highest-paid Indian banker in FY 2019-20 with a 20 per cent growth in gross earnings at Rs 18.92 crore.

He also earned an additional Rs 161.56 crore in FY20 and Rs 42.20 crore in FY19 by exercising his stock options.",561,0.9906872047318352

Sharma further added that Aditya Puri is not an entrepreneur by definition, right, he was a career banker. Here too, he was an employee, a founder employee but still an employee.

But, one should remember that HDFC as a group has been founded only by employees becoming entrepreneurs okay, that’s been the nature of the HDFC group, and they have got that DNA. Hopefully, the same DNA will continue even in the future, explains Sharma.

Finding multibaggers is a process and by following the process, at the end of 10 years, 2/3/4/5 among all the invested stocks will be brilliant and that’s how you will create the money, Shankar Sharma, co-founder and vice-chairman, First Global, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpt:



Q) Your PMS schemes - India focused and Global - both outperformed in July. What led to the outperformance – is it the tactical diversification?

A) India was a different strategy than what we followed globally. In India, our PMS delivered about 9.5 percent compared to the market which was up by about 6 percent, but on a year-to-date (YTD) basis we are up about 20 percent while the markets are still down by about 10 percent - so the gap is massive on a year-to-date basis.

The main lesson to be learned here is that – an investor you have to avoid the big mistakes. If you are able to do that then you are going to beat the markets by a pretty good margin.

Looking back, we saw the danger in February and in March. We sidestepped it, we lost very little money and then we went back into the market on April 1st in India and from there we are up about by about 35-38%, while market is up by about 32-33%.

We have outperformed, and that could happen because we avoided March substantially. The key lesson in investing is to avoid the big down – the big drawdowns.

Otherwise, we can talk about which stocks we have picked? How we tactically positioned ourselves and of course there we have had some very winners. We have had winners in pharma which have going up five times from March, five times.

So, yeah, those have all helped, but those are only small building blocks to the larger point I’m making which is do not become a cowboyed investing that is the most important thing.

On the global front, it was even better because in April itself we saw that the US dollar was going to weaken and therefore we went and bought oil at about $16-17$ that is gone up to $42/bbl now.

We have had gold, silver we bought so that is up like 70-80% in the last two months’ time and of course we have had some great stocks in China which have done phenomenally well and our Switzerland bets have done very well – we were well-diversified globally.

We avoided the big drawdowns in February and March, and that is why we are up about 22 percent on a year-to-date (YTD) basis while markets are still down. So the broad theme is while you can do all the smart stock picks and etc., but be conservative in this game, don't be a cowboy.

Q) I am sure you know this is something like music to your investors and that is something which I see on your Twitter feed as well, a lot of investors are acknowledging the fact that you have outperformed the broader markets or the markets in general? A) I will give you a quick one-line thing we got a message from an investor that we have in our - India and globally - portfolio. The gentleman is a senior executive at a major auto company in Germany. He sent us a mail saying that my whole life – and obviously a very senior person – whole life, the investing journey has changed ever since. I have started investing with First Global because the way you approach things is so different and now I understand the meaning of diversification, and now I understand the meaning of risk management, what it means by position sizing, which I was never told – these were his words.

Tech startups such as Zomato and Paytm unlikely to become the next HDFC Bank or TCS after IPOs, says...

D-Street Talk: Shankar Sharma on why he did not invest in Zomato IPO The letter further added that initially he use to buy 5 stocks that are likely do well, four would tank 80% and net-net, he would still lose money. So the point is that you can do it by following strict process scientifically and like I said avoid the big dangers, big drawdowns you will come I had in investing. Q) I was going through your Twitter feed and interestingly you bought HDFC Bank back in 1996. It has been a mega wealth creators for investors. What does the journey hold for the private sector lender amid a change in management? A) Yeah, so I mean, first and foremost, I mean nobody knew nobody. I don’t think Aditya Puri ever knew that this bank would become so big. In hindsight, we can all say I saw this coming and all that, buy nobody saw this coming. Our bet was that it was going to do very well and we put out our piece of research in ’96 which said exactly that putting a baby and Arnold Schwarzenegger together side by side. We wanted to say that this baby is going to become Arnold Schwarzenegger, and it did become Arnold Schwarzenegger, but hey, to say that we actually saw all that, I mean that is being very, very immodest. In reality, it was always a good bet, back then great management team, but that would become so big, nobody knew, 25,000 percent return. Aditya Puri is not an entrepreneur by definition, right, he was a career banker. Here too, he was an employee, a founder employee but still an employee. I don’t think in the history of business at least in India and frankly, even globally you have seen an example of an employee creating an organization of this size, scale, and excellence. I don’t think it is matched across the world, forget about India.



Therefore, if you see this achievement, and expect that the next guy will be as good as Aditya Puri, I mean, fingers are crossed, it’s a great, great company, it’s a huge machine, and as long as you don’t fiddle around too much, it can still keep running, but these are going to be big shoes to fill and let’s hope and pray that a great organization institution like HDFC Bank continues doing.Remember HDFC as a group has been founded only by employees becoming entrepreneurs okay, that’s been the nature of the HDFC group, and they have got that DNA. Hopefully, the same DNA will continue even in the future. Q) You have got the Midas touch when it comes to picking winners. So any stock idea for our listeners that could turn in to Gold? A) No, first and foremost, I don’t have any Midas touch, let me be absolutely clear, okay. The whole point in investing as I said earlier as well that do not put all your eggs in one basket -- that is silly and stupid way of investing. One could buy 25 stocks with some good research. Out of the 25 at the end of 5 or 10 years, 5 will become multibaggers, in another 5 you might end up losing maybe 25-30-40% which have exited, and the balance will be along with the market whichever way the market has gone. So your five are going to come out buying 25, your five are not going to come out buying only those five because nobody can predict. Finding multibagger is a process and we follow a process and that is how these things will come about. A pharma stock we bought in March which is up 5x came out of the process, and it didn’t come out of a brainwave. By following the process, at the end of 10 years, out of 25 stocks, 2/3/4/5 will be brilliant and that’s how you will create the money. Now as we speak right, I mean, India has been a very strange market wherein one part of the market has done terribly but there are other parts which like you said one of the stock I have mentioned right now without taking names, a 5X in four months is huge. In India, right now the interesting spaces remain telecom as well as pharmaceuticals. And also focus on sectors that have not been hurt by this pandemic. Sectors that are hurt by this pandemic, we all know which sectors they are. While they are going to have a rally and they will basically go up from the lows we still think there are risk there. Like I said, in investing as long as you avoid the riskiest areas of the market you will make money. Investors should also remember one more thing -- one should not as an investor try to make all the money that is supposed to be made in the market because many stocks will go up. Many stocks will go up in the market, and you don’t have to buy all of them. You should buy and get the ones which give you the best risk and reward tradeoff, as simple as that. And we find that there is plenty of them are available, it’s not that they are not available. We have chosen to stay out of banks and NBFCs and we are quite thankful or that. In the month of June, we actually underperformed because of that a lot of the NBFC rallied. We all know which one, right? But, I prepared to sit out those part because there are still dangers ahead. Q) Do you think the outcome of the US elections will have an important bearing on the equity markets across the globe? A) I don’t think, I think a lot of this is all nonsense when people keep trying to figure out what happens to the presidential election and therefore which will happen to the stock market. In the US, the government and the president they don’t really control much in the economy unlike India, right? Policies are drafted and driven by who which party is in power and who was leading and all that -- US is more like a machine, it doesn’t really matter, whether Trump or Biden who really cares as long as the central bank remains accommodative. As long as the central bank remains accommodative – equity markets will be fine there and if they are fine there in general other markets will also be fine that’s and of course as long as corporate numbers are good and companies do well. I don’t think one individual matters so much in the context of the US, it matters a lot in India, but it definitely doesn’t matter in a large machine like the US economy. Q) What is your take on the commodity prices all seems to be heading in one direction and that is up be it crude oil, Gold, Silver, etc. Nasdaq has already touched a record high, do you think tracking the momentum India could follow the trend? A) Yeah, so we picked all these commodities in April. We have written about it also in our investors' updates which are monthly. We have done very well because of having commodities and commodities-centric markets. We had Russia, we had Brazil which is up 50% in the last couple of months. So, obviously there is a reasonable bit of expectation that commodities will do well. In that context, if you see India then a number of the commodity stocks have done very well. So, if you look at steel or you see the aluminum, those stocks have done pretty decently in India in the last couple of months. I can’t take names. So, you can play some of these themes even in India and we have these names in our portfolio and that is another reason why we have done well. Few stocks have done phenomenally well in the last couple of months that are up 30-40%.

With the appointment of Sashidhar Jagdishan as Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of HDFC Bank, the CEO succession uncertainty lingering for last few weeks is over now, global brokerages feel.

Aditya Puri, the current MD of the country's largest private sector lender, had hinted earlier that next MD & CEO would be the internal candidate only.

And that came true when Reserve Bank of India on August 3 approved the appointment of Sashidhar Jagdishan as Managing Director & CEO of the bank for a period of three years w.e.f. October 27, 2020.

Aditya Puri is due to retire as Managing Director of the bank on October 26.

""CEO succession uncertainty finally ended, which is positive for the bank. Sashi has been closely connected with internal/board & external stakeholders. His appointment should make the transition at the bank smoother,"" said Citi while having a buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1,350 per share, implying 30 percent potential upside from current levels.

Sashidhar Jagdishan has been working in HDFC Bank since 1996 when he was appointed as a Manager in the finance function.

Sashi is currently the Group Head of Finance, Human Resources, Legal & Secretarial, Administration, Infrastructure, Corporate Communications, Corporate Social Responsibility & the Strategic Change Agent of the bank.

""Sashi Jagdishan is the right choice and a big positive. He ensures continuity. He is 'hard task master & investors' choice too,"" said Macquarie while retaining outperform call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,114 per share, implying 7 percent potential upside.

HDFC Bank's stock price has been under pressure due to concerns around the succession and the recent attrition in the top management. The stake sale by Aditya Puri had also impacted the sentiment and raised uncertainty over the CEO finalisation. The stock had corrected 12 percent in two weeks before the finalisation of CEO by RBI

""Although some concerns remain around top-level attrition, the RBI's approval addresses a major overhang on the stock's performance as Mr Jagdishan has been with the bank for the past several years; thus, succession by an internal candidate augurs well to boost investor confidence and continue the impeccable performance the bank has witnessed under the leadership of Mr Puri,"" said Motilal Oswal.

With the system challenged by the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, the brokerage believes large banks are relatively better placed to tide over this crisis. Thus, it remained positive on HDFC Bank and maintained buy call with a target of Rs 1,280, implying 23 percent potential upside.

Sashidhar Jagdishan, who has been named as new HDFC Bank CEO, was under consideration in April this year itself. This was part of the reasons that influenced the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) decision to put on hold key appointments of two key executives on the board including that of Jagdishan, according to people familiar with the development.

On 9 April, Moneycontrol had reported about possibilities of Aditya Puri’s successor being an insider after the lender on April 8 intimated stock exchanges that the RBI has put on hold the appointment of two key executives on the Board.

The RBI had said the appointment of Sashidhar Jagdishan and Bhavesh Zaveri each as Additional Director and Executive Director (Whole-Time Director) of the Bank should be put on hold until the new managing director and chief executive officer takes charge.

“We are now in receipt of a communication dated April 7, 2020 from Reserve Bank of India stating that since these are important positions in the Bank, the Bank is advised to examine and submit the proposal after a new MD and CEO assumes charge later this year. The Bank shall accordingly ensure compliance with Reserve Bank's instruction as above,” said the bank in a filing to exchanges on April 8.

Moneycontrol had reported that the RBI decision is significant considering that both Jagdishan and Zaveri are seen as strong contenders to the post of HDFC Bank’s managing director after Puri’s retirement slated in October this year.

Sukthankar’s exit a turning point

Till the time of his exit from the bank, Paresh Sukthankar, former Deputy Managing director of HDFC Bank and a trusted lieutenant of Puri was seen as a worthy successor to his boss. But Sukthankar surprised the markets by quitting in August 2018, thereby confirming the ensuing hunt for another candidate. The bank subsequently appointed Egon Zehnder for this purpose. “Post Sukthankar’s exit, the logical choice was Jagdishan. He was Puri’s choice too. Puri always wanted an insider to succeed him in the post,” said one of the persons quoted above. All of them declined to be named.

In the list of candidates sent by bank to RBI in May, Jagdishan’s name figured in the top. Puri, who was also part of the selection committee as an advisor to choose the new CEO strongly advocated Jagdishan’s candidature.

An old-timer, consensus candidate

Jagdishan joined the bank in 1996, just two years after Puri joined. His growth in the organization hierarchy was quick. In just three years He became Business Head ‐ Finance three years later in 1999 and was appointed as CFO in 2008. Jagdishan played a critical role in supporting the growth trajectory of the bank. He led the finance function and played a pivotal role in aligning the organisation in achieving its strategic objectives over the years.

HDFC Bank insiders say Jagdishan was the consensus candidate for the top job and part of the core team through the years of HDFC Bank’s evolution to the largest private bank in the country. “He is more of a finance person and a good team leader. His ascension to the CEO post will be win-win for all in the bank and for the investors. The biggest gain is continuity in business policies and organization culture which is a must in tough times,” said one of the persons quoted above.

The first challenge for Jagdishan as CEO would be to deal with the asset quality shock in the post moratorium period. The RBI moratorium ends by August 31. Analysts expect a major surge in NPAs in the subsequent quarters on account of tepid market conditions. HDFC Bank has around 9 per cent of its loan book under moratorium as on June 30.",633,0.3333114782969157

For the last few months, there were rumours within the HDFC Bank about an insider succeeding Aditya Puri as its new Managing Director and CEO. No one knew for sure though.

The rumors, however, gained momentum after Puri himself left hints in public that he preferred an insider as successor at the bank. In the last AGM of the bank, Puri made it even clearer when he said his potential successor has been around for the last 25 years.

At this point, the name wasn’t hard to guess. There were only two that fit this description in the list the bank sent to RBI: Sashidhar Jagdishan and Kaizad Bharucha.

Even after all this, when the announcement finally happened on August 4 confirming Jagdishan’s name, the news came as relief to many senior management personnel within the bank. Reason: Anyone from outside would have taken his own time to get familiar with the bank's culture. That would have perhaps proved costly for the bank in a tough industry environment.

Also, the entry of an outsider, particularly at the top level, was bound to upset at least some in the senior management team. In the recent past, private banks, which appointed outsiders as CEOs, have seen an exodus of talent from the senior level. Yes Bank being a case in point.

But Jagdishan’s appointment is a safe bet. He is unlikely to ruffle feathers at the top. Also, being an insider, he can hit the ground running. After all, the CEO designate of India’s largest private bank is a veteran with over 25 years of experience in the bank. He is a familiar face across most departments.

Shashi, as he is called by colleagues in HDFC Bank, joined the institution in 1996 as a manager in the finance function. HDFC Bank wasn’t a very well-known name back then. He joined the bank after a stint in Deutsche Bank as senior officer in its Country Financial Control Division in Mumbai. His entry into HDFC Bank happened two years after outgoing CEO Aditya Puri joined the bank (in 1994).

He rose through the ranks fast. He became Business Head ‐ Finance three years later in 1999 and was appointed as CFO in 2008. Jagdishan played a critical role in supporting the growth trajectory of the bank. He led the finance function and played a pivotal role in aligning the organisation in achieving its strategic objectives over the years.

Jagdishan is currently the Group Head of Finance, Human Resources, Legal & Secretarial, Administration, Infrastructure, Corporate Communications, and Corporate Social Responsibility. He has completed his graduation in Science with a specialisation in physics, and is a Chartered Accountant. He also holds a Master’s degree in Economics of Money, Banking & Finance from the University of Sheffield, UK.

When Jagdishan takes over as CEO of the bank he joined 24 years ago, his biggest challenge will be to continue with the legacy of his illustrious predecessor, who took charge as Managing Director in September 1994.

Puri has been instrumental in building the bank into India's largest private lender. An organisation which has stood its ground through various crises and intense competition from newer rivals. The bank has consistently delivered on growth and rewarded investors.

HDFC Bank was listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange on May 19, 1995. Between then and now, the market capitalisation of the bank has grown to Rs 5,73,569 crore from Rs 440 crore. During this period, total assets have grown to Rs 15.3 lakh crore from Rs 3,394 crore.

Total deposits grew to Rs 11.47 lakh crore in March from Rs 642 crore in March 1995 and total advances swelled to Rs 10.03 lakh crore from Rs 98 crore. The bank consistently grew at healthy rate, surprising most analysts.

Jagdishan’s biggest task is to safeguard that legacy and guide the bank to better growth. He is taking over at a time when the banking industry is in the midst of the COVID crisis.

COVID-19 hit the Indian economy at a time when it was already slowing for many quarters. Demand has plummeted and consumer sentiment is the lowest in many years. The pandemic impacted loan growth and poses a major threat to asset quality. Banks will see a spike in bad loans once the moratorium period gets over by August 31. HDFC Bank will also likely feel the heat of the COVID crisis.

As on June 30, about 9 percent of loans were under moratorium. Asset quality weakened during the first quarter as gross non-performing assets (NPA) climbed sequentially to 1.36 percent (from 1.26 percent). The management remains cautious. The new CEO will have to prepare for a likely stress on the books post the moratorium period.

The other challenge will be to safeguard the bank’s corporate governance standards. The bank recently sacked a few employees following an investigation into irregularities in the auto loan department. The charges were related to mis-selling or forced selling of GPS products to auto loan borrowers.

Rising number of fraudulent transactions in the banking system is another concern. HDFC Bank reported Rs 222 crore worth of frauds in FY20 from 7,580 cases as against Rs 498 crore from 5,484 cases in the preceding year.

Puri has been the face of HDFC Bank for more than two decades. He, along with his team, created a model that no bank could emulate in the following years. In that sense, Jagdishan has a tough assignment ahead.",916,-0.3248752603928248

As per the FY20 annual report of the bank, Puri held around 77.96 lakh shares of HDFC Bank translating to 0.14 percent stake in the bank as at end-March ’20, of which he sold 74.2 lakh shares for around Rs 840 crore. After the reported transaction, Puri’s holding in HDFC Bank stands reduced to 376,000 shares.

Puri has been the managing director (MD) of the bank since September 1994 which makes him the longest-serving MD at a private bank. As the law requires bankers to retire at 70, his 26-year tenure at the bank will end in October.

Senior management of banks selling the stocks granted to them through employee stock option plans (ESOP) isn’t new. As a matter of fact, instances of insiders selling has risen globally following the dazzling rise in stock prices since March. For instance, Morgan Stanley’s CEO sold out 150,000 shares of US bank valued at around $8 million, a day after the bank reported its second-quarter earnings for CY21. There are many such stances. But in the case of HDFC bank, the quantum and the timing of shares sold by Puri surely stirs curiosity.

Though HDFC Bank’s stock is down 3 percent today so far, it is more in line with the banking index. Hence, the weakness in the bank’s stock today doesn’t seem to be the fallout of Puri’s action. Perhaps, the grim outlook revealed by the Reserve Bank of India’s financial stability report could be the reason for weakness in banking stocks. The RBI projects the gross non-performing (GNPA) ratio of the banking sector to increase to 12.5 percent by March 2021 from 8.5 percent in March 2020 under the base case scenario.

Why Puri’s exit is a ticklish moment?

Puri has led the most successful and profitable private bank in India. HDFC bank’s market capitalisation was around $200 million, equivalent to Rs 700 crore, on its listing in 1995. As of today, the market cap has zoomed to $83 billion or Rs 595,000 crore, which is around 30 percent compounded annual growth. That’s a staggering wealth creation over the years. No doubt, Puri is the highest-paid private bank chief. He received a total remuneration of Rs 18.92 crore in FY20 excluding the value of stock options exercised during the year.

The departure of a successful leader is always a ticklish moment — even more so given that the timing coincides with the pandemic-led economic crisis which will be a litmus test for HDFC Bank and its asset quality.

HDFC’s performance in the latest quarter has been an outlier amidst a dismal scene in the banking sector.

Also Read: HDFC Bank Q1: Business scales new highs, will its stock follow suit?

The bank is gaining market share at an accelerated pace. In fact, it has become the biggest player having a market share of more than 25 percent in advances and deposits on an incremental basis in past one year.

But despite the shining performance, HDFC Bank’s stock has underperformed the broader market (NIFTY) in the last 3-month and 6-month period. That is because the Street is apprehensive about HDFC Bank’s asset quality given that around 17 percent of its total loans is in the unsecured category and risky given the current challenging environment. Also, many aren’t able to comprehend the bank’s strong growth in corporate lending given that overall corporate credit off-take is very weak.

But more than these business reasons, the impending management change has been a big overhang on the stock.

The bank’s director board had constituted a search committee comprising certain board members and Puri acting as advisor to the search committee to identify his successor and the next MD. On April 18, it finalised the names of three candidates and submitted its application to the RBI in the order of preference. While the RBI’s approval is still awaited Puri said at the analyst conference call to discuss the bank’s Q1 earnings that the next MD could well be from within the bank.

An outsider taking over the affairs of the bank often leads to pressure on stock price as it may entail a change in business strategy and increased uncertainty. In a worst case, an outsider joining a bank is often followed by a kitchen sinking. So does Puri’s stake sell indicate that his successor isn’t from within the bank but an outsider? Well, it won’t be correct to speculate because the reason for Puri’s selling can be manifold.

That said, investors need to closely follow the developments in this regard. We believe if Puri’s hint of insider getting elevated to MD turns out to be true, we can expect the stock to stabilise. However, in the long term, if Puri starts a fresh innings with a competitor, that could have negative implications for HDFC Bank.",818,-0.4122116267681122

HDFC Bank share price opened lower by over 2 percent at open on July 27 after its managing director, Aditya Puri sold bank’s shares worth Rs 843 crore post July 21, stock exchange filings showed.

Puri has sold 7.42 million shares or 0.13 percent stake, the bank said. Post this transaction, Puri holds 3.76 lakh shares of the bank or 0.01 percent.

The stock price has gained 16 percent in the last 3 months and was trading at Rs 1,091.90, down Rs 26.90, or 2.40 percent at 09:15 hours. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,101.40 and an intraday low of Rs 1,091.90.

In a statement, HDFC Bank spokesperson clarified that the value of around Rs 840 crore mentioned in media reports is the value of the shares at the current price. ""These shares were allotted to Puri at different times and at different price points (not at par). Therefore, the net amount realised by Puri is not Rs 840 crore. The acquisition cost of shares and the tax payable on the transaction has to be accounted for as well,"" the spokesperson said.

Puri, whose term as managing director ends in October this year, has been heading the bank for 26 years.

HDFC Bank has reported a 19.6 percent year-on-year growth in standalone profit for the quarter ended June 2020, led by lower tax cost and NII. However, elevated provisions and lower other income due to slowdown in economic activity limited profit growth. Profit during the quarter increased sharply to Rs 6,658.62 crore, compared to Rs 5,568.16 crore in the same period last year.

Net interest income in Q1 FY21 climbed 17.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 15,665.42 crore supported by healthy loan growth of 21 percent in the quarter and deposits growth of 24.6 percent, said the bank in its BSE filing.

According to Moneycontrol SWOT Analysis powered by Trendlyne, MFs decreased their shareholding last quarter with declining profits every quarter for the past 2 quarters.

However, Moneycontrol technical rating is very bullish with moving averages and technical indicators being bullish.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has sought details of an internal investigation being carried out by HDFC Bank with regard to alleged malpractices in its car loan operations.

The bank has been asked to furnish details on the steps being taken by them to rectify any discrepancy that may have surfaced during the investigation, Bloomberg reported.

The information is not out yet and the HDFC Bank spokesman has refused to comment on the matter, stating there is nothing new to add to what the lender’s Managing Director Aditya Puri has already said.

Puri had said on July 18 that an internal inquiry was initiated after a whistleblower complaint, which led the bank to uncover 'personal misconduct' by some of its employees. ""Based on internal inquiry findings, appropriate action was taken against a set of employees in the auto loan business segment for their act of personal misconduct,” he added.

If one goes by HDFC Bank CEO Aditya Puri’s comments, his successor will be an insider. “There has been a lot of talk about the successor not being with us for a long time. Our potential successor has been with us for 25 years. My successor was always in place, at least in my mind. It is now for RBI to decide,” Puri said at the bank’s recent AGM.

In the list of candidates submitted to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) by the bank early this year, there are two names that qualify this description—Sashidhar Jagdishan and Kaizad Bharucha. Hence, logically, one of these two executives should be named as the CEO after Puri. The RBI decision on this is still pending.

An insider like Jagdishan or Bharucha will be familiar with Puri’s work style and the bank’s way of functioning. Nonetheless, they are both sure to have big shoes to fill.

Puri headed India’s largest private bank for nearly three decades and grew it into a formidable institution. It has long been a darling of investors.

But some recent controversies in the bank has made the job difficult for Puri’s successor. The problem at hand for the new chief is not just to carry on with HDFC Bank’s performance legacy but also clear doubts in the minds of investors and shareholders that there isn’t anything rotting beneath the glossy walls of the bank. HDFC Bank was rocked recently by charges of misselling or forced selling of GPS products to the auto loan borrowers.

The incident does not amount to a banking fraud or a scam. A series of exits from the senior management including the now-controversial exit of bank’s former auto division head, Ashok Khanna, could be termed as perfectly normal as the bank’s crisis management team has been attempting to portray since Day One.

But no doubt, these controversies have dented the image of HDFC Bank among common investors. The shadow of suspicion persists.

The charges include bank’s executives forcing the borrowers to buy GPS devices bundled with the auto loans and even insisting that loans will not be sanctioned unless they buy these devices.

The devices, manufactured by a Mumbai firm, Trackpoint GPS, cost about Rs 18 000 a piece. But it is not the amount involved but the corporate practices that have been questioned.

For an institution of HDFC Bank’s stature, such irregularities do not augur well. Misselling or forced selling of products is a crime in the eyes of the banking regulator and selling a non-financial product by the bank, if indeed happened, is a sin.

The allegations first surfaced on social media. The bank responded to the charges with the statement only after a sustained social media campaign by one of the whistleblowers against the alleged irregularities and subsequent reports in the mainstream media.

The misconduct by the bank officials was acknowledged by Puri itself in the bank’s AGM when he said an internal probe was conducted against a few erring employees and appropriate action was taken.

With this, the GPS scam was no longer a social media buzz and a trading room chatter but acknowledgement by India’s largest private banking institution that some of its employees went against rules possibly under the watch of a senior vertical head. Soon, reports emerged that the bank has sacked six officials in connection with the case and that the RBI has sought details of the probe.

Does the issue end there? One can’t say for sure unless the details of the probe and findings are revealed in the public. To be sure, misselling of products isn’t new in the Indian banking industry.

From insurance products to mutual funds to controversial additional tier 1 bonds (AT1 bonds), misselling has been a worrying part of the banking business.

Banks have carried out misselling rampantly in the quest to make big money, forgetting the cardinal rules of customer fairness and fair play. Customers, especially uninformed gullible ones, fall for pep talk and marketing methods easily.

But big institutions suffer reputation damage even with smaller faults by employees and the urge to protect those erring employees complicate the wound and it takes a long time to heal.

A perfect case in hand is the heat felt by ICICI Bank’s brand following Chanda Kochhar-Videocon quid-pro-quo deal. The CEO agreed to push a Rs 3,250 crore loan to Videocon’s Dhoot so that Dhoot will invest in her husband’s company. The scandal damaged ICICI bank’s image, all because of one erring employee. The wound is still fresh.

This should be a lesson to other banks. Puri’s successor, who is waiting for RBI’s final clearance at this stage, has an immediate task of making the full details of the auto loan probe public and regain the confidence of investors—both critical for the bank particularly in an already challenging industry environment.

Until then, the bank hasn’t revealed what really went wrong in the department. All that the outsider has is media reports and allegations.

The next task would be to keep the top management together. Puri enjoyed an unquestionable command over the senior management, something he built over decades.

HDFC Bank insiders and banking industry officials say Puri’s voice always dominated the management in crucial decisions. Those who didn’t heed had to leave even after long years of work in the bank.

It is not uncommon that an exodus of the senior management begins once the term of the old, influential CEO comes to an end. This happened in Yes Bank and many other banks. The new boss will have to convince the team that he is worthy to lead the team.

The whole transition process takes a while. The problem for Puri’s successor is that the change of guard is happening at a time when the banking industry is fighting the spectre of Covid-19.

There have been several senior-level exits from the bank sine FY17, many of whom were part of the bank for over a decade and contributed significantly in building the brand. A recent ambit capital research counted eighteen senior-level exits since FY17. These include Groups heads like Munish Mittal, Ashok Khanna, Abhay Aima, Nitin Chaugh, Rajesh Kumar Rathanchand, all of whom spent 18-25 years in the bank.

The list also includes Paresh Sukthankar, Deputy Managing Director, who was rumoured to be Puri’s successor at one point. These many senior-level exits mean the new CEO will also have a new team and those who built the HDFC bank legacy over the last two decades won’t be around. That’s a key challenge.

Future is built on assumptions and hopes.

The auto loan episode has damaged HDFC Bank’s image of being an institution that can’t err. It has exposed faultlines in monitoring wrongdoers and guards good corporate governance practices. A major clean-up will be one of the first big tasks of the new CEO.",1157,-0.620645242578843

HDFC Bank has sacked at least six employees after an internal investigation found that these employees violated the code of conduct and were found involved in violation of corporate governance practices.

What is the issue all about?

Bank’s internal investigations discovered certain irregularities in the vehicle finance division. Allegedly, some employees of the bank engaged in forced selling of GPS devices to customers bundling these with auto loans.

Employees reportedly insisted the customers to buy the product as a precondition to clear the loan.

How much these devices cost?

According to reports, each devices cost Rs 18,000-Rs 19,500 per piece.

Who sold these equipment?

According to reports, a company called Trackpoint GPS, a Mumbai-based firm, sold these devices to HDFC Bank customers. The company had an alliance with the bank.

Why the controversy?

Under RBI norms, banks cannot force any customer buy any product. Banks can have tie-ups with suppliers but the sale of products should be optional. Here, the bank allegedly forced the customer to buy the product bundling it with the loan, which is an irregularity. Hence the controversy.

There were allegations that bank’s former auto loan head Ashok Khanna was involved in the GPS issue and subsequently was asked to go. However, the bank clarified that Khanna retired after getting a one-year extension.

ICICI Securities research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank’s Q1FY21 performance was commendable and the management’s narrative was resilient, despite challenges reflected in: 1) Morat 2.0 portfolio at 9% (lowest heard till now), 2) confidence in credit reserves of ~55bps coupled with 76% NPL coverage being sufficient ceteris paribus, 3) digital initiatives, franchise strength and sharp focus helping capture opportunities without compromising quality. Market share gain (21% advance growth), steady NIMs at 4.3% (despite 70bps MCLR cut) and operating cost agility (down 24% YoY ex-employee cost) aided 7% core operating profit growth in the most disrupted quarter. Accelerated recognition of 30bps of advances and expedited provisioning (coverage up 4%) initiated on non-morat pool – though contingency buffer was limited at mere 10bps.

Outlook

Earnings growth of 20% was buoyed by treasury gains of Rs10.9bn. Performance reaffirms our stance that HDFC Bank will lead responsibly and is best positioned to rebound quicker offsetting nearterm weakness. Maintain BUY.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB reported a strong PAT of Rs66.6bn (PLe: Rs64.2bn) amidst COVID-19 lockdown uncertainty, which also prompted it to make additional Rs10bn as provisions leading to a Rs55.0bn of contingency+floating provisions cover. Operating performance was better with PPOP growth of 15% YoY despite losing momentum on core fee income streams to the tune of Rs20bn which was offset by 24% QoQ lower other opex. Bank will continue to build in higher provisioning ahead but prudent risk management gives us comfort on asset quality impact but we have yet to watch outcomes in 2HFY21 as moratorium is likely to end by Aug’20. Strong capital levels (CET1 at 16.7%), strong liabilities flow, agility in managing loan growth and strong provisioning cushion remain the key driving factors for our positive stance.

Outlook

We retain BUY with revised TP of Rs1,265 (from Rs1,105) based on 3.1x (from 2.9x) Mar-22 ABV on slightly tweaking loan growth & credit cost parameters.

YES Securities' research report on HDFC Bank

Earnings and Core PPOP beat of 15% and 5% respectively, driven by lower than anticipated opex (reflecting business modularity). NII growth of 18% and decline in core fees were largely in-line with our expectations. Credit cost was elevated at 1.6% as the bank augmented contingent provisions by Rs10bn, made accelerated provisions on upfronted slippages (<90dpd) and raised overall core PCR to 76%. The Bank continues to accrete capital led by lower risk intensity of incremental growth and sustained high profitability. Only 9% of the bank’s portfolio under moratorium as of 30th June, and 97% comprised 0 dpd (non-delinquent) customers as of 29th Feb. This implies potentially lower NPL flow and higher collectability of moratorium pool. Cheque bounce rate is improving too. With a wide distribution platform, sustained liability accretion and robust capital position, HDFC Bank possesses the ability to push the peddle on growth when market improves.



Outlook

Retain BUY and as the Top Pick in the sector with reinforced conviction. Have raised FY21/22 EPS estimates by 9%/6% with positive tweaks to growth, opex and credit cost assumptions. Stand-alone bank trades at 2.5x/15x FY22 ABV/EPS (Subs value at Rs69/share). We raise 12m TP to Rs1,470 (previous Rs1,300). Demonstrated resilience in growth/profitability and increasing relative attractiveness would lead to a secular re-rating.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank (HDFCB) reported mixed trends in advances growth. While corporate growth was robust at ~38% YoY, retail loan growth declined sequentially. Operating performance remained steady, led by strong NII growth and tight control on opex. In contrast, fee income declined sharply due to the economic slowdown. However, higher treasury gains supported other income. Further, the bank has made contingent provisions of INR10b (v/s INR15.5b in 4QFY20), which increased total contingent provisions to INR40b. While slippages were higher, healthy provisioning enabled an improvement in coverage ratio. We have fine-tuned our estimates to factor in the current trends and estimate HDFCB to deliver 17% earnings CAGR over FY20-22E. Maintain Buy.



Outlook

On the asset quality front, slippages are likely to pick-up during 2HFY21 due to COVID-19 disruption which can keep credit costs elevated however higher provisioning buffers should limit the overall impact on earnings. CEO succession remains an important event in the near term and a key monitorable. Maintain Buy with revised TP of INR1,280 (3.0x FY22E ABV).

Arihant Capital 's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank posted much better than expected Q1FY21 results with Net Interest Income stood at Rs 15,665 Cr increasing by +17.8% YoY/+3.0% QoQ, PPOP stood at Rs 12,829 Cr increasing by +15.1% YoY/down 1.0% QoQ and Net Profit stood at Rs 6,659 Cr, increasing by +19.6% YoY/down 3.9% QoQ. The bank made provisions of Rs 3,892 Cr for Q1FY21 against Rs 3,784 Cr Q4FY20, with Rs 1,000 Cr as contingent provisioning for Covid-19 impact which is in excess of RBI guidelines. On the business front, the bank’s loan book grew by +20.9% YoY/+1.0% QoQ to Rs 10.03 lakh Cr while deposits grew smoothly by +24.6% YoY/+3.7% QoQ to Rs 11.89 lakh Cr on account of the bank’s strong customer loyalty and changed consumption behaviour. The advances growth was driven primarily by the substantial growth in the corporate lending at +37.6% YoY while retail lending growth slowed to +7.2% YoY owing to the bank’s strict credit lending measures.



Outlook

Considering the macro-economic slowdown, we have revised our estimates for the bank’s growth in the near term with loan book growth at below 10% for FY21. We assign a P/Adj. BV multiple of 3.5 for FY22 ABVPS of Rs 359 for a target price of Rs 1,257 per share and recommend ACCUMULATE rating on the stock.

HDFC Bank has reportedly sacked six executives over allegations of corruption and breach of corporate governance standards.

The private sector lender fired six senior and mid-level officials after an internal investigation found that they were involved in corrupt practices, according to a report by ET Now.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

HDFC Bank was looking into allegations of misconduct in its vehicle financing business. However, the bank did not respond to a request for comment by The Economic Times.

HDFC Bank's car loan customers were allegedly forced to buy GPS devices, which were sold by Trackpoint GPS, the report said.

""This is a bank approved product. It's a minuscule portion of the bank's portfolio — hardly 4,000-5,000 of these devices costing Rs 18,000-19,000 each were sold every month. The gross failure for the bank has been its audit which failed to spot the misdoing,"" a source told the publication.

""We had received some whistle-blowing complaints, internal enquiries carried out in the matter on the complaints received has not brought out any conflict of interest issue nor does it have any bearing on our loan portfolio,"" HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri said at the company's annual general meeting (AGM) on July 18.

Sharekhan's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank reported Q1FY21 results, with Operational performance largely in line with expectations; PAT was boosted by higher treasury income even though Core fee income declined. Though asset quality deteriorated slightly as GNPA rose sequentially, a confident management stated that moratorium pie has fallen to ~9% of the total book, which is positive. Balance sheet stays robust, with provision buffer (total provisions at 149% of GNPAs). The succession of Mr. Puri, the MD & CEO, will be keenly watched, but the bank has hinted the successor is likely to be an internal candidate.

Outlook

The bank clarified well on most other uncertainties (recent events, management exits). We retain our Buy rating on the stock with unchanged price target (PT) of Rs. 1,400.

HDFC Bank's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Aditya Puri has said that his preferred successor is an internal candidate who has spent 25 years at the lender. However, he did not name the candidate.

""He (the successor) has been with us for 25 years… my successor was always in place, at least in my mind,"" Puri told shareholders at the bank's virtual AGM held on July 18.

Seeking to assuage concerns on training and business understanding, he also said the candidate has ""learnt very well"".

It can be noted that Puri has been widely credited with building the bank as the most valued one by investors over nearly 26 years, and who succeeds him at the corner office is the subject of intense interest in banking and industry circles.

Earlier this year, a media report said the bank had selected the names of internal candidates Sashidhar Jagdishan and Kaizad Bharucha, and Citi's Sunil Garg as the probable candidates.

""… it is up to the RBI now to decide among what we have given to them,"" Puri said, reiterating that succession was not a problem for the bank.

Jagdishan has been with the bank since 1996 and joined as a manager in the finance function. He was appointed as a ""change agent"" recently and heads the finance, human resources, legal and secretarial, administration, infrastructure, corporate communications and corporate social responsibility functions.

Bharucha has been with the bank since 1995 and presently serves as an executive director in charge of wholesale banking. HDFC Bank is widely recognised as a consumer business-centric bank.

On July 18, Puri also said the economy has sharply recovered after the April trough but warned that the partial lockdowns being implemented across pockets may act as a dampener.

The bank expects further rate cuts of up to 0.50 per cent by the RBI in the near term, Puri said.

According to him, 12 lakh accounts were opened during the lockdown, which was 80 per cent of the pre-lockdown levels, and added that it will get back to the earlier averages by September.

Asserting that no employee has been sacked, Puri said the sales force on the field has been entrusted with the loan collection responsibilities.

As of June 30, 9 per cent of its customers by value had opted for loan moratoriums, he noted.

Jagdishan said in view of the huge quantum of payments transactions that it outsources, the bank has taken a USD 100 million cyber cover, making it one of the few lenders to have such a cover.",442,-0.9999959468841553

HDFC Bank's Managing Director and Chief Executive Aditya Puri on July 18 said ""disciplinary action"" has been taken against a few employees from the auto loans business for exhibiting ""personal misconduct"". The remarks by Puri in an address to shareholders came amid reports about the circumstances under which the head of the auto loan business retired in March and also about probes reportedly initiated by the bank to ascertain conflict of interest.

Addressing his last annual general meeting after building the bank into the second largest by assets in India, and the most valued by investors, Puri denied there being any ""conflict of interest"" found by a probe launched following whistleblower complaints.

""Enquiry did bring out another aspect related to personal misconduct exhibited by a set of individuals for which appropriate disciplinary actions have been taken,"" Puri said.

""(Ashok) Khanna being head of the referred business segment had also participated in the enquiry process,"" he said.

Puri also seemed to suggest that there was no ""co-relation"" between the misconduct of a few employees, the state of the auto loans portfolio or any losses suffered.

Auto loans contributed a fifth of the bank's retail loans and a tenth of its overall assets. Outstanding auto loans reduced to Rs 81,082 crore as of June 2020, from Rs 83,935 crore in March and Rs 81,913 crore in the year-ago period.

Seeking to allay concerns over two more senior managerial exits, Puri said its chief information officer Munish Mittal has left to pursue further studies at Oxford after spending 25 years at the bank and achieving a set of milestones given to him after he expressed a desire to move on.

Another executive left to join a spiritual group after choosing a successor to hand over the charge, Puri said, making it clear that these are not unexpected exits happening due to his departure from the bank in October.

Puri admitted to have received a communication from the Reserve Bank to pay Rs 200 crore in the Altico Capital matter, in line with the reports in a section of media, which said the lender has been asked to pay UAE's Mashreq Bank.

Seeing a stress in the realty-focused lender, HDFC Bank had netted off Altico's money held by it in a fixed deposit to cover its exposure in the lender in September 2019, leading to a controversy where it's conduct was denounced as ""selfish"" by its larger rival SBI.

""We appropriated the money based on sound legal advice. However, since the regulator has directed us to repay, we are going ahead and doing that,” Puri said.

“We (HDFC Bank) will then come pari passu with the rest of the creditors and we will also get our share (for the loan exposures),” Puri added.",469,-0.8758255044619242

The amount was debited from non-banking finance company (NBFC) Altico Capital’s account in September 2019 to write off the NBFC's bad loans.

HDFC Bank had debited the amount through an external commercial borrowing (ECB) from Dubai-based Mashreq Bank. Altico had parked the sum originally raised from Mashreq with the Indian private sector lender, Mint reported.

HDFC's action came after Altico showed signs of stress and in early September 2019 its long-term and short-term issuer ratings were downgraded by India Ratings from AA- to A+ and A1+ to A1, respectively. The ratings agency had cited “continued pressure on real estate sector … stretched working capital cycle for real estate borrowers … and diluted liquidity buffers on balance sheet” as reasons for the downgrades.

Altico then defaulted on a close to Rs 20 crore interest payment to Mashreq Bank followed by a series of defaults which led to management action.

Altico and Mashreq Bank accused HDFC Bank of “violating regulatory provisions"" for its actions and approached the RBI. A source told the paper that Altico sought to change its owner to SSG Capital from the existing Varde Partners, Abu Dhabi Investment Council and Clearwater Capital Partners and had filed an application with the central bank for the same.

India's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank is expected to report double-digit growth in profit, net interest income as well as pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) for the quarter ended June 2020.

According to brokerages, profit could grow in the range of 13-18 percent for the quarter compared to the corresponding period last fiscal supported by lower tax rate, but elevated provisions may limit growth in profitability.

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, is likely to increase 14-18 percent driven by strong 21 percent loan growth in June quarter 2020 YoY, while deposits growth was 25 percent YoY partly due to Yes Bank concerns.

""We expect loan growth to be strong but a cautious outlook on growth to continue. Retail loan growth may be optically slower due to weak volume growth in auto, while growth in the unsecured portfolio may remain strong,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees profit growth of over 18 percent YoY and NII growth of 14 percent.

Asset quality may slightly weaken during the quarter on a sequential basis, while the provisions may remain elevated due to COVID-19.

Top five private sector banks may see their slippages double to 5 percent this fiscal due to the poor loan offtake and the moratorium-driven contraction in net interest margins, warns a report.

These five banks-- HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank--collectively control a quarter of the system and three-fourths of the private banking space, according to a report by India Ratings on Friday.

""We forecast FY21 slippages to nearly double to around 5 percent for these banks from 2.3 percent in FY19 and 2.7 percent in FY20, even though net slippages would be lower if refinancing remains a challenge, resulting in a 4 percent contraction in their net interest margin,"" says the report.

As loan demand remains tepid, banks are parking their excess liquidity in low yielding alternatives such as government bonds and top-rated corporate securities due to their higher credit risk perception and widening duration spreads, even as deposit inflows have been robust.

On the other hand, growth in deposits for these top five private banks in FY20 was 18.8 percent which was 18.5 percent in FY19, while loan growth declined to 15 percent from 19.1 percent during this period.

Additionally, the Reserve Bank has injected Rs 1.7 lakh crore of liquidity into the system over the last six months through open market operations and secondary market purchases.

Without quantifying, the report expects a significant spike in delinquent assets due to the deep troubles the economy is facing due to the impact of the GDP destruction on the banking sector in the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally, banks have moved a large amount of the surplus liquidity into reverse repo where the rates have declined by 215 bps in the last one year, yielding 3.35 percent and with cost of funds falling to 5-6 percent, this could result in a negative carry.

Over FY17-FY20, net advances of these five private banks and bank credit grew at a CAGR of 15.7 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively, while the unsecured retail portfolio grew at a CAGR of 21.8 percent, and these give banks have increased the proportion of unsecured retail portfolio over the same period.

Analysts at the agency also expect pre-provisioning operating profit or operating buffers of these lenders to be about 80 bps lower than their steady state pre-provisioning operating profit, which in FY20 was 4.9 percent which may curtail their ability to withstand credit costs without capital erosion, the report warned.

Analysts at the agency attributed fall in operating buffers as outcomes of lower portfolio yields due to an increase in slippages; poor loan growth and transaction volumes and the resultant lower fee and other income; slower pace of repricing for deposits reflecting the falling interest rates; and higher liquidity deployed in low earning government securities or under reverse repos.

Stating that the impact of the rising bad loans “will not be benign,” the report notes that this comes at a time when sector was putting its house in order after the last six painful years on the corporate side, even though retail, SME and agri loans were already showing up pain areas before the pandemic hit all of us.",540,-0.7744582951068878

HDFC Bank’s loan against gold jewellery book grew to over Rs 6,200 crore in FY 2019-20 from around Rs 5,900 crore in FY 2018-19, according to the bank’s latest annual report.

Sterlite Power on Monday said HDFC Bank has refinanced a loan for its Gurugram Palwal Transmission Ltd project, leading to around 300 basis points reduction in the interest cost. The project became fully operational in April 2020.

The new financing to prepay the existing project loan of Rs 800 crore has been arranged by HDFC Bank, Sterlite Power said in a statement.

The new facility has been availed at significantly favourable terms demonstrating the considerably improved risk profile of the project post achievement of CoD (Date of Commercial Operation).

With this transaction, Sterlite Power has achieved a reduction of almost 300 basis points in the interest cost to be incurred by the project on a per annum basis.

The refinancing of this critical ISTS (Interstate Transmission System) project also highlights the keen interest of financial institutions in funding power transmission projects with stable long-term cash flows.

Pratik Agarwal, Managing Director, Sterlite Power, said that the refinancing is a ""testimony of the continued trust reposed on us by the banking and investor community for our ability to deliver challenging projects on time, with the highest standards of quality and safety, while delivering strong returns”.

Successfully commissioned in the month of April 2020, the GPTL project connects 2,000 MW additional power to Gurugram and Palwal areas in the state of Haryana.

Apart from making Gurugram DG-set free, this project will enable access to reliable power for more than 3 million households in the state. This project has implemented India's first vertical GIS substations built at Prithla, Kadarpur and Sohna.

Apart from saving land, this innovation has resulted in offsetting more than 18,000 tons of CO2 emissions each year as compared to conventional layout of a similar GIS substation.",296,0.8889087012835911

Dolat Capital's research report on HDFC Bank

The bank’s annual report analysis shows stable to improving metrics – sharp decline in RWA/total assets, higher RoRWA (also led by lower tax rate), lower off-balance sheet exposure, well matched ALM, improving business productivity & operating leverage, lower deposit concentration (though advances concentration has increased), and decline in exposure to vulnerable sectors. Improvement in headline asset quality (by 10 bps YoY to 1.3%)was largely driven by elevated write-offs during the year, leading to higher credit costs. Despite increased lending towards lower yielding corporate loans during the year, the bank has managed to keep a sharp eye on return on assets, partly also driven by improved operating leverage, higher treasury gains and lower tax rates. Digitization remains a focus area, helping the bank improve customer experience and enhance operational efficiencies.



Outlook

Even as financials deteriorate in the interim, we believe the Bank is well positioned to gain market. Its healthy PPoP profile and high provisioning buffers supports RoA of 1.5%, even as we factor in doubling of slippages for FY21E (from FY20). We maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a SOTP-based TP of Rs1,300 based on 3.3x FY22E P/ABV for standalone entity and the value of its subsidiaries, implying 3.4x of FY22E P/ABV. The stock currently trades at 2.7x FY22E ABV.

The largest and most profitable private sector bank in India has also been the most consistent performer on the Street delivering 20 percent plus profit growth for many quarters and years.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on HDFC Bank

HDFCB's Annual Report underscores structural improvement in the bank's profitability, driven by a 20bp increase in RoRWA, higher than a 7bp improvement witnessed in RoA. For FY20, NII/PPoP grew by 17%/23% while PAT grew by 25% YoY to INR263b with the bank reporting a RoE of 16.4%. - The bank has gained market share across multiple digital channels, with 17% market share in POS terminals, ~8%/~29% share in debit/credit card spend, and a credit card base of 14.5m (25.1% share). ~95% of transactions happen digitally, owing to which the bank has shown continuous improvement in its cost ratios. - On the asset quality front, agri slippages stood elevated and segmental GNPA in the priority sector increased to 4.3% v/s 1.3% for the bank. The bank further witnessed a GNPA increase in the Services segment at 1.4% v/s 1.1% in FY19. Furthermore, the concentration of the top four NPA accounts increased to ~10% v/s 6.5% in FY19. - In FY20, RWA density improved 560bp, driven by a reduction in risk weights on personal loans (to 100% from 125%) and focused lending to better rated corporate/retail customers. The concentration of the top 20 advances increased 100bp to 11.6% on higher growth in wholesale assets, and the concentration of the top 20 depositors improved ~210bp to 4%. - We note that attrition among the top employees (salaries of >INR10m) has increased over the past two years, with ~10% of such employees leaving the bank in FY20 after an average of ~14 years of service. This remains a key monitorable as the bank would also soon witness a CEO change. -



Outlook

We expect HDFCB to deliver strong business growth, led by improved digital offerings. On the asset quality front, although slippages are likely to remain elevated, impacted by COVID-19, strong provisioning buffers should limit the overall impact on earnings. The CEO's succession remains an important observable in the near term. Maintain Buy, with TP of INR1,250 (3.0x FY22E ABV).

HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri took home a total remuneration of Rs 18.9 crore in the fiscal year 2019-20, according to the latest annual report released by the bank. This figure is around 38 percent higher than what the bank offered Puri in the previous financial year, which is Rs 13.7 crore.

Puri’s remuneration of Rs 18.9 crore is excluding the value of the stock options exercised during the year which is about Rs 161 crore. This is including the stock options granted and vested over several previous years, but exercised during FY19, the report showed. The remuneration includes value of perquisites worth Rs 2.1 crore.

Kaizad Bharucha, the executive director of HDFC Bank, earned a total of Rs 8.6 crore in FY20 compared with Rs 5.8 crore in FY19, or an increase of 48 percent. Bharucha’s compensation includes Rs 80 lakh of worth of perquisites while it excludes Rs 31.6 crore worth stock options exercised in FY19. In other words, HDFC Bank paid a total of Rs 27.5 crore to two of its top executives in FY19.

Gopinath earned the highest remuneration among all independent directors. Malay Patel drew the second highest among independent directors at Rs 43.5 lakh, followed by Umesh Chandra Sarangi (Rs 31 lakh), Sanjiv Sachar (Rs 33 lakh), Sandeep Parekh (Rs 31 lakh) and M D Ranganath (Rs 36.5 lakh).

How much SBI executives earned?

Rajnish Kumar, the chairman of India’s largest bank, State Bank of India (SBI) earned Rs 31.2 lakh in 2019-20, which includes a basic salary of Rs 27 lakh and DA of Rs 4.2 lakh, according to the bank’s latest annual report. Among the managing directors (MDs) of SBI, Parveen Kumar Gupta drew Rs 41.3 lakh in FY20 (of which Rs 11 lakh was leave encashment paid) and Dinesh Kumar Khara earned Rs 29.4 lakh. Arijit Basu, another MD, drew Rs 28.5 lakh.

The wage disparity between the public and the private sectors, however, is not limited to banks. The government has not acted to reform the pay structure so far except for a few tweaks. There is another view that pay reform alone doesn’t make sense unless a level playing field is granted to all banks.

""There is no point in comparing the salaries of private and public sector bankers for obvious reasons. This difference is visible across industries, not just banking,"" said a former PSB chairman on condition of anonymity.

In August 2016, former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan called attention to the issue when he said salaries of top level employees of the public sector, including RBI, are way short of global standards.

""One of the problems, of course, is that the public sector overpays at the bottom but underpays at the top. I also feel underpaid,"" Rajan said.

The debate on the relatively lower pay scales of PSB officials was revived recently when the SBI chairman jokingly made a comment on the issue. In a recent conference call with analysts, Kumar was asked if his bank would undertake a pay cut for employees. Pat came Kumar’s reply: ""Road pe aake rehna padega, pehle hi itni kam milti hai (I'll have to live on road, I already get so less).”",570,0.4094228545824687

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Even as digital payments took a dip during the period of virtual standstill amid the COVID-19-led lockdown, retail digital payments for the fiscal year 2019-20 saw 70 percent year-on-year growth touching $520 billion. The share of such payments amounts to nearly 20 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), as against 5 percent of GDP three years ago, as per a report by Morgan Stanley.

The report noted that this exponential growth in digital payment trends is led by unified payments interface (UPI) coupled with continued strong traction in card payments. The share of UPI in overall retail digital payments stands at around 55 percent, with the report pointing out that a further spike in its usage is expected once a WhatsApp universal version is launched.

""The rising share of digital payments is also reflected in lower ATM withdrawals/Cheque Usage. ATM withdrawals grew 4% in F20 (~ 13% CAGR over past three years) and amounts to 17% of GDP,"" the report said.

Even as traditional retail payment modes like credit and debit cards are losing their share in the overall picture, their year-on-year growth continues to be strong. Meanwhile the new-age digital payment options--mobile wallets, RuPay cards, etc-- are also gaining traction, according to the report.

Large lenders in India like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and even SBI have taken the lead in different modes. While HDFC Bank has shown strong market share gains with respect to digital transactions like National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT), SBI has posted strong gains with respect to mobile banking transactions. HDFC Bank has also shown higher and improving spends per debit card in the last fiscal.

However, after a temporary moderation in digital payment trends in April this year, there has been a recovery with the reducing impact of the nationwide lockdown in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, the report noted that UPI payments, after having declined 7 percent month-on-month in March and 27 percent in April, registered a strong rebound of 44 percent in May this year.

HDFC Bank MD and CEO Aditya Puri has said Indian GDP will recover ""very fast"" and pointed out that it is essential to get the growth rate back to the pre-COVID levels.

The largest lender in the private sector will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic ""way way stronger"" than it ever was, Puri said in an e-mail to the bank's employees earlier this month.

It can be noted that the economy is widely expected to contract in FY21, with some analysts pegging the GDP to decline by 5 percent. The entire first quarter has been a washout due to the continuing lockdowns with only essential services being allowed to operate.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""The COVID crisis is a health crisis which killed supply and over a period of time demand as well. However, I am confident in the future of India and even brighter future of HDFC Bank. The GDP and the country will recover very fast,"" Puri, the founder chief executive of the lender who has been at the helm for 25 years, said.

The key factor, Puri said, is for the economic growth rate to come back to the pre-COVID levels very quickly.

He said companies with a good strategy, technology, capital, liquidity and a motivated team will emerge as winners after the crisis.

""I am confident that we will emerge from COVID way way stronger in the market than we ever were,"" he said.

The CEO also said the bank is one of the few companies which has maintained bonuses, increments and salary in these difficult times.

Puri, who is scheduled to retire in October, said the bank has an excess liquidity of $2 billion, a high capital adequacy of 17.5 percent and trained manpower.

He further said the bank will complete a technology transformation by September which will make dealings with customers frictionless.

There has been a decline in total loan book under moratorium during the extension period.

Almost 50 percent of customers had opted for moratorium initially just to conserve cash, Macquarie said as reported by CNBC-TV18.

For HDFC, the retail loan book under moratorium was at 7 percent as of June 15 against 21 percent in May, and small portion of this 7 percent is new customers opting for moratorium in the second round, the brokerage added.

One reason for this is white-collar labour has not lost jobs as much as feared, said the global brokerage.

On March 27, the Reserve Bank of India had announced the loan moratorium for three-month period (March-May) for all term loans extended by all lending institutions. The central bank in May extended the moratorium for another three months till August, given the extended lockdown due to rising coronavirus infections.

Under the scheme, the borrowers can avoid paying EMIs to banks without worrying that these loans turn to NPAs (non-performing assets).

HDFC in its BSE filing on May 25 had said in accordance with the directions by the Reserve Bank of India, the Corporation had offered the moratorium to customers whose loans were standard as at February 29, 2020.

""The corporation had adopted an 'opt-in' structure for the moratorium. As of date, approximately 26 percent of the Corporation's loans under management have opted for the moratorium. Individual loans under moratorium account for 21 percent of the individual loan portfolio,"" it added.

Macquarie believes worries about large-scale retail defaults are exaggerated.

""A bank with large market share in fast-tags saw activity levels at 75 percent of pre-COVID levels. In fact, the housing activity in non-metros is picking up,"" said the brokerage.

HDFC itself said the traction in June w.r.t housing loan has surprised positively and applications as of June 15 are 50 percent of what was seen in entire month of June 2019, as per the brokerage.

HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are its top picks in the sector, Macquarie said.

India's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank on Wednesday said its consumer finance loans are growing and the amount disbursed has got back to the pre-COVID levels of Rs 1,000 crore a month.

The Mumbai-headquartered lender's country head for consumer finance Parag Rao said changes in lifestyle due to aspects like lockdowns and work from home has created additional demand for items such as television sets, laptops, Wi-Fi routers and even vacuum cleaners, which the bank is funding at present.

It can be noted that driving consumption demand in the economy has been one of the toughest challenges which policymakers are grappling with, and economists have expressed concerns about the same.

Acknowledging that a part of the traction being witnessed by the bank is pent-up demand, Rao said there is a ""set of consumer appliances where demand is going up"".

In April, the consumer finance business had fallen by 80-85 percent and recovered to the March levels in May, even though the non-lockdown conditions prevailed for only ten days.

Rao, who also heads the credit card and payments verticals, said traditional high ticket expenditures in categories like air tickets and hotel bookings is not present as the services continue to be shut and it will take time for the same to jump back to the old levels.

From an expenditure perspective, shares of small value transactions have gone up as a share of the overall pie, Rao said.

As against 8-9 percent earlier, the small value spends of up to Rs 500 generally made for daily errands now account for nearly a fourth of the overall card spending on the reduced denominator, Rao said.

""People are pulling out their cards for more number of occasions and hence, activity on cards has gone up,” he said.

The upcoming fintech players are competitors but not disruptors, he asserted, adding that emergence of newer players helps broaden the market opportunity.

""The yeoman's job which this competition is doing is I think it is expanding the market,"" he said.

He said HDFC Bank is a full service bank offering an entire suite of products, including payments and deemed to suggest sustainability is important for the lender.

If the recent proposals by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to limit the terms of the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of private banks become a rule, HDFC Bank boss Aditya Puri’s record as the longest-serving private bank CEO will remain unbroken.

Puri has served as the CEO of HDFC Bank from 1994, meaning he has completed 26 years. Puri’s term is ending in October. The bank is yet to finalise a successor for the outgoing chief. The nearest contender to break Puri’s record is Kotak Mahindra Bank’s promoter and CEO, Uday Kotak, who has completed 17 years as bank chief. Kotak is the chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank since 2003-2004, when the bank started operations.

The RBI has proposed to limit the tenures of the promoters of private banks as CEOs and Whole Time Directors (WTDs) to 10 years if the person is from the promoter group and 15 years if from the non-promoter group. The RBI said it wants to do so “to build a robust culture of sound governance practice, professional management of banks and to adopt the principle of separating ownership from management, it is desirable to limit the tenure of the WTDs (whole-time directors) or CEOs.”

Also, the RBI has proposed to limit the upper age limit for CEO/WTDs of banks at 70 years. Going by this, Kotak had another nine years in the bank (he is currently 61). This would have meant that Kotak will match Puri’s tenure as CEO or even beat his record.

But, if RBI’s new proposals are cleared as guidelines, Kotak will have to end his term by 2022 or 2023.

Shyam Srinivasan, MD&CEO of Kerala-based Federal Bank and RBL Bank MD& CEO, Vishwavir Ahuja, both will have time till 2025 as both officials have completed a decade in their roles as chief executives. Similarly, Chandrashekhar Ghosh of Bandhan Bank has completed five years as CEO of the Kolkata-based bank, meaning he will have ten more years (non-promoter CEOs are allowed for 15 years), before his term comes to end, which is 2030.

The RBI has promised two years, or till the expiry of their tenure, whichever comes later, to the whole time directors and CEOs from the date of guidelines to identify a successor. After their tenure comes to an end, the CEOs/WTDs need to wait till the expiration of three years before re-appointment. “During this three-year period the individual shall not be appointed or associated with the bank in any capacity, either directly or indirectly, advisory or otherwise,” the RBI said.

Earlier in 2020, Uday Kotak and RBI had a court battle over Kotak's promoter stake holding in the bank. The RBI norms stipulated that Kotak had to pare promoter stake below 20 percent before December 31, 2018 from around 30 percent.

To achieve compliance, in August 2018, the bank announced the completion of perpetual noncumulative preference share issue (PNCPS), which it interpreted as cutting the promoter stake to 19.7 percent. The bank claimed it is complying with the RBI licencing norms through this deal. But here the RBI posed a question.

The regulator said preference share allotment route wasn’t sufficient to meet promoter dilution rule requirement. But the bank’s legal argument was PNCPS was part of the paid-up capital. With the impasse continuing and the deadline for stake dilution fast approaching, KMB finally decided to move the High Court of Bombay. In January, the RBI let KMB retain the 26 percent promoter stake with some riders.

The RBI said the promoters, Uday Kotak and family, while retaining 26 percent stake, need to cap the voting rights at 15 percent by April. KMB withdrew the case subsequently and some interpreted this as a win for Uday Kotak. In June, Kotak sold 5.6 crore shares for more than Rs 6,900 crore in a block deal, bringing down his stake to 26.1 percent, inching closer to the RBI’s stipulated level.

While this was an out-of-court settlement, some interpreted this as a win for Kotak at the end of the bitter court battle. It is an irony that under the proposed CEO-term rules of the central bank, Kotak is the worst hit private bank promoter.

Also, it is worth noting that the RBI has set up an internal group to review the ownership and control of private banks.

The internal working group will examine and review the extant licensing and regulatory guidelines relating to ownership and control, promoters’ holding, requirement of dilution, control and voting rights, etc, the RBI said. The working group comprises Prasanna Kumar Mohanty, Director, Central Board of RBI, Sachin Chaturvedi, Director Central Board of RBI, Lily Vadera, Executive Director, RBI, SC Murmu, Executive Director, RBI, Shrimohan Yadav, Chief General Manager, RBI, the central bank said in a release on June 12.

It is likely that the RBI group will relook at the promoter holding which means that existing promoters will have to yet again tweak their stake holdings in the respective banks yet again.",838,-0.6226821541786194
