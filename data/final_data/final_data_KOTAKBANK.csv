Shares of private sector lenders like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank and IDFC First Bank traded flat on November 21 morning battered down by the Reserve Bank of India’s move to put a leash on unsecured consumer loans that extended to both banks and non-banking financial corporations (NBFCs). NBFC major, Bajaj Finance, was marginally higher by 0.6 percent.

The Bank Nifty index traded mildly in green, up 0.3 percent as against 0.5 percent rise in the Nifty50, as of 1:40 pm.

Since the RBI directive, shares of HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank was up 0.5 perent and down 0.4 percent, respectively till November 21, but ICICI Bank and IDFC First Bank shares slipped 1 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively in the past three trading sessions.

NBFC major Bajaj Finance also suffered as shares tanked as much as 4 percent since the RBI directive. The bearish sentiment was further amplified after the central bank suspended its two products - eCOM and Insta EMI Card.

The poor performance across banking names reflected how investors viewed these banking names with regard to their exposure to unsecured retail lending. As per a Jefferies report, IDFC First Bank's exposure to personal loans, credit cards, and estimated loans to non-banking financial corporations (NBFCs) stood at 19 percent, 3 percent, and 24 percent, respectively.

On the other hand, ICICI Bank's exposure to personal loans, credit cards, and estimated NBFC loans stood at 9 percent, 7 percent, and 20 percent, respectively.

Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank, however, had lower exposure to unsecured consumer loans compared to peers like ICICI Bank and IDFC First Bank.

The central bank revised its risk-weight for unsecured consumer loans, encompassing personal loans and credit card loans. Consumer credit, excluding housing, education, vehicle, and jewellery loans, will now attract 125 percent risk-weight assets (RWA). Credit cards for banks will see an increase in RWA to 150 percent from 125 percent earlier.

For NBFCs, the RBI had increased the risk weight on consumer credit exposure of NBFCs to 125 percent from 100 percent.

Banking firms HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank may see minimal impact on their Tier-1 capital levels following the increase in risk weights for unsecured consumer loans by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), thanks to their adequate capital levels and inexpensive valuations, said analysts.

“We believe both HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are well-capitalised currently, with no immediate need to raise capital despite the RBI’s new risk-weight norms. The impact of these regulations is likely to be limited. We estimate just about 55-90 basis points (bps) impact on their CET-1 capital adequacy ratio (CAR),” said Dnyanada Vaidya, Senior Research Analyst – Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), Axis Securities.

HDFC Bank’s CAR stood at 17 percent, while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s CAR stood at 21 percent, suggested data. Both banks’ capital was at healthy levels as per the RBI mandate, which requires private sector lenders to maintain at least 8 percent of CAR levels with the central bank.

On November 17, the RBI revised its risk weight for unsecured consumer loans, encompassing personal loans and credit card loans. Consumer credit, excluding housing, education, vehicle, and jewellery loans, will now attract 125 percent risk-weight assets (RWA). On the other hand, credit cards for banks will see an increase in RWA to 150 percent from 125 percent earlier.

On the overall banking system, VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said that lenders would be able to easily pass on the increased cost to borrowers, without seeing any major drag on their profit pool.

Where do HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank stand against peers?

According to a Jefferies report, HDFC Bank’s exposure to personal loans stood at 8 percent of its total loan book as compared to ICICI Bank’s 9 percent, IDFC First Bank's 19 percent, and State Bank of India's (SBI) 10 percent. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s exposure to personal loans, on the other hand, was the lowest at 5 percent.

On the credit card loan front, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank were at 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Other lenders like ICICI Bank's credit card loan exposure stood at 4 percent, IDFC First Bank at 1 percent, and Axis Bank at 4 percent.

That apart, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank's estimated loans to NBFCs were at 1 percent and 5 percent, respectively. Compared to other lenders, estimated loans to NBFCs for IDFC First Bank was at 3 percent, ICICI Bank at 7 percent, SBI at 8 percent, and Canara Bank at 11 percent.

According to Jefferies report, IDFC First Bank and ICICI Bank may require additional capital consumption of 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively, whereas Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank's additional capital consumption would be 0.6 percent post the RBI's new risk-weight norms.

Finally, the revised tier-1 CAR suggested ICICI Bank will take hit of about 74 bps and IDFC First Bank would take a hit of 80 bps, the Jefferies note added. Meanwhile, Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC Bank would see a hit of up to 60 bps.

What should investors do?

Following the RBI’s tightening over unsecured retail lending, shares of HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank remained flat in the past two trading sessions. ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and IDFC First Bank, however, declined up to 4 percent during the same period.

Kaitav Shah, lead BFSI analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional Equities, believes that this knee-jerk reaction across banking names is only temporary in nature and investor sentiment is likely to improve over the medium term.

“We maintain a ‘buy’ call on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of Rs 2,095 in the next one year. For HDFC Bank, we call a ‘hold’ rating with a target price of Rs 1,698 per share,” Shah added.

Valuation-wise, HDFC Bank was trading at an attractive 20 times (x) price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, lower than sector’s PE mean of 24x. Kotak Mahindra Bank, too, was inexpensive at a 20x PE ratio.

ICICI Securities research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) has reported a mixed set of Q2FY24 result with strong growth, but steep decline in NIM. More importantly, RBI has approved the candidature of Mr Ashok Vaswani (ex-Barclays / Citigroup) as MD & CEO of the bank for three years. Appointment of Mr Vaswani brings clarity on management succession. However, appointment of an external candidate appears to be in contrast to street expectations. This may also mean management transition and cultural acclimatisation could be a long-drawn process, in our view.

Outlook

While the current valuations are in-expensive in comparison to historical mean, the stock is likely to remain sideways till investors get comfortable with the new MD & CEO’s broad vision and strategy. Maintain HOLD with revised TP of INR 1,800 (vs INR 1,850 earlier).

Motilal Oswal's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB reported a mixed quarter, with a 4% beat in PAT and a 35bp QoQ drop in NIM. Standalone PAT grew 24% YoY to INR32b, driven by higher fee income and trading gains of INR1.5b. Consolidated PAT grew 24% YoY to INR44.6b. NII grew 23% YoY to INR63b (in line), aided by stronger-than-expected loan growth (19% YoY) as NIMs moderated 35bp QoQ. Deposit growth was steady, though the CASA mix moderated 70bp QoQ due to a shift in SA deposits toward the newly launched ActivMoney product. Gross slippages increased 9% QoQ to INR13b; however, healthy recoveries and upgrades enabled 5bp/3bp improvements in GNPA/NNPA ratios to 1.72%/0.37%. The RBI has approved the appointment of Mr. Ashok Vaswani as the next MD & CEO of the bank for three years. Mr. Vaswani has over three-and-ahalf decades of experience working at multinational banks, initially at Citigroup and more recently at Barclays in executive positions. We believe that execution under the new CEO will remain a key monitorable to assess the stock’s performance over the near term.

Outlook

We increase our FY24/FY25 PAT estimates by 5%/7%, reflecting strong other income and controlled opex. Maintain Neutral with a TP of INR1,900.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Notwithstanding the sharp dip in NIMs (35bps QoQ) to 5.2%, KMB reported in-line PAT of Rs31.8bn/RoA of 2.5%. We believe the RBI’s recent rebuke on unsecured loans (11% of loans) could slightly weigh on growth/margin. Further, KMB’s Covid provision buffer stands low at 0.2% of loans vs 0.6-1.2% for peers and thus calls for higher provisions. We trim our estimates for FY25-26 a tad, and expect the bank to report moderate RoA/RoE of 2.1%/13%, respectively. The RBI has surprisingly given approval for the appointment of Ashok Vaswani (ex-Citi/Barclays), who has expertise in the Consumer, Corporate and Digital Banking space and has superseded KMB’s internal candidates (EDs). As the bank’s new MD & CEO, Mr Vaswani has the tall task of managing senior-management attrition/business dislocation (typically seen post top-management changes in banks) and filling the larger shoes of ex-CEO Uday Kotak.

Outlook

Factoring-in management transition-related risks, we cut TP multiple to 2.6x Sep-25E ABV from 2.8x Jun-25E ABV for the core bank and value the subsidiary at Rs480/share, leading to TP of Rs1,955/share (earlier Rs2,000) for KMB. We retain HOLD on the stock. The RBI not having yet objected to Uday Kotak’s non-executive, non-independent board seat should provide some relief, though.

The appointment of Ashok Vaswani as the new Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank is likely to be beneficial in the long run as the bank aims to achieve technological advancement to provide superior customer services, experts said.

They added that the new MD and CEO will have the big task of managing senior management attrition/business dislocation, if any. “We believe the new MD and CEO has a tall task on his hands to manage senior management attrition/business dislocation, if any, typically seen post top-management changes in banks,” said Emkay Research in a report on October 23.

According to the Religare Broking report, the appointment is a positive update for the bank as it will reduce the uncertainty regarding the top management of the bank.

On October 21, Kotak Mahindra Bank, in an exchange filing said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approved the appointment of Ashok Vaswani as the MD and CEO of the Bank under Section 35B of the Banking Regulation Act, 2013.

The new MD and CEO will take charge with effect from a date not later than January 1, 2024, as per the BSE exchange filing by the private lender.

Experts believe that it will help technological advancement of the bank because Vaswani brings in experience from consumer banking and specialises in leveraging technology for the company.

Vaswani has a three-and-a-half-decade experience with the CitiGroup, and more recently with Barclays.

Uday Kotak, founder of the bank, tweeted, “I am delighted that the RBI has approved our recommendation, Ashok Vaswani, as the next CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank. Ashok is a world class leader and banker with digital and customer focus. I am proud that we bring a ‘Global Indian’ home to build Kotak and India of tomorrow.”

“He brings with him significant executional experience with a high degree of compliance and industrial strength across corporate and consumer businesses,” the Kotak Bank exchange filing said.

At Barclays Bank, UK, Vaswani was associated as the Chief Executive Officer of their Global Consumer, Private, Corporate and Payments business and was a member of the group executive committee.

Prior to that, Vaswani was CEO, Citigroup Asia Pacific and a member of the Citigroup Global Operating & Management Committees.

Emkay Research report further said that it is unclear if Vaswani was the bank’s preferred recommendation or if his appointment was an unanticipated RBI decision.

This is because it was earlier expected that this position would be taken over by a top official internally. At the time, Kotak Mahindra Bank had shortlisted two names as possible successors to Kotak’s successor.

KMB saw a good quarter; core PPoP beat PLe by 12.5% owing to better NIM, fees and lower opex. Momentum continues in loan growth (+6.0% QoQ) that was broad based. Asset quality saw a minor blip as gross slippages were higher. SA was flat QoQ as focus is on scaling up ‘AcitvMoney’ and aim is to retain SA customers at rates lower to TD. Overhang relating to MD&CEO position goes away with Mr. Ashok Vaswani being approved by RBI. His nomination suggests bank’s long term focus on digital retail banking. KMB is a solid banking franchise with strong balance sheet, prudent credit practices and attractive RoA profile of 2.2-2.3% (ICICIB 2.0%).

Outlook

However, over last 2-3 years, earnings quality of ICICIB has been superior with likely core RoE at 17% (KMB 14%). We trim multiple to 3.3x (3.5x earlier) but roll forward to Sep’25 core ABV, maintaining SOTP based TP at Rs2,250. Retain ‘BUY’

Here are a few things, you need to know about Vaswani

Vaswani has a three-and-a-half-decade experience with Citi Group, and more recently with Barclays.

“He brings with him significant executional experience with a high degree of compliance and industrial strength across Corporate and Consumer businesses,” the Kotak Bank exchange filing said.

At Barclays Bank, UK, Vaswani was associated as the Chief Executive Officer of their Global Consumer, Private, Corporate and Payments business and a member of the group executive committee.

Prior to this, Vaswani was CEO, Citigroup Asia Pacific and a member of the Citigroup Global Operating & Management Committees.

According to the exchange filing, the new MD and CEO of the private lender is currently President of Pagaya Technologies Ltd, a US-Israeli AI fintech. Vaswani is also on the Board of the London Stock Exchange Group, the SP Jain Institute of Global Management, UK, and supports various philanthropic organisations, including Pratham, and Lend-A-Hand.

Kotak Bank’s earnings

Kotak Mahindra Bank on October 21 reported a net profit of Rs 3,191 crore for the July-September FY24 quarter, up 23.66 percent from Rs 2,581 crore clocked in the year-ago period.

The net profit beat the market estimates of Rs 3,092 crore.

The net interest income (NII) at Rs 6,297 crore, rose 23.49 percent from Rs 5,099 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. The NII also came slightly higher than the market estimate of Rs 6,226 crore.

The bank's gross non-performing asset (NPA) stood at 1. 72 percent, down from 2.08 percent recorded in the same quarter last year. On the other hand, net NPA for the quarter stood at 0.37 percent, improving from 0.55 percent on a year-on-year basis.",502,0.9658413330713908

The Street was taken by a surprise when Kotak Mahindra Bank picked Ashok Vaswani as managing director and chief executive officer. The chatter in the industry was that Kotak will nominate one of the insiders for the post keeping in mind the continuity of the bank’s working culture. But, finally, it chose an outsider for the corner office.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) too has always pitched for an arm’s length between the promoters and the management of private banks. Over the years, the banking regulator has been pushing promoters of private lenders to cut promoter stake and stay away from leading executive positions beyond a certain period to ensure good governance and avoid conflict of interest.

But, for the bigger ambitions of the bank, Vaswani’s appointment is a step in the right direction. Vaswani coming on board will enable the lender to progress on its digital journey and prepare for its global ambitions. The banker is known to build digital banking businesses in MNC companies and is thoroughly familiar with the latest innovations in digital banking and artificial intelligence.

The international banker is seasoned for over three decades in the industry,

initially at Citigroup and, more recently as the chief executive of Barclays Bank, UK, and subsequently the CEO of their global consumer, private, corporate and payments businesses. Vaswani is now the president of Pagaya Technologies Ltd, a US-Israeli AI Fintech. He is also on the Board of the London Stock Exchange Group, the SP Jain Institute of Global Management, UK, and supports various philanthropic organisations, including Pratham, and Lend-A-Hand.

Yet, as always is the case in big organisations, there are immediate challenges as well.

The first and foremost will be gaining the confidence of Kotak veterans and other senior-level executives who have been with the bank for decades and were part of the organisation building process. Big leadership changes typically follow talent exodus at the senior levels. Vaswani needs to act quick and address the likely trust-deficit that may emerge within the ranks of Kotak.

Second, Vaswani also needs to deal with the Kotak factor within the bank that will remain even after Uday Kotak’s exit in order to shape up the strategy to grow the bank beyond this point. The Kotak family remains a powerful factor being a significant shareholder, enjoying around 26 percent of the pie, and due to the presence of Uday Kotak on the Board, though in a non-executive role. Kotak will remain an influential voice on the Board of the lender.

Third, Kotak had his share of friction with the RBI in the past. The regulator, understandably, is keeping a close watch on governance in big banks and involvement of the promoters in business decisions. Finding the right balance with the regulator will be key for the new chief.

Except these three areas, Vaswani has everything else set for a smooth run. The bank is a well-oiled machine that has strong vertical leaders and impressive financial parameters. The new leader won’t have difficulties as far as performance is concerned in the immediate term.

The business of banking works largely on trust and remains highly sensitive as a banking institution deals with public money. And, there are endless challenges at every stage. All this requires tremendous grit and perseverance. That’s where Uday Kotak stood out without his impeccable track record as a trouble shooter and visionary leader.

Kotak’s successor has big shoes to fill.

Kotak Mahindra Bank's new MD and CEO Ashok Vaswani could bring in 'much-needed aggression' in the conservative bank, accelerating growth at a time when the Indian economy is on the cusp of a breakout and technology is at the left, right and centre of banking evolution, analysts said.

Yet, they feel in the near term, the overhang on the stock that has persisted over the past two years because of the leadership transition is unlikely to vanish in a hurry.

Vaswani was appointed to the top position at India's third-largest private lender by market cap on October 21 after founder Uday Kotak resigned in September.

""Kotak Bank's loan growth has been consistent, but it is rather conservative and comes on a low base. With Vaswani's appointment, the bank is most likely to go for aggressive digital growth,"" said Sudip Bandyopadhyay of Inditrade Capital.

Vaswani's appointment will be for three years from the date of taking charge, which shall not be later than January 1, 2024, Kotak Mahindra Bank has said. The appointment has to be approved by shareholders.

The international banker has over three decades of experience, initially at Citigroup and more recently, at Barclays as the Chief Executive Officer of Barclays Bank, UK, and subsequently CEO of their global consumer, private, corporate and payments businesses.

Another analyst, who did not wish to be named said, ""We will now see the digital side of Kotak Bank becoming a bigger force to reckon with, as the bank is now likely thinking about payment products, unsecured retail lending and more.”

The bank is already on a tech transformation journey. Last August, Kotak made two important appointments. Milind Nagnur, who came from Early Warning, a fintech owned by seven of the leading banks in the United States, as president and CTO to lead technology transformation. Bhavish Lathia, an Amazon veteran, was hired as its chief of customer experience.

Vaswani's appointment appears to be in line with the bank’s ambition to take the tech route to growth. This comes at a time when fintechs like Paytm, PhonePe are going big on digital lending and ahead of the impending entry of Jio Financial Services, the analyst added.

At present, Vaswani is the president of Pagaya Technologies Ltd, a US-Israeli AI Fintech. He is also on the board of the London Stock Exchange Group and the SP Jain Institute of Global Management, UK and supports various philanthropic organisations, including Pratham, and Lend-AHand.

International over domestic; external over internal

While Bandyopadhyay believes Vaswani's international banking experience will bring in best global practices at Kotak Bank coupled with the in-house team's domestic banking experience, analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities are skeptical about any immediate change in perception.

""So far, Kotak has been run largely by a core team headed by a promoter-CEO that has not changed since inception. While the new CEO brings with him rich experience in digital and consumer banking, going by the experiences at other banks, we believe it would take the new CEO at least 18–24 months to implement his perspectives,"" Nuvama's Mahrukh Adajania and Madhukar Ladha wrote in a note.

An aggressive loan growth approach is fine if it does not impact the bank's superior asset quality. HDFC Bank has been the best of the lot, having maintained pristine asset quality — under 1 percent net non-performing assets (NPA) at all times, without exception. Kotak Bank has had periods of mildly higher NPAs but nowhere near that of any other bank.

According to analysts at Bernstein, while a change in CEO was expected, an external candidate would raise questions on any potential changes in strategy and may delay major new initiatives such as the IDBI deal.

Overhang on the stock gone?

While the stock has been a consistent compounder in the past two decades, Uday Kotak's exit has been weighing on the scrip for over two years. It has been trading in the Rs 1,7o0-Rs 2,100 range since the beginning of 2021.

Jignesh Shial of Incred Capital believes that the Street will await clear signs on changes in strategy before the overhang goes. Nuvama analysts, too, said Vaswani's appointment would likely be a near-term overhang on the stock.

""Given the sharp correction in stock price, we believe the downside is rather limited. That said, upside triggers are not visible either. On balance, we maintain Hold, with a target of Rs 1,900,"" Nuvama said.

Foreign broking firm Jefferies, too, has downgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"" and lowered the price target to Rs 1,940 from Rs 2,400. The stock continues to trade at higher valuations than HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, though the ""quality premium"" has diminished over the years.

At 10:30 am, the stock was quoting at Rs 1,745.15 on the NSE, lower by 1.4 percent from previous close.

Kotak Mahindra Bank shares fell 2 percent on October 23 despite the company posting favorable earnings for the quarter ended September 2023. The market's reaction to the newly appointed external MD and CEO overshadowed the Q2 FY24 results, which were in line with analysts' forecasts.

For the quarter ended September 2023, the private lender's net profit and net interest income (NII) met the Street expectations, and NPA fell. According to analysts, the bank continued to deliver on asset quality, growth and profitability.

Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank were trading at Rs 1,726.70, down 2.42 percent on the National Stock Exchange at 9:18 am.

Outlook

CLSA has an 'outperform' rating on the stock. However, it cut the target price to Rs 2,050 per share from Rs 2,200 earlier. Kotak Mahindra Bank's loan growth is on track, and drivers remain the same. However, sharp net interest margin (NIM) compression in Q2 FY24 came in as a surprise, it noted. The global brokerage raised Kotak Mahindra's FY24 profit estimate by 6 percent; kept the FY25 estimates largely unchanged; and cut the FY26 estimates by 7 percent due to normalisation in credit costs.

Morgan Stanley has an 'equal-weight' rating on the Kotak Bank stock with a target price of Rs 2,250 per share. It said that the lender's deposit growth remains strong, and the potential for operating leverage appears strong. Operating leverage measures the degree to which a company can increase its operating income by raising the revenue. Capital market trends have picked up, and analysts expect sustained strong earnings in the near term.

Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal said that Kotak Mahindra Bank continues to guide for steady trends in retail payment defaults, and aims to further increase the mix of unsecured loans to mid-teens from 11 percent. ""We increase our FY24/FY25 PAT estimates by 5 percent/7 percent, reflecting strong other income and controlled opex,"" it said while maintaining 'neutral' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,900.

First external CEO for Kotak Bank

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also approved the appointment of Ashok Vaswani as Kotak Bank’s next managing director and chief executive officer. According to Bernstein, a change in CEO was expected but an external candidate would raise questions about any potential changes in strategy. There are also concerns of decision delays in major new initiatives. The brokerage has a 'market perform' rating on the Kotak Mahindra Bank stock with a target price of Rs 2,100 per share.

So far, Kotak has been run largely by a core team headed by a promoter-CEO that has not changed since its inception. ""While the new CEO brings with him rich experience in digital and consumer banking, going by the experiences at other banks, we believe it would take the new CEO at least 18–24 months to implement his perspectives,"" said Nuvama Institutional Equities.

Vaswani's appointment would likely be a near-term overhang on the stock, the brokerage said, as it kept a ‘hold’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,900 per share.

Jefferies has downgraded Kotak Mahindra Bank to a 'Hold' rating and reduced the target price from Rs 2,400 to Rs 1,940. The appointment of Ashok Vaswani as MD & CEO was a significant development. Since there were expectations for an internal elevation within the bank's senior management, this decision introduces some uncertainty, it noted.

Analysts at Motilal Oswal also remain constructive on the bank’s business growth outlook and its ability to deliver superior RoA. However, they believe that execution under the new CEO will remain a key monitorable to assess the stock’s performance over the near term.

He was the CEO of Barclays Bank, UK and subsequently CEO of their Global Consumer, Private, Corporate and Payments businesses and Member of the Group Executive Committee.

Earlier, he was CEO Citigroup Asia Pacific and Member of the Citigroup Global Operating & Management Committees.

Vaswani's appointment is for a period of three years from date of taking charge which shall not be later than January 1, 2024, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a regulatory filing. The appointment is subject to shareholders’ approval, the private lender added.

The international banker has over three decades of experience in the banking sector, initially at Citigroup and more recently, at Barclays as the Chief Executive Officer of Barclays Bank, UK, and subsequently CEO of their global consumer, private, corporate and payments businesses.

Currently, he is President of Pagaya Technologies Ltd - a US-Israeli AI Fintech. Ashok is also on the Board of the London Stock Exchange Group, the SP Jain Institute of Global Management, UK and supports various philanthropic organisations, including Pratham, and Lend-AHand.

Commenting on the new appointment, Uday Kotak, Founder and Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank said, “Ashok is a word class leader and banker with digital and customer focus. I am proud that we bring a “Global Indian” home to build Kotak and India of tomorrow.”

Vaswani, expressed, ""With our proven leadership team we will take the bank to new heights. We will ensure that Kotak Mahindra Bank plays a meaningful role in India’s journey to being one of the top 3 economies in the world in the next 5 years, delivering shareholder value. At a personal level, l am delighted to come back home.”

Vaswani is a Bachelor of Commerce, Economics and Accountancy, from the Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics (Bombay University), CA from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, CS from the Institute of Company Secretaries of India and Executive Education from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.

This came as the RBI capped the tenure of a managing director and chief executive officer at 15 years in private sector banks. This is due to the RBI's norms on leadership appointment which was reviewed after the Yes Bank debacle. Kotak, whose holding in the bank stands at 26 percent, has become a non-executive director of the bank.

Uday Kotak had stepped down as the Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director and chief executive officer with effect from September 1. He is, however, continuing as a non-executive director of the bank. Uday Kotak’s tenure as the chief executive officer and managing director of the bank ends on December 31, 2023.

At that time, Kotak had said he is stepping down to facilitate the succession plan at the bank.

""Succession at Kotak Mahindra Bank has been foremost on my mind, since our Chairman, myself and Joint MD are all required to step down by year end. I am keen to ensure smooth transition by sequencing these departures. I initiate this process now and step down voluntarily as CEO,"" Kotak had said.

The RBI approval for Vaswani comes after Kotak Mahindra Bank earlier today reported a 24 percent rise in its standalone net profit to Rs 3,191 crore for the quarter ended September 30, mainly on the back of improvement in the core income and lower bad loans.

Rajkumar, a taxi driver who lives in Neikkarapatti village near Palani, was shocked after he was notified that Rs 9,000 crore had been credited to his bank account. The message with the updated amount landed on the afternoon of September 9.

""Around 3 pm, I received a message from my bank (Tamilnad Mercantile Bank) about money being deposited in my account. At first, I could not even count the amount as it had so many zeroes in it,"" he told The Times of India.

The amount credited was later reversed by the bank, which acknowledged it had made a mistake in putting the money in his account. Rajkumar transferred Rs 21,000 to a friend's account after the money was credited and less than 30 minutes later, the bank realised the error and took the rest of the amount back from him.

Tamilnad Mercantile Bank clarified the matter regarding wrong credit to beneficiary accounts in stock exchange filings.

The bank said a NACH credit file received from the National Payments Corporation of India had some invalid account numbers and when the file was processed, the amount field was prefixed with the digit 9 and the file was uploaded.

Muhammad Idris, a pharmacy worker in the city, had sent the amount from his Kotak Mahindra bank account to a friend on Friday, October 6, and checked his balance after the transfer.

On checking his balance, he realised that his account had Rs 753 crore. Idris immediately brought this to the bank's notice, who then froze his account and informed him that the amount had been credited because of a technical fault.

This is not the first instance, in recent times, when a person had been left surprised by his bank account showing an unusually high amount.

Recently, a taxi driver in Chennai was left shocked after Rs 9,000 crore was credited to his bank account after he had transferred Rs 21,000 to a friend's account. Less than 30 minutes later, the bank-Tamilnad Mercantile Bank- realised their error and took back the remaining amount and urged him to not withdraw any more money.

""After a long day at work, I took a short nap in the afternoon (on September 9). Around 3pm, I received a message from my bank (Tamilnad Mercantile Bank) about money being deposited in my account. At first sight, I could not even count the amount as it had so many zeroes in it,"" the man had said.

There are two business models in corporate India and while one creates disproportionate wealth for the company, the other is what builds a nation, said Uday Kotak, at a conclave organised by India Today.

The founder and promoter of the Kotak Mahindra Bank added that he had always favoured the second.

The billionaire banker was meandering, as he said, from the topic of succession at his bank but he didn’t stray too far because he went on to speak about how companies are run.

Kotak said that he is a “big believer” that there are two business models in corporate India.

“There is one model, which I call the raja-praja model,” he said.

In this model, according to him, “the raja decides what is right for the company and goes ahead and does it, and the Praja has to accept what the raja does”.

He said, “The raja has tremendous power and therefore can create disproportionate wealth for the company but the raja will decide how much praja will get… that is the raja-praja model.”

The second model is what he calls the trusteeship model, “where you (the promoter) say that you are a trustee for all the stakeholders and create a fair business model for all the stakeholders”

Kotak said that the second, the trusteeship model, is not as influential in terms of getting business opportunities as the raja-praja model but “it is far more fair to all stakeholders”.

He said that his instinct has always been to favour the trusteeship model because he believes that this business model is what “truly builds a country, a nation, and a company”.

When asked whether his son Jay Kotak will head the bank, Uday Kotak said that Jay Kotak may do so if he performs well and that the appointment will be based on professional merit and be decided by the board of the bank.

He said, “Today’s times, kids have a mind of their own. He decided to come back and work in the bank like any other professional. It is up to him, if he performs, he may have an opportunity… it is merit, professional merit (that decides). It is for the bank and the board of the bank.”",422,0.9998353719711304

Veteran banker Uday Kotak on Wednesday rued corporate investments getting concentrated in a few groups, and urged the government to ""encourage many flowers to bloom"". Speaking at the India Today Conclave, the richest Indian banker also said that policy is not skewed, clarifying that he respects the work done by big corporations in creating world-class businesses and specifically named Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries.

""I am saying something which is close to my heart, there is a significant concentration of new investments happening only by a few groups,"" Kotak said.""I am not saying the policy is skewed, my sense is the policy must encourage many flowers to bloom,"" he added. The founder of Kotak Mahindra Bank, who surprised all by stepping down from his executive role four months ahead of the end of term recently, said many corporates are not going ahead with investments and added that we are witnessing ""significant consolidation and concentration"" because of this. The concentration can deliver in the short term, but it is in India’s long-term interests to have many businesses flourish. Listing out sectors in which concentration has grown, Kotak urged the Competition Commission of India to step in the interest of ""fair play"".

""We need free and fair markets backed by policy which actually allows a competitive marketplace"", Kotak said, urging for the fair trade regulator to be more alert. Listing out sectors in which concentration has grown, Kotak urged the Competition Commission of India to step in the interest of ""fair play"". ""I would certainly want to see a stronger role of the Competition Commission (of India) to ensure that there is fair play in the marketplace. You do not want such concentration in a few hands… I think (in) long term, as an Indian, I’d love to see many more Indians succeed,"" he added.

The telecom sector has two-and-half players from 13 in five years, the steel sector has three big companies and aviation is reduced to just two-and-a-quarter players, Kotak said. Kotak hinted that it is because of a lack of investments by India Inc. that the country trails China on the trade front, with a net deficit of USD 100 billion per year. ""Why is it that we in India cannot manufacture and find it cheaper to import from China? And that is a question we need to ask our corporates. That for all our strong fundamentals, why is it that corporate India is not able to compete with China?"" he questioned.

Kotak, who is on the board of the Kotak Mahindra Bank as a non-executive director, said his son Jay may rise through the hierarchy to lead the private sector lender only on merit. He suggested the RBI allow Indian banks to do acquisition funding, pointing out that the statute has been as it is since 1992. Kotak welcomed Ambani-led Jio Financial Services’ upcoming entry into the segment, terming the development as a ""good thing"" which will keep the rest of the industry on the edge. With the threat of artificial intelligence (AI) gobbling up jobs in the future, Kotak said Indian policymakers will have to look at universal basic income to support the population which stands impacted.",544,-0.1330259144306183

Kotak Mahindra Bank plans to be aggressive in pushing its RuPay credit cards business and will launch more RuPay unified payments interface (UPI) credit cards, said Frederick D’Souza, the bank’s Business Head for Credit Cards.

Currently, the bank has seven RuPay credit cards, which have been showing good results. More will be added soon, said D’Souza.

“We have been at the forefront of launching RuPay credit cards. We have seen a lot of opportunities and adoption of UPI on credit and we see it as a gamechanger. Hence, we plan to launch more cards and go aggressive with existing credit cards,” D’Souza told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interaction.

In the April-June FY24 quarter, the lender’s credit card business jumped 67 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis to Rs 11,360 crore from Rs 6,820 crore.

Other than the RuPay UPI credit cards, D’Souza said that cards such as the Indian oil credit card, co-branded cards with Myntra, PVR, etc. are also doing well.

On RuPay UPI credit cards, D’Souza said that the segment comprises a decent stake of the total credit card business, which is continuously growing. “We are also looking at partnerships with fintech players and digital partners to boost our cards,” D’Souza added.

UPI on credit

In June 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed individuals to link their credit cards to the United Payments Interface (UPI). However, this is possible only through select banks that have enabled the linking of their RuPay credit cards to UPI.

On May 31, BOB Financial Solutions, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of Baroda, announced that Bank of Baroda credit card customers can now use RuPay Credit Cards on UPI-enabled apps such as BHIM, PhonePe, Paytm, Google Pay, Slice, MobiKwik and PayZapp.

Similarly, in June 2023, Canara Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank introduced the facility of UPI payments to merchants through RuPay credit cards issued by them.

Some of the other banks that have enabled the linking of RuPay credit cards to UPI are Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Indian Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India and YES Bank.

“The demand for Rupay UPI credit cards is doubling in weeks,” D’Souza said. He added that the bank plans to run campaigns to bring more customers into the UPI credit card segment.

CC business

Credit card spending hit a record high of Rs 1.4 lakh crore in May 2023, the latest data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) showed. The total spending or outstanding dues on credit cards, which remained range-bound throughout the year in the previous fiscal year, has been rising by 5 percent, month on month this year.

Similarly, the number of cards in use has jumped by more than 5 million since January and crossed 87.4 million in the reporting month, making this an all-time high for May, according to the RBI data.

With the growth, the non-performing asset (NPA) level in the credit card segment for public sector banks stood at 18 percent as of March 2023 against 9 percent a year ago, whereas private sector banks reported a GNPA of 1.9 percent, according to data from the RBI’s Financial Stability Report.

In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol on September 11 Shanti Ekambaram, whole-time director of Kotak Mahindra Bank, said that the bank has never treated her differently just because she is a woman.

""I never think to myself that I'm a woman and I can't do something. In any workplace, especially if you want to do really well, you forget that you are from a different gender. You have to focus on competence and have to deliver what takes you up for the job,"" said Ekambaram while replying to a question about challenges she faced as a woman banker.

Ekambaram also pointed out that when Kotak Mahindra Bank was emerging, she never thought that she was different and could not deliver.

""To juggle the roles that women play, many of them give up. So it's not just an industry dominated by men. It is also about women wanting to succeed, move up,"" she said.

Women's participation in the banking sector

Women made up only 10 percent of the banking workforce up until the 1990s. Only the clerical grade had a higher percentage of women, at 22 percent in 2005-06. Since then, it has gone up to 27 percent in 2015-16 and 31.7 percent in 2020–21 for clerical, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data. Despite a rising trend in women's employment in the Indian banking industry, just 3,97,005 of the 16,42,804 total employees in 2021-22 in all scheduled commercial banks are female, or 24.17 percent of the workforce.

Private sector banks have approximately 1,34,000 female officers out of 6,14,000 employees in that grade, which makes 21.96 percent. Public sector banks have approximately 1,00,000 female officers out of 3,88,000, or 26.34 percent female presence at the officer level.

Women's numbers for credits improves

On the other side of the counter, an increasing number of women are taking advantage of credit to achieve their goals in life, and this is reflected in the latest Centre for Research in International Finance report published on International Women’s Day in March 2023, which reveals that portfolios outstanding across major retail loans availed by women have risen by 25 percent to Rs 26 lakh crore as of December 2022 from Rs 20.7 lakh crore as of December 2021. CIRF is a body that has several public sector banks, development finance institutions, non-banking financial companies and the like as stakeholders.

The share of female borrowers in overall retail loans (by value) increased from 25.3 percent as of December 2021 to 26 percent as of December 2022. The share of younger female borrowers (less than or of 35 years of age) has continued to increase over the last three calendar years, from 38.3 percent in CY20 to 43.4 percent in CY22.",475,0.3621351321538289

On September 2, Uday Kotak announced his decision to step off the driver’s seat of the bank he founded and nurtured into a world-class institution. While his reputation as a banker is “boring”, his journey as an entrepreneur is enviable and his qualities as a leader and people manager, awe-inspiring.

Here is a glimpse of his playbook.

ON PEOPLE, MANAGEMENT STYLE

1) The HUF called Kotak Bank: A-team of people with middle-class values, high on personal integrity. At Kotak, like attracts like. People stay on for the premium attached to a brand, for the freedom to run the ship like your own, and the pleasure of working with someone intelligent, ethical, and open to discussion. President and Group Chief Risk Officer Arvind Kathpalia has captured the essence of it, by saying that Kotak is like a Hindu Undivided Family of which Uday Kotak is the Kartha, always looking out for everyone else and always being fair.

2) Raise professionals to quasi-promoters: Uday Kotak never believed in hiring chacha and bhateejas. Initial lieutenants were mostly his clients, for example, Shivaji Dam and KVS Manian were in Tata’s Nelco, C Jayaram was with Sanmar heading the finance division, and Shanti Ekambaram was working with a foreign bank when Kotak recruited them. He believed in hiring professionals, who work to serve their own interests first, but engaging with them in a manner that made them quasi-promoters, who work to serve the company’s interest above their own. Shivaji Dam bought his first lot of shares of the company, in a private issue, with Rs 5,000 generously handed over by Uday Kotak. There were two bundles of Rs 5,000 each offered to him, but Dam took just one. Had he taken both, he would have been twice as rich.

3) Equally close or equally distant: Deep personal connections with work colleagues. He made his lieutenants feel like no secret came between them. He promptly replied to every greeting and wish and remembered personal details of ex-colleagues even after years. Yet, he maintained a clear distinction between work relationships, and best buddies. He made expectations from each clear, therefore no cliques were created and zero power play.

4) Promote insiders, then get experts from outside to accelerate insider-leader’s learning: To head new business verticals, he always chose insiders first and hired experts to work under him/her. With the group growing into newer segments, it was hard to find an insider that fit the leader profile but that didn’t stop Kotak from placing the insider on top and then bringing an expert in, as a subordinate, to become the insider-leader up to speed.

5) Build an informal network: He would talk to every person across various levels and soak up information. When visiting top-level management, would make time to chat with the attendants and other ancillary staff to gauge market sentiment and business opportunities. He would always be on time for meetings but would always stretch its closing, using extra time to talk to juniors to glean something more than what was the meeting’s initial purpose.

ON THE BUSINESS OF BANKING

1) Every penny counts: Every credit is important. Till some years ago, all loans above Rs 2 crore passed through him. But he would never ask questions if the team rejected a credit application referred by him. Senior executives recalled rejecting loans of clients personally introduced by Uday Kotak and being allowed to stand by it, however hard Kotak may have argued in favour of the client.

2) Only the paranoid survive: When NBFCs crumbled in the nineties, after CRB Capital Markets’ debacle, Kotak was quick to respond. He realised P&L (profit and loss) risk could be managed but not a bad balance sheet. He wound up his book and was among the 1 percent to survive.

3) If something’s too good to be true, avoid it: The banker steadfastly avoided all fancy deals and financial fads and always advocated erring on the side of caution. Be it the unbridled growth in infrastructure between 2003 and 2008, unsecured corporate credit, lending to real estate, or anything that offered unrealistic yields or unrestrained growth, Kotak steered clear.

4) A good manager is a good risk manager: He had the ability to anticipate risks. Seeing the financial collapse unfolding over a weekend in September 2008, his team brainstormed, and sat through a Friday night till 4 am the next morning to transfer all credit from Wachovia Bank to JP Morgan. With the risk managed, the team earned their weekend rest while peers reacted to the crisis with panic.

5) Bad news first: Good news could wait. Bad news couldn’t because it needed immediate action. Standard instruction to all execs: Convey bad news first.

6) Know the spice levels: An investment banker offers what investors want; a lender decides what is right for it. Offering equities is letting customers choose the level of spice in their food, lending is deciding how much spice you can take. In 2007-08, there was exuberance, Kotak brought some of those companies to market, but they did not lend; the opportunities were “too spicy” for their taste.

7) Leverage isn’t your money: When a bank with Rs 10 as capital and a borrowed Rs 100 loses Rs 5, it has lost 50 percent of its money. If it has lost Rs 10, it’s time to pack up. Bankers don’t have control and ownership; it’s other people’s money. Arrogance stems from believing that they own all the leverage.

8) It’s not about winning or losing: It’s about living with the consequences, like when a lion chases a deer, where winning isn’t the goal but living or going hungry is the outcome to be contended with. Sensitised senior execs to approach with the outcome-mindset and not with an intent to get to the finish line first.

9) Anticipate change, embrace change: In 1890, New Yorkers and town-planners worried about horse manure. An analyst foresaw horse manure, by 1930, piling up to the third floor of buildings. But change happened - in 1910, the automobile came into being, and was welcomed as an anti-pollution device! Anticipate change.",1070,-0.06384995579719543

Gupta’s association with Kotak dates back to 1999 when he joined as an executive director of Kotak Mahindra Finance Ltd (KMFL) and has played a key role in building the retail business of the bank even before Kotak got the banking licence in 2003.

Even as the stock market remains nervous about succession at one of India’s most admired banks, and regulators deliberate over whether the next leader should be an insider or outsider, a look at its track record versus other frontline banks may be useful to understand what gives Kotak Bank the edge.

Management guru Peter Drucker said, ""Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” If that is true for companies worldwide, it can not be untrue for banks. Actually, most will argue it is far more important for banks than for companies. That’s because of the nature of business that banks engage in.

By design, banks are built on borrowed capital. They have a small net worth or equity capital; most of the capital is borrowed from savers in the form of deposits, and it is lent to those in need, be it individual borrowers or businesses. Money is thus the raw material for banks, and the interest they earn from the borrowers over the interest they pay their lenders (depositors), after accounting for the expenses incurred by the bank in doing this operation, is the profit they make for themselves. That’s what shareholders lay claim over.

Over the past two decades, after Kotak transitioned from being a non-bank to a bank in 2003, the bank has pipped every single private sector bank rising right to the top of the table in terms of wealth creation. Kotak Bank was listed on the bourses in February 2003. So, over the past 20 years and seven months, among the frontline banks, Kotak emerged on top in terms of stock price returns with a compounded annual growth rate of 29 percent. That beats HDFC Bank which delivered a 22 percent annualised return during the period.

HDFC Bank stock has been flat over the past two years on account of nervousness over succession as well as its merger with its parent HDFC Limited, but barring this period, it has been the darling of stock markets for a good part of the past two decades. State Bank of India, the biggest and the best-run state-owned bank, delivered a 15.8 percent annualised return during the same period.

A 20-year track record is not a flash in the pan. In fact, if one were to calculate the annualised stock price returns at any time over the past 10 years, the contrast in performance would have been starker, as other wholesale banks were still in clean-up mode and Kotak was in the pink of health. HDFC Bank has been the best of the lot having maintained pristine asset quality - under 1 percent net NPA (non-performing assets) at all times, without exception. Kotak Bank has had periods of mildly higher NPAs but nowhere near that of any other bank.

What has worked wonders for Kotak is conservatism, which should actually make the regulators more confident of the bank’s ability to protect depositors’ money. The fact is, a significant portion of bankruptcies in India, and in fact, the world over, can be traced back to unbridled optimism that made managements take on high debt which proved to be their death knell as businesses did not turn out as they were expected to. While managements cannot be always trusted to make the “right” decisions –decisions are largely proved to be right or wrong only in hindsight – the only thing that investors as well as regulators can count on is their track record of decision-making and the incentive structure.

Kotak is one of the handful of private sector banks that has survived several financial storms including the very first non-banking crisis in the country in the mid-nineties which washed away 99 percent of the non-banks. If anything, Kotak can be accused of being a very unlikely, ultra-conservative banker. That again is because Kotak has been deeply cognisant of the risks in banking. “Cognisant” may be a bit of an understatement, some would term it “paranoid.” In fact, it is one of the common refrain analysts, perhaps even the central bank, have with the bank’s strategy. As they say, a harbour is a safe place but that does not mean a ship must forever be parked there.

Kotak’s way of looking at things is more like what Warren Buffett’s partner Charlie Munger maintains, “Tell me where I’ll die, and I won’t go there.” Having seen what kills banks, his actions are wiser.

In an earlier conversation with this author, Kotak remarked thus: “As a bank, we have Rs 10 as capital and borrow Rs 100. If we lose Rs 5 out of Rs 110, we have lost 50 percent of our money. If you lost Rs 10, it’s time to go home. Bankers start believing they have control and ownership; they don’t, it’s other people’s money. If you go back globally, and see the kind of lifestyles bankers lived, they lived 50:1 leverage. They were living on borrowed money and borrowed time. That arrogance comes from believing that you own all that leverage as your own money.”

Kotak has walked the high talk emerging unscathed from 2008 financial crisis when other private sector banks floundered. Along with HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank also stood out for escaping the glut of bad loans that paralysed the entire banking system in the country.

Post Covid, too, Kotak has been cautious in terms of growth. Compared to peers, it is overcapitalised, with the highest capital adequacy among leading banks. Its Tier I capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stands at 20.9 percent; including Tier II capital, CAR stands at 22 percent. This has dragged down its return on equity, which stands at 14 percent as opposed to other frontline banks at 16-17 percent despite having the highest return on assets. Simply put what this means is, that while the bank earns the highest return on its overall assets, equity and debt, its return on shareholders’ funds is a tad lower mainly because it has lower leverage.

From a stock market perspective, as we stand at the cusp of an uptick in the investment cycle and there is optimism in the air and a new wave of credit creation is unfolding, Kotak is most likely to get its fair share of growth. Apart from enough capital to fuel growth, as things stand now, Kotak also has the highest share of low-cost deposits or CASA (49 percent) which makes it truly competitive. For whoever is in the driver’s seat next, the least of the problems will be to grow. The key will be to maintain its profitable growth and avoid accidents along the way.

An insider is more likely to carry this forward, for it is decoded in their DNA. Even as the final decision on who will steer the bank next rests with the RBI, the two internal candidates, widely believed to be the bank’s recommended ones for the top job have been with the bank for the longest time. K V S Manian has been with the bank for 29 years, and Shanti Ekambaram has been there even longer than 30 years. It’s not just these two, there are a bunch of others in the senior management who have 20+ years with Kotak, so the philosophies of steer clear of “too-good-to-be-true deals” or refrain from unnecessary aggression in growth are well-entrenched in the institution. So much so that, one of the senior management once remarked, Kotak employees have a real problem. “We can’t fit elsewhere, others won’t survive here!”

That could change a wee bit. First, even if the new chieftain were to be an insider, he or she may not be the exact replica of the promoter-manager. The leadership style may also be a bit different. Till a few years ago, Kotak long-timers say, every credit of over Rs 2 crore would go through Uday Kotak’s eyes. That may not be the style of a CEO as the group grows in size.

But more importantly, the banking ecosystem of today is different from the past. One of the reasons banks like Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank avoided wholesale lending in the past is because, if things went wrong, the institutional mechanism to recover was weak. With the bankruptcy laws getting tighter, that could provide some comfort, says a banker. On digital banking, too, Kotak is at the fore-front, investing in people and technology. In August 2022, Kotak hired Bhavnish Lathia, earlier with Amazon, as its chief of customer experience and head of technology, consumer banking.

Longer-term, the key for the bank will be to preserve the culture of conservatism and focus on profitability that has made it not just survive the troughs in Indian banking but rise right to the top in terms of value creation.

The market has been discounting Uday Kotak’s departure for a while now which is why the stock has underperformed. No matter what, when an iconic leader steps away, it is natural for all stakeholders to be circumspect about the ability of the newcomer to lead the way.

Two leadership qualities that Uday Kotak brought to the table were charisma and smarts. As one of the Kotak veterans puts it, Kotak Bank is like a Hindu Undivided Family of which Uday was the Kartha. He defined the values and aligned the family to those values and a shared future. Second, Uday’s ability to see the big picture and at the same time get into the minutest details set him miles ahead. From global headwinds and digital trends to credit and capital market pricing, he had the pulse of every little thing that could impact business. It would be unfair to make the same ask of the new CEO. More importantly, the bigger size makes things only harder. The ideal model for Kotak from hereon would be for the CEO to wear two hats: one, that of a manager of sorts, managing the expectations of multiple stakeholders – the regulator and the shareholders – and two, an arbitrator of sorts, with a bunch of veterans running the various pieces of the pie.

On a relative basis, Kotak is still expensive at 2.7 times adjusted book value, while both ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank are available at around 2.3 times the book. However, the gap between the valuation of Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank versus other banks has decreased significantly. That’s because in an environment where other banks had bad surprises in store in the form of bad loans and were therefore constrained for growth, good quality of book fetched a significant premium. Now, when bad debt concerns have gone away and markets are looking at growth, the “quality premium” stands diminished.

Notwithstanding the cycles, for Kotak Bank to continue to get the quality premium, the leader will have to keep the family connected, and keep the family’s “spice” levels in check.",1875,-0.09626291905130659

ICICI Securities research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

As per the meeting held on 2nd Sep’23, the board of Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) has informed that Mr. Uday Kotak has resigned as the MD & CEO of the bank and has become a non-executive non-independent director of the bank for a period of 5 years. He would not be liable to retire by rotation. Mr. Dipak Gupta (joint MD) would carry out MD & CEO responsibilities in the interim, subject to regulatory and other approvals. The key monitorable for the stock would be the candidature and transition of the new MD & CEO.

Outlook

We maintain HOLD on KMB with a revised target price of INR 1,850 (earlier: INR 2,000) valuing the stock at ~2.6x FY25E core banking book (earlier: ~2.8x). Upside risk is in growth exceeding expectations and downside risk is in less than smooth management transition.

While Uday Kotak's retirement as MD and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank was long anticipated, a lack of clarity on a succession plan has forced the stock to underperform other large private sector banks over the past one year pushing its valuation down to an all-time low.

The 9 percent fall in the stock, against a 12 percent rise in NSE Bank Nifty, over the past one year has brought Kotak Mahindra Bank's valuation at par with peers, sharply bringing down the valuation gap between Kotak and other private sector banks, said analysts.

Going ahead, a smooth leadership transition remains key for the stock, although on most fundamental factors Kotak outsmarts its rivals.

“Over the last four years Kotak's 1-year forward valuation has de-rated from 4x P/B and now trades in line with HDFC Bank (merged),” noted investment banking firm Investec. During the same time, the bank has improved its return on equity (ROE) over 200 basis points to over 14 percent.

Furthermore, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s 1-year forward valuation is now lower compared to its own 10-year historical price-to-book average value of 3.84x. Nonetheless, despite the correction in valuation, Kotak Mahindra Bank still remains slightly expensive compared to other banks.

Can loan growth and asset quality hold up?

Over FY21-23, the bank delivered robust traction in loan growth at a ~19 percent CAGR (compound annual growth rate). On a 10-year period, loan growth stands at 15 percent CAGR. Despite spike in interest rates, retail credit growth remains strong and Kotak Bank will continue to be a big beneficiary of this, believe analysts.

“The bank remains well placed to capture growth opportunities in macro upcycle. The bank has also been driving a loan mix shift toward higher margin assets,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley.

Meanwhile, on the deposits side, Kotak Mahindra Bank has a high CASA ratio of 49 percent. CASA stands for Current Account Savings Account.

“Asset quality remains steady, and the strong CASA ratio will limit pressure on margins and enable a ~15 percent net profit CAGR over FY23- 25E,” according to domestic broking firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Analysts have always lauded Uday Kotak for avoiding any NPA mess. “His intelligence in banking is unparalleled. His deep insights always helped Kotak avoid non-performing assets for so many years,” wrote Aditya Shah, a SEBI-registered investment advisor on X.

As of Q1 FY24 end, Kotak Bank’s gross NPA stood at 1.77 percent, down 3.56 percent from peak of COVID crisis. Net NPA moderated from 1.28 percent to 0.40 percent during the same period.

Transition is key

While Uday Kotak has been credited in taking the bank’s market capitalization from Rs 945 crore to Rs 3.51 lakh crore in the past 20 years, mimicking similar growth in coming years will depend on how smooth the leadership change is.

“Considering the culture at KMB, promotion of an insider to the top job (vs a lateral hire) would be preferred by investors, in our view,” said Jai Prakash Mundhra and Chintan Shah of ICICI Securities.

The Street believes Shanti Ekambaram and KVS Manian, both whole-time directors, are the front-runners for the top job. As an interim arrangement, Dipak Gupta, the Joint Managing Director, will carry out the duties of the MD and CEO until December 31, 2023.

Uday Kotak, meanwhile, will continue as a non-executive director of the bank. With 25.72 percent stake, he also remains the biggest shareholder in the bank.

Kotak Mahindra’s valuation has fallen over the last year but it is still more expensive than bigger rivals HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank.

Over the past year, there have been concerns surrounding potential changes in leadership in the wake of Uday Kotak's imminent departure as Managing Director and CEO.

He resigned effect from September 1, three months earlier than the scheduled transition date. After being a part of the bank for over 38 years, Kotak cited significant personal and other family commitments, besides a sequenced leadership transition at the bank as the key reasons behind his resignation.

Kotak Mahindra stock vs HDFC Bank over the last year

Kotak Mahindra Bank stock has lost 8 percent in the last year. The stock has been trading at a premium as compared to its peers in the industry.

Now the stock trades lower than its historical average but is still expensive compared to other banks. The price to book ration for Kotak Mahindra Bank is 2.7x. While for HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank it is 2.3x and 2.4x.

HDFC Bank had 45 “buy” calls, one “hold” call, and zero “sell” calls on September 4. A year before, the bank had 40 “buy” calls, 5 “hold” calls, and zero “sell” calls.

“Uday Kotak’s contribution was pivotal in guiding the bank through its transition from being an NBFC to obtaining a banking licence in 2003 and evolving as one of the most successful and reputed financial organisations in the country,” said Motilal Oswal in a report dated September 4.

Under Kotak’s leadership, the bank became the fourth-largest private lender and established its presence across the financial services spectrum, including asset management, broking, investment banking, and life insurance, it said.

Uday Kotak's resignation from the helm of affairs at Kotak Mahindra Bank seems to have little impact on the stock with most brokerages maintaining their target prices and ratings unchanged.

Jefferies India has retained its 'buy' tag on the stock and kept the target price at Rs 2,400. Macquarie, too, stuck to its 'neutral' rating and target price at Rs 1,860. Investec, on its part, kept the 'buy' rating and retained the target price at Rs 2,300 a share. Morgan Stanley continued with the 'equal weight' views and the target price of Rs 2,250 a share.

According to Macquarie, Kotak's early resignation doesn't alter the uncertainty about the next CEO in January 2024 and the bank's ability to find a suitable replacement for the iconic banker.

Kotak cited personal commitments, including his son's wedding in November, to step down before the December deadline set by the Reserve Bank of India.

The lender said that two candidates have been submitted to the banking regulator for approval, but analysts said that it's unclear if they are internal or external. Analysts expect an RBI response by December.

Dipak Gupta, who has taken over as the interim chief of the bank, reaches an end to his current tenure on December 31. News reports suggest that the two internal candidates are likely to be KVS Manian and Shanti Ekambaram, both seasoned extensively at Kotak Bank. Manian oversees corporate banking, while Ekambaram is responsible for consumer and digital banking.

According to Macquarie, leadership changes can be disruptive. If one of the suggested internal candidates is appointed, they would align with the organisation's culture. The key challenges include maintaining the asset and balance sheet quality set up by their predecessor and improving ROE, which has lagged behind larger peers. There's also a need for greater focus on smaller, more granular deposits, as a significant portion of recent deposit growth came from bulk/wholesale deposits.

""Over the last four years Kotak has de-rated from 4x P/B to 2.3x (consolidated) and now trades at par with HDFC Bank (merged) and at a discount to ICICIBC. During this period, the bank has managed to improve its RoEs to 15-percent-plus, while improving the growth trajectory and ensuring the CoF advantage. We estimate the bank to deliver 20 percent EPS growth rate with stable RoEs of over 15 percent and remain our top pick in the large-cap bank along with ICICI Bank,"" said Investec in its latest note.

Morgan believes Kotak Bank is well-positioned to seize growth opportunities in the current economic upswing, thanks to its strong funding capabilities and effective underwriting practices. The bank's strategic shift towards higher-margin assets should also help protect margins as funding costs rise. Morgan's preference is for larger banks due to their more favorable relative valuations.

As the bank prepares for new leadership, the question now emerges of who would take over to continue Kotak’s legacy. Two veteran Kotak Mahindra leaders have emerged as potential frontrunners – KVS Manian and Shanti Ekambaram.

Who is KVS Manian?

KVS Manian, 61, has been the President – Corporate, Institutional & Investment Banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank since 2014. Apart from this position, he also oversees Kotak Mahindra’s institutional equities business. Manian joined Kotak Mahindra Bank as a part of investment banking business in February 1995.

After completing electrical engineer from IIT (BHU) – Varanasi and a Post Graduate in Financial Management from Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, he has spent over 30 years in positions across Banking – Investment, Corporate and Consumer, Financial Accounting and Control, Management Accounting as well as Project Management and Operations.

Previously, as President – Consumer Banking, Manian was known at Kotak Mahindra Bank for having grown the banking business, from a single branch to over 600 branches. He has also been referred to as the “architect of the integrated Consumer franchise across asset and liability products”. During his tenure, the bank launched several unique and innovative products. Manian has also been credited to have played an important role in Kotak’s transition from an NBFC to a bank.

KVS Manian is also a part of the Bank’s Operating Management Committee (OMANCOM) whose responsibility is to drive and oversee Kotak Mahindra Group’s growth charter.

Who is Shanti Ekambaram?

Shanti Ekambaram, 60, is President – Consumer Banking at Kotak Mahindra since 2014. She has been a part of the bank for over 26 years in various positions with experience in various aspects of Investment Banking such as Capital Markets, M&As, Fixed Income and Corporate Banking.

Before her current position, Ekambaram was leading corporate investment and banking as President - Corporate & Investment Banking. In her previous role, she was responsible for ensuring delivery of comprehensive advisory and financial solutions to corporates, PSUs (Public Sector Undertakings), financial institutions, MNCs and the Government.

Ekambaram has also been the Executive Director and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank. After graduating with a Bachelor degree in commerce from University of Mumbai, she has also completed her Chartered Accountancy and Cost and Works Accountancy. Prior to working with Kotak Mahindra,

Uday Kotak resigns as managing director and chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank after a scintillating two decades. In these 20 years, he has built a solid franchise with a deposit base of nearly Rs 4 lakh crore, making Kotak the eleventh largest lender in the country in terms of deposit size and fourth-largest among private banks.

Kotak's achievements are, of course, not confined to banking. Starting with bill discounting from 1985, he has built a clutch of financial institutions including a mutual fund, a life insurance, a general insurance company, a couple of NBFCs and a securities company.

The banking licence was awarded to Uday Kotak in 2003 and, for a while, the bank grew largely by providing support to its investment banking and securities companies. The lender took a leap in size and reach when it acquired ING Vysya Bank in 2014.

To Kotak's credit, his has been a near flawless record in terms of quality of the bank's asset book. Even at the height of the asset quality crises that roiled the banking sector in the middle of the last decade, when even large private lenders like ICICI Bank and Axis Bank grappled with soaring non-performing assets (NPA), Kotak Bank, like HDFC Bank, remained largely unscathed.

Not surprising, while it may rank eleventh in deposit size, it features within the top three or four in terms of market cap, thanks to high returns to shareholders. That indeed may also be Uday Kotak's weakness. Probably because of his large shareholding in the bank, he remained a very cautious banker, growing his book by no more than 15-16 percent a year. In contrast, HDFC Bank grew by nearly 25 percent in the 2000s and averaged a growth rate of 20-21 percent in the 2010s. Although Kotak Bank is only eight years younger, HDFC Bank is over five times larger in terms of the size of deposits and advances.

The slower pace of growth may be linked to Uday Kotak's large stake in the bank. In the early years, when he held close to 50 percent in it, Kotak employees were aware that in every loan, they were lending 50 percent of his money and only 50 percent of depositors' money. That made for a cautious DNA down the line.

Ironically, while Uday Kotak took very few risks with his lending, he did take regulatory risks. He has been the only banker to have taken the regulator, the Reserve Bank of India, to court on the issue of not bringing down his stake in the bank to 15 percent within the stipulated time. Eventually, the RBI too modified the rules to let promoters keep 26 percent in the banks they founded.

Uday Kotak's run-in with the regulator may not be over yet. The RBI issued guidelines in 2021, capping the term of an MD and CEO of a bank at 15 years after which he will have to take a three-year cooling-off.

""The post of the MD and CEO or WTD cannot be held by the same incumbent for more than 15 years. Thereafter, the individual will be eligible for re-appointment as the MD and CEO or WTD in the same bank, if considered necessary and desirable by the board, after a minimum gap of three years, subject to meeting other conditions. During this three-year cooling-off, the individual shall not be appointed or associated with the bank or its group entities in any capacity, either directly or indirectly,"" the RBI said.

The guidelines are no doubt informed by sound principles of protecting financial stability. The RBI would want to ensure that no untoward actions are undertaken by any individual who leads a bank for a long period. After all, it is the depositors' money at stake. For every Rs 100 loan given by a bank, nearly Rs 90 is depositors' money. The regulator would also not want a large institution to be too dependent on one person.

Despite the guidelines stating that an individual who has been MD for 15 years, should not be associated with bank directly or indirectly for the next three years, Kotak has been selected by the bank's board as a non-executive director. While the RBI has not reacted to this appointment, it remains to be seen if it would want to see the next MD as an outsider who would be less influenced by his presence in the board.

It is important not to treat this resignation as Kotak hangs his boots. Technically, he can even return as the MD after three years, unless the RBI objects, saying he didn't take the three-year cooling.

Even as the non-executive director, he remains an important voice of the banking sector and indeed of the financial sector, whom the government will, no doubt, reach out to in case of crises like IL&FS. The resignation as the Kotak Mahindra Bank MD and CEO only ends one chapter in Kotak's innings. As the famous Hindi movie line goes: Picture abhi baaki hai.",843,-0.16800014972686766

On September 2, Kotak Mahindra Bank informed the stock exchanges that Uday Kotak, the managing director and CEO, has resigned from the role ahead of his term coming to an end by the end of this year.

Kotak has been heading the bank since its inception and has grown the company to a leading financial institution in the country from scratch. Kotak along with relatives and enterprises in which he has beneficial interest holds 25.95 percent of the equity share capital of the bank and 17.26 percent of the paid-up share capital of Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited as on March 31, 2023.

Till a new CEO comes on board, the current joint managing director Dipak Gupta will carry out the duties of the chief executive officer subject to approvals from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the bank said.

Here's all you want to know about Uday Kotak's successor in the interim.

Gupta is currently the second most top executive at Kotak Mahindra Bank after Uday Kotak. Gupta, who wears a lot of hats at the bank as head of IT, cyber security, customer experience and business intelligence, currently serves as the joint managing director.

An old Kotak hand

In fact, Gupta’s association with Kotak dates back to 1999 when he joined as an executive director of Kotak Mahindra Finance Ltd (KMFL) and has played a key role in building the retail business of the bank even before Kotak got the banking licence in 2003.

Prior to joining Kotak Group in 1992, Gupta worked with the consultancy division of AF Ferguson. Over the years, Gupta has played a key role in building various businesses for the Kotak Group.

Gupta was instrumental in forging the partnership between KMFL which got the banking licence in April 2003 to become Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited and Ford Credit International. Also, Gupta was the first CEO of Kotak Mahindra Primus Limited, the KMFL–Ford Credit joint venture.

Gupta, who has a BE (Electronics), PGDM-Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, helms functions of Internal Audit and Information Technology including Cyber Security and Digital Initiatives, at the bank.

Challenges ahead

As the bank is in the midst of its biggest leadership change, Gupta will have to navigate the institution in the absence of Kotak at the helm, till a new CEO joins.

Within the business verticals, there are concerns among analysts around the growth in the unsecured loan book that has grown sharply of late.

Kotak Mahindra recorded an increase in unsecured retail loans during the April-June quarter, when compared with the year-ago period, with credit card outstanding and microfinance loans surging aggressively.

Retail unsecured loans of Kotak Mahindra Bank reached 10.7 percent of the total loan book as at the end of June 2023 from 7.9 percent a year back, according to an investor presentation by the private sector lender.

Retail microfinance loans surged 91 percent over last year, while credit card outstanding jumped 67 percent.

Retail microloans are given to low-income groups who are typically small businessmen and vendors. These loans are a tricky segment for banks as cash flows typically take a hit during a down cycle.

Gupta, however, has downplayed the concerns on retail unsecured loans. Yet, the challenges persist.

Gupta will need to also assure investors and depositors of smooth handling of the bank till the leadership transition is complete. Uday Kotak has been heading the organisation since its inception and there is no clarity yet about the new CEO yet. Gupta, however, is no stranger to challenges.",612,-0.3589885319982256

Uday Kotak has stepped down as the Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director and chief executive officer with effect from September 1, the bank said in a communication to exchanges on September 2.

Kotak will, however, continue as a non-executive director of the bank, it said. Uday Kotak’s tenure as the chief executive officer and managing director of the bank ends on December 31, 2023.

As an interim arrangement, Dipak Gupta, the joint managing director, will carry out the duties of the MD and CEO until December 31, subject to the approval of the RBI and the members of the bank, it said.

Resignation to facilitate succession

Kotak, in a communication on social media on September 2, said he is stepping down to facilitate the succession plan at the bank.

""Succession at Kotak Mahindra Bank has been foremost on my mind, since our Chairman, myself and Joint MD are all required to step down by year end. I am keen to ensure smooth transition by sequencing these departures. I initiate this process now and step down voluntarily as CEOm"" Kotak said.

Fruther, the bank is awaiting RBI approval of the proposed successor, Kotak said.

In February this year, Bloomberg had reported that board has engaged consulting firm Egon Zehnder to lead a global search for a chief executive officer to replace its billionaire founder Kotak.

Kotak has been leading the bank since its inception as a non-banking financial institution in 1985. It became a commercial lender in 2003. He has a net worth of about $13.4 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Kotak along with relatives and enterprises in which he has beneficial interest holds 25.95 percent of the equity share capital of the bank and 17.26 percent of the paid-up share capital of Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited as on March 31, 2023

To conintue in Non-executive role

Kotak, in his message, said as founder, he is deeply attached to brand Kotak and will continue to serve the institution as Non-Executive Director and significant shareholder. ""We have an outstanding management team to carry the legacy forward. Founders go away, but the institution flourishes into perpetuity,"" Kotak added.

""A long time ago, I saw names like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs dominate the financial world and dreamed of creating such an institution in India. It is with this dream that I started Kotak Mahindra 38 years ago, with 3 employees in a 300 sqft office in Fort, Mumbai. I have deeply cherished every bit of this memorable journey, living my dream,"" Kotak added.

Over years, Kotak Mahindra has created value for stakeholders and provide over one lakh direct jobs, Kotak said. An investment of Rs10,000 in the bank in 1985 would be worth around Rs 300 crore today,"" Kotak added.",481,0.9887007474899292

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may reduce the limit of Incremental Cash Reserve Ratio (I-CRR) to 5 percent from 10 percent of the increase in Net Demand and Time Liability (NDTL) on or before September 8, Upasna Bhardwaj, Chief Economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank, told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on September 1.

The central bank will review the I-CRR on September 8 or earlier with a view to returning the impounded funds to the banking system ahead of the festival season.

“We see a high probability of RBI retaining the I-CRR but they may tweak the 10 percent to 5 percent,” Bhardwaj said.

This is because Bhardwaj expects the inflows on account of government spending will offset most of the outflows of advance tax and goods and services tax (GST) payments by the end of the month and bring liquidity towards a neutral zone.

Bhardwaj said if the I-CRR were to be reversed, we may again see liquidity surplus at levels that RBI in the current environment may not be comfortable with.

On August 10, the central bank said that with effect from the fortnight beginning August 12, scheduled banks will have to maintain an I-CRR of 10 percent of the increase in their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) between May 19 and July 28.

This narrowed the surplus liquidity by over Rs 1.42 lakh crore as on August 13. The outflow on account of I-CRR was broadly in line with estimates outlined by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das and market players.

At a press meet after the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, Das had said that the I-CRR will suck out about Rs 1 lakh crore. Liquidity narrowed due to heavy GST outflows and auctions.

Liquidity condition

Currently, the liquidity in the banking system is estimated to be in surplus of around Rs 80,233.57 crore, according to the RBI’s money market operation.

As per a Kotak Mahindra Bank’s report on August 28, there is an expectation of inflows of Rs 1.10 lakh crore from government spending and Rs 52,827 crore of coupon inflows and redemptions of treasury bills and SDL during the week from August 26 to September 1.

The total outflows expected were Rs 67,900 crore from the banking system due to the auction of T-Bills, state loans and central government securities.

RBI’s take

Prior to the introduction of I-CRR, the central bank conducted various variable rate reverse repo auctions to remove excess surplus liquidity from the banking system.

The RBI also conducted various auctions of various tenures as short as overnight auction.

Still, the liquidity remained in huge surplus, which pushed short-term rates, especially overnight call money rates, sharply below the repo rate.

The surplus liquidity in the system has gone up in recent months on the back of the return of Rs 2,000 banknotes to the banking system, RBI’s surplus transfer to the government, and a pick-up in government spending and capital inflows.

The overall daily absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) was Rs 1.7 lakh crore in June and Rs 1.8 lakh crore in July 2023.

In the August monetary policy, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said I-CRR is purely a temporary measure for managing the liquidity overhang. Even after this temporary impounding, there will be adequate liquidity in the system to meet the credit needs of the economy.

However, RBI Deputy Governor Michael Patra in the Monetary Policy Committee meeting last month said a risk to the inflation outlook stems from the liquidity overhang in the banking system, according to the minutes of the meeting.

“Withdrawal of excess liquidity should engage primacy in the attention of the RBI going forward as it presents a direct threat to the RBI/MPC resolve to align India’s inflation with the target, besides the potential risks to financial stability,” Patra said.",671,-0.428496207509722

Tapobrat Chaudhry, President & Business Head – Microfinance at Kotak Mahindra Bank, has said that the bank is investing heavily in technology and putting efforts to ensure that its digital network can withstand cyberattacks such as phishing, and online frauds, among others.

“Any external attacks such as phishing are prevented or even if it happens it is immediately known and corrective steps are taken. So our bank is investing a lot in this technology. Our bank is putting a lot of effort in ensuring that its digital network infrastructure is all up to date,” Chaudhry said.

Chaudhry was speaking at a discussion on the 'Role of tech in financial inclusion' at Moneycontrol.

The official added that every stakeholder who is part of the whole ecosystem has to ensure that sufficient safeguards are built into their delivery of the product to ensure that online fraud, phishing, impersonation and cyber security breaches don't happen.

Additionally, he said each stakeholder has to ensure that the users of their platform and products are sufficiently digitally aware and digitally literate.

On financial inclusion, Chaudhry said technology has been the most enabling factor in this journey and going forward, it will play a very important role in furthering the cause.

Technology is the single most important factor of course, along with the will and the intent of all the stakeholders, Chaudhry said.

“Financial inclusion also entails providing timely access to credit facilities, in that our bank is doing some important work in reaching out to the low-income groups, reaching out to the underserved communities and offering them banking products, credit facilities which they can use to improve their livelihood and economic activities,” he said.

Jan Dhan accounts

On Jan Dhan accounts, Chaudhry said Kotak Mahindra Bank has been at the forefront among private sector banks in terms of quarter-on-quarter growth in the number of such accounts opened, which is a part of financial inclusion.

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) was launched on August 28, 2014, with the aim to provide universal banking services through the opening of zero-balance bank accounts for every unbanked household, based on the guiding principles of banking the unbanked, securing the unsecured and funding the unfunded.

As on August 9, 2023, the number of total PMJDY accounts stood at 50.09 crore, according to a release by the Ministry of Finance. About 55.6 percent (27.82 crore) Jan Dhan account holders are women and 66.7 percent (33.45 crore) of accounts are in rural and semi-urban areas, thus the scheme has introduced banking to more and more people, it stated.",459,0.9986106554667155

Asia's richest banker Uday Kotak on Wednesday (August 23) said Kotak Mahindra Bank must outlive his name as the job of the individual is to nurture the institution over time.

Speaking about the roadmap of the Kotak Mahindra Bank, Kotak, MD and CEO, said in the United States, there was a JP Morgan. Now, there is none, and the institution lives on a 100 years later.

Also, there is Goldman and Sachs. All these were started by individuals and families, and they have outlived the individuals and families to become global institutions, Kotak said exclusively to CNBC-TV18's Shereen Bhan at the Banking Transformation Summit.

""Look at even in the technology space, look at Apple. Most people thought it was Steve Jobs, he is gone, but Apple is all-pervasive. So there's so much for us to be thinking about the institutional framework. And India needs to build that more than anything else,"" he said.

Asked about succession planning, he quoted English poet Lord Alfred Tennyson, ""I think I really would like to see this institution like the famous poem — men may come and men may go but I go on forever.""

Further, Kotak asked the Indian banking sector to be disruptive if it wants to avoid the fate of telecom, steel, airline, and other sectors.

""We need to have the fear of death for us to really get our act together... Look at what has happened to the telecom sector. There were 13 players, what happened to all of them? ... (Now there are) two-and-a-half serious players in the telecom sector. Look at the airline industry, look at steel.""

He said, ""Sector after sector, you are seeing consolidation and concentration in fewer hands. I am not against consolidation as long as we keep the competitive intensity in place. So if you compare banking to these sectors, let me ask you the question — Do we have too many banks or too few banks?""

Talking about bankruptcy law, Kotak pointed out that India is facing challenges in insolvency law and the country needs to have a quick and much better resolution, ""Therefore as India grows, you cannot have a system where the credit cost is so high because of a very high-resolution cost in case of a loan getting bad.""

""Direct lending by a bank to a business group is obviously not correct. But you can have indirect lending through the vendors, through the service providers, there can be so many linkages that can happen.

Following reports on Kotak Mahindra Bank's CEO Uday Kotak's succession plans, the private lender stated that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not said anything regarding the matter.

""We would like to state that there is no communication, formal or informal, from RBI to Kotak Mahindra Bank or its Board members on CEO succession,"" Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a statement on July 31.

The clarification follows a report by Bloomberg that stated, citing sources, that RBI is nudging Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. to select someone outside the lender’s ranks to succeed billionaire founder Uday Kotak as the next Chief Executive Officer.

According to a regulatory filing on April 21, Kotak is set to assume a non-executive role in the bank after his tenure as CEO ends this year.

Kotak will be appointed as a non-executive, non-independent Director of the bank upon the conclusion of his term as MD and CEO. Kotak's tenure as the CEO and MD of the bank will come to a close on December 31, 2023.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Despite the sharp fall in NIM (by 18bps QoQ), Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) reported a beat on earnings, with PAT at Rs34.5bn (Emkay: Rs32bn) mainly due to higher ‘other income’ including treasury gains/dividend income. We believe the sharper NIM contraction was due to moderate retail growth, lower LDR and higher CoF. Bank partly attributes the strong deposit growth (22% YoY/6% QoQ) to its ActiveMoney deposit product (contributing 7-8% of deposits, with average cost of 5-5.25%). Going forward, Bank expects NIM to clock above 5% amid the rising CoF, coupled with healthy fees, thus supporting coreprofitability. We raise earnings by 2-4% for FY24-26E, building-in higher other income, but expect KMB’s RoA/RoE to normalize to 2.1%/13% from the high of 2.4%/14% in FY23 due to margin/LLP normalization.

Outlook

We lower our P/ABV to 2.7x its Jun25E ABV for the core bank, factoring for the ensuing Top-Management change; retain HOLD, with TP at Rs2,000/sh (incl subs value at Rs500/sh).

Motilal Oswal's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB reported a robust quarter, with standalone PAT increasing 67% YoY to INR35b (14% beat), driven by higher treasury gains and dividend income of INR3b from subs. Consolidated PAT grew 51% YoY to INR41.5b. Advances grew 17% YoY (3% QoQ) to INR329b, while margin contracted by 18bp QoQ to 5.6%. Deposit growth was steady, though the CASA mix moderated 380bp QoQ due to a shift in SA deposits toward high-yielding ActivMoney product launched by the bank. Gross slippages increased 46% QoQ to INR12b, of which INR2.9b were upgraded in 1QFY24. Higher slippages and healthy recoveries held GNPA/NNPA ratios stable at 1.77%/0.4%.

Outlook

We increase our FY24/FY25 PAT estimates by 7%/5% and revise our TP to INR2,170 (3.0x FY25E BV and INR560 for subs). Maintain Neutral.

Sharekhan's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s earnings growth was steady , rising 67% y-o-y which translated to RoA of ~2.8% led by higher other income despiteNIMs compression, higher opex growth and slightly higher credit cost. Sustainable RoAs for the bank is expected in the range of 2.2-2.5%. Headline asset quality trends remained stable q-o-q with GNPA/NNPA ratio at 1.77%/0.40% although slippages ratio was higher at 1.7% versus 1.2% q-o-q (cal. as % of 12m trailing loans) due to seasonality in the portfolio and normalisation of slippages but it remained lower on y-o-y basis. Kotak`s slippage ratio still continues to be lower than the top large private bank which is a key positive. Core credit cost stood at 54 bps vs 24 bps q-o-q (excluding reversal of provisions). The bank does not see any potential stress in the any of the portfolio segment but guided that normalisation of slippages and credit cost is expected to happen. Deposit growth (up 6% q-o-q) picked up sharply and outpaced loan growth. Traction in deposits was led by term deposits and a newly product launched Activ money for saving account holders. The bank guided that it is on track with leadership transition and would come out with development sooner.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating with an unchanged SOTP-based PT of Rs. 2,250. The stock currently trades at 3.0x/2.6x its FY2024E/FY2025E core BV estimates.

LKP Research's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) reported strong 1QFY24 results and the key pointers are: a) Strong NII (up 33% YoY and 2% QoQ) and seasonally higher provisions, b) GNPA/NNPA ratio stable at 1.77%/0.44%, c) restructured pool inched down to ₹6.1bn (19bps of advances) v/s ₹7.2bn in the previous quarter, d) credit off-take strong with growth of 17.3% YoY and 2.7% sequentially, e) covid provision held at ₹3.4bn as of 4QFY23, provision write-back worth ₹50mn, f) the total contingent provisioning (covid + Standard + Specific) stood 0.6% of net advances, h) Total PCR (including covid, general and specific provision) stood ~110% of GNPL amount, g) Headline NIM inched down 18bps QoQ to 5.57%. Moreover, stable Opex (C/I at 44.5%) led to superior ROA of ~2.8%. However, employee attrition is higher than peers and has a relatively weak liability franchise (v/s peers: HDFCB and ICICIB) that will be tested in FY24E as deposit competition is intensifying. Nevertheless, asset quality provides comfort for lower credit cost. Hence, the peak ROA (~3% in 4QFY23) likely to settle at the historical range of 2.2 % - 2.4%. We recommend BUY factoring a best in class ROA of more than 2.5%.

Outlook

We expect KMB’s loan book to grow at CAGR of ~18% over FY23-25E. At CMP of ₹1971, the stock is available at 3.7(x) standalone FY25E Adj. BVPS of ₹539. Valuing the standalone entity with 4.2xFY25E BVPS and subsidiaries valuation at ₹74; we arrive at a target price of ₹2,340. We recommend BUY with a potential upside of ~19%.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB saw a mixed quarter. NIM beat of 16bps resulted in better NII that was offset by lower fees and higher opex. PPoP beat of 13.3% was mainly led by higher treasury and dividend income. Business growth QoQ was also more wholesale driven as corporate credit grew by 7.0%, while wholesale deposit growth was 18%. RTD share was 80% (vs 88% a year ago). A key positive has been continuing traction in unsecured segments with PL/CC/MFI share touching 10.4% (7.8% YoY). Healthy credit environment could further propel unsecured growth cushioning NIM, although opex would continue to remain elevated.

Outlook

Hence for FY24/25E we raise NIM by 17/19bps and increase opex by ~5.4% resulting in PAT upgrade of 5.0%. Valuation is at 3.0x; maintaining multiple at 3.5x on Mar’25 core ABV we slightly raise SOTP based TP to Rs2,250 from Rs2,220. Retain ‘BUY’.

Kotak Mahindra Bank has enthused analysts with its stable asset quality and profit growth for the quarter ended June 2023. Following the results, brokerages raised their price targets 7-22 percent higher than the last closing price of Rs 1,970.

The stock, however, opened in the red on July 24 and was trading 2 percent down at Rs 1,926.55 around 9.40am. It had gained 4 percent in the week ahead of results.

The bank has reported a standalone profit of Rs 3,452.3 crore for Q1, growing 66.7 percent over the year-ago period, despite rise in provisions and contingencies.

Kotak Mahindra Bank's net interest income grew 32.7 percent on-year to Rs 6,233.7 crore, with net interest margin at 5.57 percent. Loans grew 19 percent, while deposits surged over 22 percent. Asset quality was largely stable with the gross NPA (non-performing assets) falling 1 basis point sequentially to 1.77 percent, and net NPA rising 3 bps to 0.40 percent, said the bank in an exchange filing.

Meanwhile, net interest margin was flat sequentially at 5.57 percent.

Morgan Stanley has given an 'equal-weight' rating to the stock with a target price of Rs 2,250 per share, emphasising the bank's consistent performance. The broking firm has highlighted the significant acceleration in deposit growth during the quarter and anticipates strong potential for operating leverage going ahead.

Bernstein, on the other hand, has a 'market-perform' rating for the bank with a target price of Rs 2,100 per share. It has attributed its on-year earnings per share (EPS) growth of 67 percent to a healthy NIM (net interest margin), which was in line with estimates. However, there is an expectation of a slight sequential decline in NIM for the large private banks due to a surge in term deposits, it noted.

JPMorgan has given a 'neutral' rating to the stock with a target price of Rs 2,070 per share. ""Valuations have de-rated and catch-up to historical premium will need to sustain delivery. Any positive market reaction in the near term could be influenced by potential M&A actions,"" it said.

In contrast, Jefferies holds a 'buy' rating for Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of Rs 2,400 per share. Although loan growth has slowed, the rise in high-yielding unsecured loans has positively impacted margins, it said.

Domestic broking firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services has reiterated its 'neutral' rating with a target price of Rs 2,170. ""We raise our earnings estimates by 7 percent/5 percent for FY24/25 and expect the bank to deliver RoA/RoE of 2.4 percent/14.3 percent in FY25,"" the firm said.

Last week, in a letter to shareholders, the bank's managing director and chief executive officer Uday Kotak said that he will likely take a non-executive role soon. He is set to retire as the top boss of the bank in December 2023 and his successor has not been announced yet.

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Chief Financial Officer Jaimin Bhatt on July 22 said the bank witnessed slippages from segments such as tractor finance and unsecured retail loans in the first quarter of the current financial year.

A loan becomes a non-performing asset (NPA) when there is no repayment of interest or principal for a period of 90 days. Banks need to set aside money in the form of provisions to cover such loans.

“Slippages came from tractor finance and retail unsecured loan,” Bhatt said.

In the April-June quarter, the bank reported slippages of Rs 1,205 crore, which is 0.4 percent of the net advances. Of this, Rs 288 crore was upgraded within Q1FY24.

In the same period last year, slippages were Rs 1,435 crore.

The tractor finance segment of the bank in the June quarter increased by 26 percent on-year to Rs 13,916 crore, and unsecured loans increased by 10.7 percent on-year.

Kotak Mahindra Bank in April-June recorded an increase in unsecured retail loans, when compared with the year-ago period, with credit card outstanding and microfinance loans surging aggressively.

Retail unsecured loans of the bank reached 10.7 percent of the total loan book as of June 2023 from 7.9 percent a year back, according to an investor presentation by the private sector lender.

Retail microfinance loans surged 91 percent over last year, while credit card outstanding jumped 67 percent.

Retail microloans are given to low-income groups who are typically small businessmen and vendors.

Bhatt further said there were slippages from the corporate side also in the April-June quarter. Corporate banking grew just 9 percent on-year to Rs 77,569 crore in April-June.

On the asset front, the private sector lender has witnessed an improvement, with the gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio falling to 1.77 percent from 1.78 percent in the quarter-ago period, and 2.24 percent in the year-ago period.

The moderation in the yields following a rate pause by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) since April could have prompted the Mumbai-based private lender to increase exposure in government securities, dealers said. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.

“PAT is expected to grow…led by healthy advances growth across most segments and re-pricing of asset book. The growth is also expected to be driven by unsecured segment with a very strong growth in personal loans and credit card segment…,” domestic brokerage Ashika said in a note.

Provisioning is expected to decline by 5 percent QoQ (but soar 496 percent YoY) , it said, adding, “With the utilization of provisioning buffer, we expect it to come to a normalized level.”

Operational Metrics

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s net interest margin (NIM) – a key measure of profitability – stood at 5.75 percent at the end of March 2023.

“We expect Kotak's NIM to decline 12 bps QoQ, lower than the decline for ICICI Bank because of improving loan mix. However, from Q2, Kotak's NIM decline could accelerate due to the newly launched sweep deposit scheme,” Nuvama Institutional Equities said.

However, it expects loan growth of 4 percent QoQ (19 percent YoY) for the bank amid healthy disbursements by the sector as a whole.

Analysts at Ashika added that the bank’s NIM is expected to remain in excess of 5 percent in FY24 even in the worst-case scenario.

“Based on RBI data up to May 2023, loan growth has been driven by unsecured loans including credit cards, and trade while growth in NBFCs and housing has moderated,” it added.

As per the RBI data, credit growth stood at 15.6 percent as of May’23, mainly led by retail and service sectors. Overall sectoral growth remained upbeat in 15-17 percent range.

Analysts said healthy credit off-take momentum, healthy treasury operations and relatively muted credit cost are expected to drive healthy performance of banks across segments in 1Q FY24.

Kotak Mahindra Bank shares ended 0.56 percent up at Rs 1,968.35 on July 21 despite an across-the-board sell-off in the market. The shares are up nearly 8 percent on YTD basis.

Dalal Street has seen a slew of bulk deals in recent times, with banking and finance companies accounting for the lion’s share of the transactions.

Kotak Mahindra Bank tops the list, with shares worth over Rs 8,300 crore being offloaded by two institutional investors.

Other prominent names include Shriram Finance and HDFC AMC.

Significantly, many of these stocks have fallen since their block/bulk deal dates.

Does this mean institutional investors have timed their exits to coincide with the market top?

Siddhartha Khemka, VP - Head of Research (Retail) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said this is one of the factors behind the current block deals, but not the only one.

“Most institutional investors have a time horizon for their investments. At the end of that holding period, say 3 or 5 years, they will look to sell their stake. Of course, they would want to sell when the market is in a bull run. But to say this is the only factor would be misleading, as we have to remember that the buyers are also institutional investors,” he told Moneycontrol.

He further said in some cases, for example, Abrdn, the investors were already paring their stake in the target firms (HDFC group, in this case).

Another fallout of the bulk deals has been FTSE increasing the weights of HDFC AMC, Shriram Finance and Timken India in its indices.

After the stake sales by promoters and strategic investors, the chunks have been added to free float market capitalisation, which has resulted in a weight increase.

This will lead to a cumulative inflow of $44 million into these scrips, according to Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

Shriram Finance is expected to see inflows to the tune of $19 million, HDFC AMC of $16 million and Timken India of $9 million. This will happen as passive funds tracking FTSE indices will rebalance their portfolio on June 23, added Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

""Sale of stakes held by Piramal and TPG remove a key overhang on valuation. Thus, we upgrade the stock to buy and raise the target to Rs 2,130 from Rs 1,445 per share,"" said foreign broking firm Jefferies in a recent note.

Some analysts also attributed the recent block deals, especially by midcap and smallcap firms, to the current bull run in these segments, which presents an attractive opportunity for promoters, FIIs and other large investors to take some money off the table.

Investor Churn

On June 9, Canada's state-run Canada Pension Fund sold 3.3 crore shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank, amounting to a 1.7 percent equity stake, at an average price of Rs 1,855.64 per share.

Canada Pension Fund held 4.3 percent equity in Kotak Mahindra Bank as of March 2023 end.

Another prominent name on the list is HDFC AMC.

UK-based Abrdn Investment divested its entire 10.2 percent stake in the country’s third-largest mutual fund house.

Abrdn, formerly known as Standard Life, has been consistently paring its stake in HDFC companies for some time now. The UK-based investment firm had sold off its entire 1.66 percent stake in HDFC Life Insurance for Rs 2,036.7 crore through a block deal on May 31.

Despite the recent bout of selling in frontline stocks, many analysts see pockets of opportunities.

""The banking sector has a large number of well-managed private banks, financial institutions and non-lending banking finance companies, offering a multitude of opportunities,"" White Oak Capital Management founder Prashant Khemka said.

The Nifty Bank index, which has the highest weight in the Nifty, has delivered a return of over 10 percent over the past three months. Bank stocks have been some of the best performers in the past year. This is also a space where analysts see value.

On June 15, Kotak Mahindra Bank launched its ActivMoney feature, which gives customers the benefit of fixed deposit (FD)-like interest up to 7 percent per annum, and the flexibility to access their funds at any time from the linked savings account. This is an auto sweep feature that is offered by several other banks, including Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank.

What is an auto sweep feature?

This allows a savings account holder to earn higher interest as offered in FDs while retaining the liquidity offered by a saving account. Some banks like Jana Small Finance Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank extend this facility to their current account holders.

As and when the balance in the savings or current account crosses a preset threshold, the excess amount is automatically used to open FDs for a pre-determined tenure (also called sweep-out). Similarly, when the savings account balance falls below a pre-determined limit, the linked FD(s) are automatically closed and the proceeds credited to the savings account to make up the deficit (also called sweep-in). The threshold limit for sweep-out varies. For instance, at Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, the required threshold amount in the savings account is Rs 25,000, at ICICI Bank its Rs 15,000, and at IndusInd Bank its Rs 20,000 (see graphic).

The tenure of FDs and interest rates vary with the banks. For instance, Kotak’s ActivMoney is a facility of automatically sweeping out funds above a threshold from your savings account to a FD account for 180 days. In case of insufficient balance in your account, the FD will be broken prematurely, with no early withdrawal charges, and the required amount will be transferred to your account. This facility will allow depositors to earn interest up to 7 percent per annum on their deposits, compared with an average 3.5 percent per annum for a normal savings account.

“An auto sweep facility is extremely beneficial for consumers who have to maintain large balances in their savings accounts to deal with cash flow uncertainties,” said Naveen Kukreja, co-founder and CEO, Paisabazaar.com. He added that others can also use the auto-sweep facility to build and park their emergency fund and corpus meant for their short-term financial goals.

On the launch of ActivMoney, Rohit Bhasin, president, retail liabilities products and chief marketing officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said, “It fulfils the needs of young, aspirational consumers seeking higher returns on their savings whilst having the flexibility to access funds whenever needed. ActivMoney makes banking more rewarding and enables consumers to use their savings more efficiently and effectively.”

How does auto sweep works?

Assume you have a Kotak Edge Savings Account and you opt for the ActivMoney facility. The default ActivMoney threshold for your savings account is Rs 25,000. Now, in case your savings account balance is more than the threshold of Rs 25,000, the excess amount will automatically get transferred in multiples of Rs 10,000 to a 180-day FD. You will then earn the prevailing FD rate on the balance that has been transferred to the FD. As this FD is linked to your savings account, you can access the funds whenever you wish to, with no penalty charges.

In case you are falling short of funds in your savings account, the deficit will be withdrawn from your FD automatically. This feature works similarly at other banks as well but, as mentioned earlier, the threshold limit, FD tenure and interest rate will differ.

Difference between an auto sweep account and a regular FD

To invest in auto sweep FD, you need to give a consent only one time to your bank for a particular savings account. After that, the surplus amount beyond the threshold limit is automatically converted into FD. As a result, you will earn higher returns and you won’t need to visit the bank branch to obtain an FD or apply for FD online on the bank website every time you have a surplus amount in the savings account.

In the case of a regular FD, you will have to request your bank every time to convert your surplus amount in the savings account to an FD.

Tax implications on auto sweep account

In the auto sweep account, there will be multiple interest earnings because of sweep-in and sweep-out at regular intervals. You need to reconcile the account statement appropriately for taxation purposes.

The interest in the savings account is exempt till Rs 10,000 under Section 80TTA. On FD under a sweep-in account, interest is subject to income tax according to the applicable tax slab. TDS or tax deducted at source at a rate of 10 percent is deducted from FD interest if it exceeds Rs 10,000 in a year. It’s important to note that your income slab will determine how much tax you have to pay for the interest earned on FDs. For instance, if your income is over Rs 10 lakh, you are subject to a 30 percent tax rate.

Factors to consider before opting for auto sweep accounts

“Consumers should carefully consider the various terms and conditions related to auto sweep accounts like the tenure offered for the linked FDs, interest rates offered on the tenure, levy of premature withdrawal penalty on the linked FDs, threshold amount for FD opening and closures, the size of the FDs created, etc,” said Kukreja. He underlined that since these conditions can vary widely across banks, consumers should weigh these factors and opt for the bank that suits their payment cycle the best.

What should you do?

An auto sweep account is best suited to conservative depositors, i.e., those who avoid high risks. It’s also beneficial to businesses that get no interest in their current accounts with the bank. If you are a small saver, you may prefer to open an account with a bank having lower threshold limits on the auto sweep savings account.

An auto sweep account is useful if you regularly have a surplus amount after your monthly expenses in a savings account at the end of the month.

“You can also consider the high-yield savings accounts offered by some private sector banks and small finance banks for managing their liquidity and payment cycles,” pointed out Kukreja, adding that account holders can earn interest rates of 5-7 percent per annum from these savings accounts depending on the balance maintained. These savings accounts might offer higher flexibility and returns to the account holders than auto sweep facilities.",1143,0.6287809525217328

He says that the card’s target customer segments are millennials (those born between 1981 and 1995), as well as Gen Z (those born between 1996 and 2010).

But the benefits don’t just stop at Myntra. Users will earn a 5 percent cashback while spending at preferred partners Swiggy, Cleartrip, Urban Company and PVR up to Rs 1,000 per month.

Elsewhere, you will earn 1.25 percent cashback, excluding rent, recharges, fuel, and Equated Monthly Instalment spending.

Aside from complimentary domestic airport lounge access, you could also get two PVR tickets a quarter, if you spend at least Rs 50,000 per quarter.

How much does it cost?

The credit card has a joining fee of Rs 500, but as an introductory offer, the bank is offering the card at zero joining fee for a limited period. The renewal fee of Rs 500 is applicable after completing one year if you get the card without joining fees. However, the renewal fee of Rs 500 will be waived on spending Rs 2 lakh or more a year.

Users get a virtual and physical card after completing the application process and video Know Your Customer process. The credit card will be available on MasterCard and RuPay networks.

What works

Kotak Myntra credit card users get a 7.5 percent instant discount on all Myntra transactions with a cap of Rs 750 per transaction.

For instance, on the first purchase of Rs 9,000 on Myntra, you will get an instant discount of Rs 675. Then on the second and third purchases of Rs 8,000 and Rs 9,500, you will get an instant discount of Rs 600 and Rs 713, respectively.

“To get a maximum benefit of instant discount from Myntra, you may have to break the transactions/purchases in small denominations,” says Sumanta Mandal, Founder, TechnoFino, a firm that tracks credit card trends.

Flipkart Axis Bank card offers 5 percent unlimited cashback on Myntra. “Flipkart Axis Bank Card would be beneficial only when someone is buying a single product/billing above Rs 15,000 on Myntra because of 5 percent unlimited cashback,” says Ankur Mittal, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, Card Insider.

Standard Chartered Digi Smart credit card offers a 20 percent discount, but with a cap of Rs 700, and discount is applicable only on the first Myntra transaction of the month (refer to graphic).

Apart from the discount on Myntra, the card provides a 5 percent cashback on partner brands, and an unlimited 1.25 percent cashback on all other spends.

“What makes this card stand out is the Myntra Insider membership, offering early access to sales, exclusive discounts and offers, and Supercoins,” says Mittal.

“The card is being issued on the RuPay network, which can be linked to the UPI,” says Mandal.

He adds that this can penetrate the market and contribute to an increase in usage as a preferred mode of payment.

What doesn’t work

Mandal says that the fee waiver condition is high compared to other co-branded cards in this segment. For instance, on Standard Chartered Digi Smart credit card, the monthly fee is Rs 49 and if the user spends Rs 5,000 per month, the fees get reversed.

“A card user needs to spend Rs 17,000 to Rs 18,000 per month on credit transactions, which is a bare nominal expectation and it will take your total expenditure to Rs 2 lakh and above. Then the renewal fees of Rs 500 will be waived off,” says Dsouza.

There is a joining/renewal fee of Rs 500 on the Kotak Myntra card whereas the ICICI Amazon Pay credit card is a lifetime-free credit card.

“We are not seeking to claim a joining fee from anyone. In fact, we are giving the benefit back instantly to our users,” says Dsouza. For instance, the users get a voucher worth Rs 500 from Myntra on the first transaction with a card.

Should you apply?

For the fashion-loving generation, Myntra has become a popular website to shop. Kotak Myntra credit card’s instant discount on Myntra and other benefits on lifestyle expenses of the millennials and Gen Z does sweeten the shopping experience.

“If you are a loyal Myntra customer, there is no better card in the market currently than the Myntra Kotak credit card,” says Mittal.

But it’s still worthwhile to first check your spending patterns and not just buy the card because it gives you discounts. Mandal also advises you to compare the annual fees that other cards offer.

A warning: If you do apply for this shopping card, do not overspend just because there are discounts on offer.

Make sure that you have a disciplined approach to your credit behaviour. Since a credit card offers a significant interest-free period, there may be a tendency to overspend while shopping and chasing milestone benefits.",984,0.5883501648902894

While the buyers and sellers were not known immediately, it was earlier reported that the Canada's state-run Canada Pension Fund was looking to sell a 1.66 percent stake in the private lender.

Canada Pension Fund held 4.3 percent equity in Kotak Mahindra Bank as of March 2023 end.

As Canada Pension Fund is an FII (foreign institutional investor), investors are curious whether the stake sale means foreign room opening up and thus leading to higher weightage on MSCI.

According to Nuvama Alternative Research's Abhilash Pagaria, this is unlikely. ""Post the May MSCI rejig, the FIF or the foreign inclusion factor is now 55 percent and FOL (foreign limit) in the stock is capped at 55 percent. So there is no scope of foreign headroom and hence no weight up,"" he explained.

Foreign investors' holding in Kotak Mahindra Bank already dropped to 41.22 percent in the March 2023 quarter, lower by 1.47 percentage points from December. Following this, MSCI had used an adjustment factor of 1 for calculating Kotak Bank's weightage in its index versus 0.5 adjustment factor earlier.

In Q4, Kotak Mahindra Bank reported 26.3 percent year-on-year rise in its standalone net profit at Rs 3,495.6 crore while its net interest income (NII) jumped 35 percent YoY to Rs 6,102.6 crore.

The bank's net NPA decreased to Rs 1,193.30 crore in Q4 vs Rs 1,736.71 crore in the year-ago period. In percentage terms, the net NPA improved further to 0.37 percent of net advances as against 0.64 percent in the corresponding quarter of FY22.

The stock has 24 Buy call, 15 Hold and 3 Sell calls on it. The consensus target price on the stock is Rs 2141, representing 14 percent upside from current levels.

At 9:45am on June 9, the stock was quoting at Rs 1,871.80, 0.7 percent from previous close.

Kotak Mahindra Bank plans to ramp up its digital channels to acquire business customers, aiming to expand its corporate client base three times, a top executive said.

The lender now has 40,000 customers on Fynn, its digital service for corporate and business clients, said Shekhar Bhandari, President of Global Transaction Banking.

“…we aim to take this number to 1.2 lakh by the end of FY24,” Bhandari told Moneycontrol.

Kotak Mahindra Bank is looking to target potential new customers via different social media channels and plans to run campaigns on sites like LinkedIn, Bhandari said.

More investments in tech

Customers of several banks have of late complained about issues with their banks’ digital services. Some have complained of transaction delays; others about encountering errors.

On issues with digital services, Bhandari said the size and speed at which digital transactions are taking place shows the need for a strong technology network.

“The current banking think tanks have to prepare a robust system which can manage speed, scale and safety of the transactions,” said Bhandari.

The use of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning is set to grow.

“On Fynn, we have decided to have all the growth aspects of technology. like introducing artificial intelligence and machine learning in our platform,” he said.

In the past few months, many banks have introduced new digital banking initiatives and partnerships to expand their reach on the digital front.

The country’s largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, in January 2023 partnered with Microsoft in the next phase of its digital transformation journey to unlock business value by transforming the application portfolio, modernizing the data landscape, and securing the enterprise with Microsoft Cloud.

Bull markets and bear markets last long enough that the average trader is likely to forget by the time the climax is approaching that any sort of movement is possible. — Philip Carret

One man’s meat is another’s poison, so the saying goes. This is true of the relation between market operators and fund managers of passive schemes when the latter must rebalance their portfolios because of changes to benchmark indices.

For a while now, the street has been agog with the chatter of how some market operators have been benefitting whenever there are changes announced to MSCI Indices. These operators load up on the stocks which are likely to be added to the indices, or whose weightages are set to rise, and then sell them to passive funds looking for these stocks on the day at marked-up prices when the revised weightages become effective.

Fund managers have little choice but to buy the stocks at the prevailing prices. In some cases, say market observers, there is also a tacit understanding between the operators and fund managers since the funds can justify having the higher prices paid for the stocks.

Some of the stocks which witnessed heightened volatility on May 31 as a result of the MSCI Index rejig were Kotak Mahindra Bank and Sona BLW Precision Forgings. Both stocks saw a sharp rally in the last 15-20 minutes of trade on the day, which brokers say was a clear sign of desperate buying by the funds.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

In the case of Kotak Bank, interestingly there was frenetic activity in the securities lending and borrowing (SLB) window as well. SLB is a mechanism where investors bearish on a stock borrow shares from those willing to lend it for a fee, and then sell them in the market.

Dealers tracking the stock said that most of the deals in the SLB window were struck at higher than usual rates, though it is not clear if the heavy buying was to soak up available supply in the system or if it is by someone very bearish on the stock.

Typically, stocks get a bump up when they benefit from an index rejig, but then plateau or drift lower unless there is a strong trigger for the stock to maintain its uptrend. Open positions in Kotak Mahindra Bank jumped from 10 lakh shares to 50 lakh shares between May 30 and May 31.

The jump in short positions apart, even more puzzling was the steep discount in Kotak Bank futures intra-day on May 31. At one point, the futures were trading at a Rs 40 discount to the cash market price, which is highly unusual for a large-cap stock like Kotak Bank. The wide cap indicated that buyers of the shares were willing to pay any price during the last half an hour of trade on May 31. The stock gave up much of its gains the following day as the buying frenzy abated.

Sona BLW Precision Forgings

The stock witnessed a huge bulk deal early in early trade on May 31, with a promoter group entity selling 1.9 crore shares at Rs 503 apiece. Around 1.18 crore shares of that lot were picked up by institutional investors. The stock traded around Rs 530 levels for much of the day and then surged in the last half an hour to hit the day’s high of Rs 573.

Short Call

Market chatter is that some well-informed traders who were aware of the impending bulk deal cornered a sizeable chunk of the shares by bidding slightly higher than the institutional buyers.

At the fag end of the session, they offloaded the position to passive funds looking to rebalance their portfolio. Like Kotak Bank, this stock, too, fell sharply the following day in the absence of following up buying interest.

Vedanta

Parent Vedanta Resources has said that it has paid all its maturing loans and bonds due in May and June 2023, but bears appear to the of the view that there is some money to be made going short on the stock. Open positions in the securities and lending window now stands at 1.73 crore shares. This was less than 50 lakh shares at the start of May.

Seeing Red

For Western companies, perhaps it’s easier to do business on the red planet than in Red China.

CDPQ, one of the top Canadian pension funds, has stopped making private deals in China, the latest foreign major to pull back from the country amid ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions with the West.

The $295-billion group is closing its Shanghai office, though it still has investments in the country, including in Hong Kong, reports FT.

This comes less than two years after CDPQ’s chief executive Charles Emond said the pension giant was planning to more than double its exposure to China to 10 percent of its portfolio in the years to come.

Neal and Nikkei

An interesting trend is underway in Japan. While foreign investors have rediscovered their love for Japanese stocks, sending the benchmark Nikkei to heights not seen since the asset bubble collapse in 1990s, domestic investors are on a selling spree.

In April and May, domestic outflows totalled around 2 trillion yen (USD 14.81 billion) for individual investors and over 2.2 trillion yen for Japanese institutions.

Foreign investors say they are excited about the prospect of a new era of growth in corporate Japan, but their domestic counterparts — no strangers to a disappointing market — are eager to book profits. Headline-grabbing purchases from marquee investors, including Warren Buffet, have propelled the Nikkei by 18 percent so far in 2023, making it Asia's best performing stock market.

Pricey burgers

Hamburger and steak lovers in the US may have to shell out more for their favourite meal, which are already at near record-level prices

From a WSJ report:

“The culprit is a rapidly shrinking supply of cattle. Years of persistent drought conditions, which make cattle more expensive to raise, pandemic disruptions and widespread cost increases have prompted ranchers to sell off livestock, bringing the number of cattle in the U.S. to its lowest level in nearly a decade. With costs rising for nearly every aspect of raising cattle, ranchers say they are running out of reasons to replace the livestock they send to slaughter, let alone enlarge their herds.”

The ongoing cattle shortage is reflected in the prices of live cattle futures that reached a new all-time high Thursday of $1.72 a pound.

As part of the reshuffling exercise, Adani Transmission, Adani Total Gas, and Indus Towers will be removed from the MSCI Global Standard Index, while Max Healthcare Institute, Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), and Sona BLW Precision Forgings will be included, as mentioned in the Nuvama report.

The removal of Adani companies from the MSCI Global Standard Index is expected to lead to outflows of $189 million for Adani Transmission and $167 million for Adani Total Gas.

The Nuvama report explains that if Adani Total Gas or Adani Transmission trades at the lower price limit for a cumulative duration of at least 5 minutes on the given day, MSCI will delete these securities at the lowest system price as of the close of May 31, 2023. Otherwise, MSCI will use the official closing prices, following the MSCI Index Calculation methodology.

According to Nuvama, the inclusion of Max Healthcare in the MSCI Global Standard Index is projected to result in inflows of $312 million and the addition of 47 million shares. Max Healthcare will carry a weight of 0.52 in the index. Additionally, the inclusion of HAL and Sona BLW is expected to bring inflows of $196 million and $171 million, respectively, with HAL carrying a weight of 0.33 and Sona BLW having a weight of 0.29 in the index.

Margins continued to scale new highs at 5.75% (up 28bps q-o-q) in Q4FY2023 and 5.33% for FY2023. The bank is guiding for lower margins compared to FY2023 but is confident on sustaining margins above 5% in FY2024. Credit cost reported at 24bps (annualised) vs. 27bps q-o-q. Overall asset-quality outlook continues to remain stable to positive, thus benign credit cost environment is expected to continue in FY2024. Deposit growth outpaced loan growth sequentially. Traction in deposits was led by term deposits; but on the positive side, CASA growth picked up sequentially, led by CA balances. Near-term focus would be on the transition of MD and CEO post. The bank is expected to apply sooner with the RBI.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating with an unchanged SOTP-based PT of Rs. 2,250. The stock currently trades at 3.1x/2.7x its FY2024E/FY2025E core BV estimates.

LKP Research's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) reported strong 4QFY23 results with the key pointers being: a) Strong NII (up 35% YoY and 8% QoQ) and seasonally stable provisions, b) GNPA/NNPA ratio moderation to 1.78%/0.37%, c) restructured pool inched down to ₹7.1bn (22bps of advances) v/s ₹7.7bn in the previous quarter, d) credit off-take strong with growth of 18% YoY and 3% sequentially, e) covid provision held at ₹4bn as of 3QFY23, provision write-back worth ₹380mn, f) the total contingent provisioning (Covid + Standard + Specific) stood 0.6% of net advances, h) Total PCR (including covid, general and specific provision) stood ~113% of GNPL amount, g) Headline NIM inched up 28bps QoQ to 5.75%. Moreover, lower Opex (C/I at 44% v/s 50% in 3QFY23) led to superior ROA of ~3%. However, we see a weakness in fixed rate saving account growth. It has a relatively weak liability franchise (v/s peers: HDFCB and ICICIB) that will be tested in FY24E as deposit competition is intensifying. We believe, 4QFY23 to be peak of earnings as there is no further room for EBLR re-pricing. The CDR bottleneck (~89%) shows the imminent pressure to grow deposits. Furthermore, the uncertainty over Uday Kotak’s replacement will remain a short term overhang. Nevertheless, asset quality provides comfort for lower credit cost. Hence, the peak ROA (~3% in 4QFY23) likely to settle at the historical range of 2.2 % - 2.4%. We recommend BUY factoring a best in class ROA of more than 2%.

Outlook

We expect KMB’s loan book to grow at CAGR of ~18% over FY23-25E. At CMP of ₹1938, the stock is available at 3.7(x) standalone FY25E Adj. BVPS of ₹539. Valuing the standalone entity with 4.0xFY25E BVPS and subsidiaries valuation at ₹74; we arrive at a target price of ₹2,232. We recommend BUY with a potential upside of 15%.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) saw a strong quarter as PAT at Rs35bn beat PLe by 26%, largely led by lower opex due to change in pension annuity rates and QoQ normalization of one-time promotional expenses. While loan growth was a miss at 18% YoY (PLe 21%), NIM was a beat 5.86% (PLe 5.58%) as sequential credit flow (2.9%) was mainly in favour of higher yielding non-housing retail (+7.6%). Traction continues in superior margin segments and bank is on course to achieve its guidance (unsecured share to mid-teens in FY24E) as mix of PL/CC/MFI has consistently risen over FY22 to FY23 from 6.8% to 9.9%. Share of granular deposits (<Rs50mn) in quarterly flow was better.

Outlook

We remain optimistic on KMB as balance sheet construct is improving, which would cushion margins. Valuation is at 2.9x; maintaining multiple at 3.5x, we roll forward to Mar’25 core ABV and raise SOTP based TP to Rs2,220. from Rs2,100. Retain ‘BUY’.

Kotak Mahindra Bank shares opened lower on May 2 even as the bank beat Street estimates and reported a 26 percent jump in standalone net profit at Rs 3,495 crore for the March quarter. A poll of brokerages had estimated net profit at Rs 2,925.7 crore for the fourth quarter.

The private lender's net interest income (NII) for Q4 FY23 increased to Rs 6,103 crore, from Rs 4,521 crore in Q4 FY22, up 35 percent. Net interest margin (NIM) was 5.33 percent for FY23 and 5.75 percent for Q4 FY23, the bank said in a press release.

However, overall corporate credit growth in the banking system has not been very strong currently as the capacity creation is yet to pick up, said Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Whole Time Director KVS Manian.

“Broadly speaking, we are still not seeing very strong capacity creation and therefore loan demand arising out of that,” he said in the earnings call.

At 9:25 am, the stock was quoting at Rs 1,917.70 on the NSE, lower by 1.09 percent from previous close.

Moreover, CASA ratio (ratio of deposits in current and saving accounts to total deposits) fell to 52.8 percent for FY23 from 60.7 percent in FY24.

Here's how brokerages are seeing the numbers:

JPMorgan has a Neutral rating with a target of Rs 2,070 per share. The firm believes that the bank's operating conditions remain favorable, with standalone net income ahead of expectations due to a net interest margin (NIM) beat and lower operational expenses.

Macquarie has also given a Neutral rating with a target of Rs 1,860 per share. ""Corporate loan growth remains weak. Need to monitor the bank's loan growth and deposit growth closely, as both below expectations,"" the firm said. The bank's valuation of 2.7x FY25 P/BV remains high, it added.

On the other hand, Goldman Sachs has a Buy rating with a target of Rs 2,513 per share. Goldman Sachs' analysts believe that the bank's margins are unlikely to drop below 5 percent and that management has good visibility to sustain that level or above in FY24.

""The bank's asset quality remained fairly strong, and the bank's appetite for risk has improved. Digital would be a big focus for the bank,"" they said.

Jefferies, too, has a Buy rating with a target of Rs 2,400 on the stock. Wider NIMs, high growth in unsecured loans, and strong asset quality is what Jefferies likes about the stock.

However, its analysts found that the decline in core savings deposit and weaker earnings for most subsidiaries was disappointing. ""Pick-up in core deposit growth was key to lifting loan growth,"" they said.

The only brokerage that has downgraded the stock is CLSA, from Buy to Outperform. This is because the stock has gained over 17 percent since March. ""Improving retail deposit momentum would be key,"" CLSA said, pegging the target at Rs 2,150.

Going forward, all analysts and brokerages are keenly monitoring possible M&A (merger & acquisition) of Kotak Mahindra Bank with IDBI Bank. Kotak Bank is among those that have submitted expressions of interest in picking up a majority stake in state-owned IDBI Bank's divestment process.

Kotak Mahindra Bank on April 29 said Uday Kotak's proposed re-appointment in a non-executive role is in the best interest of all stakeholders and complies with regulations.

""We have gone in accordance within the rules and regulations, and we do believe it is in the interest of all the stakeholders,"" Kotak Mahindra Bank's Group CFO Jaimin Bhatt said during the post-earnings press conference.

Further, he said they have not received any communication from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the reappointment front.

On April 21, 99 percent or 9,986 shareholders of Kotak Mahindra Bank voted in favour of Uday Kotak taking up the non-executive, non-independent director's role at the bank after he steps down as MD and CEO.

On the appointment front, Experts Moneycontrol spoke to earlier said Veteran banker Uday Kotak is unlikely to face hurdles in taking up the non-executive, non-independent director role after his tenure as managing director and chief executive officer ends.

This is because the three-year cooling-off period norm set by the RBI for the reappointment of an MD, CEO or whole-time director (WTD) will not apply for non-executive positions, they said.

According to an April, 2021, RBI circular, the MD and CEO or whole-time director (WTD) of a bank must undergo a three-year cooling-off period post their tenure, during which the individual cannot not be appointed or associated with the bank or its group entities in any capacity, either directly or indirectly.

Experts, however, point out that the central bank rules do not mention anything about top executives seeking reappointment as board members after retirement.

The bank's asset quality continued to improve. Gross NPA (non performing assets) ratio was 1.78 percent and net NPA ratio was 0.37 percent as of March 2023 end. Compared to this, GNPA stood at 1.90 percent and NNPA at 0.43 percent in the December 2022 quarter.

“As per the RBI circular dated April 26, 2021, the requirement of the three-year cooling period is for MD and CEO and whole-time director, and Kotak Mahindra Bank in its meeting has proposed to appoint him as non-executive director and, therefore, the cooling-off period is not applicable,” said Pradeep K Jain, managing partner, Singhania & Co, a Delhi-based law firm.

""I do not think it was the intention of the RBI to require a cooling-off period for NED (non-executive director) otherwise it would have mentioned it in the circular itself,"" Jain added.

A senior banker who didn't want to be identified too said there is unlikely to be a conflict of interest in Uday Kotak's case and, hence, the three year cooling-off period may not apply. ""However, the RBI shall be the final arbiter of the matter,” the banker added.

Kotak Mahindra Bank did not respond to a specific question from Moneycontrol on whether the bank has sought the central bank’s permission for Kotak’s reappointment in the non-executive role. A separate email sent to the RBI too did not elicit any response till the time of filing this copy.

What do the RBI regulations say?

According to an April, 2021, RBI circular, the MD and CEO or WTD of a bank must undergo a three-year cooling-off period post their tenure, during which the individual cannot not be appointed or associated with the bank or its group entities in any capacity, either directly or indirectly.

Experts, however, point out that the central bank rules do not mention anything about top executives seeking reappointment as board members after retirement. “So this is the area where Kotak Mahindra Bank will play up if any regulatory things pops up,” another banker said.

JN Gupta, former executive director of markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India, too said Kotak's appointment is unlikely to face pushback from the RBI.

According to Gupta, the central bank will not examine the appointment as it is in the existing framework of law. “What is interesting to note is such a law existed in only extremely weak economies where banking supervision is weak, which is not the case here. It is as per the provisions of the RBI circular and within the power of the bank,” Gupta added.

Uday Kotak, who has led the bank for more than 26 years as the CEO, is set to hang up his boots later this year. He founded Kotak Capital Management Finance as an investment and financial services company in 1985. In February 2003, Kotak Mahindra Finance received a banking licence from the RBI.

Uday Kotak's tenure as the CEO and MD of the bank will come to a close on December 31, 2023. According to Bloomberg, in February 2023 the bank roped in Egon Zehnder, a global talent search firm, to find a new chief.",655,-0.9401924908161163

Veteran banker Uday Kotak has headed the country's fourth largest private-sector lender, Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB), since its inception as a non-banking financial company (NBFC) in 1985. After turning into a bank in 2003, the company has grown to become a financial behemoth across segments.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, in the quarter ended December 2022, reported healthy standalone double-digit growth in the bottom line on strong growth in net interest income and improvement in asset quality.

The bank’s standalone profit after tax (PAT) rose 31 percent on-year to Rs 2,792 crore in the December quarter.

The global economic landscape is constantly changing. Businessman Uday Kotak today tweeted a chart showcasing the top 10 companies in the world by value, with a notable absence of any European, Chinese, or Indian companies. He also pointed out that nine out of the 10 companies on the list are American. This begs the question, he said, are predictions of American decline premature?

“Top 10 companies in the world by value. 9 American, 1 Saudi. No European, Chinese or Indian company. Predictions of American decline are premature?” the CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank tweeted.



Top 10 companies in the world by value. 9 American, 1 Saudi. No European, Chinese or Indian company. Predictions of American decline are premature? pic.twitter.com/Wcl8yn59gh — Uday Kotak (@udaykotak) April 17, 2023

The top 10 companies in the world right now by value, as shared by Kotak, are the following: Apple, Microsoft, Saudi Aramco, Alphabet, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, NVIDIA, Tesla, Meta and Johnson & Johnson.

Of the top 10 companies in the world by value, nine are American, and one is Saudi. This domination by American companies suggests that the United States is still a significant player in the global economy. Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) take the top three spots, with Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway close behind. These companies are leaders in the tech, retail, and finance industries, indicating that the United States continues to excel in these sectors.

Apple has a market value of $2.6 trillion followed by Microsoft at $2.1 trillion. Interestingly, Saudi Aramco is the only non-American company in the top 10, with a market value of $2.2 trillion. This state-owned oil and gas company has seen significant growth in recent years, and its inclusion in the top 10 is a testament to the importance of the energy sector in the global economy.

Uday Kotak’s ‘reality check’ as India pips UK to become 5th largest economy

This concept of “American decline” suggests that the United States' economic, political, and social influence is waning in the face of increasing global competition. Some argue that this decline is inevitable given the rise of other global players such as China and India. However, the statistics on the top companies in the world suggest otherwise, Kotak’s list suggested.

It's important to note that the absence of European, Chinese, and Indian companies in the top 10 does not necessarily indicate their decline. Instead, it suggests that American companies are currently dominating the global economy. European companies such as Volkswagen and Nestle, Chinese companies such as Alibaba and Tencent, and Indian companies such as Reliance Industries and Tata Consultancy Services are all significant players in their respective regions.

Furthermore, it's worth considering that the global economy is constantly evolving. The top 10 companies in the world today may not be the same in five or ten years. The rise of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain could lead to new players entering the game.",512,0.08708226680755615

Shares of IndusInd Bank declined 1.34 percent to top the Nifty losers’ chart in morning trade on April 12 after its recent shareholding pattern indicated it will miss out on MSCI Standard index inclusion by a whisker.

The private sector lender released its shareholding pattern for the March 2023 quarter recently, which shows FPI room at around 14.19 percent, IIFL Alternative Research said in a note.

The minimum FPI room required for MSCI Standard index inclusion is 15 percent. Foreign room is essentially the proportion of shares available to foreign investors relative to the maximum allowed.

“What has caught our attention is the NRI holding at 0.6% which doesn’t elaborate its nature as repatriable/non-repatriable (the latter are investments considered as domestic). In the absence of clarity, the index provider might treat it as a foreign investment,” IIFL Alternative Research said.

“Hence, we will rule out an inclusion in the forthcoming May’23 review. However, we will monitor this name for potential inclusion in the near future,” it added.

Exclusion of stocks from MSCI indices can result in substantial outflows as foreign investors and passive funds track these indices for fund allocation. Similarly, companies added to the MSCI indices usually see increased inflows.

Foreign investors' holding in Kotak Mahindra Bank has dropped to 41.22 percent in the March 2023 quarter, lower by 1.47 percentage points from December.

This could result in a wider foreign headroom opening up and the stock gaining weightage in the MSCI index, according to Nuvama Alternative Research. Foreign room is essentially the proportion of shares available to foreign investors relative to the maximum allowed. MSCI requires this to be at least 15 percent.

Kotak Bank's foreign room is 22.38 percent. With the fall in foreign investors' shareholding in the March quarter, the room has increased to 25.05 percent, as per Nuvama Research's Abhilash Pagaria.

As per the MSCI guidelines, if a security's foreign room is less than 25 percent and equal to or higher than 15 percent, then the index provider uses an adjustment factor of 0.5 to reflect the actual level of foreign room. When it is more than 25 percent, then adjustment factor of 1 is used.

As Kotak Bank's adjustment factor goes from 0.5 to 1, its weight will increase in the index. ""This could see weight-up led inflow to the tune of $690 million which is almost 32 million shares buying,"" Pagaria said.

IIFL Securities has estimated $750-million inflow to the lender.

On April 11, Kotak Mahindra Bank shares opened 4 percent higher on the NSE. The stock was quoting at Rs 1,842.55 at 9:20am. As the stock has been a laggard over the past one year, up only 3 percent, analysts expect the MSCI liquidity event to lead to a strong momentum.

In the third quarter, the bank beat Street estimates and delivered a 31 percent growth in net profit at Rs 2,792 crore. Its net interest income surged 30 percent to Rs 5,653 crore in the December quarter on the back of an on-year growth of 23 percent in loans and a spurt in net interest margin to 5.47 percent from 4.62 percent.

While earnings growth remains consistent, a key turnaround point for the bank will be when a new chief executive officer is selected. Uday Kotak has been at the helm of Kotak Mahindra Bank since it was founded in 1985 but he has to step down as CEO by next year in accordance with the RBI guidelines. His term ends on January 1, 2024.

Financial companies in India are better placed than its global peers despite global turmoil, said Jefferies in a report on the Indian financial sector. According to the global research firm, Indian firms are better placed with higher share of retail deposit, limited asset/liability management (ALM) gap and mark to market (MTM), limited dependence on AT-1 bonds and lower exposure to riskier segments like promoter and acquisition finance.

""While equities and global bonds saw pressure off-late, local bond market is stable. Post correction, valuations of some are near or below Covid lows,"" it said.

AT-1 bond market has polarised towards large/ quality banks post Yes Bank

""India had a Credit Suisse like AT-1 bond issue right around Covid when Yes Bank wrote-down AT-1 bonds and still there was some franchise value assigned to equity through capital infusion by leading banks/ NBFC. Since then, the issuances have been lower and market has become polarised towards larger and quality banks. Among banks, top three issuers are State Bank of India, HDFC Bank and Canara Bank with PSU banks having higher contribution from this,"" Jefferies said.

Valuations in some cases below Covid lows:

Valuation of Indian banks is looking fairly attractive and in some cases stocks trade below the levels during the height of Covid risk despite the fact that global events, especially in the financial sector, have stirred confidence and increased cost of equity capital (COE).

According to Jefferies, stocks above USD 5 billion in market capitalisation that are trading below the Covid-low valuations are Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance. ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank and State Bank of India are top bank picks with Bajaj Finance, Cholamandalam Investment among NBFCs. Life insurers are also attractive (and below Covid lows) but clarity on taxation of insurance policies will be key to rerating.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has a ""small exposure"" to the embattled Adani Group which has been made in line with its credit philosophy, a senior official has said.

Paritosh Kashyap, president and head for wholesale banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank, said the issues surrounding Adani Group are more of a ""capital market and valuations issue and not a credit issue.""

""We have a small exposure to the group. We do business with every corporate in the country, and our exposures are in line with our credit philosophy and size of our balance sheet,"" Kashyap told PTI in an interaction.

He said operating companies in the group have ""reasonable leverage"", coupled with strong profitability and balance sheets.

It can be noted that a report by the US short-seller had called Adani as the biggest con in corporate history, making wide-ranging allegations on governance practices among other aspects to say that the stocks are overvalued by 85 per cent.

The publishing of the report in late January led to a rout in Adani group's listed entities, and also made investors nervous about banks initially as they feared a ripple effect to play out on the banks who have exposure to the group.

The RBI has launched a special examination of the banking system's exposures to Adani Group entities, and Governor Shaktikanta Das has said that a single case cannot impact the broader banking system.

According to experts, the Indian banks' exposures are to operative companies and not against shares at the listed holding company level.

This is so because in most of the cases barring asset buys by infrastructure companies, Indian banks are not allowed to lend more than Rs 20 lakh as loans against shares, which has come in as a helpful regulatory mandate.

Since the controversy broke out, banks and financial institutions, especially the ones controlled by the state, have come out with commentaries and details of their exposures to Adani Group in a bid to assuage concerns.

Country's largest lender SBI has said its overall exposure to Adani Group is Rs 27,000 crore and it has not extended any loan against shares to the group.

Life insurance behemoth LIC has said its overall exposure is over Rs 35,000 crore, with a large part of it being in equity investments which have suffered alongside the rout in stocks, and some reports pegging the valuations dipping below the purchase price as well.

Kashyap said the overall wholesale banking book is bereft of any stress for Kotak Mahindra Bank and also expressed concerns about the lack of any stress emerging for over seven years now.

""As a segment, I can't say any one which has a stress,"" he said, adding that the bank is open to doing business with segments like infrastructure, real estate and lending to non-banks, which is otherwise considered as prone to stress.",486,-0.5572602868080139

We have seen the equity market going downhill for seven days in a row, bringing down the benchmark indices to the lowest since October 17 on February 27. Technology, auto, FMCG, metal and pharma stocks were under pressure, whereas good support for the market was found in banking and financial services stocks.

The Nifty50 recouped nearly 100 points from the day's low and smartly defended the budget day's low of 17,353, which coincides with 200-day SMA (simple moving average), before closing the session with 73 points losses at 17,393. The index has formed a hammer pattern on the daily charts, especially after consistent downtrend of last seven sessions, indicating the possibility trend reversal.

The BSE Sensex was down 175 points to 59,288, while the broader markets also caught in bear trap on Monday. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices fell 0.7 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.

Stocks that we have selected for trade spotlight included Kotak Mahindra Bank which closed 1.7 percent higher at 1,726 and formed Bullish Engulfing kind of pattern on the daily charts. The stock stayed above February 23's low, when there was Doji pattern formation. If the said low is getting hold in coming sessions, then we can say there was double bottom formation.

Mphasis fell more than 7 percent to Rs 2,040 and formed large bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with robust volumes. With Monday's fall, the stock dropped below all key moving averages and closed at more than a month low level.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises was also in action, falling 6.4 percent to Rs 183, the lowest closing level since September 8, 2021 and formed bearish candle with long lower shadow on the daily charts, indicating there was support-based buying. Also the stock held low of February 23, when there was Hammer kind of pattern formation with large volumes, but the said trading volumes declined in following sessions (February 24 and 27).

Here's what Viraj Vyas of Ashika Stock Broking recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Kotak Mahindra Bank

The stock has been one of the laggards for Bank Nifty index and has rarely participated in any rise that the index has witnessed since 2021.

At the current juncture, the stock is near the multi-month support of Rs 1,670-1,655 and one can expect a short-term bounce from these levels.

The stock can ideally move up towards Rs 1,800 and then towards Rs 1,860. The stock doesn't exhibit any real strength but from risk-reward perspective, it offers a low-risk entry. One can buy the stock.

Mphasis

The stock has been a relative laggard in the Nifty IT rally that we have witnessed during February 2023. The stock has seen as strong rejection from the 200-day EMA (exponential moving average) and continuing to sustain below the same points towards extended weakness.

The stock is likely to head towards Rs 1,900-level to seek support failing to hold which it can see a sharp decline towards Rs 1,800-level with near term resistance seen at Rs 2,150. One can sell the stock with a target of Rs 1,900 and stop-loss of Rs 2,150.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises

The stock has been in a steady decline since October 2021 but till recently, the stock broke the Rs 220-level which has acted as a strong support in the past.

As per polarity, this level will act as a strong resistance while with absence of any intermediate support, the stock might head towards Rs 160-165 zone to activate any latent demand zone.

The stock has shown continued to range expansion with bearish momentum and hence one should reduce positions.

After turning into a bank in 2003, the company has grown to become a financial behemoth across segments.

With the tenure of MD and CEO Uday Kotak coming to an end, the bank is currently hunting for a new CEO. Kotak is set to hang up its boots by the end of 2023.

In November 2022, KVS Manian, Whole-time Director, Kotak Bank, said that Jay Kotak, Uday Kotak's son, will not be a contender for the position, at least for now. According to Bloomberg, in February 2023 the bank roped in Egon Zehnder, a global search firm, to find a new chief.

Kotak Mahindra Bank has a strong line-up of experienced executives heading different verticals and at least two senior executives who could be potential contenders for the top job. There are market speculations that whole-time directors Shanti Ekambaram and KVS Manian are among the top contenders for the post.

Against this backdrop, Moneycontrol looks at the bank's management depth and its key vertical heads.

Uday Kotak, MD and CEO

The veteran banker is considered one of the giants of the Indian banking sector. Kotak, who is also Asia’s richest banker as per the Bloomberg Billionaires’ Index, 2022, headed Kotak Mahindra Finance through stages like its initial public offering (IPO) in 1992, conversion of the NBFC into a bank in 2003, and more.

Dipak Gupta, Joint MD

Gupta wears a lot of hats: head of IT, cyber security, customer experience, business intelligence, and more. Before this, Gupta worked on the partnership between Kotak Mahindra Finance Ltd (KMFL) and Ford Credit International to form Kotak Mahindra Primus Limited, the vehicle loan subsidiary of the bank.

KVS Manian, Group President and Whole Time Director

Manian is credited to have played a crucial role in Kotak’s journey from an NBFC to a bank by setting up the retail liabilities and branch banking business. As Whole-time Director, he heads investment banking, institutional equities, and some NBFC businesses of the group.

Under Manian’s leadership, Kotak has grown its presence significantly in the above verticals over years.

Shanti Ekambaram, Group President and Whole Time Director

Ekambaram heads Kotak 811 (a digital savings account), public affairs, marketing and communications, environment social & governance (ESG), and corporate social responsibility (CSR) verticals. Previously, Ekambaram set up several of the lender’s business segments and was the head of the corporate and investment banking business.

Jaimin Bhatt, Group President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)

As the CFO, Bhatt looks after finance, tax, strategy, legal, operations, and facilities of the bank, and is also part of Kotak Group Management Council. Bhatt has been associated with the bank for 26 years, and has been the CFO for 20 years.

Paul Parambi, Group President and Chief Risk Officer (CRO)

Parambi heads risk management for the bank, and is responsible for defining the framework and the practices for the same. Other than this, he is the convener of the risk management committee, and is a member of the credit and fraud management committees.

Virat Diwanji, Group President and Head, Consumer Banking

The October-December 2022 quarterly result of the bank showed that customer assets of the consumer banking segment had grown 20 percent year-on-year to Rs 28,940 crore, from Rs 24,053 crore in the corresponding quarter in 2021. Diwanji has been with the bank for 18 years, and has worked on major projects like the integration of ING Vysya Bank’s retail distribution network with KMB’s branch banking network, among others.

Oisharya Das, Group President and CEO, Private Banking

The private banking business of the bank, which caters to ultra-high net worth and high net worth individuals (UHNI and HNI), is managed by Das. Das has also worked in the company’s private banking business, both in India and overseas, and managed client relations at a national and global level.

The bank, which started digital banking in 2017, is a major player in the segment. Digital solutions, a key segment under its private banking vertical, has been responsible for a large chunk of deposits over the years. For instance, in the quarter ended December 2022, 90 percent of the recurring deposits (RD) were booked through digital banking, whereas in the corresponding quarter of 2021, the number was 81 percent..

Ramesh Srinivasan, MD and CEO, Investment Banking

KMB started the investment banking vertical in 1991. Srinivasan, after joining the Kotak Mahindra group in 1995, worked on building the vertical and is a pioneer of the Indian equity capital markets.

In the October-December 2022 quarter, the investment banking arm, Kotak Investment Advisors, recorded capital reserves of Rs 800 crore, up from Rs 744 crore in 2021. In November 2022, it secured a total funding of $3.3 billion for its real estate fund series.

In early February 2023, Kotak Alternate Assets, also part of the investment banking vertical, raised $590 million in Kotak Data Centre Fund, a fund to open 5-6 data centres in India.

Paritosh Kashyap, President and Head, Wholesale Banking

Kashyap serves as the President of the lender’s wholesale banking vertical and Business Head of its debt capital markets business. Corporate banking, a crucial segment under Kashyap, delivered a marginal 2 percent growth, with assets of Rs 69,987 crore in the October-December 2022 quarter, up from Rs 68,529 crore in 2021. However, the small and medium enterprise (SME) grew by 25 percent, from Rs 18,560 crore in 2021 to Rs 23,154 crore in 2022.

Shekhar Bhandari, President, Global Transaction Banking

As head of Global Transaction Banking, Bhandari is responsible for foreign exchange business, international trade finance, new-age firms, and other segments.

The bank’s global banking arm, Kotak International Business, reported capital reserves of Rs 1,722 crore for the October-December 2022 quarter, up from Rs 1,490 crore in 2021.",976,0.9561890959739685

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.’s board has engaged consulting firm Egon Zehnder to lead a global search for a chief executive officer to replace its billionaire founder Uday Kotak, people with knowledge of the matter said.

Group presidents and whole-time directors Shanti Ekambaram and KVS Manian are the internal candidates for the top job, according to the people. The board is expanding the search to ensure it finds suitable external candidates, they said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information.

A representative for Kotak Mahindra Bank declined to comment, while a representative for Egon Zehnder didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Uday Kotak has been leading the bank since its inception as a non-banking financial institution in 1985. It became a commercial lender in 2003.

The billionaire banker will transition from his CEO position by the end of next year, after central bank guidelines capped tenures for Indian business heads. His son Jay Kotak is not a contender for CEO, Manian had said in an interview in November.

Ekambaram joined Kotak Mahindra Bank in 1991 and is now its highest-ranking woman. She oversees several functions including online saving accounts business, treasury, public affairs and human resources, the bank’s website shows. She continues to lead its consumer banking. Manian, who joined in 1995, is part of the group management council, heading wholesale banking and wealth management business. He also has oversight responsibility of investment bank and institutional equities businesses.

Like its peers, Kotak Bank has ambitious growth plans to harness the opportunities from the expansion of the Indian economy, even as it grapples with the changes brought on by technology to conventional banking models.

The bank’s net income jumped by 31% to 27.9 billion rupees ($337 million) in the quarter ended December, backed by strong demand for credit in India. It is also exploring a minority sale in its general insurance business, Bloomberg News has reported. It acquired micro-finance company Sonata Finance Pvt. Ltd. this month.",398,0.9999931454658508

Kotak Mahindra Bank announced the acquisition of 100 percent of the equity shares of Sonata Finance, a non-banking finance company-microfinance institution, on February 10.

Here’s an explainer on the deal:

What was the announcement?

Kotak Mahindra said it will acquire all of Sonata Finance’s equity stake from existing shareholders for an all-cash consideration of about Rs 537 crore. The acquisition is subject to regulatory and other approvals, including from the Reserve Bank of India.

What is Sonata Finance?

Sonata Finance, with its registered office in Lucknow, was acquired by Anup Kumar Singh in January 2006 and converted to an NBFC-microfinance institution on December 3, 2013.

The company advances microfinance loans to the economically weaker sections of society, in particular women. It operates through 502 branches in 10 states and had 2,882 employees as of December 31. It has about 900,000 active loans.

What was Kotak’s rationale for acquiring the company?

Kotak Mahindra said Sonata’s network complements its microfinance branch network. The bank will be able to provide a wider suite of banking products to Sonata’s customer base, matching their emerging banking needs.

Is this the first time Kotak is buying a microlender?

This is not the first time that Kotak is acquiring a microfinance company. The bank acquired BSS Microfinance in an all-cash deal for Rs 139 crore in 2017.

What do analysts think about this deal?

Analysts are bullish about the Kotak-Sonata deal and said it will significantly change the bank’s presence in the rural areas and the microfinance side.

“This is part of the inorganic growth strategy of the bank. It will be an attempt to increase the franchise and get more into rural banking,” said Sanjay Agarwal, senior director at Care Rating.

Some experts said microfinance will not be easy for Kotak Mahindra Bank.

“They might be trying to fulfil certain rural obligations,” said Vikas V Gupta, CEO of OmniScience Capital.

So, why does this deal make sense for Kotak?

Analysts said Kotak has a significant amount of regulatory capital and would put it to use prudently and opportunistically.

“With the acquisition of Sonata, Kotak gets to expand its microfinance business into the complementary geographical areas of north India and even sell other banking products to these new customers,” said Shivaji Thapliyal, head of research at Yes Securities.

Have there been other recent MFI acquisitions by banks?

IndusInd Bank and Bharat Financial Inclusion merged on July 4, 2019 after the National Company Law Tribunal approved the transaction on June 10, 2019.

In August 2022, Yes Bank managing director Prashant Kumar told Moneycontrol it is open to acquiring smaller entities, especially from the microfinance segment.",445,0.9999693632125854

Microfinance is a high-yielding loan segment that has lured many banks looking to increase the yield of their loan assets. In fact, some lenders have made multiple acquisitions in a serious pursuit of this loan market. The latest is Kotak Mahindra Bank to take a convincing step into this segment through the acquisition of Sonata Finance.

Analysts have taken a favourable view towards the private sector lender post this acquisition. Jefferies India Pvt Ltd believes that the lender will be able to increase its presence in North India. “This ties with the bank's aim to lift unsecured loans from 9 percent to the mid-teens,” the brokerage said in a report.

But investors don’t seem to be moved by it. That’s reflected in the lacklustre movement seen in Kotak Mahindra Bank’s shares since the announcement of the acquisition on February 10.

Sonata Finance is a microfinance company with a book size of Rs 1,400 crore and more than 500 branches. Kotak Mahindra Bank’s microfinance book has been growing slowly and steadily to Rs 5,300 crore now. Against its own large-sized loan book of Rs 3.10 lakh crore, the acquisition of Sonata isn’t significant for Kotak Mahindra Bank.

The Rs 537-crore all-cash consideration for the deal, analysts believe, isn’t a big deal for the private sector lender. Jefferies’ calculation shows that the deal values Sonata at 1.7 times its book value as of December.

The question is whether Kotak Mahindra Bank will be able to squeeze more profit as it grows its microfinance business?

The right motivation

The motivation for the purchase of Sonata is clear. Kotak has been a conservative lender so far, keeping away from aggressively lending to high-yielding segments, such as unsecured retail loans. It dipped its toes into microfinance with the acquisition of BSS Microfinance Pvt Ltd in 2016. Since then, the lender has been circumspect about increasing the share of this segment quickly. The pandemic years vindicated Kotak Mahindra Bank’s conservative approach as the microfinance market came under immense strain. When peer banks began reporting a surge in restructuring loans, Kotak was able to keep its own slippages under control.

Analysts point out that the lender would need to seek out high-yielding assets when credit growth is booming lest it loses ground to peers. For FY21 and FY22, the yield on loans for Kotak was 8.4 percent and 7.8 percent respectively. That matched peers ICICI Bank and Axis Bank which reported yields in the 8.0-8.5 percent band. But these lenders are already aggressively targeting high-yield loan segments.

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s enviable low-cost current account and savings account (CASA) deposits have kept low yields from crimping on margins. But this will now change, as deposit rates are on the rise and with most banks clamoring for more deposits, Kotak too will need to continue raising deposit rates to attract them. The only way to maintain margins is to shed conservatism and plunge deeper into unsecured lending. To maintain the current trend of superior margins compared with peers, the bank would need to sweat more now.

As of December, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s net interest margin was 5.47 percent, which was superior to 4.65 percent of ICICI Bank and 4.3 percent of HDFC Bank.

Until now, Kotak Mahindra Bank has stayed away from riskier credit despite the lure of high returns. Microfinance loans are unsecured and far more vulnerable to economic cycles. In 2016, when Kotak bought BSS Microfinance, Chairman Uday Kotak had said that the goal was to learn about this segment and build capacity. Its peers that have made similar acquisitions have valuable lessons to offer. IndusInd Bank’s purchase of Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd (BFIL) shows how managing asset quality is critical. The private lender’s earnings came under pressure as it integrated BFIL into its books. The microfinance portfolio had its own set of problems, including a concerning episode of loans disbursed without borrower consent in March 2022.

IndusInd Bank has managed to bring down the stress progressively, but not without considerable pain.

Where is growth?

Investors simply want the bank to show consistent high growth and improvement in yield. For the past two quarters, the bank’s management has made all the right noises in its desire to tone down conservatism and go for high-yielding lending opportunities. “In the last two-three quarters, they have consistently grown, but that trend must continue. What the street is concerned about is sustainable growth,” said Gaurva Jani, Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher. He added that Kotak Mahindra Bank’s microfinance acquisitions are still small to make a big difference to valuation. “They have a CET (common equity tier) ratio of 21 percent, which is way too high,” he said.

The lender needs to utilise its capital and increase lending. So far, superior asset quality has been one of the driving factors of Kotak Mahindra Bank’s profitability and valuation. That may not be enough at a time when loan growth of every lender is booming. Morgan Stanley analysts believe that the bank’s stock is priced to perfection at the current valuation of 2.7 times FY24 estimated book value.",862,-0.0776418579949273

Kotak Mahindra Bank on February 10 said that it will acquire 100 percent of equity shares of Sonata Finance Private Limited, a non-banking finance company, from existing shareholders for an all-cash consideration of approximately Rs 537 crore.

The private lender said that it will acquire 2.6 crore equity shares of Sonata, of face value Rs 10 each fully paid up.

The acquisition, Kotak Mahindra Bank stated, will be subject to regulatory and other approvals, including from Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

""The transaction provides the bank with the opportunity to scale up its operations in the rural and semi-urban markets in the northern states of India,"" the private lender said in a statement.

Commenting on the acquisition, Manish Kothari, President – Commercial Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank said, ""This acquisition is in sync with our broad vision and strategy. We had successfully acquired BSS Microfinance in 2017 and since then have been able to integrate and steadily grow our presence in the financial inclusion segment with an advances book in excess of Rs 5,300 crore serving ~1.3 million borrowers.

In the coming months, Diwanji said, the bank will keep a sharp eye on keeping customers engaged through technology and digital initiatives.

Highlighting the rising interest rates in deposit schemes, Diwanji said that the lender saw growth in fixed deposits (FDs) but it was muted when it came to savings accounts.

“We have seen large-ticket customers move their funds to attractive investment options like FDs, mutual funds, real estate, etc.,” he said.

In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol, Diwanji also talked about customers’ new demands, consumer banking in 2023, challenges for the lender, and more. Edited excerpts:

How was 2022 for consumer banking?

Post-COVID, lending saw significant demand across most products. The post-COVID era has been rich with data with a significant formalisation of the economy, and that data has helped banks better assess credit to customers, including new to credit customers, and leverage the demand opportunity.

On the deposits side, savings growth has been muted albeit strong growth was registered in term deposits at the industry level. This is intuitive in times of rising rates like today. When there are other attractive investment options like FDs, mutual funds, real estate, etc., large-ticket customers move their funds to these attractive options. That has led to growth in products like FDs and investments, which we have also seen for our bank.

We are able to capture the growth opportunity across sectors and products due to our wide product portfolio.

Did you see any trends in the sector? What are customers expecting?

The digital arena of banking has seen huge demand across products and segments. The need for self-servicing has evolved giving rise to DIY banking; we would also see DWY (do it with you) and DFY (do it for you) banking also proliferating in the coming year.

Other than this, banking as a service (BaaS) approach over the net and mobile and use of deep data analytics, besides adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven credit rule engines coupled with bureau and transaction data leading to expansion of lending base witnessed some demand.

What are the challenges you see in 2023 for consumer banking?

With rising interest rates and enhanced opportunity for investors to earn higher returns, we see liability growth as a critical area.

We've also witnessed a rise in customers using mobile and net banking for most transactions. Hence, physical banking needs to be complemented with digital banking solutions. This invites continuous innovation leading to speed in developing and implementing technology and digitisation-led changes.

Other than this, the ability and agility of meeting continuous changes in customer expectations and providing unique omni-channel experience as a key differentiator would be an area to look for.

A key challenge will be to keep our customers continuously engaged while keeping up with their expectations, and with changing transaction patterns. The need of the hour will be to maintain the right balance between physical and digital banking and work as ‘phygital’ banking.

What are your focus areas and outlook for 2023?

We would focus on two areas: growing stable and low-cost deposits in our lending portfolio without diluting risk-adjusted returns.

In line with these twin objectives, we continue to focus on acquiring customers, particularly the salaried segment. Our endeavour would be to optimise costs and enhance productivity through adoption of technology and digitisation.

After 2022 saw banks recover, 2023 will see banks preparing to embrace higher inflation and higher interest rates amid higher competitive intensity for deposits, customer and employee retention and rising costs (technology, regulatory, infrastructure). The global economic scenario and geopolitical development will also have an impact on the banking sector in FY23. In other words, banks will have to deal with many variables (known and unknown) to balance out their growth plans.

Do you think 2023 will see a stable interest rate environment?

As inflation stabilises, we should see a relatively stable interest rate environment compared to 2022. Though one thing to look out for would be how high the interest rate would to from current levels and for how long.

We would also see a more customer-centric journey and less of (a) product-centric (approach).

The move towards the use of technology, data, analytics, coupled with consumers’ demand for a better experience, more customised offerings—banks that invest in this space will likely gain market share.

Going forward, there would be enhanced focus on fintech partnerships which will help in leveraging technology to reduce time to market and enhance (customer) experience.",764,0.5889644367354256

Kotak Mahindra Bank has become the latest lender to join the list of banks hiking the deposit rates to attract customers. The bank, on February 9, said it has increased the interest rates on fixed deposits by up to 25 bps for the 15 months to two years tenor bucket, effective February 10.

With this, the bank will now offer 7.60 percent interest per annum for senior citizens for deposit amounts of up to Rs 2 crore. An interest rate of 7.25 percent will be offered for deposit amounts between Rs 2 to 5 crore and 7.10 percent for deposit amounts up to Rs 2 crore in the 12 months 25 days to two years tenor bucket.

Virat Diwanji, Group President and Head – Consumer Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank said, ""With the RBI increasing key interest rates, we have passed on the benefit to our valuable customers offering them a higher return on their savings.""

Recently, in its first monetary policy meeting of 2023, the Reserve Bank of India, increased the repo rate by 25 bps to 6.50 percent on February 8, which is the lowest repo rate hike since May 2022.

Banks that have increased FD rates so far

Earlier, Kolkata-based Bandhan Bank increased the interest rates on fixed deposits by up to 50 bps across different maturities effective February 6.

The bank is now offering 8.5 percent interest p.a. for senior citizens and 8 percent for others for deposits with a tenure of 600 days. Similarly, for one-year deposits, the revised rate now stands at 7 percent.

The Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India on February 8 raised the repo rate by 25 bps to 6.5 percent with a 4:2 majority.

India's headline inflation, excluding vegetables, has been rising well above the upper tolerance band and may remain elevated, especially with high core inflation pressures, though the consumer price inflation eased for the third straight month in December.

The rate hike decision was as per the most of expectations by market participants. The January CPI inflation is scheduled to be announced on February 14.

According to the MPC, inflation remains a major risk to the outlook. Hence, the rate-setting panel is of the view that further calibrated monetary policy action is warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored, break core inflation persistence and thereby strengthen medium-term growth prospects.

And, it decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.

""Resilient high-frequency indicators and continued rate hikes by global central banks could have spurred the MPC action even as headline inflation has shown some signs of moderation. Rate hike of 25bps seems justified on the back of high persistent sticky core inflation - above 6 percent - to keep the inflation expectations anchored,"" Dhiraj Relli, MD and CEO at HDFC Securities, said.

The monetary policy acts with lags, it may take three-four quarters for the policy rate to be transmitted to the real economy, and the peak effect may take as long as five-six quarters, Relli feels.

After frontloaded rate hikes since May 2022, he said there could be a strong case now to put a brake on monetary tightening. Further rate hikes beyond 6.5 percent could pose an unwarranted risk to economic growth unless inflationary pressures re-emerge, he feels.

The market has reacted positively to the policy statement, with the BSE Sensex rising 376 points to 60,662, and the Nifty50 jumping 133 points to 17,854, at 1:02pm.

The Reserve Bank of India lowered its CPI inflation forecast for FY23 to 6.5 percent from 6.7 percent and sees 5.3 percent for FY24.

On the growth front, real GDP growth is estimated by the RBI at 6.4 percent for FY24 and the same has been raised to 7 percent for FY23 from 6.8 percent earlier, making India one of fastest growing economies.

""The risk of over-tightening always exists, however, we believe growth over inflation will take the centre stage for the RBI as the world passes through a sluggish growth phase, while the US and Europe continue with measured quantitative tightening,"" of Kunal Valia, Chief Investment Officer - Listed Investments at Waterfield Advisors, said.

The rate hike is going to add to the cost of capital and loans are going to become dearer, he feels.

Expert: Viraj Vyas, Technical & Derivatives Analyst - Institutional Equity at Ashika Stock Broking

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,654 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,565 | Target: Rs 1,800 | Return: 9 percent

After the strong spike in price seen in the second week of November 2022, the stock has since consolidated and is showing signs of accumulation.

A move beyond Rs 1,670-1,680 is likely to spark further bullish momentum towards life highs. On the weekly chart, the stock appears to have formed a high and tight flag which is bullish continuation pattern.

Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,160 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,830 | Target: Rs 6,750 | Return: 10 percent

On the daily timeframe, the stock is trading above its 21-day EMA (exponential moving average). On the weekly chart, stock is consolidating in a triangle pattern since April 2021.

The stock has rebounded fairly well after touching the upward sloping trendline. We expect the stock to behave in a similar manner and move towards a fresh supply zone.

Poonawalla Fincorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 300 | Stop-Loss: Rs 285 | Target: Rs 340 | Return: 13 percent

After the V-shaped recovery seen during December 2022, the stock has broadly consolidated in a channel. Volume spikes were up on days when the stock was positive and strong volume participation was seen in the last session too.

The current pattern is similar to a 'Flag and Pole' which is a bullish continuation pattern.

Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,775 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,719 | Target: Rs 1,850 | Return: 4 percent

After making the top of Rs 1,997.55, the said counter has been continuously falling, resulting in a 16 percent correction. Currently, it has taken support in the zone of Rs 1,700-1,725 (which is also its historical support).

During the last few trading sessions, Kotak Bank has displayed multiple bullish candlesticks patterns (a couple of Doji's followed by a massive Bullish Engulfing structure) hinting at a possible bullish reversal.

From the indicator point of view, daily MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has made a bullish cross along with daily RSI (relative strength index) has violated its 3-month-old trendline thus confirming our bullish stance in Kotak Bank.

One can buy in the range of Rs 1,760-1,780 in small tranches and another around Rs 1,740-1,750 (if again tested), with upside target at around Rs 1,850 and with a stop-loss of Rs 1,719.

Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,160 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,975 | Target: Rs 6,500 | Return: 5.5 percent

After making the top of Rs 7,778, the said counter has been relentlessly falling which resulted in a 27 percent cut in price. Looks like it has stabilized near Rs 5,800, which is a crucial support for coming to a few sessions.

One can buy in the range of Rs 6,130-6,165. The upside target is expected around Rs 6,500, with a stop-loss of Rs 5,975/

Tata Motors: Sell | LTP: Rs 435.45 | Stop-Loss: 455 | Target: Rs 415 | Return: 5 percent

Since last month, the said counter has been making a higher top and higher bottom which resulted in a whopping 22 percent return. One needs to be alert as of now because it has made a Dark Cloud Cover pattern followed by a trio of doji-like (refer to the chart) structures exactly at its historical resistance zone of Rs 455-460 which hints towards some profit in the coming few sessions.

On indicator front, daily MACD is overstretched along with daily RSI and has made an impulsive structure near 70 level which is a matter of concern and could be an early sign of bearishness in Tata Motors.

One should book profit in the range of Rs 435-440. Fresh buy is not advised as of now.

Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital

Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 267.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 249 | Target: Rs 320 | Return: 20 percent

The stock is trading at a 52-week high, which tells that the stock already is in strong momentum.

A recent breakout from a rectangle pattern, along with a gap and increased trading volume, confirms the trend's continuation to the upside.

The opening of Bollinger bands on the daily timeframe suggests rising volatility in support of an upward move.

The RSI on the daily timeframe has also demonstrated a breakout, reflecting sustained momentum in the stock's prices.

Going ahead we expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 320, where the stop-loss must be Rs 249 on the closing basis.

Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 781.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 730 | Target: Rs 865 | Return: 11 percent

After September 2022, Cholamandalam Investment now has got into the formation of Higher Highs, Higher Lows. This shows the positive undertone of the prices.

On the daily time frame, the stock has given a bearish channel pattern breakout, which confirms the reversal.

The stock has given a breakout of the Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern on February 1, 2023 which points towards the beginning of the trend to the upside.

The breakout is confirmed as it is accompanied by huge volumes and a Gap.

The stock is hovering near Upper Bollinger band which illustrate the rising volatility of the prices.

RSI on the weekly timeframe as well as on the daily timeframe is sustaining above 50 levels which shows that the prices have strong momentum in it.

We recommend traders and investors to buy this stock for the target of Rs 865 where the stop-loss must be Rs 730 on the closing basis.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,654.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,550 | Target: Rs 1,780 | Return: 8 percent

The multi-month breakout in the ratio charts of HDFC Bank against its benchmark index Bank Nifty on January 18, 2023 illustrates the outperformance.

Furthermore, the presence of higher volumes during upward price movements and lower volumes during downward price movements suggests that the demand for the stock is stronger than the supply. This can be seen as a positive signal as it may indicate that the stock has strong buying interest and that price increases are likely to be sustained.

The stock is demonstrating favourable technical signals, as multiple key moving averages, including the 50, 100, and 200-day are below prices which confirms the up move.

RSI on the weekly timeframe is sustaining above 60 mark reflecting presence of momentum for potential up move.

We recommend traders and investors to buy this stock for the target of Rs 1,780 where the stop-loss must be Rs 1,550 the closing basis.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Power Finance Corporation: Sell | LTP: Rs 143 | Stop-Loss: Rs 168 | Target: Rs 105 | Return: 27 percent

The stock respected its prior highs (Rs 139 and Rs 154) connecting rising trendline, as it reversed after testing that line (Rs 162) and moved towards its 20-week EMA (Rs 133) quite rapidly. Later, the stock witnessed a pullback after testing its 20-week EMA.

Bearish divergence on its weekly RSI and negative cross-over on MACD signals that the stock may resume its down move, wherein a stable move below its 20-week EMA (Rs 134) will accelerate the negative momentum. This could drag the stock towards Rs 110-105 zone in the medium-term.

In case of any rebound, its prior high connecting rising trendline (Rs 168) will cap the up-move. Fresh short position can be initiated at current juncture and on rise for a desired action.

L&T Finance Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 65 | Target: Rs 155 | Return: 73 percent

Since late-November 2022, the stock majorly ended last week above its long-term moving average (200-week SMA). We believe the stock is poised for a symmetrical triangle breakout, which could take it towards the breakout point of Rs 155 in the medium-term.

So far, the stock moved upwards taking support of its intermediate rising trendline. Its weekly RSI is positively poised above 50-mark since later-October 2022.

In case of major decline, the stock may find support around its lower band of symmetrical triangle pattern, which is currently placed at around Rs 65. Fresh long position can be initiated at current juncture and further after a breakout for an expected line of movement.

Days after financial contagion spread in India after Adani Group's crisis worsened, Uday Kotak has said that he does not see a systemic risk to the Indian financial system.

The chairman of the Kotak Mahindra Bank alluded to the Adani Group turmoil in a tweet on February 5 noting that he does not see systemic risk to Indian financial system from recent events. However, large Indian corporates rely more on global sources for debt and equity finance, he added.

The Adani Group crisis was triggered by a Hindenburg Research report released last week in which the American short-selling firm accused the Adani Group of stock manipulation and unsustainable debt. The company has refuted the allegations.

The market value of Adani Group companies plunge by almost half since the report was released. The plunge sparked concerns about spillover into the broader financial system. Adani's seven listed firms have lost about half their market value, totalling more than $100 billion since the Hindenburg report.

Amid the rout in Adani Group stocks, market regulator SEBI on February 4 jumped to ward off further damage to the market and said it has observed unusual price movement in the shares of a conglomerate, referring to the embattled Adani group.

SEBI said in all specific entity-related matters, if any information comes to its notice, it will be examined and after due examination, appropriate action will be taken.

A day earlier, the RBI had said the banking sector remains resilient and stable, ending speculation of the potential risk to lenders from their exposure to the crisis-ridden group.

Meanwhile, the ministry of corporate affairs has started a preliminary review of Adani Group's financial statements and other regulatory submissions made over the years, two senior government officials told Reuters on February 3.

The new ministry inspection process was initiated on Thursday (February 2), one of the government sources said, saying it was under ""Section 206"" of India's Companies Act under which the government reviews financial documents submitted over the years, such as balance sheets, books of accounts or ledgers.",422,-0.7113782933780125

No big bad news is good news. That sums up the Budget! Finance Minister maintained a fair balance on fiscal prudence, sustainability, inclusivity and ease of doing business, as she made Amrit Kaal's first Budget to set the blueprint for India@100. The Budget strengthens the vision centred on the principles of inclusion, innovation and sustainability. The seven priorities outlined by the Finance Minister, namely, Inclusive Development, Reaching the Last Mile, Infrastructure Investment, Unleashing Potential, Green Growth, Youth Power, and the Financial Sector, emphasise holistic economic development.

Fiscal Consolidation

The government has reiterated its firm resolve to reach a fiscal deficit below 4.5 percent by 2025-26, which is comforting. The glide path is evident with the fiscal deficit for FY24 budgeted at 5.9 percent compared to the revised estimate of 6.4 per cent for the current year.

The budgeted net market borrowings of the government are below Rs 12 lakh crore, broadly in line with market expectations. The Indian bond market may benefit from tailwinds from (1) fairly balanced bond demand-supply dynamics, (2) moderating global yields and (3) lower crude oil prices, which will provide a softening bias to interest rates.

Big Infrastructure Push

Effective capital spending budgeted at Rs 13.7 lakh crore (Rs 10.7 lakh crore in FY23 Budget) highlights the government's continuous focus on infrastructure development (with special emphasis on road, railways and defence) for achieving sustainably high medium-term growth. It is worthwhile to note that rural sector welfare schemes introduced in the wake of Covid have been pruned by 16 percent YoY, thereby creating room for additional capex.

Further incentivising the state government for capital spending, an allocation for 50-year interest-free loans for infrastructure development has been increased from Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 1.3 lakh crore. The priority in the implementation of 100 critical transport infrastructure projects for last and first-mile connectivity is a welcome move. This push to the infrastructure sector will accelerate economic growth due to its multiplier effect across the entire ecosystem.

While the government continues to do the heavy lifting on the capital expenditure, the hope is that it will crowd in private investments over the next few quarters – a necessary condition for medium-term high growth.

While in the near term, there are global headwinds, the government’s persistent reforms-based approach has laid a strong foundation for a medium-term high growth path.

Revamp of the New Taxation Regime

The Finance Minister, in her speech, has said that a simplified tax structure with fewer tax rates helps reduce compliance burden and improve tax administration. In this direction, the tax benefits have been tweaked to encourage individuals to move towards a less complex new tax regime and to provide relief to the middle class. The maximum marginal tax rate has also been reduced from 42.7 percent to 39 percent to provide relief to those at the highest income level. These changes could have a multiplier effect on consumption growth in an economy experiencing slow consumption growth.

The Budget has imposed a tax on insurance policies with premiums above Rs 5 lakh and effectively removed arbitrage of capital gains from market-linked debentures. While it will increase the tax burden on high networth individuals, the move is in the direction of simplifying and rationalising tax structures.

The markets were relieved that some adverse provisions on capital gains taxation were not brought in. I wish there were some announcements on additional tax benefits on the interest earned from bank fixed deposits to spur the deposit growth in the banking sector to fund the anticipated credit growth in the economy.

Inclusive Development and Going, Green

The Budget has outlined several initiatives focused on green growth i.e. energy transition and net zero objectives reiterating the government’s commitment to the climate agenda.

The formalisation of the Indian economy has accelerated over the last few years. However, the informal sector continues to lag. The government has recognised the challenges of the MSME sector and has extended additional collateral-free guaranteed credit of Rs 2 lakh crore, reducing their borrowing costs. This will help cushion the sector, whose outlook is clouded with some uncertainty.

Through skilling programmes for youth and teacher training initiatives, nursing colleges, focus on tourism, etc, the government is demonstrating its commitment to facilitating opportunities for youth and job creation.

Thus, the Budget 2023 offers a blueprint outlining strategies to help India achieve its ambitious goals of an empowered and inclusive economy.

Geojit's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (“KMB”) is one of the leading banks in India, with over 1,700 branches and 2,800 ATMs. The bank’s net interest income (NII) grew 8.9% QoQ (+26.3% YoY) to Rs. 7,207cr in Q3FY23, owing to sharp rise in interest on advances and income from investments. Net interest margin (NIM) also improved, widening 30bps QoQ (+85 bps YoY) to 5.47%, with the management projecting NIM to rise slightly further before moderating. Reported consolidated profit after tax rose 10.7% QoQ (+17.4% YoY) to Rs. 3,995cr. Strong loan growth, improved NIM, well-established infrastructure, expansion into new segments, and reduction in non-performing assets (NPAs) should continue to support the bank’s performance over the long term.



Outlook

Hence, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock, with a revised target price of Rs. 2,010 based on 2.8x FY25E book value per share (BVPS).

Motilal Oswal's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB reported strong earnings in 3QFY23. Standalone PAT rose 31% YoY to INR27.9b (5% beat), driven by healthy NII and controlled provisions as PPoP grew 43% YoY. Consolidated PAT grew 17% YoY to INR40.0b. Loan growth remained strong, with margin further expanding by 30bp QoQ to 5.47%. The CASA ratio, though, moderated 290bp QoQ to 53.3%. Gross slippages moderated to INR7.5b, of which INR1.7b were upgraded in 3QFY23. Healthy recoveries and upgrades led to an 18bp/12bp QoQ decline in the GNPA/NNPA ratios. KMB reversed INR376m of Covid-related provisions; outstanding Covid-related provisions now stand at INR4.0b (13bp of loans). We maintain our Neutral rating.

Outlook

We slightly increase our earnings estimates and expect KMB to deliver a 17% earnings CAGR over FY22-25. Maintain Neutral rating with a TP of INR2,000 (3.0x Sep’24E ABV and INR555 for its subsidiaries).

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) posted a 12% beat on PAT at Rs27.9bn, mainly owing to better margins and continuation of the contingent-provision drawdown, albeit partly offset by higher opex/staff expenses. Bank has indicated that it would continue investing in franchisee/technology/people and, thus, cost ratios would remain elevated. Credit-growth momentum was strong at 23% YoY/6% QoQ, but deposit growth is lagging, including CASA growth (ratio down 700bps YTD to 53%). Though NIM improved 30bps QoQ to a high of 5.5% on asset re-pricing in 3Q, it should decelerate hereon, as deposit growth as well as funding cost catches up, leading to some pressure on PPoP growth. Asset quality further improved, with 18bps contraction in GNPA ratio to 1.9%. Bank does not see any incremental asset-quality risk and continues to consume the contingentprovision buffer, unlike large peers who have retained/are re-building buffers. We raise our FY23 earnings estimates by 2%, but lower for FY24E/FY25E earnings by 3%/6% due to margin deceleration from the peak and higher opex.



Outlook

We expect RoA to normalize to 2% in FY25E from a high of 2.2% in FY23E, and RoE to settle at around 13%. Also, we believe that the impending MD change in Jan-24 will emerge as a key overhang on the stock in the near-to-medium term, as we move closer to the event. Thus, we trim our P/ABV for the standalone bank to 3x from 3.5x earlier, and revise our TP downwards to Rs2,000 (including subs value at Rs550 post 20% discount). We also lower our rating on the stock to HOLD from BUY.

The bank’s premium valuations are driven by its superior growth prospects, industry best NIM and credit costs.

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company after its December quarter earnings:

Prabhudas Lilladhar

Changed rating to 'buy' from 'accumulate' and kept the target price unchanged at Rs 2,100.

The bank saw a strong quarter as core earnings at Rs 26 billion, beating broking house estimates by 6 percent driven by higher NIM at 5.43 percent (PLe 5.2 percent) which was a function of lower cost of funds that came in at 3.83 percent (PLe 4.1 percent).

Credit growth was a tad higher at 5.7 percent QoQ driven by corporate (+6.8 percent) and retail (+6.0 percent).

With continued traction in PL/CC and MFI, bank expects unsecured share to increase from 9.3 percent to early-mid teens in FY24 which would also protect margins.

CLSA

Broking firm has maintained ‘Outperform’ rating on the stocks with a target at Rs 2,080 per share as the Q3 was robust with a big NII beat and growth remains strong.

The management confident in delivering an increasing share of unsecured book at a fast clip, while clarity on CEO transition & improving retail liability accretion will be key, reported CNBC-TV18.

Bernstein

Research house has kept ‘market perform’ rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,100 per share.

The strong margin expansion driven by healthy credit growth & continued loan mix shift and healthy Q3 EPS growth driven by a healthy credit growth and significant margin expansion.

The surge in retail segments and micro-finance helped credit growth and margin expansion and NII growth and normalisation of treasury gains translated rise in total income, reported CNBC-TV18.

Morgan Stanley

Brokerage firm has maintained ‘equal weight’ rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,215 per share. The asset quality, loan growth and margin continue to surprise, albeit were partially offset by higher than expected operating costs.

The deposit growth accelerating and expect positive jaws in FY24 and continue to expect strong earnings, reported CNBC-TV18.

JP Morgan

Research house has kept ‘neutral’ rating with a target at Rs 2,070 per share.

The standalone net income came above estimates on better NIM and lower provisions, while revenue growth was driven by NIMs and loan growth.

The bank has reinvested gains to increase opex and asset quality continues to be solid with negative net slippages. The credit costs aided by a small drawdown in reserves, reported CNBC-TV18.

Jefferies

Brokerage house has maintained the ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,470 per share as the Q3 profit ahead of estimates with stronger than expected NIM expansion and lower credit cost.

The strong loan growth aided by buoyancy in credit and ramp-up in unsecured loans. The CASA has lagged as bank lost share in bulkier savings deposits.

The asset quality stays robust, sub performance was relatively weak.

Broking house raises estimates by 3-7 percent and clarity on succession will be key to re-rating, reported CNBC-TV18.

The net interest margins (NIM) of Kotak Mahindra Bank shot past a decade high during the October-December quarter of FY23.

Net interest margin reveals the amount of money that a bank is earning in interest on loans compared to the amount it is paying in interest on deposits.

""As long as we see interest rates picking up, you will see NIMs increasing. There is some room to go up,"" said Jaimin Bhatt, president and group chief financial officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank during a press conference held after the results announcement.

The bank in the December quarter reported a net interest margin of 5.47 percent, which was the highest since the fourth quarter of financial year 2010-11.

As on March 31, 2011, the net interest margin was 5.6 percent, as per data compiled from investors' presentations.

The bank attributed the NIM expansion to its loan book pricing mix. About 69 percent of the loan book is priced on floating rate basis, within which more than half is linked to the external benchmark, which is the repo rate. Therefore, the transmission of rate hikes is swift and gives the bank enough room to offset the rise in its cost of funds with commensurate lending rate hikes.

In the past few months, most banks including Kotak Mahindra bank have hiked lending rates in line with aggressive rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Despite the race for collecting higher deposits to match the rising credit growth, returns on deposits have not increased very sharply compared to lending rates.

As per Kotak Mahindra Bank’s website, the marginal cost of lending rates are 8.15-9.15 percent across tenures.

On the other hand, it is giving returns in the range of 3.25-7.00 percent across deposit instruments and tenures.

The rise in rates on deposits and loans was witnessed after the RBI started increasing repo rate aggressively to fight higher inflation. Since May, the central bank hiked repo rate by 225 basis points (Bps).

Meanwhile, on January 21, the Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a 31 percent growth in net profit at Rs 2,792 crore for the October-December quarter over the year-ago period.

Kotak Mahindra Bank on January 21 reported healthy standalone third-quarter earnings with double-digit growth in the bottom line on strong growth in net interest income and improvement in asset quality.

Here are the top five takeaways from the lender's Q3FY23 earnings:

Strong net profit

The bank’s standalone profit after tax (PAT) rose 31 percent on-year to Rs 2,792 crore in the December quarter.

The profit growth was higher than estimates. Analysts were estimating a 22 percent rise in its net profit for the October-December quarter.

An average of the estimate of seven brokerages polled by Moneycontrol showed that the lender’s net profit is expected to be Rs 2,593.4 crore for the December quarter, compared with Rs 2,130 crore a year ago.

Net interest income

Net interest income (NII), or the difference between interest earned and interest expended, rose 30 percent on-year to 5,653 crore during the October-December quarter.

In the same period last year, the lender had reported a net interest income of Rs 4,334 crore, according to the media release issued by the bank.

While the net interest margins of the bank stood at 5.47 percent in the December quarter, as against 4.62 percent in the corresponding quarter last year.

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd beat Street estimates with a 31 percent growth in net profit at Rs 2,792 crore for the October-December quarter over the year-ago period.

A Moneycontrol poll of seven brokerages had pegged the bottomline for the private sector lender at Rs 2,593.4 crore and net interest income at Rs 5,377.7 crore, with a year-on-year growth of 24 percent.

The bank's net interest income surged 30 percent to Rs 5,653 crore in the December quarter against Rs 4,334 crore in the same quarter of the previous year. The spike in NII comes on the back of a year-on-year growth of 23 percent in loans and a jump in net interest margin to 5.47 percent from 4.62 percent.

The bank attributed the NIM expansion to its loan book pricing mix. About 69 percent of the loan book is priced on floating rate basis, within which more than half is linked to the external benchmark, which is the repo rate. Therefore, the transmission of rate hikes is swift and gives the bank enough room to offset the rise in its cost of funds with commensurate lending rate hikes.

""As long as we see interest rates picking up, you will see NIMs increasing. There is some room to go up,"" said Jaimin Bhatt, president and group chief financial officer of the bank at a pos-results press interaction.

There was a sharp dip in the share of the bank's low cost current and savings account (CASA) to 53.3 percent from 59.9 percent in the year-ago quarter.

""What we are seeing that as interest rates have moved up over the last year, the higher HNIs have tended to move out of SA (savings) towards term deposits,"" said Dipak Gupta, joint managing director of the bank. The bank's overall deposit growth was 12.8 percent.

Loan growth strength

Kotak Mahindra Bank's loan book stood at Rs 3.10 lakh crore as of December, up from Rs 2.52 lakh crore in the same period of the previous year. Retail microfinance loans grew the fastest at 121 percent, followed by credit card outstanding which grew 85 percent on-year.

Unsecured personal loans and business loans surged 69 percent. All these segments gained partly on a low base. Unsecured retail advances, including microfinance, now constitute 9.3 percent of the bank's loan book. ""We are comfortable to take this to mid-teens level,"" said Bhatt.

The management is optimistic about the coming quarters in terms of loan demand. The bank is seeing strong demand for credit from small businesses, mid-sized companies, and retail. That said, Kotak Mahindra Bank continues to remain more conservative than its peers. ""Because everything is looking good, our concerns perhaps is to not go overboard,"" said Gupta.

The bank's gross bad loan pile fell 14 percent on-year to Rs 5,994.6 crore. As a percentage of the loan book, gross bad loans stood at 1.9 percent, down from 2.7 percent in the year-ago quarter.

Fresh slippages were down to Rs 748 crore from Rs 983 crore in the previous quarter. This reduced the bank's provisioning needs, thereby boosting the bottomline.",528,0.7017955482006073

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd is expected to report a 22 percent rise in its net profit for the October-December quarter, on the back of strong net interest income, stable margins, and low provisioning.

The lender’s net profit is expected to be Rs 2,593.4 crore for the December quarter, compared with Rs 2,130 crore a year ago, an average of the estimate of seven brokerages polled by Moneycontrol shows. Net interest income is expected to be Rs 5,377.7 crore with a year-on-year growth of 24 percent.

The boost to net interest income will come from a faster-than-industry loan growth and improvement in net interest margin (NIM), according to analysts. “We expect the bank to surprise on the positive on loan growth at 20-22 percent YoY,” wrote those at Elara Capital Ltd in a note. “We expect another strong quarter of NIM benefits, given front-ended benefit of transmission. Also, a better CD (credit-deposit) ratio and loan mix tilt towards higher-yielding products may aid in some NIM improvement, driving 25 percent YoY NII growth.”

Kotak Mahindra Bank has been conservative when it comes to loan growth in the past. During the past two years, it has lagged larger peers in loan offtake which was by choice. However, the bank has turned slightly aggressive in the past two quarters, and this has reflected in its loan book expansion. The lender has also become more open to unsecured lending that carry a higher risk. To that extent, analysts believe that the management’s commentary on potential stress in the unsecured lending segment and loans to small businesses will be critical.

That said, the lender’s asset quality is expected to remain strong and bad loan ratios low. Even loans given to small businesses under the government emergency credit line guarantee scheme (ECLGS) may show low stress, analysts said.

“ECLGS portfolio behaviour is likely to hold up well. Credit cost likely to normalise to 40- 60bps from a low base of less than 20 bps in Q2,” wrote analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd.

The bank has continued to beef up its digital ecosystem and unsecured lending, which is expected to keep operating expenses elevated. Even so, operating profit is expected to grow by a robust 36 percent for the December quarter.",394,0.9713572561740875

Top private equity fund General Atlantic-promoted KFin Technologies is likely to launch its initial public offer (IPO) on December 19, 2022 as the leading tech-driven financial services platform for asset managers looks to raise around Rs 1,500 crore, multiple industry sources with knowledge of the matter told Moneycontrol.

“The plan is for the anchor book to open on December 16 with the issue launch likely between December 19 and December 21 for public investors,"" said one of the persons cited above.

A second person told Moneycontrol that the firm is targeting a valuation of around Rs 6,300 crore for the proposed IPO. The issue will solely be an OFS ( offer for sale) with promoter General Atlantic as the selling shareholder, this person added.

Two others persons confirmed the above launch details. “KFin is a fast-growing firm with an international presence and diversified revenue streams,” one of them elaborated.

All the four persons cited above spoke to Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity.

In response to a detailed email query from Moneycontrol, KFin Technologies said, “We would like to bring to your attention that the details of the valuation of the Company and various qualitative statements about the Company’s businesses disclosed in the Moneycontrol News Reports (contents of which are attached), are not based on information provided in the Draft Red Herring Prospectus dated March 31, 2021 (“DRHP”), or the red herring prospectus dated December 10, 2022 (“RHP”), and are, in our view, speculative in nature.""

ICICI Securities, Kotak Mahindra Capital, Jefferies, IIFL Securities and JP Morgan are the investment banks working on the IPO. AZB & Partners and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas are the legal advisors, according to the DRHP.

Other than majority shareholder General Atlantic, Kotak Mahindra Bank is also an investor in KFin Technologies. The private sector lender acquired nearly 10 percent stake in the firm last year by investing Rs 310 crore as primary infusion in the company. Private equity firm Warburg Pincus backed CAMS ( Computer Age Management Services) is a peer of KFin and made its market debut on October 1, 2020.

THE KFIN TECH FOOTPRINT

According to its website, KFin Technologies serves the needs of asset managers with clients spanning mutual funds, AIFs (alternative investments), pension, wealth managers and corporates in India and abroad. The company provides SaaS-based end-to-end transaction management, channel management, compliance solutions, data analytics and various other digital services to asset managers across segments, as well as outsourcing services for global players. In addition, the firm also provides several investor solutions including transaction origination and processing for mutual funds and private retirement schemes in Malaysia, the Philippines and Hong Kong.

At end of January 2022, the total AUM of mutual funds serviced by CAMS and KFin Tech stood at 69 percent and 31 percent respectively. However, in terms of the number of AMCs serviced, KFin Tech is the largest investor solutions provider to the mutual fund industry, providing services to 25 out of the 42 AMCs operating at end of January 2022, thereby accounting for 60 percent of the market in terms of clientele.

For the nine months ended December, KFin Tech posted revenues from operations at Rs 458 crore and a net profit of Rs 97.6 crore, representing a year-on-year growth of 35 percent and 313 percent, respectively.",549,0.9998534023761749

A day after the RBI raised the benchmark lending rate by 35 basis points, Kotak Mahindra Bank Managing Director Uday Kotak on Thursday said the central bank may go for one more rate hike to bring inflation below its upper tolerance level of 6 per cent.

Yesterday, the RBI indicated that it wants inflation to be within the band first and then move towards the target of 4 per cent, Kotak said at the CII Global Economic Policy Summit 2022.

""My sense is that there could be one more rate hike and that may be the time for thinking about a pivot, but we got to watch very closely the data, and maybe around 6.5 per cent as it looks today, subject to what happens to the world, subject to what happens to oil, subject to what happens to many other things,"" he said.

Kotak further said the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates this month will be a signal for other central banks.

""I think that is going to be a very crucial signal about what is the interest rate trajectory in the largest market and the largest pool of money in the world, which is the US,"" he said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Wednesday hiked the key repo rate by 35 basis points to 6.25 per cent, the fifth straight increase since May.

In all, the RBI has raised the benchmark rate by 2.25 per cent since May this year.

On the potential of the Indian economy, Kotak said the country has become the fifth largest in the world at about USD 3.2 trillion and has huge potential.

There are opportunities to move up the ladder, to be among the top three in the world, and its realisation would depend on certain metrics, including economic performance in terms of absolute GDP and absolute per capita income instead of the PPP comparison, he said.

To develop world class Indian companies, he stressed on the need to build scale in manufacturing based on cutting edge product innovation and developing IP rights rather than depending on arbitrage alone to secure an advantage.

Speaking at the event, Bajaj Finserv Managing Director Sanjiv Bajaj said credit needs to be given to the government for continuous and consistent investment from their side in public infrastructure.

While the aspect of developing new manufacturing capacities holds promise, its realisation would depend on execution of policies, Bajaj noted.

He further said four broad areas -- aligning industry and trade policies; building a strong financial sector to support the real economy; augmenting education and healthcare expenditure to build people capacity; and expanding the share of manufacturing by extending the PLI scheme in labour intensive areas -- would accelerate India's journey towards a USD 40 trillion economy.",475,0.904550701379776

The Nifty50 reversed some gains on last Friday after rallying in previous eight straight sessions. But the index recorded one percent gain for yet another week ended December 2, forming bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly frame and making higher highs formation for seventh week in a row, tracking favourable global cues.

In fact the index has ended at record closing high on a weekly basis, though it retraced from record highs on daily charts. The momentum is intact and Friday's correction is on expected lines given the consistent uptrend in the past. Hence, once the current consolidation ends, the Nifty50 is expected to resume upward journey once again towards 18,900-19,000 levels in coming days, with crucial supports at 18,500-18,300, experts said.

The momentum indicators RSI (relative strength index) also traded above 60 mark with upward bias on the weekly basis, and the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) on the weekly as well as monthly frames shows positive trend.

""The chart structure construes a positive development, with the indices being in a cycle of higher highs – higher lows. 18,500 is expected to act as the sacrosanct support for the index. While on the higher end, the swing high of 18,900 odd zone is expected to provide some intermediate resistance, followed by the psychological mark of 19,000 in the near term,"" Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One said.

He remains sanguine with the up trend and would advocate the traders to utilize the dips to add long position in the index.

Also, he expects strong moves outside the indices as the midcap space has witnessed a multi-month breakout and could unfold a new leg of rally in the comparable period.

Simultaneously, one should stay abreast of global and domestic developments on a regular basis and continue with a similar buy on decline strategy till the time important supports are held comfortably, the market expert advised.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the December 2 closing prices:

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

HEG: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,060 | Stop-Loss: Rs 995 | Target: Rs 1,155 | Return: 9 percent

The weekly timeframe chart of HEG indicates an upside bounce after a consolidation movement of last week. We observe a formation of higher bottom at Rs 956 in mid of November 2022, currently the stock price is moving up steadily thereby confirming bottom reversal pattern.

The overall weekly chart pattern indicates a completion of larger downtrend in the stock price and a resumption of renewed buying interest from the higher lows.

The stock price is now placed at the cluster hurdle of weekly 10 and 20 EMA (exponential moving average) and down sloping trend line around Rs 1,080-1,100 levels. Hence, a sustainable move above this area is expected to have a sharp positive impact ahead.

Buying can be initiated in HEG at CMP (Rs 1,060), add more on dips down to Rs 1,025, and wait for the upside target of Rs 1,155 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss of Rs 995.

MTAR Technologies: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,738 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,625 | Target: Rs 1,910 | Return: 10 percent

The weekly timeframe chart of the stock price, MTAR Technologies indicates a sustainable upside bounce in last week. The stock price was moving in a narrow range over the last few months and is currently showed upside breakout of the range at Rs 1,700 levels.

Hence, further sustainable move from here could be considered as a significant upside breakout and the stock price could move up sharply. After the formation of crucial bottom in June 2022, the stock price seems to have formed a higher bottom recently and started to move up. Volume has started to rise during upside breakout and weekly RSI shows positive indication.

One may look to buy MTAR Technologies at CMP (Rs 1,738), add more on dips down to Rs 1,670 and wait for the upside target of Rs 1,910 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,625.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Muthoot Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,136 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,050 | Target: Rs 1,300 | Return: 14 percent

The stock has formed a double bottom formation on the daily chart. On Friday, the stock absorbed the selling pressure from the falling trend line at Rs 1,125.

It will face the next set of resistance at Rs 1,215 to validate the formation of a double bottom. It is a buy at current levels and more on a drop at Rs 1,080. One can keep a stop-loss at Rs 1,050, and hurdles will be at Rs 1,215 and Rs 1,300.

Bharat Dynamics: Buy | LTP: Rs 966 | Stop-Loss: Rs 890 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Return: 14 percent

It is forming multiple continuation formations between the narrow range of Rs 900 and Rs 1,025. These types of formations eventually enter a trending wave. The Rs 940 and Rs 900 levels would be major support, however, Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,025 would be immediate resistance levels.

Based on the weekly formation, we are expecting a further upside in the stock. Buy at current levels with stop-loss at Rs 890. On higher levels, it has the potential to rally towards Rs 1,100 with a major hurdle at Rs 1,025.

Bharat Forge: Buy | LTP: Rs 855 | Stop-Loss: Rs 815 | Target: Rs 897 | Return: 5 percent

On Friday, the stock made a higher low at Rs 839 as compared to the previous low which was at Rs 816. After hitting an all-time high of Rs 897 in the previous month, it got into profit-taking mode.

However, after hitting the support of Rs 816, the stock has formed a solid base which will take the stock towards Rs 1,000 in the long run. In the medium term, the stock has the potential to move higher towards Rs 897 again. Buy at current levels and place stop-loss at Rs 815.

Expert: Vikas Jain, Senior Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,931 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,790 | Target: Rs 2,180 | Return: 13 percent

Its weekly RSI has turned upwards from the lower part of the range and other key technical indicators on near-term timeframe chart are positively poised.

The stock has a strong support near its multi band of moving averages on the weekly time scale and the strong positive momentum in the sector reinforces our positive stance.

Therefore, we recommend directional long position for a target of Rs 2,180 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,790.

LIC Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 394 | Stop-Loss: Rs 368 | Target: Rs 470 | Return: 19 percent

The stock oscillated at around its 200-day SMA (simple moving average) and rose to 4-week closing high subsequently.

Trendline breakout in its daily RSI and bullish cross-over in its daily MACD signals that the stock is on the verge of a turnaround.

A stable move above its key band of weekly moving averages will support a strong up-move and could take the stock towards Rs 445 initially and Rs 470 subsequently.

Therefore, we recommend directional long position for a target of Rs 470 with a stop-loss of Rs 368.

Voltas: Buy | LTP: Rs 855 | Stop-Loss: Rs 810 | Target: Rs 950 | Return: 11 percent

On the lower side, the stock found support at around its 55-month EMA (exponential moving average) and crossed its 200-week average.

The stock bounced from its 52-week low of Rs 804 and gained 3 percent week-on-week basis.

Its weekly RSI reversed from its bottom level and poised for a turnaround and indicates a strong reversal in the stock from current juncture.

Therefore, we recommend directional long position for a target of Rs 950 with a stop-loss of Rs 810.

A month after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) launched the pilot for a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), it has kick-started the pilot for the retail version which goes live today. The retail digital rupee, or e₹-R, can be used by people for day-to-day transactions.

With both wholesale and retail pilots live in the country, the RBI has joined 17 other central banks including those of China and South Korea whose pilots are underway. Over 60 central banks have expressed interest in launching their own digital currency and a total of 105 countries are at various stages of exploring the technology. With these pilots, India joins a global movement which is being seen as the next step of the evolution of currency.

The RBI on November 29 while announcing the pilot said that the implementation will be done in phases in partnership with a few banks and in some cities to start with and the scope will later be scaled up.

The pilot will be implemented among a small group of customers and merchants, starting with the four cities of Mumbai, New Delhi, Bengaluru and Bhubaneswar. It will in the next phase be extended to Ahmedabad, Gangtok, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Indore, Kochi, Lucknow, Patna and Shimla.

While the e₹-R is built for customers like us, what does it exactly do and why is it different from current digital transactions through wallets and the Unified Payments Interface (UPI)? Here are five things to know about the e₹-R.

The RBI defines CBDC as legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form. It is similar to sovereign paper currency, but in a digital form and is exchangeable at par with the existing currency. Meaning, Rs 100 in CBDC form is the same as Rs 100 in the form of notes.

The key difference here is that a CBDC is issued directly by the RBI, not by banks, and will appear as liability on its balance sheet.

The foundational principles and core features for a CBDC have been laid down by the Bank for International Settlements and serve as guiding principles for central banks globally.

Use cases

The RBI said that in the current phase of the pilot, e₹-R can be used for person-to-person (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M) payments.

Mihir Gandhi, partner and leader for payments transformation at PwC India, said, “Key use cases may be programmable payments, cross-border payments with immediate benefits of lower cost of printing and managing currency, instant payments and finality of settlement and enhanced safety.”

The RBI also said that the e₹-R will offer features similar to that of physical cash like trust, safety and settlement finality. “As in the case of cash, it will not earn any interest and can be converted to other forms of money, like deposits with banks,” RBI added.

How will transactions work?

The RBI has identified four banks to be part of the initial phase of the pilot which will help the central bank to distribute the e₹-R. Similar to current digital transactions, the RBI said that transactions can be executed through wallets offered by participating banks.

Users can make payments to other users who are a part of the pilot, and e₹-R will also be interoperable with existing bank accounts. This means that users can transfer funds between their CBDC accounts and bank accounts eventually. For merchant transactions, customers will be able to scan QR codes to make payments.

How is this different from UPI?

The key difference is that customers accessing CBDC will have to open a separate CBDC account which will be connected to the RBI’s server. The transactions will not take place on the bank’s server like UPI, wallet, National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) or Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) transactions. Instead, the transactions will be executed and recorded on the RBI’s blockchain.

Monish Shah, partner at Deloitte, explained, “e₹-R is digital currency representing cash issued by the central bank and is non-interest-bearing. It's different from UPI which is an actual debit and credit from one bank account to another.”

“Once implemented, it will also give more benefits where users can create programmable money, meaning you can earmark money for specific end uses. This may be helpful in the case of direct benefit transfers and other disbursals to ensure that the money is being used for the reason it has been given. It will help reduce the overall physical cash in the economy and make the system more efficient,” he added.

Banks in the picture

The first four banks that will be a part of the pilot are State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank and IDFC First. Four more banks—Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank—will join this pilot subsequently, the RBI said. As of now, the RBI has not involved fintechs like PhonePe, Google Pay and Paytm, which are UPI leaders, in the pilot. With banks on board, users will be accessing CBDC through the apps of the banks and wallets provided by them.",842,0.9998735785484314

A Kotak Mahindra Bank arm on Tuesday announced that it has invested Rs 550 crore in Sanghi Industries Group by subscribing to non-convertible debentures of the cement-making company and its promoter grouping.

Kotak Special Situations Fund's infusion will correct Sanghi Industries' capital structure, help the company's liquidity profile, and enhance its operations, according to a statement.

The investments being done from a USD 1 billion fund by KSSF will include Rs 500 crore in the NCDs of Sanghi Industries (SIL) and the remaining Rs 50 crore in the NCDs of a company owned by the promoters of SIL which in turn will be infused into the company.

With this deal, KSSF has completed 13 deals and deployed over Rs 6,300 crore, the statement said.

On the SIL investment front, it said the company is engaged in the manufacturing and distribution of cement under the brand 'Sanghi Cement', and has a strong presence in Gujarat and is one of India's low-cost cement producers.

A Kotak Mahindra Bank arm plans to raise up to USD 1 billion to invest in data centre business.

Kotak Alternate Assets, a division of Kotak Investment Advisors (KIAL), on Friday announced the appointment of Subhamkar Das as the chief operating officer for the 'Kotak Data Centre Funds platform, as per an official statement.

The statement did not mention about the fundraising plans, but market sources said the private sector lender's arm is planning to raise between USD 500-USD 1 billion for the fund, which will be ploughed into the data centre businesses.

KIAL has raised/managed/advised in aggregate of over USD 6.8 billion across different asset classes, including real estate, private equity, infrastructure, special situations fund, and investment advisory, since its inception in 2005. Typically, it raises money from investors to bet on opportunities it sees for higher returns, and usually, it puts in its own money as well.

The data centre business have attracted investments from a slew of players lately, including announcements by industrial houses like Adanis and Hiranandanis.

KIAL's managing director Srini Sriniwasan said India is at the cusp of a ""data explosion"" and the company expects the industry to grow from 650 MW to 2.2 GW over the next five years, which will be requiring an investment of USD 7 billion.

He said Kotak has always been trying to identify new investment opportunities and has invested in empowered teams to execute plans to meet investors' target expectations.

The son of India’s richest banker isn’t in the running to lead Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., as the lender looks to appoint a chief executive officer within the next six months to replace its billionaire founder.

Jay Kotak, son of founder Uday Kotak who has led the business since establishing it in 1985, is not a contender for the role, according to KVS Manian, the firm’s whole-time director. The billionaire will transition from his chief executive position by the end of next year, after central bank guidelines capped tenures for Indian business heads.

“Jay is still young. He will have to work his way up on merit,” Manian said in an interview. He expects the board to announce their pick in the next five to six months.

Part of the new CEO’s job will be to help guide Mumbai-based Kotak Mahindra’s expansion plans. Consumer spending in India has rebounded with annual credit growth in the country close to the highest in more than a decade, though there are signs the economy may be slowing.

Technology, Infrastructure Financing Push

The bank recently hired Amazon.com Inc. veteran Bhavnish Lathia as chief of customer experience to also design and lead the technology of its consumer bank.

There’s a push toward using technology to fuel the bank’s growth across all segments, according to Shanti Ekambaram, group president and whole-time director. The bank’s competition is no longer other banks, but tech-enabled platforms that deliver digital consumer experiences, Ekambaram said.

“In the future, banks will be more like tech companies, but offering financial products to customers,” she said in the same interview.

The new CEO will also guide the firm’s push into infrastructure financing, including roads and airports, as well as the transition to renewable energy. Shorter time frames on refinancing infrastructure assets has increased the appeal of this market, helped by government action to make the investments safer, Manian said.",325,0.9987561404705048

Bulls retained their might for the fourth straight week ended November 11, taking the Nifty50 to its peak for this year so far on the back of a rally in its global peers. The upbeat sentiment in the market was fuelled by the hope of a slowdown in rate hikes by the Federal Reserve after inflation in the US began cooling off.

The Nifty50 rallied more than 200 points or 1 percent to settle the week at 18,350, backed by technology, banking and financial services and metal stocks. The index has seen a bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly scale, with a higher-high-higher-low formation for the fourth consecutive week.

Momentum indicators MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) and RSI (relative strength index) also indicated the positive mood in the market. Hence, the chances look bright for the Nifty50 to move towards a record high of 18,604 in the coming days if the momentum sustains and global markets support, with crucial support at the psychological 18,000 mark, said experts. They advised to continue with the 'buy on dips' strategy.

""The price configuration looks promising, too, because the Nifty finally managed to surpass the time-tested trendline resistance above 18,200–18,000 with some authority,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

For the coming week, he feels 18,200–18,000 would now be seen as a sacrosanct support zone, whereas on the flipside, testing 18,450 and 18,600 is clearly on the cards. In fact, if the momentum persists, the Nifty will see a fresh record high in the coming week itself.

Till now, most of the other heavyweights have been driving the markets higher but with the IT space coming out of its long slumber, the rally is likely to be robust in nature, Chava said.

The broader markets were under pressure with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices falling 1 percent and half a percent respectively.

Hence, instead of anticipating reversals in the underperformers, traders should look to ride the trend with the heavyweights or sectors which are participating in this up-move, and look for buying opportunities from a short-term perspective, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com, advised.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the November 11 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Zomato: Buy | LTP: Rs 72.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 67 | Target: Rs 90 | Return: 24 percent

The stock completed a sideways corrective pattern on last Friday and closed above the upper band of the trading range, which was at Rs 70.

Based on that the stock should move towards Rs 90 level with minor resistance at Rs 80. It is a price and volume-based break out for the stock, which signals the start of an impulse-up move.

One can buy 50 percent quantity at Rs 73 and the remaining 50 percent at Rs 69 with a stop-loss at Rs 67.

United Spirits: Buy | LTP: Rs 885 | Stop-Loss: Rs 860 | Target: Rs 960 | Return: 8.5 percent

Since the stock has broken the resistance of the falling trend line, it is consolidating at the upper band of the rectangle formation, which is suggesting that the stock is ready to surpass the upward boundary, which is at Rs 905.

On the dismissal of Rs 905, the stock would move toward the levels of Rs 925 and Rs 960. It’s a buy at current levels as the risk to the reward is decent. One can buy at current levels and keep a stop-loss at Rs 860 for the same.

Mphasis: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,027 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,900 | Target: Rs 2,400 | Return: 18 percent

The stock is turning positive on the weekly chart. With a positive divergence, it is on track to complete a falling wedge (a bullish consolidation), which would pull the stock towards Rs 2,400 in the medium term.

It is advisable to buy at the current level with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,900. On the upside, resistance will be at Rs 2,150 and Rs 2,400.

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

Firstsource Solutions: Buy | LTP: Rs 109 | Stop-Loss: Rs 101 | Target: Rs 125 | Return: 15 percent

After showing a rangebound action in the last 5-6 weeks, the stock price has witnessed a sharp upside bounce last week and closed higher. The stock price is currently placed at the resistance of 20-week EMA (exponential moving average) around Rs 108.50 and further upside from here could bring another hurdle of down sloping trend line at Rs 112 in the near term.

Volume has expanded during upmove on last Friday and weekly RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price ahead.

Buying can be initiated in Firstsource at current market price (Rs 109), add more on dips down to Rs 104.50, wait for the upside targets of Rs Rs 117 and next Rs 125 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss of Rs 101.

ITI: Buy | LTP: Rs 111 | Stop-Loss: Rs 104 | Target: Rs 126 | Return: 13 percent

After witnessing a sharp upside breakout of down sloping trend line resistance on November 1 at Rs 108 levels, the stock price has shifted into a consolidation with minor downward correction in the next 5-6 sessions.

The recent minor downward correction seems to have completed and the stock price is now ready to show another round of sharp upside bounce from the higher lows. The recent weakness has not negated the upside breakout of the down trend line. The daily RSI shows positive indication and one may expect continuation of upside momentum in the near term.

Buying can be initiated in ITI at current market price (Rs 111), add more on dips down to Rs 107 and wait for the upside targets of Rs 120 and next Rs 126 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss of Rs 104.

Expert: Jatin Gohil - Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,059 | Stop-Loss: Rs 968 | Target: Rs 1,360 | Return: 28 percent

After a higher level of reversal, the stock tested its prior high's connecting rising trendline and respecting its long-term moving average (200-week SMA) oscillated upwards.

We believe the stock is poised for a breakout, which could take it towards Rs 1,330-1,360 zone.

In the past, reversal from its long-term moving average has supported a health up-move.

The key technical indicators are in favour of the bulls on short-term timeframe chart.

In case of any decline, the stock will respect its long-term moving average.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,899 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,740 | Target: Rs 2,180 | Return: 15 percent

The stock has made higher bottoms on the weekly chart with an inside range and trending in a narrow range confirms a breakout.

Its weekly RSI has turned upwards from the lower part of the range and other key technical indicators on near-term timeframe chart are positively poised.

The stock has a strong support near its multi band of moving averages on the weekly time scale and the strong positive momentum in the sector reinforces our positive stance.

Therefore, we recommend directional long position for a target of Rs 2,180 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,740.

Jubilant Foodworks Future: Sell | LTP: Rs 566 | Stop-Loss: Rs 617 | Target: 463 | Return: 18 percent

In second week of October 2022, the stock witnessed a breakdown from rising wedge pattern and after sluggish movement, it has extended loss with above average volume.

On the lower side, the stock may find support around Rs 547, as multiple lows formed at around that level.

The key technical indicators gave sell signal post bearish divergence on the short-term timeframe chart.

This could drag the stock below its near-term support of Rs 547 and could move it towards Rs 506-487-463.

On the higher side, the stock will face hurdle around its prior highs (Rs 652 and Rs 628) connecting intermediate falling trendline.

Thus, a short position can be initiated for the target of Rs 463 with a stop-loss of Rs 617.

Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers

Sharda Cropchem: Buy | LTP: Rs 391 | Stop-Loss: Rs 350 | Target: Rs 480 | Return: 23 percent

The free fall started from July 2022 till October 2022 which resulted in a 47 percent decline in price. On a daily scale, the counter has formed classic Doji near its historical support of Rs 375 along with drying volume which indicates that bears are losing grip.

In the previous trading session, the said counter witnessed nice buying interest supported by sufficient volume which is adding more confirmation for early reversal in the counter.

On the indicator front, the daily RSI (relative strength index) has formed a bullish divergence near the oversold zone (refer to the chart) which further confirms the upside in the counter.

One can buy in small tranches at current levels and buy another tranche at around Rs 370 levels (if tested). The upside is expected till Rs 480 and support is around Rs 350.

Alembic Pharmaceuticals: Buy | LTP: Rs 639 | Stop-Loss: Rs 570 | Target: Rs 750 | Return: 17 percent

On a monthly scale after hitting an all-time high of Rs 1,111, the counter nosedived to Rs 540 levels which accounted for a 51 percent depreciation in price.

Even on a daily scale, negative volume is drying up indicating possible upside momentum.

On the indicator front, the monthly RSI has formed an impulsive structure near the oversold zone which further confirms the upside in the counter. One can buy at current levels, the upside expected is Rs 750 and credible support is at Rs 570.

Petronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 212 | Stop-Loss: Rs 200 | Target: Rs 235 | Return: 11 percent

Petronet has witnessed a very sharp correction of 14 percent between July 2022 and September 2022. Since then the stock is consolidating between Rs 200-205 on the hourly scale and it has made a solid base near Rs 203 levels.

On October 3, 2022, it completed a bullish BAT pattern near said range along with the complex structure on daily RSI which hints towards a possible reversal in the counter.

One can hold (if already bought) and add (if considering fresh buy) in the range Rs 211-213. The upside is expected till Rs 235 with a stop-loss of Rs 200 on a closing basis.

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, India's fourth-largest private lender, sees tepid demand for corporate credit even though conditions to lend to companies have improved, a top company executive told Reuters in an interview.

The credit environment has never looked better, KVS Manian, president for corporate, institutional and investment banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank said on Wednesday. But demand from corporate borrowers is still not very strong, he said.

Indian corporations have deleveraged their balance sheets significantly over the past few years by raising equity and refinancing high-cost debt. This has opened opportunities for banks, which have seen growth coming mostly from retail lending in recent years.

Bank credit rose 19% year-over-year during the fortnight ending Oct. 20, according to Reserve Bank of India data.

Sector-wise data available until September shows that credit to industries rose 12.6% year-on-year, with small- and mid-sized corporates recording stronger growth.

""We are seeing opportunities in sectors like cement, steel, renewable energy, roads, and chemicals. In these five sectors, there is some capacity creation and therefore credit demand,"" said Manian.

""We are yet to see secular increase in demand for credit across sectors.""

Lending to small-and-medium-sized businesses, though, has risen, aided by the government's emergency credit guarantee scheme launched during the COVID-19 crisis, which helped stabilize the sector.

Kotak Mahindra Bank loaned 140 billion rupees ($1.69 billion) under this scheme, with low defaults.

MISPRICING RISK

Banks in India are required to lend a certain percentage of their overall advances to priority sectors such as agriculture and small businesses.

But, Manian warned that corporate loans could be mispriced as a large number of banks chase few opportunities.

""We feel the market is not pricing the credit risk and also the cost of priority sector lending appropriately into the pricing for corporate advances.""

This, he explained, has meant that even a smaller company, which may be riskier to lend to, is able to borrow at costs close to those associated with relatively higher-rated corporates.

To avoid this, Kotak has expanded its corporate credit book by investing in ""credit substitutes"" such as commercial paper, bonds and non-convertible debentures issued by companies. It has invested 273 billion rupees in such instruments.

""While there is a mark-to-market risk in credit substitutes, we look through any MTM losses since we tend to hold most securities till maturity.""

DEPOSITS BATTLE

Like most other lenders, Kotak is also focused on pushing up deposits, which are growing at a slower pace than credit.

""Deposits will be back in fashion as banks raise deposit rates, particularly on term deposits,"" said Manian.

""This will mean that cost of funds will go up and the ratio of low-cost deposits (current and savings accounts) will look weaker because more money will come in term deposits.""

Manian, though, does not necessarily see this impacting the bank's lending margins as a larger share of assets is repricing compared to liabilities.",491,0.06825729391791603

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB saw a steady quarter as core earnings were in-line while asset quality improved due to controlled slippages. As expected, loan growth was 25% YoY while NIM was higher by 5bps at 5.11% owing to better yields that was a function of strong growth in SME and retail attributable to traction in HL, PL/CC and vehicle. Corporate growth was muted due to competition led mispricing which was partly offset by growth in credit substitutes. Focus would be on higher yielding retail which may keep opex elevated and target is to scale up unsecured share from 8.7% to early-mid teens. Deposit growth of 2.8% QoQ was impacted by SA blip due to outflow from HNI & affluent segment although TD accretion was 7.5% QoQ.



Outlook

KMB is comfortable with a LDR of 90%. We slightly tweak our earnings for FY23/24/25 baking in higher NII and opex. Rolling forward to Sep’24 core ABV we maintain multiple at 3.6x and raise SOTP based TP from Rs1,950 to Rs2,100. Retain ACCUMULATE .

Kotak Mahindra Bank on October 22 reported a 27 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in its standalone net profit for the July-September quarter on the back of rise in net interest income (NII).

The bank reported a net profit of Rs 2,581 crore during the quarter under review, compared to Rs 2,032 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

Analysts expected Kotak Mahindra Bank to report a 15 percent rise in net profit, powered by healthy core earnings growth and broad-based loan growth.

The private sector lender is expected to report net profit of Rs 2,332 crore for the July-September quarter, according to the average of estimates of seven brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. NII is expected to be Rs 4,875 crore, an increase of 21 percent YoY.

Net interest income and net interest margins

The NII of the bank rose 26.81 percent on-year to Rs 5,099 crore on a standalone basis, compared to Rs 4,021 crore in the year-ago period.

NII is the difference between interest earned and interest expended.

Similarly, the net interest margin (NIM) on standalone basis also grew YoY. It climbed a sharp 72 basis points (bps) to 5.17 percent in the reporting quarter.

Asset quality

The bank had reported improvement in its asset quality in the reporting quarter, with gross non-performing assets (NPA) down to 2.08 percent from 3.19 percent in the comparable period last year.

Net NPA also improved marginally to 0.55 percent in July-September. On sequential basis, net NPA improved sharply; in the previous quarter it stood at 0.62 percent.

Analysts believed that Kotak Mahindra Bank will show further improvement in asset quality metrics for the July-September quarter. Analysts expect slippages to trend lower again for the reported quarter. Slippages had fallen to Rs 654 crore in the April-June quarter from Rs 736 crore in the preceding three months.

Deposit growth

In the reporting quarter, the bank has seen a rise in deposit of 11.5 percent on-year and a marginal rise of 2.76 percent on-quarter to Rs 325,203 crore.

Current account and savings account (CASA) ratio as of September 30, 2022, stood at 56.2 percent.

Kotak Mahindra said it recorded a 25 percent YoY growth in customer asssets, which includes advances and credit substitutes, at Rs 3.21 lakh crore as of September 2022, with advances also growing over 25 percent to Rs 2.94 lakh crore in the same period. Deposits rose by 11.5 percent to Rs 3.25 lakh crore YoY.

Non-interest income (other income) for the quarter increased by nearly 8 percent to Rs 1,955 crore driven by fee and services segment (largely general banking fees), which contributed the most to other income, which grew 24 percent YoY at Rs 1,760 crore.

Pre-provision operating profit for the quarter at Rs 3,568 crore was up 14.4 percent from the year-ago period.

The bank reported a significant decline in provisions and contingencies at Rs 137 crore, down 68 percent from the year-ago period, though sequentially it was up 496%.

The asset quality performance also improved further in the September quarter, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of gross advances falling 16 bps sequentially to 2.08 percent and the net NPA declined 7 bps QoQ to 0.55 percent.

Kotak Mahindra Bank said slippages for the September FY23 quarter stood at Rs 983 crore (0.3 percent of advances), of which Rs 330 crore were upgraded, hence net slippages came in at Rs 653 crore. ""The recoveries and upgrades during the quarter were at Rs 945 crore,"" it said.

The bank held total provisions of Rs 6,496 crore including Covid-19 provision of Rs 438 crore and restructuring provision of Rs 207 crore, maintaining higher than the regulatory requirement at 10 percent of the restructured book, it said.

On the consolidated basis, Kotak recorded a profit after tax of Rs 3,608 crore, growing 21 percent YoY for the quarter, with Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance segment showing 74 percent YoY growth at Rs 270 crore but the general insurance business remained in loss at Rs 17 crore against loss of Rs 16 crore YoY.

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd is expected to report a 15 percent rise in net profit powered by healthy core earnings growth and broad based loan growth.

The private sector lender is expected to report net profit of Rs 2332 crore for the July-September quarter, according to the average of estimates of seven brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. Net interest income is expected to be Rs 4875 crore, an increase of 21 percent year-on-year (YoY).

Analysts expect the bank’s loan book to show a healthy growth of 23-25 percent led by a jump in mortgages and small business loans. The bank has shed some of its conservativeness in lending over the past two quarters and this would reflect in the quickening of loan growth. That said, Kotak Bank continues to avoid high-risk segments for lending and is cautious in giving out small business loans. Analysts therefore see the bank’s performance modest, relative to its larger peers.

Another boost to profitability would be from the absence of large mark-to-market hit on its bond portfolio. In Q1, the lender had suffered Rs 857 crore treasury loss owing to mark-to-market hit on its bonds. In Q2FY23, bond yields were benign and therefore treasury income is likely to improve for lenders.

Mixed margin outlook

Analysts expect net interest margin for Kotak Bank to show a sequential improvement given the transmission of policy rate hikes onto lending rates. Analysts at Nuvama Research (formerly Edelweiss Securities) expect margins to expand by 12 basis points for the quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Kotak Bank’s current and savings account (CASA) share in total deposits is healthy at 58.1 percent as of last quarter and is one of the highest in the industry. Even so, CASA ratio has slipped and could come under further pressure as liquidity tightens progressively. “We believe it is difficult to strengthen liability franchise in a tight liquidity environment,” a Nuvama Research note said. “We also believe, unlike other banks, Kotak has used up all its levers of margin expansion and credit cost normalisation,” the note added.

Asset quality

Kotak Mahindra Bank will show further improvement in asset quality metrics for July-September quarter. Analysts expect slippages to trend lower again for the reported quarter. Slippages had fallen to Rs 654 crore in April-June quarter from Rs 736 crore in the preceding three months.

Investors should watch for the performance of the small business loans, especially those disbursed under the emergency credit line guarantee scheme. Analysts, though expect this segment too to show resilience in terms of asset quality. The cushion from a comfortable 70 percent provision cover would be an added comfort for investors.

The date was October 6, 2022. The stage was set, and the room was abuzz, flickering with multiple disco lights. HDFC Bank was all set to launch its newest digital initiative in one of Mumbai’s fancy five-star hotels. Bankers, fintech players and journalists were all there, revelling in one of the most glittering events in the banking landscape.

The event was the launch of the SmartHub Vyapar Merchant app, which would facilitate instant, digital and paperless merchant on-boarding for the bank’s customers. The app was developed by HDFC Bank in partnership with Mintoak Innovations, a merchant SaaS (software as a service) platform.

Such events, to launch their digital initiatives, have become the new normal in the banking space. Banks today are no longer confined to their traditional brick-and-mortar setup or the exhausting paperwork of old. They are getting with it.

Fintechs fuelling change

A major reason for banks constantly revolutionising and upgrading their digital services is the rise of fintechs. Relying on smartphones for almost everything is the new normal, particularly when it comes to financial services. Fintech companies have become an integral part of the country’s economy, keeping it on the move.

Today, India has more than 7,000 fintech startups, operating in various segments. Such is the breadth of their presence that they have a finger in every pie, from payments and online credit facilities to subscription management and peer-to-peer lending.

With the growing presence of fintechs, banks have realised that they need to gear up on the technology front. Banks are using artificial intelligence to ensure smooth customer identification and authentication, while also mimicking live employees through chatbots and voice assistants.

The use of Aadhaar and video know-your-customer (KYC) along with card-less cash withdrawals and paperless customer on-boarding are some of the tools that reflect acceleration in the digitisation of banking in India.

Gone are the days when consumers had to wait for hours to reach the front of the queue, complete formalities, fill forms and access customer care for assistance at banks. With fintech banking solutions, self-service capabilities provide customers with operational processes that were previously only available via a physical branch. Not just that, bank-to-bank payments have become the new normal.

The opportunity to tap this trend is huge. According to an E&Y report, only about 12 percent of Indian adults—fewer than 20 percent of account owners —had made a digital merchant payment in 2021. However, two-thirds of those who made a digital merchant payment did so for the first time after the onset of COVID-19. Also, the share of account owners with an inactive account in India is 35 percent, which was the highest globally in 2021.

Fintechs have been driving this change.

“The primary evolution that the fintech players in the country have brought in is that they have digitalised financial processes. One of the major trends in the fintech sector is digital lending, through which borrowers can avail of a loan through applications on their mobile,” said Mahesh Shukla, founder of PayMe, a fintech.

According to Shukla, fintechs have also significantly reduced and also simplified the documentation process. One of the major challenges in conventional banking is that it was earlier difficult for people in rural areas to access loans. Fintech has made it easy for people from all parts of the country to do so online, added Shukla.

Globally, too, cross-border remittance is a growing opportunity, with payment volumes expected to cross the $156 trillion mark in 2022, according to the E&Y report. Banks would require technology to cater to this growth, something that fintech companies are already providing.

Rise in fintechs

As of July 2022, India had over 7,300 fintech startups, according to ""The Winds of Change"" report presented by EY during the 2022 Global Fintech Festival in Mumbai. The EY report said Indian fintechs received $7.8 billion in funding in 2021, way more than the $2.9 billion they received in 2020.

According to the Chiratae and EY report, lending AUMs in Indian fintech have the potential to grow from $38 billion currently to $515 billion by 2030.

Fintechs are increasingly looking to capture underserved markets with their presence, convenience and technology. With the growing number of fintechs in India, banks are beginning to feel the heat and are gearing up on the technology front.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, for example, hired a chief technology officer recently, while other big lenders such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are ramping up tech teams through lateral hiring.

Fino Payments Bank has also appointed a Chief Digital Officer and plans to recruit many people for this division to drive digital banking among the youth.

“Several years back, most banks and large institutions began hiring Chief Digital Officers or Chief Data Officers. These trends are normal every time an industry goes through a massive change,” said Amit Das, chief executive officer and co-founder of Think360.ai, a Mumbai-based data science company.

“In a way, with the growth of fintechs, banks are aspiring to become savvier, and the advent of transformative technologies like AI (artificial intelligence) will force these realignments.”

Das’ views were corroborated by Kotak Mahindra Bank’s first chief technology officer, Milind Nagnur. In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol on September 14, Nagnur spoke of an important shift — that of viewing the bank as a software engineering-focused organisation. In his view, the new definition of trust in banking for customers is not about the safety of assets, but about how dependable a bank’s digital offerings are.

Are banks worried?

According to bankers, the rise of fintechs has indeed revolutionised the lending industry, with most traditional banks trying to catch up with fintechs. If anything, fintech lending has only threatened the ‘traditional’ way of banking and lending, which is good for customers and the market. However, it is too nascent to say that they could replace banks altogether, they added.

Banks have superior funding franchises, arguably more underwriting expertise, and a widespread distribution or collection network that is also becoming a lot more digital. Fintech companies have better technology capabilities, user interfaces, and innovative solutions.

According to industry players, both banks and fintech companies have realised the advantages the other offers and have come together to offer comprehensive solutions.

“Over the decade, especially after the start of the pandemic, it has been clearly proven that fintechs and banks have a collaborative relationship rather than a competitive one,” said Murali Ramakrishnan, managing director and chief executive officer at South Indian Bank.

“I feel that fintechs will continue to have the role of an enabler rather than a competitor. Even with banks’ legacy infrastructural gaps, they do have a firmly established long-term client base that is unlikely for fintechs to replace,” Ramakrishnan added.

According to Akhil Handa, chief digital officer at Bank of Baroda, while technological advances are not new to finance, digital innovation has brought major improvements in the connectivity of systems, in computing power and cost, and in newly created and usable data. These improvements have alleviated transaction costs and given rise to new business models and new entrants like fintechs.

“Fintechs have demonstrated that they can transform the financial-landscape, where consumers get to choose from a larger set of options at competitive prices and build efficiency through lower operational costs,” said Handa. “Banks may have lost some customers to mobile fintech applications, but this has also created an opportunity like never before for banking institutions and inspired them to embrace change.”

Large unbanked population

Another reason why there is a tremendous opportunity for both players to survive in this landscape is the large number of unbanked Indians. Around 200 million Indians are unbanked, according to the Global Findex Database –2021. That’s quite a large number for both fintechs and banks to tap into.

“In India, we have enormous unmet demand for credit and enough space for many players. So, thinking that fintechs are eating into banks’ business is rather odd,” said Sugandh Saxena, chief executive officer at the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE).

Saxena added that most traditional banks are trying to catch up with fintechs, which only pose a threat to the ‘traditional’ way of banking. Banks in India have capital, scale, credibility and a much larger mandate, he added.

Bank of Baroda’s Handa said that while there has been increased competition from fintechs in the last few years in segments like payments and lending, banks have taken on this challenge as an opportunity.

Fintechs, according to Handa, have to an extent inspired banks to make product delivery seamless and on the go. Banks are delivering products with enhanced user experience and have made customers transition back to using the products and services of incumbents, he said. Rather than fear, he feels it is “healthy competition” between two entities striving to constantly push each other to serve their clientele better every day.

Can fintechs replace banks?

For a while back in 2021, the question often asked was: will fintechs be a threat to banks? Today, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has left no one in doubt about the answer, going by the slew of circulars that it has issued to rein in fintechs.

“The RBI seems hell-bent on regulating fintechs through banks or NBFCs (non-banking finance companies), and hence our models will have to evolve around that,” said a fintech founder, on condition of anonymity. “Our wings are clipped, so we have to depend on banks and NBFCs for survival. With the kind of regulations that the RBI has brought in, it is impossible for fintechs to replace banks altogether.”

According to Rajat Deshpande, chief executive officer and co-founder of FinBox, the plan for legacy players—banks and NBFCs—looks like this: improve your technology stack, partner with fintechs where you can’t build it yourself, and convert the entire suite of offerings into a digital-first business where the cost of delivery is lower.

This way, there’s much more potential to increase revenue per customer, said Deshpande. Direct acquisition of customers, added Deshpande, is becoming increasingly expensive and hence eats into margins quickly.

However, some bankers said that while banks’ cost of spending on digital transformation has increased, the costs may be plateauing.

“I think we are plateauing; 50 percent is at an aggregate level. At an aggregate level we are clearly seeing a plateauing of costs already,” said Parag Rao, group head – payments, consumer finance, technology and digital marketing at HDFC Bank at the launch of the SmartHub Vyapar app.

The way forward: collaboration or confrontation?

At least seven bankers and fintechs Moneycontrol spoke to said that collaboration, and not competition, is the way forward. Rather than competing with each other, it would be best for fintechs and banks to identify each other’s strengths and play the market together, added industry players.

“It's no longer going to be an 'us versus them'. Banks and fintechs have both realised that they accomplish more when they are collaborating, instead of competing,” said Srikanth Mopidevi, managing director and head of technology at DBS Bank India. “By working in tandem, banks are able to provide customer-friendly technology, while fintechs benefit from the large-scale network and customer data available with the banks.”

The next few years, Mopidevi said, will see a host of new collaborations expected to further improve the banking experience. Bank-fintech partnerships have especially enabled smaller banks to innovate and become competitive. However, fintechs will complement and enhance the existing banking landscape and not replace it, he added.

HDFC Bank’s Rao concurred with Mopidevi’s view. Rao said that he believes “very strongly” in the partnership philosophy and that the bank is open to more partnerships with fintech players.

Fintech players, too, believe that the partnership model will work well for both sides. “We believe that neo-banks and traditional Banks can work together to increase the size of the pie and play off each other’s strengths,” said Kunal Varma, co-founder and CEO of Freo, a consumer neobank. “This would lead to a win for the consumer, reduction in costs, and rapid market expansion with sustainable profit pools for the industry.”

This trend is currently visible. In September, Axis Bank partnered with fintech firm PayNearby to launch savings and current accounts for last-mile merchants. IDBI Bank has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Vay Network Services as its first fintech partner for digital supply chain finance solutions (e-SCF). There are many such examples.

According to the EY report cited earlier, collaborations between traditional financial services players such as banks with fintech startups is “business as usual” now and enabled by the proliferation of APIs (application programming interfaces, which allow myriad software types to communicate with each other) and data sharing norms.

With limited new licences, fintech startups only have the partnership route to go to market, and that is being welcomed by banks, the report said.

The market cap of HDFC Bank is now 10 times higher than that of crisis-hit Credit Suisse after the latter's stock price crashed amid speculation about its financial health. The market cap of HDFC Bank is six times higher than that of Deutsche Bank.

Currently, HDFC Bank's m-cap stands at $99.10 billion while Credit Suisse's m-cap is at $11 billion. A year ago, Credit Suisse had a market cap of $26 billion.

Deutsche Bank's m-cap is at $15 billion. Last year its m-cap was at $26 billion. Both Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have declined nearly 58 percent and 40 percent in the last one year.

Many Indian banks like State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Indusind Bank now have higher market capitalisation than Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank.

State Bank of India has an m-cap of $58 billion while ICICI Bank's m-cap stands at $74 billion. Kotak Mahindra Bank's m-cap is $44 billion. Axis Bank's m-cap is $28 billion and Indusind Bank's m-cap is $12 billion.

On Friday, new CEO of Credit Suisse Ulrich Koerner penned a memo to staff noting the strong capital base and liquidity position of the bank. Post this, its five-year senior CDS widened to 250bps.

Both Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank shares have been under pressure since the beginning of the year. The shares are trading at valuations not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. In light of the troubles with gilt yields, investors feared that these investment banks would face big losses on their books, especially with leveraged finance, Moneycontrol reported.

Credit Suisse’s investment bank vertical has reported depressed earnings in the past quarters. Deutsche Bank faced immense pain in 2016 when the firm reported a big hit on its revenues, and its management had announced a restructuring plan wherein dividends were suspended, the Moneycontrol report said.

Meanwhile, brokerage firm CITI says 'this is not 2008'. Citi believes Credit Suisse's position is better than its peers. CS has a CET1 ratio of 13.5 percent, higher than its peers and LCR at 191 percent, which is the best in class; the liquidity position also remains healthy.",357,-0.0002218782901763916

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on September 30 delivered an interest rate hike of 50 basis points on expected lines, retaining its inflation forecast at 6.7 percent for FY23.

However, the central bank decided to lower its FY23 real GDP growth estimate to seven percent from 7.2 percent earlier, which was lower than the S&P Global Ratings' 7.3 percent projection but same as that of Fitch Ratings.

""The MPC delivered rate hike in line with expectations. At this point, we still think that the RBI would not go too restrictive and terminal rate could hover near estimated real rates, implying not more than 100 bp hikes ahead, including today's decision. However, the extent of global disruption will remain key to the RBI’s reaction function ahead,"" Madhavi Arora, lead economist, Emkay Global Financial Services, said.

Given the RBI acted in line with other central banks, the equity markets rebounded with the Nifty50 moving closer to 17,000, up 146 points at 16,964 while the BSE Sensex rallied more than 500 points to 56,936 at the time of writing this article, after losing seven percent in previous seven consecutive sessions.

The volatility also cooled down further with the passing of two key events (RBI policy and Fed meet). India VIX declined by 3.87 percent to 20.48 levels.

Banking & financial services, realty, and auto stocks participated in the run-up, but defensives IT and pharma were under pressure.

Bajaj Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 7,104.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,700 | Target: Rs 8,000-8,200 | Return: 13-15 percent

The stock has overall been in a positive trend moving above the significant 200-day moving average (DMA) zone of Rs 6,780 levels with a consolidation phase witnessed recently moving between the range of Rs 7,100 and Rs 7,600 levels but medium-term bias remains positive.

We anticipate a revival from Rs 7,000 levels which is the support zone of the channel pattern on the daily chart with major support lying near the 200 DMA level of Rs 6,750.

Our view gets negated only in case a breach below the 200DMA level is established and till then the overall trend remains positive. The stock has immense potential to rise further and one can buy and accumulate this stock for an upside target of Rs 8,000-8,200 keeping the stop-loss of Rs 6,700.

The strong support visible is near the 200 DMA level of Rs 500 where we anticipate a revival and can move ahead for another fresh upward move to breach the recent peak level.

With the chart overall looking good, we suggest buying and accumulating the stock at every decline till Rs 505 levels and expect it to rise thereafter for upward targets of Rs 580-620 while keeping a stop-loss at Rs 490.

Private sector Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd in association with Indian Institute of Technology-Madras on Tuesday said it has launched the ’Kotak IIT-M Save Energy Mission’ to encourage adoption of various energy conservation measures in the micro, small and medium enterprises sector.

Under the corporate social responsibility initiative of Kotak Mahindra Bank, satellite centres would be set up at IIT-Bombay, IIT-Gandhinagar, IIT-Indore, IIT-Ropar, while the hub of Save Energy Mission would be at the IIT-Madras campus in Chennai.

The hub would monitor and implement the energy assessment activities across the country, while the four satellite centres would identify the MSMEs that qualify for industrial energy assessment services and carry out audits and share recommendations for energy saving, a press release from IIT-Madras said.

”We are excited to launch Kotak IIT-M Save Energy Mission, which will enable IIT-M faculty and students to work with the MSME sector and help them become energy efficient,” IIT Madras Director professor V Kamakoti said.

Union Minister of Education, Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Dharmendra Pradhan formally rolled out the initiative at an event in Chennai on Monday, the release said. ”Kotak Mahindra Bank is committed to promoting energy conservation and Kotak IIT-M Save Energy Mission is a step in the direction to encourage SMEs and MSMEs to adopt environmentally sustainable technologies and processes,” Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd Joint President and Group chief CSR officer, Rohit Rao said.

”The SMEs and MSMEs need support and guidance to implement environmentally responsible measures in their units. Kotak’s CSR partnership with IIT-M is an endeavour to help SMEs and MSMEs reduce waste, save on audit costs and implement energy-saving measures,” Rao said.",288,0.9988880753517151

As chief technology officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank, Milind Nagnur stands apart from many of his peers. For one, Nagnur’s last stint was at Early Warning, a US-based fintech company that was owned by seven banks. In over 20 years, Nagnur has held leadership roles in Citi and Wells Fargo and combines the expertise of traditional large banks with the technology-first approach of fintech companies.

Nagnur speaks of an important shift – that of viewing the bank as a software engineering-focused organisation. In his maiden interview since taking over as the first CTO of Kotak Mahindra Bank on August 2, Nagnur tells Moneycontrol that when it comes to tech, it is equally important to master newer ways of working as it is to master new platforms. In his view, the new definition of trust in banking for customers is not about the safety of assets, but about how dependable a bank’s digital offerings are. Edited excerpts:

What are your top priorities in your new role?

The first one is to transform the bank to take a technology-first approach to solving customer problems. In other words, create new and productive experiences for customers that are powered by technology.

The second priority is to think in terms of solving customer problems versus thinking in terms of selling our products. Whether it is a bank or any other organisation, traditionally, there is a lot of inside-out thinking. Therefore, the second change would be transforming ourselves into thinking outside-in.

The third priority would be being true to ourselves in the new definition of trust. The traditional definition of trust in banking has been about whether my assets are going to be safe and sound. But today, that’s a given. The new definition of trust is whether my bank is available digitally and physically, with high performance and reliability and 100 percent availability, when I need it, where I need it, and in the channel and format that I need it in. If you talk to millennials and GenZ today, that is the new definition of trust.

What are the learnings that you can take from your past roles and apply here?

My fintech experience teaches me that you should think big, but you should start small and scale fast. That is a very different approach compared to spending months thinking about huge investments, and you're swinging for the fences and going all out with certain projects and proposals. Also, long-drawn implementations for several years.

Gone are the days when companies could afford to do that. So, you move towards an agile mindset today where, of course, you have to think big and be ambitious but you don’t at one shot make the swing for the fences investments. You start with a minimum viable product. You test and learn as you launch to market. That also changes the way in which you internally operate, that's where new ways of working come about. Typically, most of the people in technology traditionally would be used to project plans where development, testing, and third-party reviewing take months.

The new way of operating is essentially about – ‘I have a vision and I have defined it. But I'm going to start small with a minimum viable product. Every four to six weeks, I am going to launch some part of that. I'm going to test the market with probably at least two versions of what I want to go live with.’

In the process you are doing this incremental value-add where you are testing and learning, adjusting and discarding things that are not working out. Then you are amplifying and enhancing things that are giving amazing experiences to customers. It is very important for us to understand and master not only new and modern platforms like cloud, but also new and modern ways of working.

We have often heard that large banks are not agile when it comes to tech upgrades due to huge volumes. Does that constrain you?

One great example of agility is the 811 platform. That is a great example of working differently, co-locating the different product teams, software engineers, the UI and UX designers, everyone working on the feature set together. Then launching the product to the digital mobile channel in short sprints. These are the characteristics of the agile method of working. So, the goal here is to take bright spots like that in terms of new ways of working and apply them across the company with three objectives – one is to fortify and solidify the core so that the core is really strong. Further, modernise our platforms using avenues like cloud and therefore enabling modern experiences for our customers and team members.

Are you in talks for any fintech partnerships?

The role of partnerships in the financial space is definitely very important. The future is about having a strong ecosystem that consists of customers, financial institutions like ours, the regulators and the fintechs. These four components of the ecosystem have to partner and collaborate very closely to enable the exponential growth that we all want India to have. So, that's a critical part of our strategy.

I cannot comment on specifics. Obviously, our highest priority is to stay within the regulatory framework. Within that regulatory framework, we are open and look forward to partnerships and collaborations, taking our customers and regulators in confidence at each step.

What are the bank’s plans when it comes to leveraging fintech partnerships for backend development?

The whole world is moving towards an event-based architecture. You can also call it APIs (application programming interface) or microservice-based architecture. What that really means is you are modernising your architecture in a way that partnerships and collaboration are possible in a safe and secure manner, provided that the interfaces are API-based and the deployments follow certain security standards. Also, provided that end-to-end customer journeys can be stitched together as a result of these APIs talking to each other.

It is very important that we design an event-based architecture and even core backing platforms must adhere to that. We should think about edge computing based on this event-based architecture to make instant experiences available to our customers, which is what everybody wants now. The customer’s expectation is that I want my service, whether it's banking or any other service, at my fingertips on my mobile phone when I want it and where I want it.

In order to enable that, our internal architecture across the ecosystem, including across other banks, fintechs, data service providers, credit bureaus, and payment providers should get on to event-based, edge computing, and API-based architecture. If we do these three things across the ecosystem, then I think we can see phenomenal exponential growth in terms of how digital services are made available to the customers.

There is a view that core banking systems are not exactly agile. What is the remedy?

The remedy is exactly what I just said, which is the blueprint for an event-based architecture. To further drill down a bit more technically into this topic, if traditional implementation of core banking was a monolithic database, where everybody is hitting the same database for every query, whether it's branch or real-time or digital, sooner or later you are going to get into some of those bottlenecks and performance issues. But by having an event-based architecture and an edge computing cache, what happens is you have real time synchronisation between the core database and between your events database and you offload a lot of real-time processing to your edge computing framework, which is powered and replicated through the core banking system.

Has Kotak Mahindra bank moved to an event-based architecture or is that something that will happen in the next few months or a year or so?

It's a journey. It's not a one-and-done. We have definitely made a great start in terms of having our own event-based architecture and we have seen some early benefits from that. But like I said, it's a journey that we have to continue across various platforms internally and externally.

What steps will the bank take to curb digital frauds?

We have a very advanced cybersecurity programme and this is a situation where technology is to be used to create technology. So, we are making significant advances in our cybersecurity programme with newer tools. That'll put us significantly ahead in terms of proactively monitoring, gauging and preventing some of these cyber issues.

How is the bank attracting top tech talent?

Our mission is to be a software engineering focused organisation and therefore, there is heavy emphasis on acquiring software engineering talent. The ratio of engineers to non-engineers becomes very important. That ratio will go up significantly and that is our goal.

In terms of how we are going to achieve that, all of our messaging, whether it's on LinkedIn or social media, whether it's when we visit campuses, or whether we talk to potential candidates or whether we have our talent reviews, we welcome and invite the best software engineers to join us.

The second impactful part of the holistic package is about the ability to do meaningful work with a purpose and impact so many people's lives positively. The third one is about a culture of collaboration and engagement. We are completely changing how things work. Instead of working in verticalised departments, we are working horizontally in cross-functional teams.

How will you ensure that the servers can handle the growing volumes and improve the approval rate for Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions?

We do very frequent capacity planning and positioning for the next several years at a time and not just the near term. We have made a great start and we are going to show exponential benefits in that regard in the days and weeks to come.

Your advice to Indian fintechs?

I would say keep innovating. Always keep in mind the fundamentals of financial services, which are safety and soundness and trust. Because people trust the financial services, industry and service providers. This space comes with a lot of responsibility and trust to our consumers, so keep innovating with that in mind.",1697,0.8152626029082707

Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank said on August 30 that it wrote twice to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requesting enforcement of standardised fraud reporting requirements by all lenders.

This came after a media report, citing government data, said Kotak recorded 5,278 cases of fraud in the first quarter (April to June) of FY22, whereas State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, reported only nine cases.

Moneycontrol spoke to bankers and experts on whether all banks follow set protocols in reporting frauds and the challenges and reforms needed to plug loopholes:

1. What type of frauds do banks report to the regulator?

Lenders must report frauds of Rs 1 lakh and above pertaining to fund misappropriation, criminal breach of trust, encashment through forged instruments, manipulation of books of accounts or through fictitious accounts, and conversion of property, said Jugal Mantri, chief executive officer at Anand Rathi Global Finance, citing RBI guidelines.

Banks must also report frauds related to unauthorised credit facilities extended for reward or for illegal gratification, negligence and cash shortages, cheating and forgery, and irregularities in foreign exchange transactions, among others.

Kotak Mahindra said of the 5,278 cases it reported, 97 percent were associated with digital and card-related frauds that occurred “due to customers unwittingly compromising their credentials by clicking on unknown links” or giving access to their devices, among others.

“It is our submission that other banks do not appear to be exhaustively or uniformly reporting these types of frauds. Such frauds are not a reflection of any vulnerabilities in the bank’s secure infrastructure and systems,” the bank said.

2. How many frauds did banks report in FY22?

Responding to Moneycontrol’s query, an SBI spokesperson said the bank reported 4,192 frauds in FY22 and 5,724 frauds in FY21 to the regulator.

Data provided by the RBI shows that while private lenders reported more frauds than public sector banks in FY22, the total value of frauds reported by PSU banks was substantially higher than that of private banks.

As per the RBI data, private lenders reported 5,334 fraud cases amounting to over Rs 1 lakh during FY22, higher than 3,078 cases reported by the state-run lenders. The total amount involved in frauds reported by private banks stood at Rs 17,588 crore during FY22, lower than Rs 40,282 crore of frauds reported by state-owned lenders.

Further, according to the latest data provided by the Centre, during Q1FY23 while some lenders did not report any fraud, HDFC Bank reported 303 fraud cases while ICICI Bank reported 436 cases. The two banks did not offer comment for this story.

3. Which are the areas where banks report the most frauds?

According to the SBI spokesperson, the most instances of fraud by volume is in the retail segment, and by value, it is in the corporate segment.

Deloitte India, citing a survey, identified retail banking as a major contributor to fraud incidents, with 53 percent of the respondents indicating they had experienced more than 100 fraud incidents over the past two years, reflecting a 29 percent increase since the previous edition.

“Similarly, the non-retail segment saw an average of 20 fraud incidents, highlighted by 56 percent of the survey respondents, again a rise from the previous edition that stood at 22 percent,” said KV Karthik, partner, financial advisory, at Deloitte India.

Additionally, data theft, cybercrime, third-party induced fraud, bribery and corruption, and fraudulent documentation were identified as the top five concerns with over 42 percent of the respondents (cumulative) reporting to be victims of these, as per the Deloitte survey.

“Similarly, in the RBI annual report, while overall frauds reported decreased, ‘loan frauds’ have been highlighted as one major area of concern. This was based on the data provided by the banks for frauds above Rs 1 lakh,” Karthik said.

4. What are the reasons for banks’ failure to report frauds?

Ashvin Parekh, managing partner at Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services, said the key problem lies in recognising fraud, which is done by banks. After studying the frequency and severity of each fraud, the bank’s risk management committee must report each fraud to the board of directors, he said.

Governance plays a key role in the reporting of frauds, Parekh said.

“Frauds can not only cause financial loss but reputation risk to the bank as well. In many banks, for instance, you may find that the disclosure policy itself may be an open one, leaving decisions to executives. If the board is not vigilant and the risk management practices are weak, then frauds which occur may not be taken as seriously as some other banks may take. That is exactly what Kotak Bank is saying,” Parekh said.

Amit Das, cofounder of Think360.ai, said most banks and non-banking finance companies don’t report fraud comprehensively.

“There are challenges associated with tracking and reporting frauds consistently, resolving fraud-related issues, establishing clear accountability, off-system management, potential expose of internal process failures, reputation risk, among others. This is similar to the teething issues with bureau reporting in the earlier years,” Das said.

5. What is the RBI doing to tackle fraud disclosure challenges?

According to Karthik, the RBI has mandated banks to report all types of frauds. Banks need to furnish Fraud Monitoring Returns in individual fraud cases, irrespective of the amount involved.

The RBI asked banks to submit fraud reports in cases where central investigating agencies have initiated criminal proceedings suo moto and where the RBI has directed that such cases be reported as fraud, Karthik said, adding that the format for reporting of fraud to the RBI has been provided by the regulator in various circulars issued at regular intervals.

As Moneycontrol reported on August 29, the RBI is also working on a fraud registry aimed at keeping repeat offenders at bay from the banking system.

“The fraud registry will capture information like IP (internet protocol) addresses and phone numbers repeatedly used to commit frauds,” executive director Anil Kumar Sharma said on August 29.

“A mechanism for these details would be created so that banks can report these details to us. That will help us prevent these fraudsters using the banking infrastructure for perpetrating fraud after fraud after fraud,” he added.

6. What are banks doing to lower fraudulent transactions?

Public and private sector banks are raising customer awareness on frauds through digital campaigns, bankers said.

Sending messages and mails to customers advising them not to click on any unknown links, asking them not to provide private bank account information to others through calls and messages, and running digital campaigns to raise awareness are some of the measures, they said.

HDFC Bank recently launched a fraud awareness campaign called #StayVigil through which the bank will “educate people about fraud and its prevention techniques” and guide customers who have been defrauded of their savings.

7. Are better regulations needed to report frauds?

Bankers and analysts are divided on whether the RBI should introduce further fraud disclosure norms.

Das of Think360, who is in favour of further regulation, says there is a “big need” to standardise fraud reporting and fraud management norms across lenders. It will ensure consistency, better fraud repositories, deeper understanding of systemic or process failures, and swifter response to fraud events, he said. It will also allow for faster action against perpetrators, he added.

“Imagine a fraudster replicating the same modus operandi across multiple institutions and accounts and getting away with it because they are aware that no one is tracking aggressively,” Das said.

Mantri of Anand Rathi, on the other hand, said the present fraud disclosure norms are adequate and called for lenders to follow the existing procedure vigilantly.

“As per the RBI circular dated Sept. 29, 2016, frauds are classified under seven broad categories. This classification does not specifically include online/digital frauds. There could be a possibility of non-reporting of such instances. Else, I do not see any incentive for non-reporting,” Mantri said.

The RBI guidelines and internal norms of lending institutions are adequate, he said, adding that true compliance with policies, regular reviews and monitoring mechanisms can help in averting fraud.",1343,-0.2397367466579784

Geojit's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank is one of the leading banking and financial groups in India. KMB has 1,700 full-fledged branches and 2,705 ATMs. Net interest income (NII) in 1QFY23 stood at Rs. 6,160cr (up 18.6% YoY and 3.8% QoQ) driven by the strong growth across corporate/ wholesale banking and retail banking segments. Net interest margin improved to 4.92%. Reported PAT grew at 52.6% YoY to Rs. 2,755cr due to a drastic reduction in operating expenses. Sequentially, however, PAT was down 29.2% QoQ, because of lower non-interest income. Strong parentage, well-established business infrastructure, strong asset quality, robust growth in advances, and reduction in NPA auger well for the bank’s performance going forward.



Outlook

Hence, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock albeit with a revised target price of Rs. 2,173 based on 3.4x FY24E BVPS.

Many private banks like Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank have shown a significant rise in disbursement of unsecured loans last quarter, as per their latest quarterly results. During the outbreak of COVID-19, banks had excessively tightened their disbursement policy. But now, with the economy looking up, banks are gradually easing up, and disbursing more unsecured loans. For banks, unsecured loans are a source of better profit margins in, say analysts.

Going forward, analysts expect a significant rise in the retail unsecured loan portfolios of more banks this fiscal.

Although the data for year-on-year (YoY) growth for IndusInd Bank was not disclosed, the bank said during the announcement of their results that retail loans grew by 3 per cent on quarter-on-quarter(QoQ) basis, with significant pick-up in retail unsecured loans. Credit card lending grew 17.4 per cent QoQ, while personal loans climbed 9.5 per cent QoQ.

Here are the major reasons for private banks to be lending more unsecured loans compared to the previous years:





Loosening of disbursement policy:According to analysts, all banks tightened their disbursement policies during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a fall in the number of unsecured loans issued in the next year. But with the situation gradually getting back to normal, banks are modifying their disbursement policies to make loans accessible to more and more people. “The delinquency number might have moved up a bit but it is still much below the threshold level of banks. Given that these loans have somewhat higher margins, slightly higher delinquency is good enough for banks, as that is priced in the loan,” said Prakash Agarwal, President, Financial Services, India Ratings and Research.





Higher loan rates than FD rates:With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raising rates, banks have increased their lending rates more than the deposit rates. “Banks haven’t increased fixed deposit (FD) rates as much as they have increased their lending rates. So, net interest margin (NIM) is increasing. Thus, they are giving out more loans to cover up the losses of the last two years, as disbursement was quite low (during that period),” said Siddharth Pandey, analyst at Bank of America.





Better profit margins:According to analysts, since lending rates are high, it is the most profitable business for banks. To adjust for the higher credit risks in the business, banks use higher lending rates drawing from the classic risk adjusted return paradigm.





Gradual fall in NPAs: As of March 2022, gross NPA stood at 5.9 per cent, which had previously touched 11.2 per cent in 2018. So, the gross NPA is coming down. It is likely to fall further this fiscal as corporate sector asset quality is likely to improve, according to analysts. Moreover, banks are trying to balance their portfolios, as secured loans form the bulk of their portfolios. “While NPAs in MSME loans could inch up, retail NPAs should be steady and many banks have a demonstrated track record of low NPAs in the retail segment, including in unsecured segments.” added Sitaraman.





Catering to the salaried customers: According to analysts it is primarily customers from the lower socio economic strata who struggle to repay these loans. But most private banks cater to customers with good credit history, are mostly salaried, and belonging to the upper and middle income group. Thus, the chances of defaults are minimal for them.



“They will budget for a specific level of NPA and then charge the lending rate in such a way, so that even if non performing (NPAs) are somewhat higher than in other secured businesses, the higher lending rate will compensate for that. Secured loans like home loans have very fine lending rates, so banks’ profit margin is relatively lower for such loans despite lower NPAs,” added Krishnan Sitaraman, Senior Director & Deputy Chief Ratings Officer, CRISIL Ratings Limited.

Although, most of the banks have performed well in terms of dealing with NPAs, analysts have cautioned banks against being too confident in terms of disbursing unsecured loans, considering the economic turmoil India is going through. “Banks should not be too confident as there may come some challenges in the job sector that may affect repayment,” said Aggarwal.

Banks need to have proper credit appraisal and risk management systems in place to be able to deal with any possible defaults. That will help them keep NPAs under control, else in a fast growing book NPAs could rise. “Even if a bank is disbursing loans to salaried individuals or someone having regular earnings, it is important for the banks to evaluate their financial standing and repayment capabilities through adequate credit appraisal mechanisms,” added Sitaraman.

According to analysts, apart from the salaried or self-employed categorisation and credit bureau scores, banks have multiple attributes that go into their scorecards for arriving at lending decisions. Such scoring parameters include socio-economic factors which could now be populated based on the digital information about the borrower, such as physical location, educational qualifications, and details of friends and family members, which help in the socio-economic profiling of the borrowers and predictability of future defaults.

“Tighter underwriting, including granular and diversified credit portfolio, and smaller exposures to new-to-credit customers are some of the other precautionary measures that can be taken by banks to minimise the risk of NPAs,” added Aashay Choksey, Assistant Vice President, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA.",898,0.5816341400146484

Sharekhan's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) reported PAT at Rs. 2,071 crore, up 26% y-o-y but down 25% q-o-q, below street’s expectations and our estimates (8%) due to higher treasury losses and higher opex growth (31% y-o-y/5% q-o-q). Slippages were higher sequentially, almost double, at Rs. 1,435 crore versus Rs. 736 crore q-o-q. However, out of the total slippages reported, Rs. 781 crore were upgraded during the same quarter. So, net slippages were at Rs. 654 crore. Asset quality improved on a q-o-q basis, with GNPA and NNPA ratio declining by 10 bps and 2 bps q-o-q to 2.24% and 0.62%, respectively. SMA 2 book stood at Rs.159 crore versus Rs. 186 crore q-o-q. Strong growth momentum witnessed in advances, which grew by 29% y-o-y/3% q-o-q (higher than larger peers), led by retail (unsecured as well as secured) and SME portfolio. Deposits grew by only 10% y-o-y due to lower CASA growth (6.6% y-o-y/-2.8% q-o-q).

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating with an unchanged PT of Rs 2,250. The bank is positioned well to grow exponentially after conservatively containing itself in the past with strong low-cost liability franchise and improving asset-quality matrix. The stock currently trades at 3.2x/2.8x its FY2023E/FY2024E core BV.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a 12% miss on PAT at Rs20.7bn, mainly due to an MTM hit on treasury (Rs8.5bn) and higher opex due to higher investments/business-related expenses, partly offset by lower provisions as the bank continues to draw down contingent provisions as it gains more confidence on the asset-quality front. The bank continued to clock strong credit growth - up 29% yoy/3% qoq, mainly led by mortgages, unsecured loans and vehicle loans. SA growth was lower at 6% yoy, prompting it to raise SA rates, reversing earlier stance to stay put. But, the bank surprised positively on margins - up 14bps qoq to 4.9% on better LDR/sharp drop in borrowings. Higher slippages, at Rs14.4bn/2.6% of loans, were mainly due to the change in RBI norms on out-of-order a/cs, of which >50% (Rs7.8bn) was upgraded in Q1 itself, leading to a 10bps contraction in GNPA to 2.2%. Management remains confident about asset quality and expects the LLP to remain low in FY23, including consumption of Covid provisions.

Outlook

We expect the bank to deliver 2-2.1% RoA on the back of accelerating growth and lower LLP, with RoE of around 13-14% over FY23-25E due to its elevated capital levels. Retain Buy with a TP of Rs2,180 based on standalone P/ABV of 3.5x Jun’24E ABV and subsidiaries’ value of Rs620 per share. Retain Buy.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB saw a steady quarter with good core earnings (5% beat) mainly led by better asset quality resulting in lower provisions while core PPoP came in as expected. Stronger recoveries reduced stress ratio QoQ, leading to lower provisions. Credit flow in Q1FY23 was entirely driven by retail attributable to healthy accretion in mortgage and PL/CC. Corporate growth was muted due to intense competition. Hence incremental focus would be on higher yielding retail which may keep opex elevated. On liabilities, the bank is comfortable with a LDR of 90% suggesting that additional asset growth would be funded by deposits. Higher SA rate differential of 50bps to peers could protect NIM given rising yields.

Outlook

We like Kotak Bank owing to strong underwriting and balance sheet strength, although valuation is expensive to upgrade the stock. We retain ‘ACCUMULATE’ with SOTP based TP of Rs1,950.

The market had a strong week ended July 22, closing at more than two-and-a-half-month high with over 4 percent gains on the back of positive global trend, renewed buying interest at the FII desk, and easing commodity prices, including oil. After breaking out at the 16,000 levels, the Nifty50 did not look back, and crossed the 200-day exponential moving average of 16,521 in the middle of week, which also sustained in the later part of last week.

The index closed at 16,719.5 on Friday, the highest closing level since May 2, and has been making higher high higher low formation from the last five weeks on the daily charts, with bullish candlestick pattern formation on the daily as well weekly charts, while on the monthly charts, there was Bullish Engulfing kind of pattern formation.

The index has taken a support around its 30-31 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of up-move (from Covid lows to all-time high), which was placed at Rs 15,183 and since then it has seen upward move, barring intermittent correction.

Oscillators on the higher time frames indicated the sentiments are positive, but the lower timeframes (one hour and below) indicated negative sentiments which can be a sign of overbought and hence some setback can't be ruled out, especially after a 4 percent run-up last week and 10 percent rally from June lows, experts said.

On the levels, the next resistance for the index may be at 16,794, (the previous swing high point on June 3), followed by 16,946 and then 17,050 (200 days SMA), while the breakaway gap of 16,360-16,490 created during the last week can be act as a crucial support area, experts said.

""Going ahead, any decline towards this support is likely to get bought into. On the higher side, the recent swing high of 16,793 is very much within a touching distance now and soon we would see the benchmark index surpassing this as well. Slowly but steadily, we would see it eyeing its '200-SMA' (simple moving average) zone of 16,900 – 17,050 which would certainly be a sigh of relief for market participants,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.

He further said that although the undertone remains bullish, it's important to understand that the low hanging fruit is already gone and hence, it's advisable not to become too complacent; rather better to take one step at a time for a while.

A lot of thematic moves started doing well last week and hence, the pragmatic approach would be to focus on such potential movers which are likely to provide better trading opportunities, the market expert advised.

Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the July 22 closing prices:

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

L&T Finance Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 72.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 69.8 | Target: Rs 78 | Return: 8 percent

After a short term correction, the stock has formed higher bottom formation. From last couple of weeks, the stock is hovering between Rs 70 to Rs 74 price ranges. However, the short term texture of the stock is still in to the positive side.

We are of the view that, as long as the stock is trading above 20 days SMA (simple moving average) Rs 70.50, the uptrend wave is likely to continue. Above which it could hit the level of Rs 78. Further upside may also continue which could lift the stock up to Rs 80.

PVR: Buy | LTP: Rs 1939.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,870 | Target: Rs 2,070 | Return: 7 percent

In this month so far, the stock rallied over 5 percent. After a promising uptrend rally, the stock consistently taking support near Rs 1,875 level.

Technically, on daily charts it has formed higher bottom formation and comfortably trading above 20 days SMA (simple moving average). Unless it is trading below Rs 1,870, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 2,070. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 1,935 and Rs 1,900 levels with a stop-loss below Rs 1,870.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,392.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,350 | Target: Rs 1,485 | Return: 7 percent

After a short term correction, the stock took the support near 50 days SMA or Rs 1,350 and bounced back quickly. In the last week, from the weekly lowest level it rallied over 4 percent.

It also formed long bullish candle which suggesting strong possibility of further upside from the current levels. Looking at the overall pattern it offers buying opportunity for the positional traders with a decent risk-reward ratio. The trend reversal move is likely to continue up to Rs 1,485.

Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative & Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities

Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 358.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 340 | Target: Rs 380-400 | Return: 12 percent

The stock price has broken out from the symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart. Short and medium term trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its important moving averages.

Momentum oscillators – RSI (11) and MFI (money flow index - 10) have placed above 60 and sloping upwards, indicating strength in the current uptrend of the stock.

Trend of the stock is positive as it is trading above its important moving averages. Plus DI is trading above Minus DI while ADX line is placed above 25, indicating stock is likely to gather momentum in the coming days.

Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa

Bharat Forge: Buy | LTP: Rs 706.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 682 | Target: Rs 748 | Return: 6 percent

After the recent corrective phase, the stock has recovered gradually from its swing lows and has now given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance on the weekly charts.

The volumes along with the price upmove are rising and the ‘RSI Smoothed’ oscillator is also hinting at a positive momentum.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 706-702 for potential targets of Rs 735 and Rs 748 in the near term. The stop-loss should be placed below Rs 682.

Polyplex Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,367.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,220 | Target: Rs 2,650 | Return: 12 percent

In the recent corrective phase, the stock has managed to hold above its 200-day EMA support and prices have now resumed the positive trend. The volumes along with the prices upmove are good and the momentum indicators are also hinting at a positive momentum.

The 5 days EMA (exponential moving average) has given a positive crossover above the '20 DEMA' which signals a short term uptrend.

Thus, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 2,370-2,360 for potential targets of Rs 2,520 and Rs 2,650 in the near term. The stop-loss for short positions can be placed below Rs 2,220.

Jatin Gohil, Technical & Derivative Analyst at Reliance Securities

JK Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,332.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,135 | Target: Rs 2,720 | Return: 17 percent

After a higher level of reversal, again the stock tested its 50-month EMA and witnessed a smart recovery. In the past, the stock resumed its up-move after testing that moving average.

We believe the history will repeat itself, as the key technical indicators reversed from the oversold zone on medium-term timeframe chart and positively poised.

This could lead the stock towards its point of polarization, which is placed at around Rs 2,720.

Mphasis: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,276.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,065 | Target: Rs 2,700 | Return: 19 percent

Since late-June 2022, the stock oscillated around its 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior up-move (Rs 630-3,660), which was placed at Rs 2,145. On week ended July 22, the stock breached its prior weekly falling trend and bounced.

The key technical indicators are in favour of the bulls on medium-term as well as short-term timeframe charts. On the higher side, the stock may face hurdle around Rs 2,380.

A stable move above that hurdle will take the stock towards Rs 2,475-2,550-2,700 in the short-term. In case of any decline, the stock will find support around its prior swing low, which is placed at around Rs 2,065.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,827.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,760 | Target: Rs 1,925 | Return: 5 percent

The stock is in the strong up-trend, as it again reversed after testing its 38.2 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior up-move (Rs 1,712-1,852). In the past, the stock extended gain after testing that level and moved towards its 100 percent Fibonacci extension mark.

The key technical indicators are positively poised on short-term as well as near-term timeframe charts.

The stock has potential to move towards its 100 percent Fibonacci extension of prior up-move, which is placed at around Rs 1,925. On the lower side, the stock will find support around Rs 1,760, where its 20-day and 50-day EMAs are placed.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank on July 23 reported its April-June net profit at Rs 2,071 crore, up 26 per cent year-on-year (YoY), aided by higher loan growth and lower provisions. Here are the top five key takeaways from the bank’s Q1 earnings:

Healthy loan growth

As on June 30, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s total advances stood at Rs 2.80 lakh crore, up 29 percent YoY and three percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ).

Home loans and loans against property (LAP), accounting for Rs 80,975 crore of loans, grew 46 percent YoY and six percent QoQ respectively while corporate banking loans grew 11 per cent on year to Rs 66,633 crore. On a sequential basis, corporate loans were lower by 0.1 per cent.

Microfinance loans stood at Rs 3,650 crore as on June 30, registering over 100 percent YoY growth owing to lower base. Credit cards loans, meanwhile, grew 77 percent on year to Rs 6,819 crore as on June 30.

Deposits growth stable

While assets rose faster, deposits registered 10 percent YoY growth to stand at Rs 3.16 lakh crore as on June 30. On a sequential basis, total deposits rose 1.5 percent.

The bank’s low-cost, current account and savings account ratio (CASA) lowered to 58.1 percent as on June end from 60.2 percent a year ago.

Net interest income (NII), or the difference between interest earned and expended, rose Rs 4,697 crore, up 19 percent YoY. Net interest margin (NIM) was 4.92 percent during April-June, higher than 4.60 percent a year earlier.

Asset quality stable

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio improved to 2.24 percent as on June end from 3.56 percent a year ago and 2.34 percent a quarter ago.

The net NPAs stood at 0.62 percent as on June end, two basis points (bps) lower than March end.

Recoveries and upgrades during the quarter ended June stood at Rs 1,295 crore, while the provision coverage ratio stood at 72.6 percent, lower than 73.2 percent a quarter ago.

Other income falls

During April-June, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s consolidated other income fell to Rs 2,494.6 crore as against Rs 4,528.8 crore a year ago and Rs 7,960.1 crore a quarter ago.

This was on account of the bank reporting a loss of Rs 1,656.54 crore on sale of investments including revaluation in insurance business.

Banks’ other income includes non-fund-based income such as commission from guarantees, letters of credit, financial advisory fees, selling of third-party products, and earnings from foreign exchange transactions, among others.

Capital ratios stable

As on June end, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s capital adequacy ratio (CRAR) stood stable at 22.15 percent while common-equity tier-I (CET-I) ratio stood at 21 percent. The lender’s CRAR was lower than 23.11 percent a year ago and 22.69 percent a quarter ago.",461,0.3869864419102669

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank on July 22 reported a 26 percent year-on-year growth in standalone net profit at Rs 2,071 crore for the quarter ended June 2022, supported by lower provisions, with improvement in asset quality performance.

A Moneycontrol poll of seven brokerages showed that the net profit was expected to rise 32 percent to Rs 2,176 crore.

Provisions and contingencies declined by a massive 97 percent year-on-year to Rs 23.59 crore at the end of June quarter compared to Rs 703.52 crore in the corresponding quarter of previous fiscal.

The fall in provisions stems from the improvement in asset quality metrics. During the quarter, the bank wrote back Rs 65 crore worth of provisions it had made specifically towards pandemic related risks. Gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances fell by 10 bps sequentially to 2.24 percent and net NPAs declined by 2 bps to 0.62 percent in Q1FY23. Gross bad loans a year ago were 3.58 percent of the loan book.

Incremental stress has also remained low for the bank. Fresh slippages totaled Rs 654 crore on a net basis compared with 736 crore the previous quarter. What's more is that the bank was able to make higher recoveries and upgrades as well. These rose to Rs 1295 crore for the June quarter compared with Rs 897 crore in the preceding quarter.

The bank's core interest income also showed healthy traction.

Net interest income, which is a difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew by 19.16 percent to Rs 4,697 crore compared to same period last year, with 29 percent YoY growth in loan book.

Surprisingly, loan growth was driven by unsecured personal loans, credit cards, consumer durable loans and business loans, both on a year-on-year basis and sequentially. Kotak Mahindra Bank has been a conservative lender in the past but it seems to have shed this for the June quarter.

Credit cards expanded 77 percent from a year ago and showed the highest sequential growth of 22 percent among loan categories. Personal loans, business loans and consumer durables showed a year-on-year growth of 77 percent and healthy sequential expansion of 15 percent. The share of unsecured retail advances has increased to 7.9 percent from 5.6 percent a year back. The bank's corporate loan book also showed a growth after contracting in the previous quarter.

An expansion of net interest margin to 4.92 percent also helped support core interest income. NIM was supported by healthy low cost deposit pile as current account and savings account (CASA) formed 58 percent of total deposits. That said, CASA growth was a modest 8 percent.

While the bank delivered on asset quality and core income as per street expectations, its operating performance fell short. Operating profit was down 16.6 percent from a year ago to Rs 2,783 crore, weighed by high operating expenses and a mark-to-market hit on the bank's investment portfolio. These two overshadowed the strong core interest income growth during the quarter for the bank.

Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a mark-to-market hit of Rs 857 crore for the June quarter. This dragged non-interest income down 31 percent despite resilient fee income growth.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank is likely to report robust profitability on the back of stable asset quality but loan growth is likely to be modest.

The bank is likely to report 32.5 percent year-on-year growth in net profit to Rs 2,176 crore for the quarter ended June, the average of the estimates of seven brokerages surveyed by Moneycontrol showed.

Most analysts expect the bank to report stable asset quality as fresh delinquencies are expected to be flat. Jefferies India Pvt Ltd expects the annualised delinquency ratio to come down to 1.7 percent for Q1FY23 from 2.9 percent a year ago. Gross bad loans as a percentage of loan book may remain low and adequate provisions would give additional support. Kotak Mahindra Bank has been conservative in its lending and that is expected to show in strong asset quality metrics.

The flipside of conservative lending practices is moderate loan growth. Most banks have indicated that loan growth has quickened and large lenders are going aggressive in disbursements, both corporate and retail. Analysts expect Kotak Mahindra Bank to show restraint even now although loan growth is likely to be higher than previous quarters. As such, a base effect would mean an additional boost in year-on-year loan growth rate. “Growth momentum in mortgages remains strong, but CV is lacklustre,” noted analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a report. The private sector lender’s loan disbursements may show robust growth on a sequential basis.

Loan growth would support a double-digit growth in net interest income and an improvement in net interest margin would also lend a hand. “NII is expected to grow by 18% led by healthy loan growth, as the management’s focus has shifted to advance growth,” analysts at Ashika Institutional Equity Research wrote in a note.

Other income is expected to be impacted owing to pressure on treasury income. Rise in bond yields during the quarter is likely to have resulted in mark-to-market losses which would have hit treasury income. That said, core fee income is expected to show traction. “Sequential fee income growth would be healthy due to a bounce-back in payments-related fees somewhat offsetting seasonal sluggishness. Treasury income would be weak but this would move this needle less, relatively speaking, since treasury income is a relatively small part of total non-interest income for the bank,” analysts at Yes Securities Ltd said in a report.

Inflation is the new buzzword across global financial markets. Central banks across the world are grappling with high price pressures and walking a tightrope in terms of managing growth-inflation dynamics. US inflation, particularly, has been a cause of worry for the Federal Reserve. With inflation there spiking to a four-decade high of 9.1 percent in June, the odds of the Fed raising rates by 100 basis points (bps) at this month’s meeting have risen. With global central bankers aggressively tightening rates, the actions of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) monetary policy committee (MPC) will largely depend on how hard a line the Fed would take.

In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Kotak Mahindra Bank’s chief economist Upasna Bhardwaj said the aggressive rate action by the Fed and other global central banks may prompt the MPC to hike the policy rate by 50 bps at its August policy meeting. Domestic inflationary pressures are unlikely to subside soon, with the headline print likely to stay around 7 percent for the next few months, she said. Further, India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth is likely to be weighed down by hardening financial conditions, Bhardwaj added.

Edited excerpts.

Have we seen the peak of India’s inflation or do you anticipate further price pressures?

April’s reading was probably the peak of inflation. But we have to keep in mind that inflation will remain significantly higher than the RBI’s threshold of 6 percent for the next few months. In fact, the next few inflation readings will be around the 7 percent handle, plus/minus 10 basis points. So, while inflation may have peaked, the moderation of inflation is likely to be very gradual. I don’t see the possibility of a sub-6 percent reading before December 2022. That, too, will depend on a lot of domestic and global factors. In the current scenario, at least for the next two quarters, we see the headline inflation reading above 6 percent.

What is your inflation forecast for FY23?

Inflation forecast for FY23 is 6.5 percent. In the June policy, the RBI projected inflation at 7.5 percent and 7.4 percent in April-June and July-September, respectively. There itself we felt that the RBI was on the higher side. In the June quarter, we saw that inflation was 20 basis points lower than the RBI’s forecast. Even in the July-September quarter, inflation will be about 25-35 bps lower than RBI’s estimates. That, in itself, should bring down headline average inflation for FY23 than what was projected by the RBI in June.

On the positive side, there has been a decline in commodity prices globally and a correction in crude oil prices to around $100 per barrel. While this provides some respite, it has to be assessed against the backdrop of a consistently weakening currency. Benefits of lower commodity prices will be partly offset by a weakening currency. However, there is a lot of uncertainty to these estimates.

What is the trajectory of food inflation?

Food prices seem to be stabilising and some components are on the softer side. Some correction is seen in prices of fruits and vegetables as well as pulses. Globally, too, food inflation is on the softer side. In the absolute near term, food inflation appears to be in check. But certain components like cereals, meat, fish prices will see some upward pressure.

How do you assess core inflation at this stage?

Core inflation is expected to remain sticky and elevated. For most of this year, we see core inflation in the 5.5 percent to 6 percent range. However, the MPC will be looking more at the headline inflation while framing policy.

With inflation being the top priority for MPC currently, what is your expectation from the August policy?

With the US June CPI having recorded a 40-year high of 9.1 percent, the probability of a 75 bps Fed rate hike seems to be a given—while not entirely ruling out 100 bps—especially as the Bank of Canada goes all-in with a frontloaded 100 bps hike. Global aggressive frontloaded actions may prompt a 50 bps hike by the MPC in the August policy. The MPC’s actions will largely depend on how aggressive the Fed’s actions would be.

Where will the repo rate be at the end of this cycle?

For this year, we are looking at additional 85 bps of repo rate hikes and that should happen back-to-back in the coming policies. Cumulatively, we expect the repo rate to be at 5.75 percent by December 2022.

The global situation is quite adverse, with recessionary concerns in the US clouding risk sentiments. Despite that, the Fed’s rhetoric has pointed towards a need for continued rate hikes to manage and anchor inflation expectations. In this context, I think frontloaded policy rate hikes by the MPC is necessary, not just to anchor inflationary expectations but also to manage financial market stability. We cannot afford to narrow the interest rate differential in order to avoid any instability in financial markets.

What is your growth forecast for FY23 against the backdrop of expected repo rate hikes?

Our estimate for FY23 GDP growth stands at 7.3 percent. While exports and consumer demand may be the laggards, government spending and early signs of private capex may offset the adverse shocks to the Indian economy. We need to keep in mind that the first-quarter growth numbers will come on the back of a very favourable base effect. After that, second quarter onwards, the underlying GDP growth momentum will be very tepid, in the 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent band.

Do you expect the RBI’s desperate catch-up act on inflation to hurt the economy?

The interest rate is a blunt tool to manage the supply-side inflation. However, the frontloaded rate hikes can help curb demand-side price pressures to manage capacity constraints. We expect growth to be weighed down by hardening financial conditions and, hence, the weak underlying growth momentum will show up in the data with a lag.

How relevant is the monetary policy stance at this stage?

The RBI has already tweaked the language in its policy stating that there is a focus on withdrawal of accommodation. The fact is that liquidity is still reasonably in surplus, although lower than the peaks witnessed a year back, and shorter end of the curve too remains relatively low. I think as monetary tightening picks up pace, the stance henceforth is immaterial. The policy stance and the liquidity stance has to align with the MPC’s objective to bring the weighted average call rate to the repo rate.

Any timeline by when the overnight call rate aligns with the repo rate?

We have seen a considerable reduction in the banking system liquidity surplus. However, the government’s cash balances are still fairly robust at around Rs 3 lakh crore. This will continue in the current quarter. Till the liquidity remains in surplus, the call rate will remain where it is, slightly below the SDF (standing deposit facility) rate.

Going into the next quarter, the currency leakage will pick up but that will be offset by increased government spending. To that extent, my sense is that liquidity will remain in the range of 1 to 1.5 percent of NDTL (net demand and time liabilities), which the RBI will be comfortable with. The weighted average call rate should move towards the repo rate by the end of FY23. We will need liquidity to shift in the neutral to negative zone for the weighted average call rate to move towards the repo rate. By the end of the year, we should see liquidity moderate towards neutrality.

So, will bond and dollar sales be the primary liquidity absorption measures along with the SDF?

Yes, at this point I think that FX (foreign exchange) sales will be more used as the primary liquidity absorption tools OMO (open market operations) sales will be limited as they could disrupt the bond market. They will be done on an ad-hoc basis.

The rupee continues to weaken despite the RBI’s measures to attract more foreign deposits. How much more pain do you foresee for the currency?

The recent measures are more at the margin; it is difficult to quantify inflows that these could bring at this stage. There could be some amount of foreign inflows that could come into corporate bonds and government securities in the shorter end of the curve if the forward premia were to fall sharply. FCNR(B) deposit rates could now be nearly at par with global rates. However, it will not materially move the needle because overall the sentiment remains weak.

In 2013, when the RBI announced the fixed swap window, banks were sufficiently incentivised. If this is put in place going forward, we may see aggressive flows and the impact on the rupee will be much higher.

Also read: RBI measures unlikely to bring hefty forex inflows, may not help rupee much: Experts

So, will the depreciating pressure on the rupee continue?

The measures don’t change the fundamental outlook for the rupee. The rupee will continue to weaken. The current account deficit is widening and there is uncertainty whether the current correction in crude oil prices will be sustainable. Apart from oil, the global risk-off is quite a dampener for the rupee as FPI (foreign portfolio investor) outflows refuse to abate. A widening current account deficit and consistent foreign outflows will continue to be a double whammy for the rupee and the depreciation bias will continue.

The RBI has enough ammunition to control the movement in the rupee and, hence, we don’t expect a runaway depreciation. The rupee will move with limited volatility and will slowly drift lower, tracking global cues. The rupee should broadly trade in the 79 to 81 band through the rest of the year, with risks skewed on the downside.

How effective will the rupee trade settlement be in reducing the widening current account deficit?

This measure is largely to facilitate trade settlement between countries like Russia, Iran and Sri Lanka; apart from that, it does not change anything significantly. We expect the current account deficit to remain reasonably elevated at 3 percent of GDP for FY23.

Coming to the bond market, do you think the RBI will be comfortable with the current levels of bond yields?

Globally, conditions are adverse. We have to see how the interplay of high US Treasury yields and elevated commodity prices, although melting down recently, play out for the bond market. Domestically, supply concerns will be key for the bond market. The RBI will clearly not be able to support the market through outright OMO purchases. Supply concerns, domestic monetary tightening and hardening global yields will drift the bond yields higher.

What can the RBI do to cool bond yields?

Operation Twists and ad hoc OMO purchases along with verbal intervention could be the way to ensure that the longer end of the yield curve remains well anchored. The 10-year yield, which earlier had the potential of moving above 7.75 percent due to adverse global and domestic conditions, will probably stay around 7.50 percent—plus/minus 15 bps—for most of FY23.",1856,-0.8926624953746796

Kotak Mahindra Bank announced on July 8 that it had acquired the agriculture and healthcare equipment financing portfolio of De Lage Landen Financial Services India Private Limited (DLL India), a subsidiary of De Lage Landen International BV, owned by Rabobank.

The operations of the acquired portfolio will be transitioned to Kotak Mahindra Bank in a planned manner over the next few months, the companies said in an exchange filing, adding that until it is done, the portfolio will continue to be managed by DLL India.

With this acquisition, Kotak will gain access to over 25,000 high-quality customers with a total standard loan outstanding of around Rs 582 crore. Notably, apart from the standard loans portfolio, Kotak Mahindra Bank has also acquired the non-performing assets portfolio with a total loan outstanding of around Rs 69 crore.

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s acquisition of DLL India’s Agri and Healthcare Equipment portfolio reiterates our continued commitment towards a strong presence in this space and gives us access to a high-quality customer base. We welcome DLL India customers to Kotak Bank and assure them that they will experience a seamless transition and enhanced customer experience.”

Abhishek Mudgal, Country Manager, DLL India, said, “In the last 9 years of our operations in India, with our proficient services of global standards, we were able to establish an excellent quality customer base in India. We are immensely glad that we are transferring our outstanding portfolio and customer base in India in the capable and experienced hands of Kotak Mahindra Bank, who we believe will fully support our philosophy of delivering sustainable financial solutions and high-quality services to the customers.

Kotak Mahindra Bank ranks 13th most-valued firm in India with an MCap of $42 billion.

Goldman Sachs says the key driver for Kotak will be its beneficial position in a rising interest rate environment; sustainable loan growth at a 20 percent CAGR on utilisation of excess capital and realisation of the operating leverage aided by its digital platform (811); pre-provision operating profit-return on assets (PPOP-ROA); and limited dilution risk as promoter’s stake at RBI limits, leading to an improvement in ROEs of 200bps in FY22-25.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has unanimously decided to hike the repo rate by 50 basis points (bps) to 4.9 percent as inflation is likely to be above 6 percent till December 2022 given global growth risks and geopolitical tensions. The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target range, while supporting growth.

After the repo rate hike, the standing deposit facility (SDF) rate stands adjusted to 4.65 percent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the bank rate to 5.15 percent, but the MPC has decided to keep cash reserve ratio (CRR) unchanged at 4.5 percent.

“The supply-side measures taken by the government would help to alleviate some cost-push pressures. At the same time, however, the MPC notes that continuing shocks to food inflation could sustain pressures on headline inflation. Persisting inflationary pressures could set in motion second-round effects on headline CPI (Consumer Price Index). Hence, there is a need for calibrated monetary policy action to keep inflation expectations anchored and restrain the broadening of price pressures,” the RBI said in its note.

The central bank raised its full year FY23 inflation forecast to 6.7 percent, from 5.7 percent earlier, as the tense global geopolitical situation and the consequent elevated commodity prices impart considerable uncertainty to the domestic inflation outlook. While considering the inflation forecast, the RBI hopes for a normal monsoon in 2022 and an average crude oil price (Indian basket) of $105 per barrel.

“The MPC increased its CPI estimates to 6.7 percent from 5.7 percent for FY23, which now appears to be a more realistic level. This contributes to enhanced credibility and confidence in the RBI’s policy decisions. The status quo on CRR certainly comes as a positive surprise for the banking sector and augurs well to nurture credit growth revival,” said Yesha Shah, head of equity research at Samco Securities.

Overall, as the repo rate still has some catching up to do compared to global peers, this policy seems to be in the right direction to achieve governor Shaktikanta Das’ aim to bring back the policy rates to at-least pre-Covid levels, she believes.

The RBI expects further input and output price pressures considering early results from manufacturing, services and infrastructure sector firms polled in the its surveys, but it has retained real GDP growth projection for FY23 at 7.2 percent, though spillovers from prolonged geopolitical tensions, elevated commodity prices, continued supply bottlenecks and tightening global financial conditions weighed on the outlook.

“The recovery in domestic economic activity is gathering strength. Rural consumption should benefit from the likely normal southwest monsoon and the expected improvement in agricultural prospects. A rebound in contact-intensive services is likely to bolster urban consumption, going forward,” the central bank reasoned.

Investment activity is expected to be supported by improving capacity utilisation, the government’s capex push, and strengthening bank credit, the RBI said.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB’s Q4 earnings of Rs26.9bn (PLe: Rs17.3bn) were higher led by healthy loan growth of 21% YoY, solid fee income accretion, and provision write back. Margins were a tad better (+16bps QoQ) led by higher CASA share. Driven by better collections overall asset quality improved QoQ. COVID provisions are ~20bps and restructuring at 44bps is lower to peers. On rate hike and inflation, the company suggested that while the situation is evolving, as of now it seems credit growth may not be materially impacted although a higher secured pool can offer a good inflation hedge. Also, in-line with our stance, it indicated that in short term there could be a positive impact on NIM for banks having a higher share of short term assets. However, margin impact in medium term would be tough to ascertain as it will depend on various factors. For KMB 48% of the loans are linked to EBLR (in-line with peers) which may safeguard NIM while the lower unsecured pool may protect asset quality.

Outlook

KMB is focused on building up sticky liabilities led by asset growth driven by healthy customer acquisition although tech investments would continue which may keep opex a bit elevated. We like Kotak Bank owing to solid credit practices and balance sheet management, although valuations are steep to upgrade the stock. We retain ‘ACCUMULATE’ with SOTP based TP of Rs1,925.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Bank reported a strong 35% beat on PAT at Rs27.7bn, mainly led by sustained strong delivery on growth/margins, fees and contingent provision drawdown as it gains more confidence on the asset quality front. However, opex remained elevated to support strong business volume and future investment in tech (7.5% of opex). KMB continued to surprise positively on credit growth, up 21% yoy/7% qoq on the back of strong traction in mortgages and unsecured loans (albeit on low base). It expects to sustain strong credit growth and believes that a higher CASA ratio (61%) and a floating rate book (70%) should support its healthy margin trajectory in a rising rate cycle. KMB rejigged its board, with Gaurang Shah (ED) being moved out of the bank and elevated as Chairman of Kotak General Insurance. KVS Manian (age 60 yrs) has been reappointed as ED, while consumer banking head Shanti Ekambaram (59 yrs) has been elevated as ED, which we believe hints at a potential top management change, including MD & CEO Uday Kotak and DMD Dipak Gupta in Dec’23.

Outlook

We revise our earnings estimates for FY23 by 4% but largely retain FY24 estimates. We expect the bank to deliver 2-2.1% RoA, but RoE would remain moderate at 13-14% due to its elevated capital levels. Factoring in higher CoE and moderate sustainable RoE of 14%, we lower our TP to Rs2,180 (vs. Rs2,300) based on standalone P/ABV of 3.5x vs. earlier 4x. We value subsidiaries at Rs620 per share. Retain Buy.

Uday Kotak, ace banker and chief of Kotak Mahindra Bank, is a happy man. Over the quarters, the bank’s asset quality has improved significantly. After the pandemic, the bank is now back to high loan growth and strong balance sheet as surplus liquidity makes inorganic opportunities appealing for the banker at this point.

In an interaction on 5 May, Kotak spoke about the trends in asset quality and loan business, his vision for the bank and the opportunities in India’s booming financial services space.

Edited excerpts:

The RBI rate hike surprised markets. What are your thoughts on the timing and impact of the rate hike?

The wolf of inflation is firmly back and the future is here and future is now. It was pretty clear that the wolf of inflation is getting more entrenched. And therefore, there was clearly a need to move. And I compliment the RBI for having the courage to take this call between policies and during market hours. Because normally if you go back through the history of RBI policy, it is normally been not during market hours. So they made it a point to have it during market hours, we've had intra-meeting moves. So that is also an important point during market hours. Therefore, I read this as a very strong message by the RBI that they're taking the point on inflation and inflationary expectations seriously, and you cannot allow the wolf to get deep in and then it becomes that much tougher to get the wolf out.

What’s your take on the course of interest rates?

I think we were at historically low interest rates. We expected interest rates to go up. Assuming inflation as per RBI’s estimates in the fourth quarter comes at 5.1 percent, to move to zero real interest rates, we need at least 100 basis point hike in the current fiscal. If inflation data changes and the inflation data thereafter has been adverse, if the repo rate hikes will be at least 100 basis points in total, it could be more.

How do you see the banking industry responding to the recent rate hike by the RBI?

Whatever the banks have as their fixed rate loans they remain what they are. For the new fixed rate loans, the bank will reprice on the fixed rate basis. The second is of course MCLR-based (marginal cost of funds based lending rate) floating rate loans. So, there is an RBI formula for MCLR which each bank has, so banks have to relook at their MCLR every month. So if you notice in the last few months MCLR has already started moving up. So, as these RBI rates get priced into deposit rates, you will see MCLR against loans getting gradually repriced.

The third is market benchmark rate loans, particularly entire retail lending was market benchmark. So also it could be on the wholesale lending side. So within that, I think most banks have categories of benchmarking markets. The bulk of the benchmarking was repo rate. For the last one year, one and a half years, repo rate was fixed, therefore, those market benchmark repo rates were not changing. Now with today's increase those market benchmark rates linked to repo rates will get repriced.

The second benchmark which some of the banks were using was treasury bills that will depend on the market price of treasury bills and accordingly move with that.

Can you comment from Kotak’s point of view?

As far as Kotak is concerned, our book is the largest in repo rate benchmark followed by MCLR rate benchmark and we have the smallest fixed rate. So, for us to be able to pass on appropriately based on our pricing is fair and reasonable.

Some fear rate hike will dampen consumer demand...

Consumer demand will be more affected by macro factors, which is broader inflation, the levels of salary increases they get, the discretionary surpluses they had, how much of their money is getting used for non-discretionary items like food and other things. So, those will have a bigger impact -- interest rates in the early stage will not disproportionately impact but as they rise, they start impacting; the most obvious area we have to look at is home loans. Because in early stages, financial institutions will increase the duration of the loan but there will come a time when you say that now instalment starts going up.

Are you bullish on loan growth targets?

We have got the accelerator on loan growth. And positively for us, all of our book is floating rate and the ability to transmit interest rates, as central bank increases, is very much inherent in our loan book -- we believe that our growth momentum on loans will continue. And we manage risk very well not only for your credit quality, but also our asset liability matching, cost of funds. And our treasury book is at a very, very low duration of around 1.2 years. So we are getting into this period of high interest rates, very well prepared as we go forward.

With RBI hiking rates, where do you see NIMs (net interest margin) headed?

If you look at our NIMs, we have always had hikes. And that's because, number one, our mix of retail is higher than wholesale in our total growth. And that helps in getting better NIMs. But these NIMs are high, also reflecting on a significant advantage of cost of funds. And when your CASA (current account savings account) ratio is 60 percent plus it has a significant positive impact on cost of funds. And we are entering into the new world of interest rates going up with a very high CASA ratio. Now, as you know, these rates on CASA do not change as fast as regular deposit rates, therefore, if 60 percent of my deposit base is CASA that's a very stable cost of funds base and I have always believed that low cost and stable liability franchise is the core to a sustainable bank.

Are you looking at any inorganic opportunities?

I think if you look at last year, we didn't do anything big, but we did a lot of things. Volkswagen Finance decided to exit its business in India. And we bought out the entire portfolio Volkswagen Finance, the same thing we did with Ford, who again decided to exit the cars and the car finance business in India. So we again, acquired their finance portfolio. We also made a financial investment in a company called KFin Tech, which was 9.9 percent investment.

And let me assure you with the way we are positioned on our balance sheet, we continue to be very open. We are looking at the opportunity. And I actually feel that in the last two years, thanks to a huge amount of liquidity which central banks globally created, actually it’s a little bit like a high tide that makes everybody look comfortable. I remember the famous Warren Buffett statement. And it's only when the tide goes down that you really know who is swimming with water. Okay, so I do believe that's the time which we're getting into. So we will keep our eyes and ears open and pencils sharp.

Are you happy with the contribution of subsidiaries to group earnings?

If you look at consolidated profits of Kotak Mahindra Bank, 30 percent or more of our profits come from our subsidiaries. Consolidated profits contribute to a very large part of Kotak’s profits and there are a couple of reasons for that. One is that we own 100 percent of our subsidiaries; none of them is listed. For the shareholders and the consolidated bank, they get the advantage of 100 percent of the profits of these subsidiaries. As a result of this, our percentage of profits coming from non-banking units is significant. Same goes for our NBFC subsidiaries as well. Our consolidated profits are broad-based and not dependent disproportionately only on the bank.

When will the bank start unlocking the value of subsidiaries?

I think the best way of unlocking the value of subsidiaries for any investor who can see through is to buy the holistic piece as one piece, none of our subsidiaries needs capital; we are very well capitalised. We think they are highly value-accretive businesses, which we are in. And there is no need for capital on both on a consolidated basis and standalone basis, we have the highest capital adequacy ratios. We need to be very clear that for sustainable financial institutions, you got to keep on having a business model which grows at speed but is very conservative on capital dilution for a stakeholders.

How’s the asset quality situation?

If you look at the January-March results, our slippages have been extremely controlled. On an annualised basis, our slippages are about 1.08 percent of the total book. On an absolute basis, our gross slippage is about Rs 736 crore. We were a little conservative, especially in the early phase of Covid. Now, the quality of our credit book is extremely nuanced.

Are you now comfortable growing your unsecured retail book?

In our annual report last year, in my letter to the shareholders, I added that we'd be more aggressive on unsecured retail going forward. And what you're seeing in our numbers during the fourth quarter is a reflection of a philosophy - back to the unsecured book - it is a reflection of philosophy that we were extremely low on unsecured.

Now, we have done a significant amount of work on our analytics and our existing customer portfolio. And we are now beginning to mine our existing customer portfolio deeper, and we feel quite confident being able to grow while keeping our credit quality in mind. And keep in mind, our net interest margins are very healthy, therefore, we can take a higher risk and manage returns as we go forward.

Do you think that the bank has adequate provisions?

When you take a call or what you think is adequate provision, you have to look at the internal data. So our internal data tells us that slippages are low and that gave us the confidence that we are more than adequately provided, if you take a call to reduce the provisions or to reduce the COVID provisions because our data is extremely strong.

What is your assessment of the response received for the LIC IPO?

One of the most heartening things to me today was the kind of retail investor response which has come on the first day of the issue. That is extremely heartening. And I think LIC is a very strong brand in the minds of every investor. And I was talking to somebody who was talking about the strength of the LIC brand, ‘agar kisiko insurance policy lena hai,’ they don't say ki humae aap insurance de do, many of them say, “LIC lelo,’ when you have such a strong brand and a national franchise of the scale and size of LIC, I'm actually very happy with the retail investor response.

What is your assessment of inflation in India?

You talk about any of our minds, our expectations on inflation is key for inflation to follow. Therefore, we have to control that. My view is that after 2008, we have not seen the wolf of inflation; we are now seeing it. The wolf is here! I think this rate hike was needed and I am glad that they have acted intra-market and intra-policy.

Was the RBI justified in hiking the repo rate?

We have to move towards positive real interest rates. RBI’s fourth quarter inflation estimate as given in April was 5.1 percent. So, your repo rate has to be higher than that. If inflation is higher, you have to respond to it and acknowledge where you see inflation beyond that.

Will Kotak Mahindra Bank transmit the rate hike to borrowers?

Our fixed rate book for more than one-year loans is around 15 percent. The rest of it is either book within one year or linked to floating rate. So there, rate transmission will happen.

What is the next step for Kotak in terms of acquisitions?

We are consistently looking and we feel that our balance sheet is strong, our positioning is good, our capital adequacy is good, cost of funds is low. We are very open for the right opportunity as we go forward. I have always been a believer that in the last two years with so much of liquidity floating around, asset prices had a wonderful time. So, you really want more realistic asset values for us to be able to take the next big step forward.​",2157,0.8150944880076817

Kotak Mahindra Bank share price rose 2 percent in early trade on May 5, a day after the company reported its March quarter earnings.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank on Wednesday reported a 64.5 percent surge in net profit in the March quarter to Rs 2,767.4 crore on higher net interest income and writeback of provisions, exceeding estimates by a wide margin.

Net interest income in the quarter jumped 17.6 percent to Rs 4,521 crore. Non-interest income rose 21.4% year on year to Rs 1826 crore. Net interest margin (NIM), a key measure of profitability, stood at 4.78%, up 39 basis points (bps) from last year.

The bank has written back Rs 453 crore in Covid provisions, resulting in a provision and contingency write-back of Rs 306 crore in the fourth quarter. In comparison, it had made provisions of Rs 734 crore in the year ago.

Asset quality has improved sequentially, with the bank reporting gross non-performing assets (NPAs), as a percentage of total advances, of 2.34% in the March quarter, down 91 bps a year ago. Net NPA also improved to 0.64% from 1.21% last year same quarter.

In absolute terms, GNPA was down by Rs 956 crore to Rs 6,470 crore, and net NPA was down by Rs 969 crore to Rs 1737 crore in Q4FY22.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after March quarter earnings:

Morgan Stanley

Research firm Morgan Stanley has kept an equal-weight rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank reflecting valuation and relative risk reward. It kept a target of Rs 1,965 per share.

The profit was 19% above estimate on lower credit costs, while core PPoP was in line with estimates. Loan growth acceleration remains on track.

Morgan Stanley sees core PPoP at 22% CAGR over FY22-F24 versus 4% in FY21-22, reported CNBC-TV18.

CLSA

Broking house CLSA has maintained a buy rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,200 per share.

There was strong growth and NIM performance. The asset quality continues to improve, leading to provision reversals.

Liability mobilisation will need to rise significantly to fund loan growth.

The bank can deliver 20% CAGR and guided NIM decline of 10-15 bps will be a positive catalyst, reported CNBC-TV18.

Jefferies

Brokerage firm Jefferies has maintained buy rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target at Rs 2,600 per share.

The profit was above estimates aided by writeback of credit costs & higher other income. The NII growth was healthy & in-line with our estimates with robust asset quality.

CASA growth needs to improve from 12% now. The growth & clarity on succession are the key, reported CNBC-TV18.

Prabhudas Lilladher

KMB’s Q4 earnings of Rs26.9bn (PLe: Rs17.3bn) were higher led by healthy loan growth of 21% YoY, solid fee income accretion, and provision write back.

Margins were a tad better (+16bps QoQ) led by higher CASA share. Driven by better collections overall asset quality improved QoQ. COVID provisions are ~20bps and restructuring at 44bps is lower to peers.

The bank is focused on building up sticky liabilities led by asset growth driven by healthy customer acquisition although tech investments would continue which may keep opex a bit elevated.

We like Kotak Bank owing to solid credit practices and balance sheet management, although valuations are steep to upgrade the stock. We retain ‘ACCUMULATE’ with SOTP based target price of Rs 1,925.

Motilal Oswal

Kotak Mahindra Bank delivered a healthy core operating performance and broad-based loan growth. NIM inched up further sequentially and is at the higher end of the range in recent years.

The bank continues to demonstrate steady progress in building a strong liability franchise, with CASA ratio standing ~61% (highest in the industry).

We maintain our neutral rating with a target price of Rs 2,000/share (3.1x FY24E ABV + Rs 587 for its subsidiaries).

Sharekhan

The bank has higher capital buffers with strong low-cost liability franchise along with lower core credit cost scenario.

We believe the bank is well positioned to benefit from the credit demand cycle with its calibrated growth stance, strong underwriting, assessment capabilities, and healthy digitalisation benefits adding to the moat of its business strength.

Further, we expect its subsidiaries to contribute to consolidated earnings, as they gain scale and market share going forward.

We maintain our buy rating on the stock with an SOTP-based price target of Rs 2,250.

At 09:28 hrs Kotak Mahindra Bank was quoting at Rs 1,809.00, up Rs 32.35, or 1.82 percent on the BSE.

The account aggregator (AA) ecosystem, introduced in September 2021, can ensure better security and stronger protection of banking data while enhancing customers’ experience, say experts. Nine private banks including, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and IndusInd Bank went live on the AA system last year and five public sector banks will join this year.

The AA network is a financial data-sharing system regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). One of its main features is that data cannot be shared without the consent of the individual concerned.

The finance ministry in the first week of September 2021 said eight of India’s largest banks had introduced the system, even though its concept was approved by the RBI in 2016 itself.

Better user experience

The government when introducing it said the AA system was aimed at helping individuals securely and digitally access the information they have with a financial institution as well as share this information with any other regulated financial institution within the AA network. Banks that have implemented the system say the network has been built with the customer at the center. It empowers customers to effectively manage their data.

“They have the power to decide with whom their data can be shared, for what purpose it can be used, and for what duration it can be retained,” said Deepak Sharma, president and chief digital officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank.

At its launch, the government said the AA system replaces the complex ‘terms and conditions’ form of ‘blank cheque’ acceptance with granular, step-by-step permissions and control each time the customer’s data is used.

“In a regular scenario, there is significant effort involved, wherein the customer has to share their banking data with another bank/financial institution using hard copies or PDF documents. However, with the AA framework, it is very easy for customers to share information either one time or on an ongoing basis for a defined period of time,” said Sameer Shetty, president, and head, of digital business and transformation, Axis Bank.

Moreover, as pointed out by various lenders, the system makes things easier for customers, eliminating duplication and paperwork to offer seamless information to banks.

“The ease of on-boarding and managing consent by customers will ensure large-scale adoption in every nook and corner of the country,” said Murali Ramakrishnan, MD and CEO, South Indian Bank.

Enhanced encryption of users’ data

The system aims to create a third-party trusted source of information that allows seamless data flow between all players, say experts. “In various cases, once customers’ data is shared with a bank for one purpose, it gets circulated among other departments too. For example, if a customer shares her/his data for a housing loan, it might happen that the vehicle loan department may get access to it. But the AA system prohibits that,” said Nageen Kommu, founder and CEO, Digitap, a tech company providing AI-driven solutions for the banking industry.

Customers can choose which department their data will be shared with and the system minimises the chance of data sharing even within various departments of the same bank. “The system enables customers to offer authentic information in a controlled and managed environment to all the players in the ecosystem, including banks,” said Kunal Jhunjhunwala, founder and MD, Airpay, a payment gateway for banks.

It helps customers take real-time lending decisions in multi-bank personal finance management (PFM) and maintain a consolidated financial dashboard while also enabling wealth assessment and planning, all the while ensuring encryption.

“AA handles the consent management part on behalf of the customer and the data is exchanged only between financial information users (FIU) and financial information providers ensuring that only the right FIU receives the data,” said Sharma.

The privacy aspect is well taken care of by the regulator requiring customer consent. This can pave the road to full-fledged open banking in India going forward, according to Ramakrishnan.

What next?

Although widely accepted in the banking sector, several experts asserted that there is still room for improvement for the system. Banks already part of the AA system said more banks joining it will strengthen it further. “In future, the addition of GST (goods and services tax), PF (provident fund) and utility bills information in the AA framework will make it truly transformational,” added Shetty.",773,0.9417463958263397

“The view is that post-COVID the economy is coming back. At this stage, there was concern in the immediate aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine conflict of oil going out of control. It doesn’t seem to be. Yes, it’s still high at $100 plus but the mood is cautiously optimistic,” the country’s leading banker said.

“I was very enthused by the (RBI) governor’s extremely positive approach to the future of the Indian economy,” he added.

When asked about his expectations of the rate trajectory, Kotak said there should be a differentiation between developed markets and India. In the US, there was 0 percent interest rates until recently, he said, while the inflation was 7.5 percent.

“The gap between the interest rate and the inflation was just too high and, they were very much behind the curve,” Kotak said.

On the other hand, in India, the difference between the projected inflation and the repo rate is low.

“We are not so much out of line compared to the levels of inflation,” he added. “The path we, in India, need to traverse is a smaller move compared to what the developed markets have to.”

To a question about the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, Kotak said it was a trade-off of whether the rate hike would come in April or in June.

“The question is: do they first move with the reverse repo and narrow the corridor? Or, what is de facto, which is through the VRRR they’ve already got the overnight rates closer to the repo rate?” he said. Kotak was referring to variable rate reverse repo auction which has emerged as the main liquidity management tool.

Billionaire banker Uday Kotak on Sunday highlighted how geography is an important factor when it comes to wars and stressed on the need to be ""atmanirbhar"" or self sufficient when it comes to the country's resources, especially for its military needs.

He was referring to India's dependence on Russia for its defence equipment. ""Ukraine Russia conflict highlights that geography matters. For India, with China on one side and Pakistan on the other, both nuclear enabled, our dependence on Russian military equipment, and US far away, we have challenges,"" the CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank tweeted.

Russia is India's biggest supplier of defence weapons.

Last December, India and Russia inked four defence pacts and resolve to expand military ties. The allies inked an agreement for joint production of over six lakh AK-203 assault rifles at a manufacturing facility in Uttar Pradesh’s Amethi besides firming up another pact on military cooperation for 10 years. The rifles will be manufactured for the Indian armed forces at a cost of around Rs 5000 crore.

Highlighting the dependency on Russian military equipment, Uday Kotak tweeted, ""One thing this war teaches for sure: be atmanirbhar!""

This is the first time that Kotak chose to speak up about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but being ""atmanirbhar"" has been one of his core interests. After the announcement of Union Budget 2022 earlier this month, Kotak tweeted that it was a trust-based governance to make India self sufficient.



Budget: trust based governance to build atmanirbhar bharat. Reposes faith in taxpayers, entrepreneurs, investors. Build an open, digital and inclusive India with a 25 year vision. I am proud to be Indian.

— Uday Kotak (@udaykotak) February 1, 2022

Kotak's tweet resonated with a number of Twitter users. Global market watcher Sanjay Dutt tweeted, ""The biggest story for investors, ordinary citizens and the government is the atmanirbhar push. India infra and manufacturing creates jobs, wealth, improves standard of living and most importantly tackles poverty and inequity. Every Indian needs to focus on this.""

The jury deliberated on over 40 companies, personalities and entities to try and determine the outstanding achievers across over 13 categories basis not only the usual quantitative criteria, but qualitative markers including nimbleness, endurance, fortitude, inspirational quotient, strategic sagacity and sheer grit in the face of overarching adversity through 2021. Not just that, the jury also weighed in on what it will take to tackle everything 2022 could throw up. With the insightful discussion centred around “Navigating 2022: Chasing The Recovery”, conversations veered towards growth with compassion, nurturing a culture of agility & innovation, moving towards net zero.

Chaired by Laxman Narasimhan, Global CEO of Reckitt Benckiser, the jury of CNBC-TV18 India Business Leader Awards 2022 included Uday Kotak, MD & CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank, Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle India, Zarin Daruwala, Cluster CEO - India & South Asia markets (Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka), Standard Chartered Bank, Sanjeev Bikhchandani, Founder & Executive Vice Chairman, Info Edge (naukri.com), Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys, Munish Varma, Managing Partner, SoftBank, and Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Executive Chairperson, Biocon & Biocon Biologics.

Jury Chair Laxman Narasimhan, CEO, Reckitt Benckiser, said he was “widely optimistic” about how corporate houses, policymakers, and various stakeholders would respond to the challenges and opportunities 2022 would offer, saying, “I know that 2022 will be tough, but we would certainly do better.”

One of the key challenges the jury was unanimous in identifying was the overarching expectation of inflationary headwinds; veteran banker Uday Kotak commented on the outlook on inflation trajectory and the idea that higher interest rates and hawkish central banks would become de rigueur, saying, “I am of the camp that there will be steady increase in interest rates, but it is possible for the economy to grow.”

Cautiously optimistic about the future, Zarin Daruwala said, “We have seen government’s Debt-to-GDP go up, so the next 1-2 years will be about how governments manage the fiscal deficit as well as how they use monetary policy to ensure that growth is enabled.”

The jury was also eloquent on how a recalibration of fiscal and monetary policy measures to balance out growth with liquidity and other macro-economic indicators would automatically point to a redrawing of the global commercial and economic landscape. Speaking on the impact of rising interest rates, Munish Varma of SoftBank said, “Capital will get expensive, and valuations of private companies will get recalibrated as interest rates go up and liquidity tightens. However, businesses with strong fundamentals will receive capital.”

Sanjeev Bikhchandani, Founder, Info Edge, added, “Late-stage investors who find options in USA much cheaper could end up taking money away from India. Investors will get a bit more selective and discerning. Start-ups will have to work harder and smarter to increase value and get more funding.”

Uday Kotak added his strokes to the realistic picture saying, ""Fuzzy money or fizzy money will not last, investors who do their homework well shall continue to grow.” Speaking on areas sparking growth, Salil Parekh, CEO, Infosys, said, “This approach of converting all of the activity to a digital activity is going to drive the next phase of growth across the world.”

Suresh Narayanan, CMD, Nestle, called for introspection by companies and emphasised the importance of investing more in work culture, as he believes that “if businesses were to invest more in culture than capex, we would have a lot more better run companies"".

Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, Executive Chairperson, Biocon, said she wants to see India grow from 4% of value capture in the global pharma market to upwards of 15%. Further, she believes this can be achieved by investing in innovation and in R&D; to this end she has been engaging with the government to explore the possibility of the PLI scheme, given the high gestational periods, and high-risk investments involved in the pharma industry.

Summing up the discussion, Jury Chair Laxman Narasimhan reiterated the need for a strong focus on company culture that will bring about the strengths desired for safe passage through the pandemic.",716,0.5607627555727959

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB’s Q3 earnings of Rs21.31bn (PLe: R20.46bn) were marginally higher along with decent NII growth of 12% YoY & provision write back, while other income saw a minor blip due to MTM Provisioning on investment and higher other opex growth. Tailwinds from lower cost of funds continue, while loan growth returned at 18% YoY. Slippages continued to come off and stood at 1.2% of loans, other metrics like PCR continues to be robust at 71%, retained COVID provisions of ~40bps and restructuring of 54 bps. We believe KMB has emanated from cycle of stress and now remains focused on asset side growth driven by 1) higher customer acquisitions & experiences, 2) comfort on growing unsecured retail, 3) well managed asset quality and 4) commitment towards high technology investments. The business momentum should continue with control on credit costs/ slippages and higher share of low cost deposits, though high opex could be a hindrance in earnings growth.

Outlook

We retain ‘ACCUMULATE’ with TP of Rs1,978 (unchanged) & subs value of Rs430 based on Sep-23 SOTP.

Business magnate Uday Kotak has urged startups to brace for increased interest rates and changing returns expectations as the world of easy money comes to an end with central banks gearing up to tighten policies, YourStory reported.

Interest rates being “close to zero” over the past couple of years around the world, investors turned to equity for better returns resulting in a Cinderella moment for startups, the executive chairman and managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank explained.

He further noted: “Cinderella times will not last forever. We are not very far away from the clock striking midnight. At some point, if rates really rise significantly, then debt becomes a more serious option for institutional investors as well.”

Kotak also said he was “exhilarated by the startup world’s growth and opportunity in transforming India and the world”, advising the young companies to “be aggressive and experimental” but in a sustainable way and within the confines of law.

He also strongly recommended that startups conduct “thorough health check-up” of their firms before “coming to the markets and raising capital”.

Underscoring the need for a “top to bottom check of how ready startups are for public markets” by an independent governance expert, an investment banker or a lawyer, Kotak said that “immature launches and risk of accidents” need to be mitigated.

Moreover, he stressed the need to follow regulations, adding that many companies “have not adhered to the substance of governance”, which has caused an “excess of rules and regulations” such that publicly listed companies face a “huge overbearing load of compliance” which leads to the risk of losing marketplace opportunity.

“We need to find a proper balance between ticking the boxes of regulations versus the substance of the regulation. We have to be clear that the approach should not be robotic, one size fits all. Especially as an enterprise grows, regulations should have the flexibility of adjusting to the realities of the case rather than stick to rules,” he noted.

Kotak also advised fintech startups to be cautious about “being fast and loose with regulations compared to traditional players”.

Citing his own Kotak Mahindra Bank, he said the lender needs to have many startups cropping up within itself. “We cannot hide ourselves under the cover of being a large firm. The firm has to transform by creating many internal startup firms within the firm, to be able to reach out to customers, and therefore being competitive. Enterprises should not sit under the cover of being a regulated entity and, therefore, not being responsive to customers and the marketplace,” Kotak added.

Private lender Axis Bank is inching closer to the takeover of Citibank's India consumer business, with the acquisition deal likely to be finalised this month, news agency Reuters reported on January 17, citing two sources familiar with the development.

Citi's India consumer business is being valued at $1.5 billion in the planned deal, Reuters learnt from the sources. Kotak Mahindra Bank, another private lender which is also in the acquisition race, has submitted a bid lower than Axis Bank's, they reportedly added.

While both the lenders did not react to the Reuters report so far, Citi India told the news agency that it is moving ahead with its plan to offload the consumer retail business in the country.

“We continue to move forward with our process with respect to our India consumer business sale in accordance with our broader strategic refresh,” Citi India was quoted as saying.

Last month, CNBC TV 18 had learnt from sources that Axis Bank is likely to strike an all-cash deal for Citi's India retail assets, which could be worth $1.5 billion with up to $300-400 million milestone payments which depends on performance in the future.

Citi's India retail business involves over 2.5 million customers and more than 1.2 million bank accounts.

On December 7, a report in The Economic Times claimed that Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank have emerged as the top contenders to clinch the deal. The report, citing a source, had said Kotak was more ""aggressive"" between the two bidders.

Notably, Citibank runs a profitable franchise in India and had a loan book of Rs 68,800 crores as on March, 2021, of which Rs 28,000 crore was retail loans. These mainly included cards, mortgages and personal mortgages, said a report released by investment group CLSA on September 8.

Citibank is the sixth largest card issuer with market share of 4.2 per cent in cards issued, the report added. As per CLSA's estimates, Citibank could have a credit card book of approximately Rs 9,000 crore.

On April 16 last year, Citi said it will exit consumer/retail operations in 13 countries across Asia and Europe. The 13 nations include Australia, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

Citi’s consumer business in India comprises credit cards, retail banking, home loans and wealth management. The bank has 35 branches in the country and employs 4,000 people in the consumer banking business. It had a 0.6 percent market share in advances and 1.1 percent in deposits, along with 2.58 million credit cards outstanding, as of October 2021.",430,0.7333053052425385

Ashneer Grover seems to have lived many lives in a few years where most people's one life was threatened by the Covid-19 pandemic. In just over three years, his fintech startup BharatPe has become among India's biggest fintechs, and received a coveted banking license that even eluded larger and more influential company Paytm and its founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Its valuation zoomed to nearly $3 billion, making the 3 year-old firm India's third most valuable fintech for a few months.

Behind the scenes though, a wildly different set of things were happening. BharatPe's employees were leaving in droves due to a poor and punishing work culture, and Grover stepped back for Suhail Sameer to take charge of daily affairs of the company.

And in the last week things really heated up. Grover was found in a leaked audio to be verbally abusing and screaming at a Kotak Mahindra Bank employee for not getting allocation to Nykaa's Initial Public Offering (IPO). While Grover denied the claims, the evidence is now irrefutable. This, added with his unfriendly and abrasive behavior on Shark Tank India, the Indian edition of the US-based renowned entrepreneur-investor reality show, did not help.

New-age companies are over-estimating their tech-hiring requirements and engineers are getting complacent as they are raking in the moolah amid a hiring war, said BharatPe co-founder and MD Ashneer Grover.

Grover was speaking at the Wharton India Economic Forum on January 8 on a panel with Uber’s Asia-Pacific president of mobility Pradeep Parameswaran and BillDesk co-founder Srinivasu MN.

“The challenge is, the amount of salary the tech guys are getting paid is making them lazy. They're not thinking of evolving themselves into product managers or becoming more relevant, or upping their game,” Grover said.

He added that, until this war of talent continues, techies will not have any incentive as there is a big pot of gold they currently have. BharatPe, according to Grover, has 100 engineers as part of its team which is seen by many industry players as understaffed.

“Personally, I feel I am overstaffed. A lot of companies are not asking their tech teams what they are doing,” he added.

In his view, companies are just adding more engineers as a way of ""throwing people at the problem"" while planning scale-based growth, which is not the right solution. Tech employee hiring has to be a saner number and not in 1000s, he said.

“I fail to understand how as a founder of a company you can be comfortable having 1000 tech people. Something is really amiss there. That problem is just getting brushed under the carpet because there's so much capital available. No one is asking you for profits. No one is asking you what's your cost of production of a product,” he said referring to the boom in startup funding seen over the past year.

Until this war of talent continues, Grover said that companies like BharatPe will continue to lure techies with BMW bikes and free trips to Dubai to avoid them being poached by other companies.

However, when it comes to banking, Grover sees a huge opportunity if tech and not financial services is at the core of what is being built.

“All core banking systems are legacy systems. They were built 20 years ago when the banks computerised from a ledger system. None of them can even handle a fraction of the UPI volumes that are happening today,” he said.

BharatPe, in a joint venture with Centrum Financial Services, had secured a small finance bank licence from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in October 2021 to acquire the beleaguered Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank. Grover said that the aim behind securing a licence and entering into core banking was to serve more customers on low transaction credit and payments.

Over the past week, Grover has been embroiled in a controversy after an audio clip surfaced which allegedly was a conversation between him and a Kotak Group employee. The leaked audio has Grover allegedly abusing and threatening the said Kotak employee for failing to secure financing and allocation for shares worth Rs 500 crore in an IPO launched by beauty firm Nykaa.

Moneycontrol was the first to report on January 9 that the matter had escalated further and Grover along with his wife Madhuri Grover had sent a legal notice on October 30, 2021 to Kotak Mahindra Bank's managing director and chief executive officer Uday Kotak and other senior management on the issue.

The notice accused the bank of failing to secure financing and allocation in the IPO and sought damages for the gains Grover, his wife and their clients would have made after subscribing to shares worth Rs 500 crore in the company besides Rs 1 lakh towards the cost of the legal notice.

Kotak Group confirmed receipt of the notice in a statement late evening on January 9 saying, ""This notice was received by us and was replied to appropriately at the time, including placing on record our objections to inappropriate language used by Mr. Grover.”",648,-0.5388049483299255

Kotak Group in a statement on January 9 said that it has placed on record its objections to inappropriate language used by BharatPe co-founder and MD Ashneer Grover against a Group employee.

The statement by the Kotak Group came in response to Moneycontrol's report stating that Grover and wife Madhuri Grover sent a legal notice to Kotak Mahindra Bank's managing director and chief executive officer Uday Kotak and other senior Group executives.

In the notice dated October 30, 2021, Grover accused the bank of failing to secure financing and allocation of shares in an IPO launched by beauty firm Nykaa late last year.

Confirming Moneycontrol's report, Kotak Group's statement said, ""This notice was received by us and was replied to appropriately at the time, including placing on record our objections to inappropriate language used by Mr. Grover. Appropriate legal action is being pursued.""

""We would like to confirm that there is no breach or violation by the Kotak Group in any manner whatsoever,"" the statement further read.

After a week of back and forth over the leaked audio call which allegedly had BharatPe's Grover using abusive language and threatening a Kotak employee, the Group has confirmed that Grover used inappropriate language through the statement.

On January 6, Grover had claimed that the viral audio clip was “fake” adding that it was a “scamster” who put it out. The statement by Kotak now raises questions over Grover's claims that the audio clip was fake.

“Folks. Chill. It’s a fake audio by some scamster trying to extort funds (US$ 240K in bitcoins). I refused to buckle. I’ve got more character. And Internet has got enough scamsters,” Grover had tweeted.

Grover subsequently deleted the tweet where he claimed the audio is fake. The audio too has been taken down.

The copy of the notice that has been reviewed by Moneycontrol was sent by Sumit Agarwal, Partner and founder, Regstreet Law Advisors on behalf of Grover and his wife. The notice was also addressed to Oisharya Das, CEO of Kotak Wealth Management, Shanti Ekambaram, Kotak Mahindra Bank's Group President for Consumer Banking and KVS Manian who heads Corporate, Institutional & Investment Banking.

In the notice, Grover and his wife sought damages for the gains they would have made after subscribing to shares worth Rs 500 crore in the company besides Rs 1 lakh towards the cost of the legal notice.

The notice read, ""Kotak’s refusal to provide IPO financing to our clients at the eleventh hour has completely crippled our clients’ ability to participate in the Nykaa IPO and deprived them of a business/investment opportunity about which they had informed Kotak more than a month in advance of the launch of the IPO. Had Kotak informed our clients at the very beginning that it would be unable to provide IPO financing for the Nykaa IPO, our clients would have approached other financiers who were ready and willing to provide IPO financing to our clients for this IPO.""

It further asked Kotak to provide IPO financing to Grover and his clients for the Nykaa IPO and allocate shares of FSN worth Rs 500 crore before the closing of the Nykaa IPO on November 1, 2021. If Kotak failed to do so, the notice said, the Group will be liable to compensate the clients.",550,-0.9030492663383484

“(The board will) consider the proposal for seeking the consent of the board for issuance of unsecured, redeemable, non-convertible debentures/bonds/other debt securities, on private placement basis, in Indian/foreign currencies, in domestic and/or overseas markets, in one or more tranches, during FY 2022-23, subject to the approval of the members of the bank and any other approvals as may be necessary,” the filing said.

The update comes a day after The Economic Times reported that Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank had emerged as the top contenders to acquire the assets of Citibank’s Indian retail business.

According to the report, Kotak Mahindra was the more aggressive bidder and more keen than Axis Bank to acquire the business. The deal will likely be all cash of less than $2 billion.

“The bidders are negotiating the cash payout, fee and commissions they will cough up for Citi’s team to service the consumer book,” the publication cited sources as saying.

In April, Citibank said it would exit the retail business in 13 markets to conserve capital and focus on higher yielding revenue streams. However, its management has indicated that the exit would not lead to “fire sales”.",309,-0.9154223203659058

Amid surging popularity of online payment systems, India's top banker Uday Kotak said lenders based in the country may end up losing large portions of their traditional business to digital wallet platforms such as Google Pay and Walmart-backed Phonepe, Bloomberg reported on December 3.

Google Pay and Phonepe, which are dominating the country's retail digital payments sector, are either owned or backed by deep-pocketed tech giants, Kotak pointed out while speaking at a forum organised by Bloomberg and India’s International Financial Services Centres Authority.

To match the competition, Indian banks need to adopt a customer-centric instead of a sales-centric approach, said Kotak, who is the founder and chief executive officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The lenders are required to hire more talent and significantly scale up their technologies, he added.

""Bankers were short-sighted over the last three years...Their standard response was ‘oh, there is no money in payments,"" Bloomberg quoted Kotak as saying.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank, on November 29, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had granted its approval to Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to increase holding in the bank up to 9.99 percent.

The approval is valid for a period of one year, the bank said.

This is subject to compliance with the provisions issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 and any other guidelines/regulations and statutes, as applicable, the bank said.

Uday Kotak tells Twitter user to ""get facts right"", says Kotak Bank was not lead manager for Paytm IPO

Last week, the RBI accepted a working group's recommendation to increase promoter stake in private banks till 26 percent and non-promoter stake to 10 percent.

As of September 30, the LIC holds 4.96 percent stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank. Promoters Uday Kotak and family holds 26 percent stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank while Canada Pension Plan Investment Board holds 6.37 percent. In 2020, Kotak moved court against the RBI’s direction to reduce promoter stake to 15 percent. The RBI later agreed to allow Kotak to retain stake at 26 percent.

On November 26, the RBI accepted 21 out of the 33 recommendations submitted by a Central bank working group on ownership and corporate structure for Indian private sector banks.

Among the recommendations accepted is a rule that says the cap on promoters’ stake in the long run of 15 years may be raised from the current levels of 15 percent to 26 percent of the paid-up voting equity share capital of the bank.

This stipulation should be uniform for all types of promoters and would not mean that promoters, who have already diluted their holdings to below 26 percent, will not be permitted to raise it to 26 percent of the paid-up voting equity share capital of the bank, the RBI said.

'Central banks, sovereigns globally have one medicine for all problems: print money', says Uday Kotak

""The promoter, if he/she so desires, can choose to bring down holding to even below 26 percent, any time after the lock-in period of five years,"" the RBI said.

However, when one user directed that criticism towards Uday Kotak, the CEO and MD of Kotak Mahindra Bank, the veteran banker responded saying the user must get his facts right.

According to Paytm's DRHP filing with the SEBI, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Axis Capital and Link Intime were the lead managers of the IPO.

Shares of Paytm hit a low of Rs 1,271 on the BSE today, which is over 40% down from its issue price of Rs 2,150 and more than 18% lower than the close on November 18, the day of listing. The stock closed nearly 13% lower at Rs 1,362.

The stock had listed at a discount of 9 percent and closed down 27 percent on November 18.

Paytm, the biggest public offer in Indian capital markets, saw the worst listing performance in a decade as brokerages flagged several risks related to uncertainty over the business model, path to profitability, and concerns over steep valuations.

On the second day of its trading, the crash in the stock came amid weak market sentiment on Monday as benchmark indices Nifty 50 ended 1.8% lower at 17,441.05 points and the Sensex was down 1.96% at 58,465.89 points.

His remarks suggested that the move not only hits the value of currency, but also hurts the values to constructively address long-term challenges.

""Like climate change it is the future generation’s problem. We need to solve it not kick the can. Future is here. Future is now,"" the MD and Executive Director of Kotak Mahindra Bank said.

The stock rallied 23 percent in the current financial year to hit a record high of Rs 2,201 on October 22. However, it corrected six-tenth of a percent on October 25 despite stellar run in the Bank Nifty that crossed 41,000 mark for the first time.

""We expect the loan growth to be 10 percent YoY with a pickup in the retail segment. Deposits are expected to grow by 12 percent YoY. NII growth is supported by stable NIMs with lower costs of funds and a reduction in liquidity. We expect credit costs to remain under control with the QoQ reduction. The cost to income ratio is expected to be around 43.3 percent,"" said KRChoksey Research which sees 17 percent decline in profit.

Sharekhan, too, expects 10 percent YoY growth in loan book with strong net interest margin at around 4.5-4.7 percent for September 2021 quarter.

Asset quality

KRChoksey feels asset quality will remain stable with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) at 3.45 percent in Q2FY22.

""Asset quality should see an improvement, especially in the retail segment as feet on street start moving while restructuring should be minimal. Gross NPA is expected to dip by 13 bps QoQ to 3.4 percent,"" said ICICI Direct which expects 15 percent YoY decline in profit.

After testing a fresh lifetime high of 18,604 on October 19, Nifty started to move lower. The profit booking spree continued for the third straight session on October 21 and the Nifty almost marked a low of 18,000.

The price action points towards the possibility of the index further witnessing profit booking and the momentum indicators point towards decreasing bullish momentum in the prices.

On the open interest (November 25 options) front, the highest open interest was seen in the 19,000 Call and participation was seen in the 18,000 Put contracts. Thus, we can expect the broader range of the index to be 18,000-19,000.

Looking at the charts, we believe, currently the index is heading lower towards 18,000-17,900. This zone will act as a key support. And if this level is breached, the index can move even lower towards 17,600.

On the upside, 18,600 will be the level to watch in the coming week. If the prices breach above this level, the index can move towards the 19,000 mark.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Bank of Baroda: Buy | LTP: Rs 95.45 | Stop Loss: Rs 85 | Target: Rs 109 | Return: 28 percent

For the past 3 weeks, Bank of Baroda has been forming a higher high, higher low pattern after breaking above the downward slopping trendline. Looking at the price action, the momentum indicators, and other technical parameters, we believe this stock has a lot of upside potential left.

If the prices breach above the previous swing high of Rs 109. If this level is breached, we might see the stock move towards the Rs 122. It seems to be a good buying candidate with upside targets of Rs 109 and Rs 122. We recommend a stop loss of Rs 85.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,143.75 | Stop Loss: Rs 2,050 | Target: Rs 2,273 | Return: 14 percent

After choppy moves in last few sessions, on October 21 the stock gained momentum and moved higher with good volume buildup. The price action and the volumes point to the possibility of increasing bullish momentum and the prices moving towards fresh lifetime highs.

Investors can accumulate Kotak Mahindra Bank at this point and hold with a target of Rs 2,273 and Rs 2,449 and maintain a stop loss of Rs 2,050 on closing basis.

Union Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 50.65 | Stop Loss: Rs 45 | Target: Rs 65 | Return: 28 percent

Union Bank has been forming a higher high, higher low pattern after moving out of consolidation. This breakout and up move is also backed by rising volumes. The momentum indicators and the technical parameters all point towards the possibility of the prices moving higher towards Rs 54 immediately, and then further towards Rs 65.

The bullish view will be negated if the prices breach below the Rs 45. We also recommend this level to be a strict stop loss.

The equity market cheered the continuity in policy support after the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on October 8 left key policy rates unchanged and retained the accommodative stance in its bi-monthly policy meeting.

The benchmark indices extended gains with the Nifty50 rising 123 points to 17,913.50 and the BSE Sensex trading above the 60,000 mark at 60,111.55 with gains of 433.72 points at 11:36 hours IST.

""The credit policy is neutral to positive for the market as the market was already expecting that interest will remain unchanged but the market is cheering the fact that there is no change in the stance; while ending GSAP is a little negative surprise but the governor's comment that he is ready to resume GSAP if there will be a requirement gives respite,"" said Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika Investmart.

MPC also retained the full-year GDP growth forecast at 9.5 percent while lowering the CPI or retail inflation target to 5.3 percent from 5.7 percent.

The repo rate or the rate at which RBI lends to commercial banks was retained at 4 percent and the reverse repo rate or the rate at which RBI borrows from banks was also left unchanged at 3.35 percent.

""All members - Shashanka Bhide, Ashima Goyal, Mridul K Saggar, Michael Debabrata Patra and Shaktikanta Das (except Jayanth R Varma) - voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward,"" the RBI said in its policy statement.

""The governor is confident about growth and didn't show much worry about inflation therefore the market is witnessing a bullish momentum post policy,"" he added.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das in a statement said, given the existing liquidity overhang, the absence of a need for additional borrowing for GST compensation and the expected expansion of liquidity in the system as Government spending increases in line with budget estimates, the need for undertaking further G-SAP (G-sec Acquisition Programme) operations at this juncture does not arise, but the Reserve Bank would remain in readiness to undertake G-SAP as and when warranted by liquidity conditions and also continue to flexibly conduct other liquidity management operations including Operation Twist (OT) and regular open market operations (OMOs).

Expert: Pushkaraj Kanitkar, VP-Equities at GEPL Capital

Canara Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 174.85 | Target: Rs 205 | Return: 17.2 percent

The price chart has been in 6-month long classical ‘Cup & Handle’ pattern. The whole formation has taken place above the 200 DMA indicating a rational uptrend.

The recent breakout above the level of Rs 170 has been accompanied by above average volumes. The level of breakout has been retested in Wednesday’s correction.

Stock belongs to a sector which is relatively showing a good amount of upside, both technically as well as fundamentally. We feel the uptrend has legs to take it to pattern projection of Rs 205, with further opening of extensions to Rs 235.

A stop loss needs to be maintained around Rs 155, below which the pattern will negate.

State Bank of India: Buy | LTP: 457.9 | Target: Rs 533 | Return: 16.4 percent

Once again, the price chart has been in 6-month long classical ‘Cup & Handle’ pattern. The pattern was further accompanied by formation of an ‘Ascending Triangle’ with a breakout occurring above the Rs 455 mark.

A stop loss needs to be maintained around Rs 424, below which the pattern breaks the trendline & monthly supports.

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 777.10 | Target: Rs 950 | Return: 22.2 percent

The price pattern of a breakout above earlier top (Rs 800) will trigger a momentum buy in this stock. The pattern was further accompanied by respect of a rational uptrend, that has been running parallel to the 200 DMA.

The price pattern post mid-April indicates a clear upsloping trendline with a slope close to the median 45 degrees. We feel the uptrend has legs to take it to pattern projection of Rs 950.

A stop loss needs to be maintained around Rs 725, below which the pattern breaks the 200 DMA rather convincingly.

Expert: Siddharth Sedani - Vice President, Equity Advisory at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers

Larsen & Toubro: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,712.45 | Target: Rs 1,932 | Return: 12.8 percent

Management talked of a healthy opportunity pipeline of Rs 9.6 lakh crore in FY22 (Rs 6.6 lakh crore domestic, the rest international) & the robust order backlog (around Rs 3.3 lakh crore), sturdy balance sheet and no near competitor. On lower execution, L&T's Q1 FY22 consolidated revenue was up 38 percent, less than Anand Rathi's estimates. The EBITDA margin was 10.8 percent (largely, in line), a 319bp expansion YoY, aided by better cost management and operating leverage. Excluding services segment, order inflow was a modest 11 percent up YoY due to delays in tendering and awarding.

For the rest of FY22, the overall opportunity pipeline continues to be strong at Rs 8.96 lakh crore (Rs 9.06 lakh crore at end-FY21). We reiterate our positive stance on the company's execution pace of the robust order backlog (around Rs 3.24 lakh crore), sturdy balance sheet and no near competitor.

We believe that, in the present situation, L&T's greater public-sector exposure (i.e. 84 percent of its domestic order book) augurs well in credit risk and limited opportunities from private industries (however, showing some signs of improvement). Also, 60 percent of the order book comprises variable price contracts that cushion margins in such an inflationary environment.

With a robust order book in hand and a sturdy pipeline, revenue assurance is healthy. We expect revenue/PAT CAGRs of 17 percent/31 percent over FY21-23. Valuing the company on a sum-of-parts basis and at a 20x multiple for its core business, we arrive at a target price of Rs 1,932. We retain a buy. Risks are sluggish capex and volatile crude-oil prices.

Hero Motocorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 2841.65 | Target: Rs 3,653 | Return: 28.6 percent

Hero Motocorp reported consolidated revenue from operation of Rs 5,502.8 crore during Q1FY22, a growth of 85.3 percent YoY. The company registered a volume growth of 81 percent YoY during Q1-FY22. The company sold a total of 10.25 lakh units of motorcycles and scooters during Q1 FY22 despite Covid-19 related disruptions. Spare sales number for the quarter was Rs 455 crore for Q1 FY22, which is 8 percent of revenue. On delivered volume of 10.25 lakh during Q1 FY22, the company gained 200 basis point market share over full year 2021.

The commodity costs continued to rise, thereby impacting the industry margins. The company has taken judicious and measured pricing decisions, reducing the impact on the customers by offsetting part of the increase through the accelerated Leap-2 saving program.

On electric vehicle (EV) front, the company guided to follow three different strategies. First, the launch of fast charging EV product by March 2022, secondly investment in Ather and third the battery swapping technology through Gogoro. The company remains optimistic about demand over the coming months with the start of the festive season and also a healthy monsoon and encouraging farm activity.

With last-mile retail opening up further, the company expect numbers to be positive as they move forward. Hero Motocorp aims to build further on its market leadership as they continue to delight customers with superior products and technology. We have buy rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 3,653.

HDFC: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,727 | Target: Rs 3,150 | Return: 15.5 percent

Housing Development Finance Corporation's (HDFC) consolidated revenues grew 3.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) in Q1FY22. On standalone basis, HDFC reported revenues of Rs 11,657.5 crore, down 10.4 percent YoY. Net interest income grew by 22 percent YoY in the quarter. Net interest margin (NIM) stood at 3.7 percent. The company reported 181 percent growth in individual loan disbursements (after adding back loans sold in the preceding 12 months) during the quarter ended June 30, 2021 compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

The growth in the total loan book after adding back loans sold was 22 percent. The provisions as at June 30, 2021 stood at Rs 13,189 crore.

Individual loans which comprised 78 percent of the total loan book, grew 14 percent YoY. The demand for home loans continues to remain strong and disbursements have picked up with the unlocking of respective locations.

While disbursements during April and May of the current financial year were somewhat impacted, business has reverted to normalized trends in the months of June and July. July 2021 disbursements were the highest ever in a non-quarter end month. Disbursements between April to July 2021 i.e. four months were 108 percent of the disbursement levels achieved during the first six months of the previous year.

Reflecting strong capital position, capital adequacy ratio stood at 22.0 percent and Tier I capital ratio was 21.3 percent, exceeding the minimum regulatory requirement for the capital adequacy ratio and Tier I capital of 15 percent and 10 percent respectively. The company maintains higher levels of liquidity & has a strong deposit base. The company continues to grow strongly given its strong market position in the housing finance sector, healthy spreads, sturdy capital position, conservative provisioning and strength from its subsidiaries. We maintain buy rating with a target price of Rs 3,150 per share

Sharekhan's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) is well-positioned to grow at a healthy rate as credit demand picks up and as it has a clean balance sheet (capital adequacy of 24.7%; Tier I capital at 22.8%), strong liability franchise (industry leading CASA at 60.2%) and improving trend on asset quality side. In Q1, slippages were elevated amid wave-2 of COVID-19. However, KMB’s COVID-related provisions (0.6% of loans) and restructuring was low at 0.25% during the quarter. In Q2, we expect slippages to decline as collection efficiency improves. Consequently, GNPA ratio is expected to be at ~3.3% in Q2, down from 3.56% in Q1. NII is also likely to grow by ~15% with better recoveries and an increase in credit growth during the quarter. We expect the bank’s subsidiaries such as Kotak Securities and Kotak Asset Management to perform well amid a buoyant equity market. Valuations are attractive after adjusting for subsidiary valuations of Rs. 571/share.

Outlook

We retain a Buy rating on the stock with revised SOTP-based price target of Rs 2,428 - valuing the standalone bank at 4.5x FY23 book value.

The BSE Sensex hit a new high of 59,737.32 before closing 125.27 points lower at 59,015.89, while the Nifty50 jumped to a fresh high of 17,792.95 before falling 44.30 points to close at 17,585.20 on September 17. Benchmarks climbed over a percent each for the full week.

KSB, too, scaled to all-time high of Rs 1,375 before finishing the day trade at Rs 1,237.95, up 3.24 percent.

Here's what Himanshu Gupta, VP Research at Globe Capital Markets, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Kotak Mahindra Bank

With a very sharp upmove seen over past few weeks, the stock has given a vertical rally from Rs 1,600 odd levels and is very close to its previous all-time highs above Rs 2,000 levels.

The daily chart pattern are suggesting a breakout from a rounding bottom formation which have a potential medium term targets of Rs 2,300 and Rs 2,500, however looking at the recent momentum a throwback in the near term towards the immediate support of Rs 1,900-1,920 cannot be ruled out, which in fact will be a good opportunity for the positional traders to enter.

For long term investors a hold is recommended as even after the sector being in the vicinity of life time highs has grossly been an underperformer compared to the broader markets over past 12-15 months.

InterGlobe Aviation

The airline stock has finally been able to take a leap in the sky reacting to positive air traffic numbers. The charts of IndiGo had been indicating a positive setup for a while and as soon as the economy opened up the stock witnessed a breakout above Rs 1,850-1,900 zone which had been acting as a supply zone over past many occasions.

We remain extremely positive on IndiGo even after the recent surge in the prices and expect targets of Rs 2,600-2,900 in medium term.

Short term traders can hold their long positions with a trailing stop loss below Rs 2,100 while medium to long term traders can accumulate the stock on declines towards Rs 2,050-2,100 levels.

Tata Elxsi

Tata Elxsi has been one stock that has defied gravity over past few months and has really tested the patience of investors in terms of how much profits one can ignore to book. On a serious note, the stock is a perfect example of how a good stock can make wealth for its shareholders beyond expectations. (With lows of Rs 490 in March 2020 to current price of Rs 5,300+).

Since the long term chart structure of course is not sending any warning signals so for, long term investors who are sitting on huge profits are still advised to keep holding the stock for targets of Rs 6,000 over next 6-9 months, as IT sector is expected to deliver strong performance over next 3-4 quarters.

Levels of Rs 4500-4,200 are likely to act as a strong support zone, in case stocks enters some consolidation in coming months where fresh longs are recommended.

KSB

KSB is also one of the stronger performing counters in the recent months, where the long term setup still continues to remain positive and targets of Rs 1,475/1,600 can be expected over medium to long term.

In the short term the stock has given a breakout recently from a pennant formation on daily charts which is in line with the long term positioning of the stock, short term traders can maintain a stop loss below Rs 1,150 and stay invested.

Bajaj Electricals

A recent breakout from a continuation pattern in the first week of September above Rs 1,220-1,240 has further added to the momentum of Bajaj Electricals and the stock has hit a new all-time high just shy of Rs 1,600 mark.

Amidst the increase in the volatility at record highs in the broader markets, a technical retracement towards Rs 1,420-1,400 levels is expected before the stock resumes its uptrend once again.

Positional traders are advised to use this dip to enter and maintain a stop loss below Rs 1,300 levels.

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (KMBL) will now offer home loans at an interest rate of 6.50 percent per annum instead of 6.65 percent per annum.

Notably, this is a limited period offer for the festive season and will be offered till November 8, 2021. Further, the reduced interest rate of 6.5 percent will be applicable across all loan amounts and will be linked to a borrower’s credit profile. Additionally, this will be applicable on both fresh and balance transfer cases.

Ambuj Chandna, President, Consumer Assets, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said: “We are delighted to add to the festive cheer for millions of home buyers and help make their dream of owning their ideal home a reality. As the world has changed and we are spending more time at home, our lifestyles have also evolved. People are looking for comfortable residences where the entire family can work, entertain and spend quality time together.

Indian stock markets are trading at record highs, with the BSE Sensex above the 58,000-point mark and the NSE above 17,000 for the first time on expectations of a strong economic recovery, abundant liquidity and positive global cues.

The rally is being driven by buying in information technology, consumer packaged goods, metals and realty stocks. Banks have so far stayed out of the rally.

Indian markets have outperformed Asian peers so far this year. The Nifty Midcap 100 has scaled new highs post a sell-off in August, touching the 29,000-point mark. Of late, blue chip stocks have participated in the rally with Reliance Industries leading the pack. Nifty is at present trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 26.60x against 19.38x at its March lows.

After such a strong performance, we expect the markets to cool a bit before the next leg of the rally. We advise investors to book partial profits if their targets have been met; otherwise, remain invested. Traders are advised to maintain a strict stop-loss on their positions. Investors can use a “buy on declines strategy"" for stocks that are doing fundamentally well and have a potentially great future.

We expect the banking and automobiles sectors to perform well. The former has been consolidating and is expected to benefit from an economic recovery. Automobile stocks have corrected recently because of a crisis over a shortage of microchips; we feel the problem is temporary and the sector is expected to bounce back strongly once the crisis is resolved. Automobiles stocks are also expected to benefit from the electric vehicle play.

Here are three top picks for strong returns:

Kotak Mahindra Bank

The stock is consolidating in the Rs 1,700 to Rs 1,850 range since March 2021. Recently the bank sold a stake in Airtel Payments Bank. We expect the stock to reach Rs 2,050 levels.

Mahindra & Mahindra

Considering the current chip shortage and a drop in production estimates, the stock has corrected more than 20 percent since highs of February. The company recently launched its XUV700, which has created a buzz in the market.

We don’t expect the chip shortage to continue for a long period and this dip should be considered an opportunity to add this gem.

Hero MotoCorp

The company is the market leader in the two-wheeler segment in India. It has recently launched its first electric vehicle. The stock has corrected more than 20 percent from its February high. We recommend a buy on this counter with a target price of Rs 3,650.

In an era marked by the COVID-19 crisis, the Kotak Mahindra Bank will not shy away from taking ""bolder bets"", the bank's Managing Director and CEO Uday Kotak said in his message to the shareholders on July 29. The statement comes three days after the private sector lender posted a 32 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in standalone Q1FY22 net profit at Rs 1,641.92 crore against Rs 1,244.45 crore in Q1FY21.

Here is the full text of Uday Kotak's message to the shareholders:

The Never Normal World

We have leapfrogged five years in the span of a year.

The dictionary defines normal as usual, regular, conforming to a type, standard or pattern. Humankind is hard-coded to seek the assurance and security such patterns promise, even a new normal, if you will, to which we can adapt and grow accustomed to. But a never normal world, one that is unpredictable and does not fit patterns, is a new planet of challenges and opportunities.

2020 was a year unlike any that we have seen. And while 2021 brings with it a fair degree of hope and optimism, I believe that we must embrace living in a world where the new normal and never normal coexist.

Look around us. And what is clear is that the pandemic has resulted in some everlasting changes in the way consumers and businesses will function. There are some significant structural changes that are taking place, in the way we live and work, the way we bank, shop and interact with others. When it comes to digital and technology, we have leapfrogged five years in the span of a year, and while there will be some rebalancing when we revert to more in-person interactions, there is no going back completely, with digital extending to almost all aspects of our lives.

The other consequence of the pandemic is the risk of increasing imbalance between the rich and the poor – both when it comes to people and nations.

This poses some important questions. Will the post-COVID world see greater collaboration between nations or will each country retreat into a silo? Will it give a boost to globalisation or increase protectionism? How do we ensure equal growth that embraces all? And from India’s perspective, how do we turn this crisis into a significant opportunity for the country and its citizens?

India in the Never Normal

The future belongs to the educated and skilled

The two months of April and May 2021, when COVID 2.0 struck India, served as a reminder of human frailty and vulnerability in a manner that I had never imagined. We must do everything in our power as people and governments to make sure it never recurs.

While India was amongst the hardest hit, the silver lining is that we have a tremendous opportunity before us to turn adversity into success for our people.

Geography is history. We are transitioning to a world where ‘location’ will be increasingly irrelevant. India’s army of talented software engineers, analysts, consultants can provide their services to the world sitting in India. And for a service economy like India’s, this can be a boon. India can be the front office as well as back office of the world.

However, for India to harness this opportunity fully, what is critical is that we redouble our efforts in education. We have to make good the year that so many of our children have lost to the pandemic. More importantly, we have to make structural changes in our educational system to improve the quality of education imparted, invest in teachers and upgrade teaching infrastructure.

The future belongs to the educated and skilled and we owe it to our present and future generations, in particular to those lower down on the socio-economic ladder, to invest in education, aggressively and meaningfully. Education gives us the best chance to bridge the gap and offer a better quality of life to all.

On the same lines, even within the country, I expect COVID-19 will narrow some of the disparities between urban and small town & rural India. With geography no more a significant consideration, people can choose to work from their hometowns and migration to the cities could reduce. This will enable workforce in smaller cities to compete for jobs irrespective of where they are based.

India in 2021 is also where we were in 2003, at the early stages of an investment cycle. The growth driver for India will be infrastructure – both physical and social. Investments in physical infrastructure, including internet and broadband connectivity, sharp increase in healthcare spending – building and upgrading healthcare facilities, training doctors and nurses, and education are a sine qua non. We have to invest significantly more and move closer to the 3% of GDP mark in healthcare investments over the next 3-5 years.

However, the country cannot lose sight of the importance of sustainability as we pursue our growth priorities. Climate change is a reality and sustainable growth is the future. Profit, people and the planet are closely intertwined such that we cannot focus on one at the expense of the other. We will also see a disproportionate flow of global and domestic capital to companies that adopt and integrate the principles of ESG in their businesses.

Kotak in the Never Normal

From caution to growth conviction

Which brings me to Kotak. As I’ve said before, our ambition is to continue to build on our vision of a world-class financial services institution that delivers long-term sustainable returns for all its stakeholders. With that in mind and against the backdrop of the pandemic, you will see a significant shift in our approach, one of greater aggression, one that is even sharper on execution.

We will not shy away from taking bolder bets. We have a deep conviction in the India growth story and confidence in our risk management capabilities. And we believe the time is right to experiment more, concentrate on segments that we deem offer the best opportunities for returns and, in the process, support the Indian economy by extending credit, while at the same time providing safety to our depositors.

Our template for growth as always will revolve around risk-adjusted returns. We don’t look at either – returns or risk - in isolation. Today we have a much lighter balance sheet and with sufficient capital in our hands, we are ready to grow substantially faster, but on our terms.

The other area that takes precedence for us is higher investments in strengthening our digital and technology platforms and offerings. The future may be uncertain, but we can be confident that it belongs to technology. What was once a support function to business, is now the epicentre around which our businesses will revolve.

Finally, you will see a further shift in our business model towards being even more customer-centric. While customer-first was always the byword that we lived by, the needs of the customer are now even more front and centre. Our model will revolve principally around customers and business decisions will be taken with the customer at the core.

The year gone by

Safety-first

In an extraordinary year, our primary focus was on safety. Safeguarding our employees, customers and partners. Banking is an essential service and we took a number of measures to ensure the seamless delivery of services, while at the same time ensuring a safe workplace environment for all. Our strengths in digital banking allowed customers to bank safely from home.

During the year, we have undertaken a mindset shift to make retail and commercial lending our focus, in addition to the corporate and deposit franchise. For example, we are leveraging our low cost of funds to offer a competitive interest rate on home loans. Home loans give us an opportunity to build a longer-term relationship with customers. And we will get bolder in unsecured retail finance too, for which we’ve kept our powder dry over the last two years.

From a group perspective, we had multiple engines firing. In FY 2020-21, the subsidiaries contributed 30% to the consolidated Profit after Tax. Stock markets posted a smart recovery and then some, and this was reflected in the performance of Kotak Securities and Kotak Mutual Fund.

Kotak Life Insurance put in a strong performance with AUM (Policyholders’) growing 34% YoY. Over `30,000 crore of funds were raised via IPOs in FY 2020-21 and Kotak Investment Banking was the banker to many of the marquee issues. Kotak Special Situations Fund invested in six stressed/special situations opportunities during the year across sectors like real estate, chemicals, technology, cement and pharma.

Looking Ahead and Beyond

Doing good and doing well go hand in hand

At this critical juncture, we have to redefine our priorities. Growth cannot be just for a select few. Inclusion is our responsibility as well as a business imperative. There will be a premium on sustainable growth. Growth that is inclusive and that takes into account the environment, is socially responsible and scores high on governance and ethics. Doing good and doing well go hand in hand.

For the financial sector, the disproportionate importance of risk management has come to the fore. The ability to price risks well and having superior underwriting skills is core to the success of a financial services institution.

The industry also needs to stop postponing the inevitable and kicking the can down the road. Upfront action with an eye on enduring, sustainable growth, not swayed by quarterly, short-term results is a must for the future of a healthy Indian financial sector.

Banks also need to be relevant for the future. The winds of change are blowing and banks need to reinvent themselves. Customer-focus and Digital-first are the keys to survival and growth.

As a financial services institution, I believe that Kotak is well-positioned to take on the future with more than adequate capital in our arsenal, a nimbler balance sheet and a more assertive attitude.

I express my deepest gratitude and appreciation to all the COVID warriors who have delivered exceptional service in such trying circumstances.

This includes members of the Kotak family who have tirelessly put others before self – both on the job and off it.

We are in for exciting times ahead. The old maxim “Change is the only constant” could well have been written for 2021 and beyond.

I wish you peace, prosperity and good health.",1730,0.6387789377144405

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,900

Kotak Mahindra Bank reported in line operating performance, though lower provisions against our estimate led to standalone PAT growth of 32% YoY (5% beat). Consolidated PAT declined by 3% YoY on account of weaker performance from subsidiaries, mainly Kotak Life and Kotak Prime.

Loan book fell ~3% QoQ (up 6.6% YoY) led by a decline across most segments. On the liability front, CASA growth remains steady, driving CASA mix to 60.2% (highest in the industry).

The bank reported an in line core operating performance in a challenging environment, despite muted loan growth across most segments. The bank continues to report steady progress in building a strong liability franchise, with a CASA ratio of ~60% (highest in the industry). Asset quality was affected due to the second COVID wave, which hampered collections, thus driving elevated slippages.

We estimate a credit cost of 1.1% for FY22E (v/s 1.3% in FY21). We maintain our earnings estimate for FY22E/FY23E. We maintain our Neutral stance with a target to Rs 1,900 per share.

Kotak Special Situations Fund (KSSF), one of the largest special situation, credit and distressed asset funds, has invested over half of its $1-billion initial corpus in eight companies, and will scout to raise a similar amount from investors later this year or early next year, a top company official has said.

Kotak Investment Advisors, a part of Kotak Mahindra Bank, February 2019 launched KSSF as an AIF special situations fund with a $1-billion corpus. It received 50 per cent maiden money from the UAE sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority ($500 million), 25 per cent ($250 million) from the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC, and the rest between Premji Invest and Kotak Group.

The fund hopes to complete deals worth 65 per cent ($650 million) of its corpus by September. Typically, funds like KSSF shore up capital when they use up 75 per cent of the existing capital and are sector-and instrument-agnostic when it comes to resolving stressed assets issues.

Either it picks up assets/stressed asset opportunity from the IBC/National Company Law Tribunal processes and others are those companies which look for one-time settlements with their lenders to avoid bankruptcy. ""We have so far deployed $502 million of our $1-billion fund in eight companies. The first investment of Rs 500 crore was made in January 2020 in Jindal Stainless (JSL). We hope to pick up more assets by investing another Rs 1,000 crore by September,"" KSSF Chief Executive Officer Eshwar Karra PTI.

KSSF is an arm of Kotak Investment Advisors. ""We'll look for the second round of fund-raising when we've deployed 75 per cent of the corpus. ""We'll look for the second round of fund-raising when we've deployed 75 per cent of the corpus.

""As and when we reached that, which I expect to happen by the year-end, we'll launch a road-show to raise a similar amount, though we've 2.5 years more to close the fund,"" he said. Karra added that had it not been for the pandemic-induced lockdowns, many more deals would have been completed. ""In fact, we have really worked well only in the March quarter.""

Going forward, the firm's focus is consolidating the investments already made, ""even as my 10-member team keeps on prospecting new deals"", Karra said. On the eight investments already made, Karra said they are into six sectors and broadly fall under five investment categories — special situation ($104 million or 21 per cent of the invested funds), stressed assets ($195 million or 39 per cent), pre-pack or one-time settlements ($156 or 31 per cent), insolvency ($47 million or 9 per cent), and liquidation (nil so far).

Under the special situation category KSSF's first investment was of $69 million in Nuvoco, the cement business arm of the Nirma Group, in June last and this was mostly in equities, though our main investments are into special debt. The second investment under the special situation scheme was the $35-million investment in the nutraceutical firm Omniactive, he said.

Under the stressed assets category, ""we've so far invested $195 million in three companies"", he added. The largest is the $73 million Jindal Stainless Steel (debt though specially issued NCDs), followed by AGS Transact ($49 million) and $73 million into realty group Prestige, in which we own over 70 per cent.

Under the pre-pack or one-time settlement, ""we've invested $156 million $57 million in chemical firm DCW; and $99 million in HKR Roadways, a toll road project in Andhra in which we now own 74 per cent equity after the one-time settlement with the lenders"", he said. Karra added that HKR had over Rs 1,600 crore of debt and they entered into an one-time settlement with the lenders for Rs 750 crore, of which ""we paid Rs 715 crore"".

Under the insolvency process we have picked up the Saket, south Delhi-based commercial asset Prius for $47 million, he said. Overall, over 80 per cent of our investments are debt and the rest equity, he added.

Karra said they have an exit time of two-three years, and a lock-in of two years for any investment. Exit could happen through sell out or IPOs and have a commitment to return over 20 per cent to the investors, he said.",718,0.9992608428001404

KMB’s earnings of Rs16.8bn (PLe: Rs16.9bn) was in-line with expectations though certain line items were weak. NII growth of 8% YoY/flat QoQ and higher provisions of Rs11.8bn dragged quality of earnings. Asset quality though was stable and other stress indicators of restructuring+SMA2 was only 23bps of loan. Bank carries a 57bps of COVID provision though would have comforted us if it was higher and similarly with PCR which was at 63%, lower amongst peers. Bank has continued with its stance of lending judiciously without letting guard down and underwriting remains paramount. Hence it has chosen to grow only certain focused secured segments so we think conservatism should continue. Bank has seen relative underperformance recently but despite the same bank remains one of the most valued.

ICICI Direct's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a mixed set of numbers on the operating front while credit growth trajectory on a sequential basis was maintained. Kotak Bank posted lower-than-expected NII growth at 8.0% YoY to Rs 3842 crore, mainly on account of 34 bps YoY and 19 bps QoQ decline in net interest margins. The bank took a hit of ~Rs 110 crore in NI line for relief on interest on interest. Non-interest income (NII) reported a sharp jump of 31% YoY, 51% QoQ to Rs 1949 crore, driven by 23% QoQ rise in fee income and treasury gains (PBT level) of Rs 898 crore vs. Rs 48 crore QoQ. Cost to income ratio declined ~258 bps YoY with 9.4% QoQ reduction in employee expenses due to lower retirement benefits due to improved interest rates. The bank made elevated provisions worth Rs 1179 crore, up 181% QoQ. Thus, PAT came in at Rs 1682 crore, slightly below our estimates.

Outlook

We maintain our BUY rating with an SOTP target price of Rs 2040 (unchanged).

Dolat Capital Market's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB reported in line NII growth of 8% YoY, impacted by high slippages and few one-offs (previous quarter’s interest reversal, compound interest waiver of Rs1.1bn). Operating profits benefitted from higher treasury gains and better fee lines, growing by 25% YoY. Sequential loan growth of 4.5% YoY was driven by HL (10% QoQ) and SME (6-7%), CV/CE (9%), and agri loans (9%).  Pro-forma slippages at 4% for 4QFY21 and 2.5% for FY21 seemed higher than peers (HDFCB/Axis/ICICI at 1.7%/3%/2.5% for FY21). KMB’s higher CoF in previous cycle and associated asset side risks could be playing out in our view. Pro forma PCR increased to 64% (from 61%), but remains below peers, which are at 70-75%

Outlook

Tweaking our forward estimates, we maintain our ACCUMULATE rating with an unrevised TP of Rs1,900 based on 3.7x FY23E ABV for the standalone bank and value of subsidiaries, implying a P/ABV of 4.9x.

The consideration paid for HKR, a special purpose vehicle owned by a consortium led by the Gayatri Group, also includes a one-time settlement for funding the debt with all the lenders, KSSF said in a statement.

The USD 1 billion KSSF is managed by Kotak Investment Advisors, which focuses on alternate assets business, and this funding and resolution of debt is the fund's first bet on the road sector.

“Acquiring controlling stake in stressed assets like HKR is in line with our overall strategy of settling lenders in full cash against their dues and taking over such projects,” KSSF chief executive Eshwar Karra said.

He said the company requires additional capex to achieve commercial operation date (COD), and it expects a turnaround in the next few years.

HKR was awarded a 25-year concession for a four-lane toll highway project of the existing Hyderabad Karimnagar Ramagundan section of State Highway One (SH1) under Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer basis by the then Andhra Pradesh government.

The 207 km toll highway project commenced operations from June 2014, but due to delays in the right of way and significant under performance of traffic vis-à-vis initial estimates, the account became a non-performing asset (NPA) with all lenders.

The existing consortium of lenders to HKR has sanctioned a one-time settlement of all the dues, subject to a Swiss Challenge Auction. Post settlement of dues, HKR will no longer be an NPA account, the KSSF statement said.

Spelling out the fund's strategy for the future, Karra said KSSF will continue to offer a full cash settlement, which he said is a much better option than non-cash options and is fully geared to fund pre-packaged solutions under IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code), as and when the rules are notified.",321,-0.014575660228729248

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after the March earnings:

HSBC | Rating: Reduce | Target: Rs 1,490

The gross NPAs remained broadly stable on QoQ basis, while loan growth recovered to positive territory.

Pressure was seen on term deposit growth. The strong capital & liquidity buffers are the positives. RoE could remain less than 12% by FY23.

Morgan Stanley | Rating: Equal-weight | Target: Cut to Rs 1,900 from Rs 2,025

The core PPoP growth was at 18% YoY, adjusted for one-time interest income reversals. The company reported steady asset quality and a strong performance by subsidiaries. We expect sustained earnings acceleration.

CLSA | Rating: Underperform | Target: Rs 1,850

The Q4 headline PPoP & PAT missed due to interest on interest reversal. The valuations are not cheap at current levels and we see better risk-reward in ICICI Bank & Axis Bank.

Credit Suisse | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,680

The growth picked up and credit costs also rose. The capital levels are strong (Tier-1 At 22%). The bank looking to accelerate growth and is open to inorganic opportunities. Rating is neutral as stock trades at 3.7x core P/B, for 13% RoE.

Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 2,130

We value the bank on a standalone basis at 4.5x its FY2023E book value and its subsidiaries at Rs 490 per share. The bank’s strong operating metrics, prudent and agile leadership team, well-capitalised balance sheet, as well as the quality of its subsidiaries (formidable players in their own segments), provide long-term value to franchises.

Dolat Capital | Rating: Accumulate | Target: Rs 1,900

The company reported in line NII growth of 8% YoY, impacted by high slippages and few one-offs (previous quarter’s interest reversal, compound interest waiver of Rs 1.1 billion).

Operating profits benefitted from higher treasury gains and better fee lines, growing 25% YoY. Sequential loan growth of 4.5% YoY was driven by HL (10% QoQ) and SME (6-7%), CV/CE (9%), and agri loans (9%).

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,900

The bank reported missed on our expectations, affected by elevated provisions and lower NII. Loan growth is showing signs of a revival, with a higher focus on Home loans. The bank continues to report steady progress in building a strong liability franchise, with the CASA ratio improving to 60% (highest in the industry).

Asset quality ratios stood stable on a sequential basis, while restructuring book stands limited at 0.19% of advances. The bank carries COVID-related provisions of Rs 12.8 billion (0.6% of advances), which provides us comfort, and estimate credit cost at 1% for FY22E (v/s 1.3% in FY21).

ICICI Direct | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 2,040

The bank's long term focus continues on maintaining risk-adjusted returns. Credit growth momentum has been maintained sequentially, which is a positive.

Recent RBI announcement of limiting MD & CEO term to 15 years may not impact the bank immediately as there is an adequate time of over 2.5 years for a smooth transition. Comfortable provision provides comfort regarding volatility in asset quality and, thus, earnings. Consistent performance over a period of time, healthy return ratios 2% RoA & 13% RoE with strong management are reasons for premium valuations.

LKP | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,900

We expect the bank’s loan book to grow at a CAGR of 10% over FY21-23E. At CMP of Rs 1725, the stock is available at 4.4(x) standalone FY23E Adj. BVPS of Rs 396. Valuing the standalone entity with 4.8xFY23E BVPS; we arrive at a target price of Rs 1900. We recommend a buy rating with a potential upside of 10%.

Kotak Mahindra Bank clocked a 32.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone profit at Rs 1,682.4 crore in the quarter ended March 2021, impacted by higher provisions. The profitability was supported by higher net interest income (NII), other income and pre-provision operating profit.

Numbers missed analysts' expectations. Profit was estimated at Rs 1,800 crore and NII at Rs 4,060 crore for the quarter, according to the average estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Net interest income in Q4 FY21 grew by 8 percent to Rs 3,842.81 crore compared to the year-ago, with moderate 1.8 percent YoY growth in advances at Rs 2.23 lakh crore during the quarter. However, net interest margin contracted to 4.39 percent from 4.72 percent in the same period.

Deposits, at Rs 2.8 lakh crore in the March quarter, grew by 6.6 percent year-on-year, missing analysts' expectations of over 10 percent growth.

Provisions and contingencies remained elevated at Rs 1,179.41 crore for the March quarter 2021, increasing 12.6 percent compared to the year-ago quarter and rose 181.8 percent QoQ.

During the quarter, the Supreme Court vacated the stay on NPA recognition and granted relief for interest on interest. Till December 2020, w.r.t cases not considered as NPA, Kotak Mahindra Bank had considered full hit for provisions and income as provisions for advances.

""Post the Supreme Court order, the bank has retrospectively, reversed income and consequently adjusted provisions and contingencies. Further, the bank has created a liability of Rs 110 crore towards estimated interest relief and has reduced the same from interest earned,"" said the bank.

The bank further said there was no fall in the COVID-19 provision during Q4 FY21. COVID-19 provisions were retained at Rs 1,279 crore as of March 2021, the bank added.

Total provisions (including specific, standard, COVID-19 related, etc.) as on March 2021 were Rs 7,021 crore, which was 95 percent of gross NPA, the bank said.

Non-interest income (other income) in Q4 FY21 surged 30.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,950 crore, while the pre-provision operating profit grew by 25 percent to Rs 3,407.5 crore compared to the year-ago quarter.

Asset quality weakened further in the March quarter with gross NPAs, as a percentage of gross advances, climbing to 3.25 percent compared to 2.26 percent in the previous quarter, while net NPA jumped to 1.21 percent at the end of Q4 FY21, compared to 0.5 percent in Q3 FY21. But gross and net NPAs dipped 2 bps and 3 bps respectively compared to proforma NPAs reported at the end of December 2020.

In the financial year FY21, the bank recorded a 17.1 percent growth in profit at Rs 6,965 crore and net interest income grew by 13.6 percent to Rs 15,340 crore compared to the previous year.

The consolidated profit of the bank stood at Rs 2,589 crore in Q4 FY21, up by 35.9 percent YoY. Subsidiary Kotak Mahindra Prime registered 14.3 percent YoY growth at Rs 184 crore, Kotak Securities' 47.9 percent growth at Rs 241 crore, and Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance' 17 percent growth at Rs 193 crore YoY.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank on May 3 is expected to report healthy growth in profit on account of lower provisions, NII and normalised credit cost YoY with stable asset quality QoQ, but sequentially, provisions may remain elevated.

Net interest income could also see double-digit growth with pick-up in loan traction. Loan growth could be 1-3 percent YoY and 4-5 percent QoQ, while deposit growth may be 8-9 percent QoQ and over 10 percent YoY.

""Net interest income momentum of 15-16 percent YoY should continue led by lowering cost of funding & strong CASA. We expect 4 percent QoQ credit growth (up 1.2 percent YoY), and 8 percent QoQ deposit growth,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher.

The brokerage further said that higher provisions are likely to improve provision coverage ratio, and slippages could keep earnings lower than last two quarters, but improvement expected on YoY basis.

The brokerage sees 34 percent YoY growth in profit with 23 percent decline in provisions, and 8.6 percent QoQ decline with 35 percent rise in provisions.

According to ICICI Direct, Kotak Bank is expected to improve its growth momentum as compared to the previous quarter from 4.5-5.0 percent QoQ, which should be driven by agri, home loans, commercial vehicle segment while corporate book can also contribute in a similar fashion as last quarter.

""Deposit growth is expected to be at 12.5 percent YoY with CASA contributing to around 59 percent to total deposits. NII is expected to show healthy 16.7 percent YoY growth aided by pick up in loan traction and around 10 bps sequential improvement in NIMs. Credit cost is expected to come in at 30 bps for the quarter,"" said the brokerage which sees 49 percent growth in profit YoY.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) final guidelines on tenure of bank CEOs (chief executive officers) will mean Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) chief Uday Kotak will have to step down by 2023-end on the expiry of his current three-year term. Although this gives the bank ample time for Kotak's exit, the RBI new rules are a cue to the major private lender to begin planning the leadership transition process.

According to the RBI rules announced on April 26, in the case of MD&CEO or WTD (whole-time director) who is also a promoter/ major shareholder, the incumbent cannot hold these posts for more than 12 years. In the case of promoter CEOs, at the sole discretion of the Reserve Bank such MD&CEO or WTDs may be allowed to continue up to 15 years. Kotak has already completed 17 years as KMB's CEO.

Kotak is at the top post of the bank since 2003-2004, when the bank started operations. By the time Kotak’s term ends on January 1, 2024, he would have completed 20 years at the post. “There is no immediate change for Kotak as he has been appointed for three years by the RBI recently for three years,” said an official at the bank who didn’t want to be named. The RBI approved Kotak's re-appointment in December last year with effect from January 1.

However, as it appears, Kotak will have to exit the post he held for two decades at the end of 2023 and hence the bank will have to begin preparations for the leadership transition soon. “Finding a successor to Kotak will not be a big challenge for the bank,” said Siddharth Purohit, analyst at SMC Global Securities in Mumbai. “The bank has a good leadership team in place,” Purohit said.

A bitter past

Earlier in 2020, Uday Kotak and RBI had a court battle over Kotak's promoter stake holding in the bank. The RBI norms stipulated that Kotak had to pare promoter stake below 20 percent before December 31, 2018 from around 30 percent. To achieve compliance, in August 2018, the bank announced the completion of perpetual noncumulative preference share issue (PNCPS), which it interpreted as cutting the promoter stake to 19.7 percent. The bank claimed it was complying with the RBI licencing norms through this deal. But here the RBI posed a question.

The regulator said preference share allotment route wasn’t sufficient to meet promoter dilution rule requirement. But the bank’s legal argument was PNCPS was part of the paid-up capital. With the impasse continuing and the deadline for stake dilution fast approaching, KMB finally decided to move the High Court of Bombay. In January last year, the RBI let KMB retain the 26 percent promoter stake with some riders.

The RBI said the promoters, Uday Kotak and family, while retaining 26 percent stake, need to cap the voting rights at 15 percent by April. KMB withdrew the case subsequently and some interpreted this as a win for Uday Kotak. In June, Kotak sold 5.6 crore shares for more than Rs 6,900 crore in a block deal, bringing down his stake to 26.1 percent, inching closer to the RBI’s stipulated level.

While this was an out-of-court settlement, some interpreted this as a win for Kotak at the end of the bitter court battle.

New RBI norms

Issuing the latest rules, the RBI said the post of the MD&CEO or WTD (whole time directors) cannot be held by the same incumbent for more than 15 years in the case of a non-promoter individual.

The RBI said after the 15-year term, the CEO will be eligible for reappointment in the same bank, if considered necessary and desirable by the board, after a minimum gap of three years, subject to meeting other conditions. During this three-year cooling period, the individual shall not be appointed or associated with the bank or its group entities in any capacity, either directly or indirectly.

In the case of promoter CEOs, at the sole discretion of the Reserve Bank, such MD&CEO or WTDs may be allowed to continue up to 15 years. While examining the matter of re-appointment of such MD&CEOs or WTDs within the 12/15 years period, the level of progress and adherence to the milestones for dilution of promoters’ shareholding in the bank shall also be factored in by the Reserve Bank, the RBI said.

The RBI also clarified that no person can continue as MD&CEO or WTD beyond the age of 70 years. Within the overall limit of 70 years, as part of their internal policy, individual bank's Boards are free to prescribe a lower retirement age for the WTDs, including the MD&CEO, the RBI said.

Going by the 15-year cap rule, Shyam Srinivasan, MD&CEO of Kerala-based Federal Bank and RBL Bank MD& CEO, Vishwavir Ahuja, both will have time till 2025 as both officials have completed a decade in their roles as chief executives. Similarly, Chandrashekhar Ghosh of Bandhan Bank has completed five years as CEO of the Kolkata-based bank, meaning he will have ten more years (non-promoter CEOs are allowed for 15 years), before his term comes to end, which is 2030.

Announcing the rules, the RBI also capped the upper age limit for non-executive directors (NEDs), including the Chair of the board, at 75 years and after attaining the age of 75 years no person can continue in these positions, the RBI said.

The total tenure of an NED, continuously or otherwise, on the board of a bank, shall not exceed eight years. After completing eight years on the board of a bank, the person may be considered for re-appointment only after a minimum gap of three years, the RBI said. This will not preclude him/her from being appointed as a director in another bank subject to meeting the requirements, the RBI said.",982,0.815952718257904

“This has resulted in excess debit from customers’ bank accounts on March 8. All such excess debits have already been reversed,” Rao said.

Kotak did not specify the name of the PSU bank.

On March 8, a few customers of the bank took to Twitter to complain of excess debits from their Kotak Mahindra Bank accounts.

Technical glitches have happened with multiple banks in the recent months inviting the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to pay attention. Banks like HDFC Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) have reported technical snags in the recent months.

In December 2020, the RBI asked HDFC bank to temporarily stop all launches of the digital business generating activities planned under its program ‐ Digital 2.0 - and other proposed business generating IT applications and sourcing of new credit card customers. In addition, the RBI asked the bank’s board to examine the lapses and fix accountability.

This happened after a major digital outage reported by HDFC Bank on November 21, 2020, when all transactions through HDFC's credit/debit cards, internet banking, UPI, IMPS, and other modes of payment failed. The bank quickly swung into action and rectified the issue but not without leaving a question mark on the reliability of HDFC Bank digital channels.

SBI, too, reported outages on its digital banking channel, Yono, in 2020.",311,-0.9846607446670532

C/I ratio declined ~790 bps YoY but was up ~380 bps QoQ to 42.3% as promotional, advertisement expenses increased with increasing business activity.

YES Securities' research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB delivered a better-than-expected core operating performance, reflected in marginal beat on core PPOP (up 33% yoy and reversion of core PPOP margin to pre-Covid level) and significantly lower credit cost. The latter was underpinned by a strong asset quality performance that was manifested in restrained 60bps sequential increase in proforma Gross NPLs (to 3.3%), marginal one-time restructuring at 0.28% of net advances and lower SMA-2 book at 31 bps of net advances. On the proforma NPLs, KMB provided for interest accrued but not collected even for the moratorium period. As the bank did not dip into its Covid buffer, it was stable at Rs12.8bn (60 bps of advances).  After delivering a strong broad-based 4.5% qoq growth (slower traction in CV/CE and unsecured retail), which was a seven-quarter high, the management sees momentum sustaining in large segments of Mortgages, Agri Finance and Corporate lending. The deposits mix trends remain impressive with incremental gains on CASA (59% of deposits) and granularization. The improvement in LDR (utilization of excess BS liquidity) will aid NIM in coming quarters and this along with normalization of credit cost will drive a solid earnings performance.



Outlook

We estimate 20% earnings CAGR for KMB during FY20-23 with a 20-30 bps expansion in RoA. RoE improvement will be contingent on the pace of growth. The core bank trades at 3.5x FY23 P/ABV, at 20-25% premium to HDFC Bank, thus scope for a large re-rating is restricted. We retain BUY rating and upgrade price target to Rs2,005.

Sharekhan's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s (KMB) Q3FY2021 numbers were healthy, with strong operational numbers, improved asset quality (on a sequential basis), healthy CASA, and advances traction, which were positives. The bank’s gross NPA ratio and net NPA ratio (proforma basis) would have been 3.27% and 1.24%, respectively (was 2.7% and 0.7% in Q2FY2021); but proactive front-loading of provisions with restructured assets at 0.28% indicate stable asset-quality outlook. The bank’s management commentary is more positive on growth, also seen in strong sequential growth in advances, which is encouraging.

Outlook

We value the standalone bank at ~4.5x its FY2023E book value and its subsidiaries at ~Rs. 490 per share. We recommend a Buy on KMB with an SOTP-based price target (PT) of Rs. 2,130.

Dolat Capital Market's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB reported in line numbers with NII and PPoP growing by 17% and 29% respectively. Sequential loan growth of 4.5% YoY surprised positively. Pro-forma NPAs were higher sequentially by ~60 bps to 3.27%, with pro-forma PCR at ~61%. However, bank’s COVID related provision buffers of Rs12.8bn remain unutilized thus far. Pro forma slippages at ~Rs19bn for the quarter or 3.79% (annualized) had a disproportionate share of unsecured consumer retail loans, with 40% of incremental stress coming from this segment against its loan-book share of 6%. Total restructured portfolio (including invocations) is likely to be ~0.3% of loans and remains below industry. Excluding PL and CV segments, sequential growth was broad based including a healthy growth in corporate book of over 6.5%. ECLGS disbursements stood at Rs97bn or 4.7% of advances. The bank has a market share of 5.5% in the total industry ECLGS disbursements against KMB’s advances market share of ~2%.



Outlook

Our earnings upgrade for FY21E is largely led by decline in credit costs, while that for FY22/23E more impacted by operating efficiencies. We maintain our ACCUMULATE rating with a revised TP of Rs1,900 based on 3.9x Dec-22E ABV for the standalone bank and value of subsidiaries, implying a P/ABV of 5.0x.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank is expected to report more than 20 percent year-on-year growth in profit and over 15 percent rise in net interest income for the quarter ended December 2020, with sequentially stable asset quality.

Pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) is likely to be strong with growth of more than 30 percent YoY aided by lower cost to income ratio (which could be around 39 percent in Q3 FY21), but loan growth may be under pressure.

""NII is expected to grow by meagre 17 percent YoY on account of the slowdown in the advance growth and lower NIM due to high liquidity. Advance growth is expected to moderate to -2 percent YoY with focus of bank being more on balancesheet strength rather than short term profitability,"" said Narnolia Financial Services which expects profit growth at 24 percent and PPoP growth of 38 percent YoY.

Motilal Oswal also feels loan growth at (-3.3) percent to remain under pressure, but deposits may show healthy traction, rising in double-digit, while profit growth is expected to be around 20.4 percent and PPoP at 33.5 percent in Q3FY21 YoY.

""Asset quality of the bank is expected to remain moderately effected however the guidance on potential slippages going forward needs to be tracked,"" said Narnolia said.

Private sector Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) on December 14 said the RBI has approved the re-appointment of Uday Kotak as managing director of the bank for a further period of three years. The banking sector regulator also approved the appointment of part-time chairman Prakash Apte for three years.

""The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has vide its letter dated 14th December 2020, granted approval for the re-appointments of Prakash Apte as Part-time Chairman; Uday Kotak as MD & CEO; and Dipak Gupta as Joint MD for a period of 3 years, with effect from January 1, 2021,"" the bank said in a regulatory filing.

It may be noted that the board of the bank and the shareholders had approved these re-appointments, subject to the approval of the RBI, at their respective meetings held on May 13, 2020, and August 18, 2020, the filing said.

Kotak is founder managing director and promoter of the bank, while Apte was appointed as the part-time Chairman of the bank at the annual general meeting held on July 19, 2018, for a period from July 20, 2018, till December 31, 2020.",198,

PNCPS is a type of financial instrument which pays a fixed dividend to investors as long as the company is in business.

Announcing the statement on developmental and regulatory policies on December 4, the RBI had said that banks cannot make any dividend payouts from the profits pertaining to the financial year 2019-20. This is in order to further strengthen the banks’ balance sheets while at the same time supporting lending to the real economy, the regulator said.

This was after the regulator observed that in the context of the ongoing stress and the heightened uncertainty on account of COVID-19, it is imperative that banks continue to conserve capital to support the economy and absorb losses.

The RBI has now said that the restriction on dividend payments also applies to perpetual non-cumulative preference shares as well.

In August 2018, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a stock exchange filing that its Board has ""approved the allotment of 100,00,00,000 Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) to eligible investors at the issue price of Rs 5 per PNCPS, aggregating to Rs 500 crore pursuant to the issue.""

Subsequent to this issue, the paid-up capital of the bank has increased from Rs 953.16 crore to Rs 1,453.16 crore and the promoter holding is 19.70 percent of the paid-up capital, it said.

Kotak's holding in the bank prior to the preference share issuance was 29.74 percent.

Also, the RBI plans to restrict even non-banks from paying dividends saying different categories of NBFCs would be allowed to declare dividend as per a matrix of parameters, subject to a set of generic conditions.

Yesterday, in a draft circular, the regulator proposed draft rules for NBFCs to declare dividend. According to the draft, deposit-taking NBFCs and systemically important non-deposit taking NBFCs should have Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) of at least 15 percent for the last three years, including the accounting year for which it proposes to declare dividend.

Also, the net non-performing asset (NPA) ratio should be less than 6 percent in each of the last three years, including the accounting year for which it proposes to declare dividend, the RBI said. Non-Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking NBFC should have leverage ratio of less than 7 for the last three years, including the accounting year for which it proposes to declare dividend, the RBI said.

Unlike banks, currently there are no guidelines in place with regard to the distribution of dividend by NBFCs.",430,-0.0033600926399230957

Kotak Mahindra Bank share price gained in the early trade on November 26 despite broking house Motilal Oswal downgrading the stock as the risk-reward is unfavorable after the sharp outperformance.

The sharp outperformance in the stock (aided by MSCI inclusion) when seen in the context of growth outlook and return ratios (average RoE of 12.7 percent over FY21-23E) drives us to downgrade our rating to neutral, said Motilal Oswal.

It revised the target price to Rs 1,800 per share.

The company has delivered a 32 percent return since Oct’20 upgrade, resulting in a sharp expansion in trading multiples to 4.2x FY22E ABV – a 17% premium to its five-year average trading multiple, it added.

The management expects an improvement in asset growth after doing an exemplary job in building a robust liability franchise, while Motilal Oswal expect loan growth to sustain at 12 percent CAGR over FY21-23E.

YES Securities' research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

We raise FY21/22 earnings and ABV estimates by 10-12% and 2.5-3% respectively on the back of material upgrade in PPOP expectations (higher NII and lower cost growth now) and significant reduction in credit cost assumption. The latter being underpinned by low impeding and susceptible flow (small SC-order slippage pool and SMA-2 + robust customer asset mix with only 6% coming from unsecured products) and management commentary on current Covid buffer (62 bps of adv.) being adequate to address potential stress. We estimate the stand-alone bank to deliver 20-22% earnings CAGR on a 6-7% loan CAGR over FY20-22 because of expansion in core PPOP margin.

Outlook

We see no deterioration in RoA for the current year despite higher provisions and expect profitability to improve to life-time high in FY22. KMB has underperformed in recent months and its valuation premium to HDFCB has dissipated. Expect valuation to re-rate from current 3x FY22 P/ABV is response to likely continuation of non-linear earnings growth. Upgrade rating to BUY and 12m PT to Rs1,670.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB delivered a strong 27% YoY growth in earnings at Rs21.8bn (PLe: Rs14.9bn) which were much above ours and consensus estimates. Strong beat was on back of (i) continued NII traction of 17% YoY despite loan book flattish QoQ & -4% YoY (ii) recovery in fees (iii) higher treasury income (had not booked in Q1FY21) and (iv) substantially lower provisioning than expectations. Strong liability franchise build-up over the years has significantly benefitted funding cost which is now amongst the lowest in the industry, but growth has been quite selective as management continues to outweigh risks to growth. With a strong liability franchise in place, high capital and steady asset quality keeps our view constructive, although balance on loan growth has to improve from here on.

Outlook

We retain ACCUMULATE with revised TP of Rs1,503 (from Rs1,389) based on 3.1x core Sep-22 BV & Rs293 for subs (rolled over from Mar-22).

Including standstill NPAs, slippages would have been ~1.1% and gross NPA would be stable QoQ at 2.7%. PCR increased by ~700 bps QoQ to 76% and stood at ~72% on a pro forma basis, implying healthy recoveries and low write-offs during the quarter. Standard loan cover stood at 0.6% of advances as of Sep-end, same as last quarter. Management noted that the stock of provisions the bank held was adequate and conservative. Despite weak growth trends, continued moderation in CoF has aided NII growth. Growth should not be a challenge eventually, given the comfort on CoF. We expect incremental asset quality risks to be limited for KMB owing to its conservative stance on lending and strong risk practices.

Outlook

However, trading at 4.1x 1 year forward ABV, valuations factor in most positives. Rolling over our estimates to Sep22E, we maintain our ACCUMULATE rating with a revised TP of Rs1,580 (from Rs1450 earlier) based on 3.3x Sep-22E ABV for the standalone bank and value of subsidiaries, implying a P/ABV of 4.5x.

Rolling over our estimates to Sep22E, it maintains 'accumulate' rating with a revised TP of Rs 1,580 (from Rs 1450 earlier) based on 3.3x Sep-22E ABV for the standalone bank and value of subsidiaries, implying a P/ABV of 4.5x.

Motilal Oswal

Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a strong quarter, with lower provisions and higher treasury income driving earnings. The bank continues to report steady progress in building a strong liability franchise, with the CASA ratio improving further to ~57 percent. Loan growth remains flattish as the bank remain cautious in a weak macro environment, however, a strengthening liability franchise would improve the bank's competitive positioning and aid asset growth.

Motilal Oswal increases its FY21/FY22 earnings by 27 percent/20percent, led by steady revenues and sharp decline in provisioning expenses and introduce FY23 to our estimates. It upgrades rating to 'buy' after 10 quarters and revises teh target price to Rs 1,650 (3.2x Sep'22E ABV + Rs 493 for subs).

ICICIdirect

The bank's long-term focus continues on maintaining risk-adjusted returns. With a shift in focus, ICICIdirect expects growth to pick up gradually in certain segments before gathering a higher pace in the medium term. Adequate provision provides comfort to deal with volatility in asset quality.

With levers present for sustained growth in earnings and the bank being well placed on the capital front to drive business growth, making it an attractive franchisee. The bank has been a consistent performer, driven by reasonable RoE, high RoA ratios and strong margin profile. Hence, premium valuations for management strength, sustainability. It maintains 'buy' rating with SOTP target price of Rs 1634, valuing at 3.9x FY22E.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank is expected to see around 20 percent year-on-year decline in its Q2 FY21 profit due to a potential spike in provisions.

The growth in net interest income could also slow down to around 12 percent year-on-year with moderate loan growth and a slight contraction in net interest margin for the quarter ended September 2020.

The pre-provision in operating profit (PPoP) growth is also expected to moderate to little over 10 percent YoY due to slow growth in net interest income and other income, supported by controlled operating expenses.

""We expect net interest margin to dip, on account of asset side re-pricing and a lower cost-to-deposit ratio. NIMs will be partially cushioned by the recent drop in saving account rates and the recent fundraise. We expect NII growth of 12.6 percent YoY (up 1 percent QoQ),"" said HDFC Securities.

""With controlled operating expenses growth PPoP is expected to grow at 10.5 percent YoY and 5.6 percent QoQ. We have factored in higher provisions (up 2.3x YoY and flat QoQ). Consequently, PAT is expected to de-grow 20.7 percent YoY but up 10 percent QoQ,"" the brokerage added.

Asset quality issues are expected to remain in control and credit cost are expected to come down sequentially as provisions come down too, Prabhudas Lilladher said.

Motilal Oswal also feels asset quality is likely to remain largely stable, with gross non-performing assets at around 2.8 percent and net NPA at 0.9 percent. The brokerage sees 20 percent decline profit but expects 12.6 percent growth in NII and 10.1 percent in PPoP.

Key things to watch out for would be comments on growth and overall stress, additional provisions towards COVID-19/ increase in PCR and performance of subsidiaries.

The stock has not seen major movement during the September quarter and financial year 2020-21, falling 6.8 percent and rising 6.7 percent respectively, though it gained 26 percent from March lows. Asset quality concerns weighed overall on banking stocks.

Das is appreciative of banks for maintaining operational continuity in COVID-19 times.

But, reading between the lines, the key message from the governor, also a former finance secretary in the central government, seems to be that banks should resume lending.

That's exactly what the government, the majority owner in state-run banks, also wants. Das wants lenders to identify sunrise sectors that have the potential to bounce back.

“Being overly risk-averse is self-defeating for banks,” said Das.

How will banks take this advice?

Let’s look at the bank credit flow scenario so far.

On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, non-food bank credit growth at 6.7 percent in June 2020 was nearly the same as in May 2020 but lower than the growth of 11.1 percent in June 2019.

Credit growth to agriculture and allied activities increased by 2.4 percent in June 2020 as compared with a higher growth of 8.7 percent in June 2019. Of this, credit growth to industry grew by 2.2 percent in June 2020 as compared with 6.4 percent growth in June 2019.

Within industries, credit to large industries increased by 3.7 percent in June 2020 as compared with 7.6 percent in June 2019.

Remember, these are the latest bank credit growth figures.

The RBI started infusing massive amount of liquidity into the banking system in March last week. There has been a total of 115 basis points reduction in RBI’s key lending rate since then.

The RBI has launched multiple rounds of targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO) and special liquidity facilities. Despite all these measures, bank credit growth isn’t picking up.

Why?

As Das said, the villain in the story is high risk aversion. In an adverse economic scenario, banks become cautious in taking fresh exposure to companies. This is because the assumption is that the demand slump will stay for a prolonged period and continue to hurt the cash flows of companies. This could lead to fresh loan defaults.

Banks do not want additional non-performing assets (NPAs) to burden their balance sheets. Already the Indian banking system is saddled with huge amount of sticky loans. Total Gross NPAs stood at 8.5 percent as on March, 2020.

In its latest financial stability report, the RBI said the gross NPAs could jump to 14.7 percent by March 2021 in a worst case scenario. This means out of every Rs 100 lent by banks, Rs 14.7 will not come back.

Why banks fear bad loans?

That’s because if a loan turns bad, banks need to set aside significant amount of money to cover these losses in the form of provisions. This affects banks profitability.

This isn’t the first time the RBI has stressed on the need for banks to shed risk aversion.

Also Read: RBI's annual report: Central bank says Indian banking 'has to be liberated' from high risk aversion

In its latest annual report, the central bank said “Indian banking has to be liberated from the risk aversion that is impeding the flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy and undermining the role of banks as the principal financial intermediaries in the economy.”

Will banks pay heed to RBI’s demand?

There are two views among banks on whether this is the right time to restart lending or not. For example, take a look at country’s two top bankers— SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar and Kotak Mahindra CEO, Uday Kotak. Kumar is of the view that this is the best time to lend but Kotak says his bank would be very cautious in giving new loans.

Those banks, with high moratorium loan book (indicating chances of high potential stress if economy doesn’t improve soon) and already high chunk of bad loans, may not heed to RBI’s request in the immediate future.

These banks, mainly private sector lenders, may continue to be extra cautious and selective in giving fresh loans.

On the other hand, PSBs which are directly under the control of government, may step up lending under government pressure to boost economic growth. Both will be risky bets.",722,-0.6818139232121981

Private-sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank is scaling down its partnership business built on Unified Payments Interface (UPI), according to two sources. Kotak Bank will no longer partner with payment startups to offer settlements over UPI payments made through those apps and is also understood to have shut down the BHIM KotakPay app and removed it from Play Store, the sources added.

At a time when UPI as a payment mode is growing, for a new-age private-sector lender to roll back its offerings on the platform is an interesting move. It highlights two major points. One, while UPI as a payment mode is growing, revenue generation on transactions remains a question. Secondly, a large chunk of UPI transactions is concentrated between the likes of Google Pay, PhonePe and Paytm.

There is no merchant discount rate on UPI. Further P2P transactions are primarily free of cost. Kotak was one of the first banks to introduce charges on even P2P transactions. While the first 20 transactions were free, from the 21st, the bank charged Rs 2.5 for payments upto Rs 1,000 and Rs 5 for payments above that.

“Kotak has shut down its partnership business on UPI and has also taken off a separate UPI app it had from the Play Store,” said one of the sources.

The sources also pointed out that Khaalijeb, which was working with Kotak for its UPI partnership, has been asked to wind up the integration by middle of September. As per the NPCI website on third-party apps, Khaalijeb was using @kmbl handle in partnership with the bank.

""The bank had aggressive targets for its partners, but given the competitive market conditions, not much could be achieved in terms of market share, which could be the reason for this scale down,"" said the second source.

The bank did not directly comment on queries from Moneycontrol. However, Deepak Sharma, chief digital officer at the bank, said they are committed to the PSP business and not exiting it, the bank continues to be an active participant in the ecosystem and has a large network of strategic partners across categories, including payments.

“With our connected banking platform, we continue to onboard new partners and routinely evaluate existing relationships. UPI is an important part of the payment ecosystem and our innovative solutions power various enterprise and payment service providers,” he added.

The bank continues to work with MSwipe for the merchant acquiring business and is working with Setu to ramp up its API platforms, he said.

The bank was offering UPI payments through the mobile banking app, its dedicated UPI app, and through Khaalijeb, which is a third-party app provider. While the mobile banking app continues to offer all forms of UPI payments, the link to download the Kotakpay app had turned void and Khaalijeb partnership is being wound up.

The beauty of UPI as a payment mode was that banks could offer the backend settlement but the front end could be offered by any third party application. That is where tech giants like Google, Facebook and PhonePe built their payments business.

Google Pay works with four large banks -- HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, State Bank of India and ICICI Bank. Facebook, which offers WhatsApp Payments, is piloting currently with ICICI Bank and PhonePe offers through both ICICI Bank and Yes Bank.

“If you look at the share, these top five banks have almost 90 percent UPI payments flowing between them,” said one of the sources mentioned above.

From Kotak’s standpoint, it can continue to offer UPI payments to its customers through the mobile banking app. Further, it can leverage UPI through the @kotak handle for all other services, like auto-debit, subscriptions for IPO and the like.",617,0.3265373508135478

Wherever possible, the government must do whatever it takes to build exports, since it indicates the economy's ability to be competitive, veteran banker Uday Kotak said as he charted out ways to regain control over Indian markets that was 'systematically' captured by China.

Speaking to The Economic Times, Uday Kotak said ""wherever there is a possibility for the government, we must do whatever it takes to build exports because exports are a true proof of our ability to be competitive and things like delays in payments from the government or committed incentives are something which I would strongly urge the government to move on that fairly so that there is a consistent message that India is competitive on exports"".

The Kotak Mahindra Bank Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, or push for self-reliance of the economy.

""In terms of focus areas, I was happy with his particular focus on infrastructure and the integrated approach that he has taken. He said let us not look at infrastructure in bits and pieces and verticals,' he told the publication.

Kotak, who recently took over as president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), also gave some insight into India's dependence on Chinese imports.

""I have talked to many members of CII and members of Indian industry and they have said that in the last 10 to 15 years sector after sector, segment after segment, China has been able to dramatically under-price its goods and many Indian manufacturers have gone out of business. Once they have captured that market, in some cases, they have also increased pricing thereafter after domestic manufacturing has gone away,"" he told The Economic Times.

Kotak also shared his thoughts on the world after COVID-19, which has hurt businesses and economies across the globe.

""I genuinely believe we are no longer moving to a new normal, we are moving to a world in finance, technology and business to a never normal world,"" he said.",346,0.28808977206548053

Ajay Peter Kerkar, Director and Group CEO of Cox & Kings, told The Times of India the investigation “is an inquiry”.

Axis Bank in its complaint alleged that some office bearers of Cox & Kings and its sister-concerns cheated the bank of Rs 1,030 crore after availing loans, which were not repaid.

In its complaint, Kotak Mahindra Bank alleged that the travel company in “manifold transactions” managed to “siphon off huge sums … from banks, financial institutions and public investors” through subsidiaries and offshore companies. The bank added that it extended financial services to Cox & Kings since 2012 and outstanding amount till June 24, 2019 was Rs 174.3 crore.

Moneycontrol could not confirm the development independently.

Following the default, banks assigned PriceWaterhouse-Coopers (PWC) to undertake a forensic audit. Two of these draft reports found “irregularities and fraudulent practices of some of office bearers of the travel company,” it said.

PWC’s first draft report for Kotak said the bank had “all reason” to believe that receivable Rs 449 crore from 15 parties were “fictitious” as these parties had common addresses, were created on the same day, and were not found at mentioned address during physical visit.

First information report (FIR) for both cases is yet to be registered.

Dolat Capital's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB reported a healthy operating performance with NII and core PPoP growing at 17% YoY each. Nil treasury gains impacted overall PPoP. Loan growth declined YoY by 2% (7% QoQ) and has been a key dampener for NIM (down 30 bps QoQ), apart from surplus liquidity. Moratorium at 9.7% declined from 26% in April-end, where the bank has extended moratorium 2.0 only to fundamentally viable customers, 80% of which are secured. Total COVID-19 related provisions stood at 0.6% of advances for the bank. Despite weak loan growth, continued moderation in CoF supports NII growth. Given the comfort on CoF, growth should not be a challenge for the bank eventually. KMB’s conservative stance on lending and strong risk practices should result in relatively lower asset quality risks in our view.

Outlook

However, valuations look rich. We maintain ACCUMULATE rating with an unrevised TP of Rs1,450 based on 3.3x FY22E ABV for the standalone bank

KMB reported a mixed quarter with weak earnings performance, affected by lower fee income, 32bp QoQ decline in margins and sharp sequential decline in loan growth. On the asset quality front, slippages were elevated, driving 45bp QoQ increase in GNPA ratio while provision coverage remained broadly stable. Moratorium 2.0 declined to 9.65% with 95% coming from moratorium 1.0. However, moratorium figures are not comparable due to a different computation methodology used across banks. - On the business front, loan book declined 7% QoQ, affected by the (a) lockdown, and (b) bank’s cautious approach in a weak macro environment. SA deposits’ growth was steady, driving further improvement in CASA mix to 56.7%.

Outlook

We have cut our PAT estimate for FY21/22E by 10%/11%, primarily to factor in higher credit cost, lower growth and other income. Maintain Neutral.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB’s s’lone earnings of Rs12.4bn (PLe: Rs15.7 bn) was a miss on back of slightly higher provisions and lower other income (as bank did not book any treasury gains). NII growth of 18% YoY stood out despite loan growth being flattish YoY as bank has been materially benefitting from lowering cost of funding (150bps SA rate cut in 3 months). Moratorium has come off to 9.65% v/s 26% in May with certain collections to be made from Morat 1.0, but could add to stress eventually from H2FY21 onwards. We continue to build 80-100bps of credit cost and 150bps of slippages in FY21/FY22E respectively. In our view, the bank has a very resilient balance sheet to any shock with strong capital ratios, improved liability franchise over last 2 years and ability to manage asset quality.

Outlook

We retain ACCUMULATE with TP of Rs1,389 (from Rs1,343) based on 3.1x core Mar-22 BV & Rs275 for subs.

India's fourth-largest private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has reported an 8.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in standalone net profit for the quarter ended June 2020, dented by higher provisions, primarily with respect to COVID-19, and lower other income.

Profit declined to Rs 1,244.45 crore, which was on expected lines given the higher COVID-19 related provisions, compared to Rs 1,360.2 crore reported in the year-ago quarter.

Net interest income increased by 17.8 percent YoY to Rs 3,723.85 crore during June quarter 2020 which matched analysts' expectations. Net interest margin came in at 4.4 percent for the quarter against 4.48 percent in Q1 FY20.

During the June quarter, the bank raised Rs 7,442 crore through a QIP issuance of 6.5 crore equity shares.

Deposits grew by 12.3 percent YoY to Rs 2,61,524 crore in Q1 FY21, but loan book declined 1.9 percent to Rs 2,03,998 crore.

""Average savings deposits crossed Rs 1 lakh crore, growing by 34 percent to Rs 1,05,673 crore in Q1 FY21 compared to Rs 78,654 crore in Q1 FY20. Average current account deposits grew by 10 percent to Rs 36,066 crore in Q1 FY21 compared to Rs 32,679 crore for Q1 FY20,"" said the bank.

CASA ratio as on June 2020 stood at 56.7 percent versus 50.7 percent in June 2019.

Asset quality weakened during the quarter with gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances rising 45 bps sequentially to 2.7 percent, while net NPAs rose 16 bps QoQ to 0.87 percent in Q1.

Slippages for the quarter were at Rs 796 crore which was higher than Rs 491 crore in March quarter 2020 and Rs 751 crore in June quarter last year.

""Moratorium 2 (June-August) is 9.65 percent of loan book as of June 2020, which included 9.15 percent from moratorium 1 (March-May). Around 80 percent of moratorium 2 book is secured,"" Kotak Mahindra Bank said in its BSE filing.

Provisions and contingencies shot up 203.7 percent to Rs 962.01 crore compared to the year-ago quarter, but the same declined 8.2 percent on a YoY basis.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank's earnings may take a hit due to higher provisions and lower other income, but there could be improvement in asset quality and fall in slippages QoQ.

It is scheduled to announce numbers on July 27.

Brokerages expect profit to witness flattish to moderate de growth in the quarter ended June 2020 as provisions for bad loans are expected to increase by 2.5 to 3 times over a year-ago period due to COVID-19 related provisions, but pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) may increase more than 10 percent YoY.

Net interest income is seen rising around 16-18 percent YoY with loan growth at around 7 percent, brokerages feel.

""We expect loan growth to remain moderate at around 7 percent and margins to improve slightly to around 4.8 percent, while liability franchise is expected to remain strong with higher CASA and asset quality may remain stable with gross non-performing assets at around 2.3 percent,"" said Motilal Oswal which sees profit falling 3 percent and NII rising 18 percent YoY.

HDFC Securities feels profit is seen flattish YoY as it has factored in higher provisions (up 2.8x YoY), but it expects NII growth of 17 percent YoY with loan growth moderated to sub-7 percent.

The brokerage also sees healthy core earnings, as controlled 11 percent operating expenses growth will lead to 14 percent growth in PPoP.

""Despite sharp drop in CD ratio, we expect NIMs to improve sequentially. This will be boosted by the sharp drop in saving account deposits rate and recent fund raise,"" said HDFC Securities which feels details on the moratorium, comments on macros and the financial sector, deposits inflows after the drop in saving account rates and performance of subsidiaries would be key things to watch out for.",303,0.994898647069931

Top five private sector banks may see their slippages double to 5 percent this fiscal due to the poor loan offtake and the moratorium-driven contraction in net interest margins, warns a report.

These five banks-- HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank--collectively control a quarter of the system and three-fourths of the private banking space, according to a report by India Ratings on Friday.

""We forecast FY21 slippages to nearly double to around 5 percent for these banks from 2.3 percent in FY19 and 2.7 percent in FY20, even though net slippages would be lower if refinancing remains a challenge, resulting in a 4 percent contraction in their net interest margin,"" says the report.

As loan demand remains tepid, banks are parking their excess liquidity in low yielding alternatives such as government bonds and top-rated corporate securities due to their higher credit risk perception and widening duration spreads, even as deposit inflows have been robust.

On the other hand, growth in deposits for these top five private banks in FY20 was 18.8 percent which was 18.5 percent in FY19, while loan growth declined to 15 percent from 19.1 percent during this period.

Additionally, the Reserve Bank has injected Rs 1.7 lakh crore of liquidity into the system over the last six months through open market operations and secondary market purchases.

Without quantifying, the report expects a significant spike in delinquent assets due to the deep troubles the economy is facing due to the impact of the GDP destruction on the banking sector in the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally, banks have moved a large amount of the surplus liquidity into reverse repo where the rates have declined by 215 bps in the last one year, yielding 3.35 percent and with cost of funds falling to 5-6 percent, this could result in a negative carry.

Over FY17-FY20, net advances of these five private banks and bank credit grew at a CAGR of 15.7 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively, while the unsecured retail portfolio grew at a CAGR of 21.8 percent, and these give banks have increased the proportion of unsecured retail portfolio over the same period.

Analysts at the agency also expect pre-provisioning operating profit or operating buffers of these lenders to be about 80 bps lower than their steady state pre-provisioning operating profit, which in FY20 was 4.9 percent which may curtail their ability to withstand credit costs without capital erosion, the report warned.

Analysts at the agency attributed fall in operating buffers as outcomes of lower portfolio yields due to an increase in slippages; poor loan growth and transaction volumes and the resultant lower fee and other income; slower pace of repricing for deposits reflecting the falling interest rates; and higher liquidity deployed in low earning government securities or under reverse repos.

Stating that the impact of the rising bad loans “will not be benign,” the report notes that this comes at a time when sector was putting its house in order after the last six painful years on the corporate side, even though retail, SME and agri loans were already showing up pain areas before the pandemic hit all of us.",540,-0.7744582951068878

The financial sector needs recapitalisation as it will witness erosion of capital due to increase in bad loans caused by the COVID-19 crisis, Kotak Mahindra Bank MD Uday Kotak said.

He further said there will be costs that cannot be borne by businesses or the government, and these will be borne by the financial sector.

""The banking sector's loan book is about Rs 100 lakh crore and the total capital of all banks in India is about Rs 11 to 12 lakh crore. So, if 4-5 per cent of loans turn bad due to COVID, the capital position of the banking sector will get impacted by about 40 per cent,"" Kotak said in the company's latest Annual Report.

""There will be some mark-to-market gains as bond yields have dropped. Still, the financial sector will need to be recapitalised,"" he added.

The bank raised Rs 7,400 crore through Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in May.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""This additional capital will support the bank in dealing with contingencies or financing business opportunities (organic and / or inorganic),"" he said.

Kotak also said the government has announced a set of reform oriented and supply side packages and the Reserve Bank has been proactive with its actions.

Considering the stimulus measures announced so far, he said India's consolidated Centre plus state fiscal deficit could reach 11-12 per cent of GDP.

""One question that foxes everyone is why the capital markets are buoyant globally even as we see a slowdown across geographies. First, there has been a significant monetary expansion by central banks worldwide,"" he said.

Besides, investors and analysts have already discounted earnings downside for FY 2021 and are looking at earnings of FY 2022 and FY 2023.

""Similarly, I believe the government and industry should not worry too much about the current fiscal year's slowdown and instead plan and work towards a medium-term growth strategy,"" he said.

Talking about the performance of the bank, Kotak said its ""strong and trusted deposit franchise is one of our most prized assets. As on March 31, 2020, savings deposits crossed Rs 1 lakh crore, growing by 21 per cent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.""

While the big boys of India Inc like RIL, Bharti Airtel and Kotak Mahindra Bank are cruising through the lockdown period with ease, small-cap and mid-cap entities are facing severe cash flow and valuation issues.

Here is what PVR Ltd, the nation’s largest operator of multi-screen theatres, has to say.

“Since all cinemas are shut, the company is not generating any revenue from operations while we continue to incur committed cash outflows, including salary payouts, overheads as well as payments for older working capital,” it said in a communication to the stock exchanges on June 8.

Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail is another example. The company has seen a dramatic drop in footfalls at stores and plunging sales from the second week of March.

“Eventually, it had to shut down its entire retail network through the month in line with the nationwide lockdown. This had an adverse impact on the quarterly performance,” the company said on May 27.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chief Ajay Tyagi and team is aware of the woes of the smaller players and has taken several steps to help the companies.

Sebi has relaxed the fund-raising norms by amending the Takeover Code and the ICDR ( Issue of Capital & Disclosure ) Regulations. The new rules were notified on June 16.

In the last few months, Sebi had already taken a few other steps like extending the approval validity for launching IPOs by six months, relaxing the norms for changing the size of fresh issues, widening the eligibility for companies to fast-track rights issues, slashing broker turnover fees and filing charges for issuers, and directing listed companies to disclose the impact of COVID-19 on their operations.

Subsequently, the Ajay Bijli-promoted PVR approved a Rs 300 crore-rights issue while bracing for a “significant negative impact on profitability and liquidity during lockdown and even thereafter till business comes to normalcy.” Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail is also planning a rights issue.

WILL THE TWEAKS TO THE TAKEOVER CODE ENTHUSE PROMOTERS?

The changes to the takeover code will now allow promoters to acquire up to 10 per cent in their firms (as compared to 5 per cent earlier, referred to as a creeping acquisition) in a financial year without an open offer.

Promoters, however, can do that only through a preferential issue of shares and after pumping in fresh capital. A preferential issue is a sale of shares by a firm to a select group of investors, and is considered one of the swiftest ways to raise capital.

The move is valid till March 31, 2021.

Sandip Bhagat, partner at law firm S&R Associates, says it’s a welcome move as it would offer promoters more flexibility and help listed companies to raise fresh funds from promoters in these tough times. This step is also a breather to companies which were finding it difficult to access debt financing and equity financing.

But the jury is out on whether the limited relaxation of an additional 5 per cent would be sufficient for companies.

“The doubling of head room for creeping acquisition, solely for promoters and solely for the infusion of fresh money into the company seems like a nudge to enable money being invested into business instead of being spent on buying shares,” says securities law expert and advocate Somasekhar Sundaresan.

In the current environment, businesses are looking at shareholders to tap fund-raising avenues and create adequate liquidity buffers.

“Promoters with deep pockets could bring in funds and ensure cash flow in trying times like now. It’s the first attempt at a fixed-term provision with a sunset clause just for this financial year. It would be interesting to see if it is put to use,” Sundaresan adds.

Many corporates have warmed up to rights issues (issue of shares at a special price for existing shareholders) in recent months, which have seen promoters lapping up residual or renounced shares.

Even private equity firms are focusing more on the operations of their portfolio firms.

“While rights issue was one avenue, one limitation for listed companies was the inability to raise capital from promoters in excess of 5 per cent in a financial year without a mandatory open offer for another 26 per cent. SEBI has been intelligent enough to help companies by making this relaxation,” says Aakash Choubey, Partner, Khaitan & Co.

THE PRICING FACTOR

Pricing is always an important criterion for such equity issues, but this time Sebi has left the pricing norms for preferential allotment unchanged. Choubey wonders if the move would be enough to help companies deal with liquidity issues. Since there is no relaxation on floor pricing, companies may find it an expensive option.

Unlike rights issue, preferential issues are carried out via a SEBI- approved formula at an average price of the last two weeks or past 26 weeks, whichever is higher. In the COVID-19 era, there is a substantial gap between the current market price and the price arrived at by using the Sebi formula, making it really tough for firms.

As part of the June 16 amendment, Sebi has also relaxed the provision for voluntary open offers by temporarily removing a disqualification condition.

Earlier, a shareholder with 25 per cent or more shares or voting rights was permitted to make a voluntary open offer, but only if he had not acquired any shares of the company via the creeping acquisition route in the preceding 52 weeks.

That condition has now been relaxed till March 31, 2021, giving a fresh option to promoters to consolidate their holdings, but less than the overall public shareholding threshold of 75 per cent.

REDUCING THE QIP COOLING-OFF PERIOD

As part of the changes notified on June 16, the market regulator also substantially reduced the mandatory gap between back-to-back qualified institutional placements or QIPs by a listed firm to two weeks. Earlier, firms were required to maintain a gap of six months between two QIPs.

Will this help?

“Possibly -- for those firms that need money in quick succession,” feels Bhagat. Capital market experts believe the move will help corporates time their fund-raising plans better and give them greater flexibility to launch share sales based on share price movement.

But then there are those who wonder if issuers can execute deals so quickly today and if risk-averse investors would be comfortable with such short gaps.

Fund-raising conditions are not ideal for firms outside the heavyweight category. “In the current unprecedented situation, investors will prefer to seek safety in established businesses. All over the world, big is becoming bigger. In such a scenario, investors will prefer to be with leaders, which, by definition, are large-cap companies,” says Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak AMC.

Interestingly, since 2009, even with a gap of nine months between subsequent QIPs, only four placements emerge, according to Prime Database. The list includes Unitech Ltd and 3i Infotech in 2009, Mannapuram General Finance & Leasing in 2010 and Dhanalaxmi Bank in 2013. Unitech had the shortest gap of 71 days.

(Source: PRIME Database)

Between March 25, 2020 (the beginning of the nationwide lockdown) and June 3, 2020, Indian companies raised Rs 7,443 crore via the QIP route, which represents a 135 per cent increase, compared to the same period last year.

FY 2019-20 was an active period for the QIP route, with corporates raising Rs 51,216 crore from 13 QIPs. In FY 18-19, Rs 10,489 crore was raised from the same number of QIPs. Both QIPs and preferential issues require shareholder approval via a special resolution.

The path has been set for a smooth sail for the small-cap and mid-cap companies. But are these measures enough and are more required? The markets will provide the clue in the coming days.",1294,-0.2353295534849167

Kotak Mahindra Bank share price was up over 2 percent after global research firm Morgan Stanley had maintained its overweight stance on the stock.

The research firm has retained its overweight call on the stock with target of Rs 1,475 per share and expects credit cost to be higher in FY21 against last year, according to a report by CNBC-TV18.

The research firm is of the view that moratorium has not shown significant increase from April end with the bulk of moratorium requests dropping materially. FY21 will be a tough year for fees given slower loan growth, it added.

The stock price added 15 percent in the last 15 days and was quoting at Rs 1,332.45, up Rs 28.70, or 2.20 percent at 12:48 hours. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,354.60 and an intraday low of Rs 1,305.15 and was one of the top index gainers.

A total of 2.83 percent promoter stake was sold as part of the block deals at a price of Rs 1,240 a share. The markets cheered the move as the Kotak Mahindra stock ended up 7.5 percent at the end of trade on June 2.

“The Regents invest in select stocks in select markets with a very long term horizon,” said a source familiar with the stake sale process. The Regents of the University of California currently manages a portfolio of investments totalling roughly $120 billion, which includes retirement, endowment, and cash assets.

Kotak sold 5.6 crore equity shares (representing 2.92 percent of total paid-up equity) at Rs 1,240 per share, as per the bulk deals data available on the BSE on June 2.

The stake sale was to comply with a settlement agreement struck with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in January on promoter stake dilution, which brought the curtains down on an extended standoff between the regulator and the bank over reduction in promoter shareholding.

On January 30, Kotak Mahindra Bank had said RBI had agreed to its proposal to reduce promoter stake to 26 percent from the current 29.9 percent over the next six months. It also said promoter voting rights will be capped at 20 percent of the paid-up voting share capital until March 31 and will be further capped at 15 percent, effective April 1. Kotak Mahindra Bank had added that promoters will not purchase any further 'paid-up voting equity shares' of the bank till the promoter shareholding reaches 15 percent.

As per the shareholding pattern as of March 2020, promoter and promoter group shareholding was 29.92 percent including 29.63 percent stake held by Kotak.

Kotak Mahindra Bank share price closed at Rs 1,343.20 on the BSE, up 7.52 percent on June 2.

Not seem to be convinced with India's sovereign rating downgrade by Moody's, Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak on Tuesday said credit rating is a matter of opinion.

Moody's Investors Service on Monday downgraded the country's rating by one notch to 'Baa3', the lowest in the investment grade, with a negative outlook on worries over growth and fiscal risks.

""As of now, including the global financial crisis, that matter of opinion (rating) has proved that there has been no legal liability for that opinion being right or wrong,"" Kotak quipped.

It is to be noted that the big three rating agencies, including Moody's, came under heavy criticism after the global financial crisis for giving favourable ratings to insolvent institutions like Lehman Brothers, which triggered the global meltdown in 2008.

Even in India, rating agencies were under scrutiny over the IL&FS crisis and some other incidents.

""Having said that Moody's rating was higher than S&P and Fitch so it has brought it down to that level but with the negative bias. The way I would look at is...rather than being in denial, I will go through Moody's report and see where are the areas where we can improve,"" he said at CII annual meet.

Kotak said, he would agree on the fact that India needs to get growth back because there is perception that trend growth or average growth rate is slowing down.

""Unless our trend growth rate goes up we will have a bigger problem in getting our fiscal deficit down. So, the positive message that I would take out of this constructively is not as much as rating downgrade or even the negative bias but what do we do to get trend growth back to a better level,"" he said.

He also said that there is a need to strengthen financial institutions at a time when there is a risk of non-performing assets (NPAs) going up.

The public sector banks would need financial support from the government to drive the economy, he said, adding about Rs 3 lakh crore may be required for public sector banks.

""The COVID-19 outbreak and resulting lockdown has impacted adversely the real economy, businesses, individuals, Government and financial sector. While the government is facing the risk of higher fiscal deficit, the banking sector urgently needs the recapitalisation to the tune of 3-4 lakh crore to meet the lending requirements,"" he said.

Within the private sector, Kotak said, ""we have a situation where quite a few banks are in the business of banking but unable to lend"".

As per SEBI, the winding up process will have legal and operational challenges. For instance, the fund house has to take trustee approvals and will also need consent of majority of unit holders.

Kotak Mahindra Bank through its Debt Capital Markets team will work closely with Franklin Templeton Trustees, to assist with all portfolio actions in these six schemes that are being wound up, the release stated.

""Franklin Templeton is committed to ensuring an orderly and equitable exit for all investors at the earliest possible time, and we will partner with the Board of Trustees and Kotak Mahindra Bank to ensure an efficient wind-up of these schemes, while preserving maximum value for our investors,"" said Sanjay Sapre, President, Franklin Templeton – India.

Dolat Capital's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

While KMB’s PPoP growth was healthy at 19% YoY led by stable NIM and healthy sequential growth in other income, PAT was impacted by Rs6.5bn of COVID related provisions. Higher CASA ratio and decline in SA deposit rates resulted in ~45 bps QoQ decline in CoF, aiding NIM of 4.7% despite a 700 bps decline in Loan-deposit ratio.  We continue to like KMB for its strong liability franchise with improving CoF, conservative lending approach, strong subsidiaries, and healthy capital position. Despite lowering growth estimates and doubling of slippages in FY21E, improving CoF and strong PPoP profile support RoA of 1.6%.

Outlook

We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of Rs1,450 based on 2.8x FY22E ABV (standalone bank) and the value of its subsidiaries, implying a FY22E P/ABV of 4.7x.

Investment behaviour and asset allocation preferences might change in the post-COVID-19 world.

People might even prefer keeping funds in hand.

As the new infections continue to rise, there is doubt over opening of the economy fully in the immediate period, experts feel.

The economic impact of the lockdown is severe. Companies are resorting to layoffs, pay cuts, furloughs as economic activity has come to a standstill.

Hence, as fear of income loss rises, the skewed asset allocation of Indian households towards largely illiquid physical assets (95 percent of assets in property, vehicles, machinery, gold, etc) could incrementally shift towards relatively liquid and safe financial assets, ICICI Securities feels.

The brokerage said in FY19, Rs 22 lakh crore (11.7 percent of GDP) or 64.3 percent of net savings were invested by Indian households in physical assets and gold even as net financial assets dipped to 6.5 percent of GDP largely driven by the rise in financial liabilities.

According to the research firm, the demand for big-ticket and lumpy discretionary spends such as tourism, leisure and expensive consumer durables could dip significantly both from a supply-side issue as well as focus of households shifting towards raising liquidity (cash, bank deposits etc.) along with augmenting their life and health protection.

Given the extended lockdown and gradual opening of economy with minimum capacity with due care and safety, consensus real GDP growth expectations points towards zero or marginally negative growth for FY21 (gross national income should show similar trends), while nominal GDP and GNI might record low single-digit growth.

""Q1CY20 (January-March) GDP growth is tracking close to 2 percent YoY. The latest high-frequency data suggest GDP in Q2 is tracking towards a contraction of about 9 percent YoY,"" said Barclays in its report dated May 14.

The global investment firm thinks more data will bring that closer to its forecast of a 12.4 percent YoY drop. ""We remain comfortable with our 0 percent CY20 GDP growth forecast,"" it said.

Hence, ICICI Securities feels anecdotal evidence suggests that bulk of the income loss for households is in urban unorganised sector while in 'organised sector' income loss is being largely absorbed by corporates and government in the short term although fear of income loss looms.

Therefore the brokerage believes financial intermediaries in sectors such as insurance and banks with strong brand loyalty, proven retail franchise, strong execution and clean balance sheets should benefit in the current environment.

As a result, its analysts are positive on HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI Life Insurance and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance.

However, the key risk to the above thesis is the protracted income loss to household savings as government and corporates' ability to absorb losses and transfer income to households will be limited and a longer lockdown could hurt jobs and income prospects even in organised sector, said the brokerage.

Low-income urban workers in small scale enterprises are the worst affected but they add very little to savings although their rising indebtedness will impact net savings, it added.

ICICI Direct's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) reported a mixed set of numbers with moderation in advance growth and a steady operational performance. In the wake of Covid-19, the bank has provided for Rs 650 crore, which took a toll on earnings. The overall performance of subsidiaries remained muted. The bank has said that ~26% of borrowers (by value) have opted for moratorium up to April 30, 2020. In lieu of the Covid-19 emergency, the bank has provided Rs 650 crore. Total provisioning for the quarter was at Rs 1047 crore in Q4FY20 (~48 bps of advances) vs. Rs 171 crore in Q4FY19. Surge in provisioning dented PAT by 10% YoY to Rs 1266.6 crore.

Outlook

We estimate RoA, RoE at 1.6%, 11.7%, respectively, for FY22E. Management strength and sustainability enable BUY rating with target price of Rs 1600, valuing the bank at 3.8x FY22E.

Brokerage houses were mixed in their views on Kotak Mahindra Bank after its March quarter earnings.

The bank reported a standalone profit of Rs 1,266.6 crore for the quarter ended March 2020, registering a 10 percent fall due to a significant jump in COVID-19 related provisions.

The stock largely remained rangebound after witnessing recovery from March lows. It was quoting at Rs 1,189.75, up 0.27 percent on the BSE at 12:10 hours IST.

While maintaining a buy call on the stock and raising price target to Rs 1,450 (from Rs 1,425 earlier), global research firm CLSA has raised its earnings estimates by 10-12 percent for FY21/22.

It believes MSME package will support Kotak Mahindra Bank as the lender has a relatively higher share in MSME loans, though profit was lower during the quarter due to higher provisions and loan growth slowed to 7 percent but deposit traction remained strong.

On May 13, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman unveiled Rs 6 lakh crore package for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), NBFCs which are majorly impacted by the lockdown started on March 25.

FM announced Rs 3 lakh crore collateral-free automatic loans for business (including MSMEs), Rs 20,000 crore subordinated debt for MSMEs and Rs 50,000 crore equity infusion through MSME Fund of Funds, while there will be Rs 30,000 crore liquidity facility for NBFC/HCs/MFIs and Rs 45,000 crore Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme 2.0 for NBFCs. Also, the definition of MSMEs has been changed.

The private sector lender has reported a 10 percent year-on-year decline in Q4FY20 profit at Rs 1,266.6 crore as provisions rose 6-fold YoY to Rs 1,047.47 crore due to Rs 650 crore provisions towards COVID-19.

Net interest income grew by 17.2 percent YoY to Rs 3,559.65 crore with NIM at 4.72 percent and loan growth at 7 percent in Q4, while deposits increased by 16 percent.

Asset quality improved due to moratorium as slippage declined 50 percent sequentially. Gross non-performing assets declined 21 basis points and net NPA 18 basis points QoQ.

While maintaining buy call with a target at Rs 1,600 per share, ICICI said, ""The stock has outperformed broader indices and rightly so, it deserves premium given lower risk of volatility and higher visibility on stability and scalability. We believe conservatism, risk cautiousness and stability take precedence in such circumstances.""

Also, stable subsidiaries’ performance would provide support to valuations, it added.

Management articulated to stay cautiously optimistic, focus on sustainability and resilience, customer acquisition through digital route and grow franchises in non-credit businesses.

Overall, operating performance stood healthy during the March quarter, with a pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) growing at 19 percent YoY.

Motilal Oswal cut its profit estimates for FY21/22 by 14/8 percent, primarily as it factored in higher credit cost while estimating Kotak Bank to maintain a cautious stance on lending, although a reduction in SA/TD rates would aid margins.

On the asset quality front, the brokerage expects non-performing loans formation to increase due to rising stress in the commercial vehicles (CV) and unsecured segments. However, the brokerage estimates Kotak to deliver controlled credit cost versus peers, even as the moratorium book is quite the same.

Motilal Oswal maintained a neutral rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,350 per share.

HDFC Securities feels valuations are expensive and as a result, it has add rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1,282.

""Kotak Bank's Q4 earnings were below estimates, due to high COVID-19 related provisions (a trend seen across banks in Q4). GNPA growth was contained by the standstill classification. Its strong capital base, stable & granular deposit franchise and superior underwriting practices make it one of the best placed in the sector,"" said the brokerage.

""A fund-raise, while RoAE dilutive, is not undesirable. It would (1) partly resolve the promoter stake issue and (2) further strengthen the bank's already strong balance sheet,"" it added.

Emkay Global has retained hold rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank as the stock offers a safe harbor in the current risk-off environment, given its strong liability/capital buffer, traditionally conservative underwriting and pedigree management.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank is expected to report around 8-13 percent growth in profit, and net interest income is seen rising in double-digits despite moderate growth in advances at around 7 percent for the quarter ended March 2020.

In the case of deposits, the growth is seen in strong double-digit due to Yes Bank crisis during the quarter, but slippages could be elevated compared to the previous quarter.

The stock has fallen around 17 percent in the past year, it has lost 32 percent year-to-date and has lost 23 percent during the March quarter.

""Slowdown in auto sales and cautious approach in the MSME segment led credit growth to be reported at around 6.7 percent YoY. A cautious approach towards wholesale lending is to continue ahead. Focus on secured retail loans provide comfort and are not cause for worry,"" said ICICI Direct which expects 12.6 percent growth in net interest income.

Peer bank crisis worked in favour of the bank, thus leading deposits to grow at 15.2 percent YoY with CASA increasing at 56.2 percent, it added.

HDFC Securities also expects loan growth to further moderate to sub-7 percent against 10.4 percent in Q3, and sees a sharp surge in deposits (especially CASA) at 16/10 percent YoY/QoQ post the Yes Bank event.

ICICI Direct sees pre-provision operating profit growing 13 percent YoY supported by stable other income and reduced operating expenses.

With credit cost at around 25 bps of advances, profit is seen coming in at 12.6 percent YoY, the brokerage said.

According to Motilal Oswal, the profit, pre-provision operating profit and NII growth could be 9 percent, 11 percent and 14 percent respectively YoY.

On the asset quality front, ICICI Direct said, ""Lockdown is expected to lead to a rise in slippages leading to gross non-performing assets at 2.5 percent. Exposure to SME, and the unsecured retail segment remains vulnerable. In addition, the extension of the lockdown would further add to asset quality worries.""

Narnolia also feels asset quality is expected to remain under stress with gross NPA at 2.6 percent for the quarter.

Key things to watch out for are promoter stake in the bank, the stress in the SME segment, outlook on growth and asset quality, deposits inflows, and performance of subsidiaries.

Retail billionaire Kishore Biyani-backed Future Group, which is saddled with high promoter level debt, has launched preliminary talks with a clutch of strategic and private equity investors to sell its stake in its general insurance joint venture with Italy’s Generali Group, people familiar with the matter told Moneycontrol.

Mumbai-headquartered Future, India’s largest retail firm, holds a 50 percent stake in Future Generali India Insurance, which commenced operations in 2007.

“Future Group has reached out to India-focused private equity firm True North, Hero FinCorp, Kotak Mahindra Bank, among others,” one of the persons told Moneycontrol. Future Group has named investment bank UBS to find a buyer for the proposed stake sale.

A second person said discussions have picked up pace in recent weeks and Future Group expects to raise $300-350 million through the deal. Another person said Future Generali India Insurance was a “good, well-built platform that has been around for 12-13 years” and would therefore attract interest from bidders.

A fourth individual privy to the negotiations said Future Generali is among the top 10-11 players insurance in India and is reasonably sized. “True North is bullish on the domestic insurance sector and has been on the prowl for more bets in this space after it struck the Max Bupa deal. The Hero Group has attempted acquisitions in this segment earlier, but those deal talks didn’t fructify and it continues to be interested in the segment,” he said.

Explaining the deal rationale for Kotak Mahindra Bank, this person said they (Kotak) are a late entrant in the general insurance and a small player. “They can achieve size and scale through this deal.”

All the four persons spoke to Moneycontrol on the condition of anonymity.

In response to an email query from Moneycontrol, Future Group and UBS declined to comment. “We have no comments to offer,” said Rohit Rao, Chief Communication Officer, Kotak Mahindra Group. True North was unavailable for comment. When contacted, Abhimanyu Munjal, Joint MD and CEO, Hero FinCorp said, “We don’t want to comment on market speculation.”

Future Group promoter entities had a total debt of Rs 11,970 crore, with total pledged shares estimated at over 90 percent by value across the group, according to media reports.

Let’s take a closer look at the targetFuture Generali India Insurance is present in more than 125 locations across India, has 3,000 active corporate clients and has sold more than 82 lakh policies. The firm manages assets worth Rs 3,629 crore as of March last year. It has products ranging from health insurance, personal accident, travel insurance, motor insurance, home insurance and others.

In 2018, Generali Group said it has signed an agreement with Future Group to increase its stake in its insurance ventures in India to 49 percent from 25.5 percent after investing $130 million.

Khushroo Panthaky, Director, Grant Thornton Advisory Pvt, feels the next few months could determine the extent of opportunity that the coronavirus pandemic could spell for these firms. ""In the post COVID-19 era, on account of increased costs of reinsurance and a high incidence of claims on the health side, general and health insurance companies will enhance premium for individual and group health insurance policies. General insurance companies will start offering comprehensive health insurance and other covers, given that group health insurance could be made mandatory for all business and government establishments. The next six months could determine the extent to which this pandemic could turn into an opportunity for these insurance players,"" he explained.

Who are the suitors?In February 2019, True North purchased a 50 percent stake in Max Bupa from Max India for Rs 510 crore. Max Bupa is a joint venture between Max India and UK-based healthcare services firm Bupa. True North (formerly known as India Value Fund Advisors — IVFA) was established in 1999 with a focus on investing in mid-sized India centric businesses. It has pumped in around $1.5 billion across 30-plus businesses, according to its website. Its existing portfolio includes companies such as Zydus Wellness, Meru Cabs, DM Healthcare, KIMS Hospitals, Magma Fincorp, among others.

Delhi-headquartered NBFC Hero FinCorp offers two-wheeler loans, used car loans, loan against property, corporate and SME loans. According to media reports, in September 2019, the Anil Ambani Group called off the proposed sale of its general insurance business to Hero FinCorp after advanced negotiations.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

All safety procedures, including wearing of masks by staff and customers, providing hand sanitisers to every customer before use of the ATM, periodic sanitisation of the ATM and maintaining social distancing, will be strictly followed, Kotak said.

Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank closed 8.59 percent higher at Rs 1,249.85 on BSE on April 23, a day after the company said its board had approved raising of capital by way of issue of equity shares.

On April 22, the company said in a regulatory filing that the board had approved the fundraising for up to 6.50 crore equity shares of Rs 5 each, through a private placement, follow-on public offering (FPO) or qualified institutions placement (QIP) or a combination.

CNBC TV-18 quoted global brokerage CLSA saying that the timing of capital raising makes it ponder reasons behind the move.

""While proposed capital raising will help to reduce the promoter stake by 1 ppt to 29 percent, it will also mean RoE dilution of up to 30-50 bps for FY21/22,"" CLSA said.

Capital raise opens up the possibilities for pursuing a tactical M&A opportunity, CLSA said. It has a buy recommendation on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target price of Rs 1,425.

On the other hand, Morgan Stanley has an 'overweight' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,680.

As per CNBC TV-18, Morgan Stanley said the capital raising would further improve balance-sheet strength and after the capital raise, the bank's ability to absorb loan losses would increase to 23 percent.

""RoE for FY21 would reduce by 0.3 percent ppts if capital raising is executed and FY20 proforma tier-I ratio will increases 2.9 ppts and FY21 will increase by 10 ppts,"" Morgan Stanley said.

The board of private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) on Wednesday approved a proposal to raise capital through issuance of 6.5 crore shares. According to the current price of its shares, sale of 6.5 crore shares will entail raising up to Rs 7,500 crore.

The capital raising may help the bank's promoter group led by its chief executive Uday Kotak reduce its holding in the bank to comply with a plan mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). As part of the bank's plan approved by the RBI, the lender is required to get down the promoters' stake to 26 percent from the over 30 percent held as of December 2019.

Post-Yes Bank fiasco, the private banking industry is suffering from a major trust deficit. Some of the private banks such as IndusInd Bank and RBL Bank have witnessed erosion in their deposit portfolios.

However, banks like Kotak Mahindra and HDFC Bank have bucked the trend. On April 6, Kotak Mahindra Bank said its deposits have grown by 11.7 percent since December 2019. The total deposits of the bank grew from Rs 2.31 lakh crore on December 31 to an estimated Rs 2.58 lakh crore in March 2020, the bank said in a regulatory filing.

Of this, savings accounts have grown by Rs 91,729 crore to Rs 1.04 lakh crore or by 14 percent, the bank said, while current deposits grew by 17 percent from Rs 36,788 crore to Rs 43,000 crore. The ratio of current and savings account deposits to total deposits stands at 56.2 percent as of March 2020, compared to 53.7 percent in December.

At the same time, net advances have grown nearly flat on a quarter on quarter basis to Rs 2.19 lakh crore, the bank said.

On April 5, HDFC Bank also announced that its deposits have grown by 7.4 percent in the January-March quarter to Rs 11.46 lakh crore.

But both IndusInd and RBL have witnessed a decline in deposits. IndusInd Bank in a regulatory filing on March 30 said its deposits have shrunk by 10-11 percent since Q3. The bank attributed much of this (about 70 percent) to some government- accounts moving money out of the bank and rest by corporate houses. The hit on the retail book was less, it said.

""This (fall in deposits) will also result in lower CASA ratio, but reduce our dependency on this category for deposits in future,"" the bank said. Similarly, RBl Bank said it has seen 8 percent decline in its deposit book.

Kotak Mahindra Bank share price fell more than 10 percent intraday on April 1 after the private lender talked of increased risk and cost due to extended moratorium and warned of default if recovery was delayed.

The stock has plunged 31 percent in two months, as the 21-day lockdown to control coronavirus raised fears of defaults that could result in NPA pressure. The stock was trading at Rs 1,163.30 on the BSE, down Rs 133.05, or 10.26 percent, at 1058 hours.

While addressing conference call, the country's fourth-largest private sector lender said it was seeing problems in unsecured personal loans such as credit cards and consumer durables, especially from customers who are fence-sitters and have the ability to pay but not the will. ""Extra efforts are required to remind them through calls,"" it said.

""Defaults are expected to rise due to which recovery will be delayed. The bank is focusing to protect balance sheet rather than looking for balance sheet or income statement growth,"" said the lender.

The bank believes the economic recovery will take six to nine months if the coronavirus situation continued beyond a month (up to three-month time). ""The management sees urban areas more problematic than non-urban areas.""

The Reserve Bank of India has given a three-month moratorium for the payment of loans after the lockdown.

""The extended moratorium will increase the risk and costs for the banks due to the asset-liability mismatch,"" it said.

Here are the highlights of Kotak Mahindra Bank's conference call, collated by KR Choksey:

Macro outlook

- The management foresees three types of scenarios. In the first scenario, the end of COVID-19 situation in 15-30 days' time (optimistic scenario) and everything will be normal in about two months.

- Scenario Two, assumes this situation to continue beyond 1 month (up to three-month time) economic recovery will take six-nine months for recovery.

- Scenario Three extends beyond three months, which is pessimistic. The company expects extended health problems and recovery, salary cuts and job loss. The management believes we are in Scenario Two.

- The management sees urban areas more problematic than non-urban areas.

Recent movement in assets and liabilities

- On the liability side, the banks witnessed an increase in customer deposits although not significant but better than expected. There was an uplift in saving deposits and a marginal increase in current and term came from existing customers, other private banks including Yes Bank (post moratorium) and small finance banks.

- The bank doesn’t have too much government deposit exposure and hasn’t noticed a significant movement in these.

- On the assets front, the bank has been cautious about SME lending for the last one year. On the retail front, the bank will remain cautious but continue to grow home loans and unsecured loans, while on the wholesale front, the bank has been selective and not taken any concentrated bets.

NPL recovery management

- The management believes this situation will require geared up efforts towards recovery of non-performing loans (NPLs) and proper recovery infrastructure in place.

- Retail borrowers are expected to repay EMIs on priority such as home loans, card loans and two-wheeler loans will be prioritized as compared to other personal loans.

- Expecting lower recovery as customers who have the ability to pay will also hold back to enjoy RBI moratorium and to have liquidity in difficult times.

- The bank is seeing a problem in unsecured personal loans, which include credit card, consumer durables and other personal loans, especially from the customers who are fence-sitters and have the ability to pay but are not willing. Extra efforts are required to remind them through calls.

- The bank believes, if you are not the first to reach the customer; you will end up losing money.

- Defaults are expected to rise due to which recovery will be delayed.

- The bank is focusing to protect the balance sheet rather than look for balance-sheet or income-statement growth.

BFSI sector issues

- The management sees that in the present situation, the NBFC sector is more exposed to the solvency issue than the liquidity issue.

- On the liquidity side, the BFSI sector will face issues with regards to ALM mismatch, tightening of liquidity. However, these are manageable with infused liquidity and reasonable support offered by the Centre.

- The extended moratorium will increase the risk and costs for the banks due to ALM mismatch,

- In the case of the pessimistic scenario, the bank is expecting all the problems mentioned above to raise to the power of two or three.

Kotak Mahindra Bank has cut the annual interest rate on savings accounts with daily balances above Rs 1 lakh to 5 percent with effect from April 1.

For savings accounts with daily balance of up to Rs 1 lakh, the interest rate will remain at 4 percent.

Most of the lender's savings accounts with balance above Rs 1 lakh and up to Rs 10 lakh currently have an annual interest rate of 6 percent, according to the bank's website.

The revised interest rate is applicable on Resident Accounts only, the bank said.

The country's largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), had also earlier this month reduced interest rate on savings bank accounts to 3 percent for all customers. Before the cut, it used to pay 3.25 percent on a balance of up to Rs 1 lakh and 3 percent for balances above Rs 1 lakh.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had on March 27 cut the repo rate by 75 basis points to 4.4 percent. This means that other banks, too, might soon revise interest rates on deposits and lending rates.",193,

So is the time right for value buying or is the market expected to fall more?

The first thing which one should understand is not to be under an illusion that they can time the market. Yes, the way this can be done is to deploy cash in markets in a staggered way.

“In this sharp decline, we are suggesting our clients begin their investments in quality stocks with 20-25 percent of their investment corpus designated for the equity asset class and infuse their capital slowly in the next 2-3 installments whereas traders should still remain cautious as market volatility will remain an intact cause of coronavirus crisis,” Amit Gupta, Co-Founder, and CEO, TradingBells told Moneycontrol.

“Traders should adopt “Hit and Run guerrilla Trades” which means they should not take overnight positions, should respect the intraday trend and square up their positions in a day itself,” he said.

The next question is how can one look at picking stocks? There will be a lot of beaten-down stocks that might be looking attractive from a price perspective, but are all of them a good buy? History, suggest otherwise.

The idea is to invest in stocks that have strong fundamentals because most of the decline is largely due to external factors. To start with, investors should analyze the core business of the company, balance sheet, profit, and loss statement, and valuations such as EPS, PE, ROCE as all these factors indicate the health of the company.

“Though there are many strategies to invest or select stocks, one should have a mix of value and growth stocks while constructing a portfolio,” Arun Kumar, Market Strategist at Reliance Securities told Moneycontrol.

“One can select stocks where the fundamental growth is consistent and the long-term business prospects are fairly decent. Also, many high dividend-yielding stocks are available at relatively cheap valuations which can also add value in the long run,” he said.

We spoke to various experts on fundamentally strong stocks which investors can look at for the next 1-year:

Expert: Amit Gupta, Co-Founder, and CEO, TradingBells

Kotak Mahindra Bank:

Kotak Mahindra Bank has good profit growth of 20.63 percent over the past 5 years. It has shown consistent growth since inception.

It is the third-largest bank in terms of market capitalization. The stock has corrected 50 percent from its last two years' move and recovered swiftly from there.

HDFC AMC:

The company is virtually debt-free and has a good return on equity record of 37.88 percent in the last 3 years. The company has been maintaining a healthy dividend payout of 48.09 percent and sales growth of 11.67 percent.

On a technical chart, the counter has corrected more than 61% from its peak and has shown smart recovery from its Fibonacci retracement golden ratio of 61.8% marked at 2249 and manage to close at 2686.

If the stock manages to sustain above 2550 level then it may head towards 2860, 3238 levels in the near-term.

IRCTC:

IRCTC enjoys the monopoly business practices in catering, watering, and e-ticketing for Indian railways. Increasing uses of the internet with improving consumption patterns of Indian consumers make the catering and water business more growing and fruitful.

The company is virtually debt-free and has a good ROE track record of 28.55 percent and a healthy dividend payout of 41.76 percent in the past 3 years.

The counter is also fairly valued to its value and has corrected more than 60 percent from its peak. A move above 1314 will take the rally towards 1314- 1474 mark in the near-term.

Asian Paints:

For paint companies, the fall in crude oil prices will be beneficial as crude oil derivatives are used as inputs for paints. Given that the entire benefit is unlikely to be passed on to the end consumer, there will be an expansion in margins. Asian Paints and Berger Paints should be major beneficiaries.

Larsen & Toubro Infotech:

The Company offers an extensive range of IT services like application development, maintenance and outsourcing, enterprise solutions, infrastructure management services, testing, digital solutions and platform-based solutions to clients in diverse industries.

The company has an ROE track record of 34.09 percent of the past 3 years and virtually debt-free.

Expert: Ritesh Asher – Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at KIFS Trade Capital

State Bank of India:

SBI is the largest public sector bank in terms of deposits, advances, customers, and banking outlets fostering the nation’s 2.6 trillion-dollar economy.

Strong pipeline of recoveries up to 70 percent in 2020, healthy growth in the retail loan business is increasing. House loans grew by 17 percent, auto loans grew by 8.32 percent, and other P-segment loans grew by 5.06 percent. Steady asset quality makes SBI bank a good bet to buy.

Bajaj Finance:

New customer acquisition continued to be strong at 2.46mn, with total franchise came in at 40.38mn, over 24 percent growth on a YoY basis. Cross-sell franchise stood at 23.48mn, and the Asset under management (AUM) grew 35 percent on a YoY basis to Rs. 145,092cr.

Given the challenging macro conditions company’s profit before tax grew 36.9 percent YoY, while the net profit surged 61 percent YoY largely attributable to the lower tax rate. Also, the stock is available at a discount price.

Wipro:

Wipro is a leading information technology, consulting and business process services company. The company had a dedicated workforce of over 180,000 serving clients across 6 continents.

If we consider the company’s half-yearly performance it registered a 4 percent YoY hike in sales, which was accompanied by the company’s cost optimization strategy and strong client relationships that will help the company gain lost ground in the long-term.

HDFC Bank:

HDFC Bank has maintained a large stable asset quality with GNPAs between 0.9-1.4% over FY15-FY19. Over the last 10 quarters, the bank has seen NIMs sustain in the range of 4.2-4.3%.

Going forward, as and when the system-wide credit demand strengthens, the bank would be in a position to unlock NIMs by redeploying excess liquidity towards higher-yielding loan assets.

In the near term, while NIM could be under marginal pressure, operating leverage and lower credit costs would prop up RoA.

Jubilant FoodWorks:

The company has shown 3-years average revenue growth 13 percent while the 3-years average profit growth at 19 percent.

The net worth of the company almost doubled in 4 years from FY15 to FY19. The company’s 100 restaurant expansion strategy and split-store strategy with an increase in same-store sales growth (SSSG) look promising for further adding to the company’s net profits.

The corporate tax cut will also add up on the company’s favor and the debt to equity ratio remains NIL all this factor indicates healthy fundamentals of the company.

Billionaire Uday Kotak-led Kotak Mahindra Bank is keen to play the white knight and rescue the fund-starved Chennai-based Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) as part of a proposed transaction under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), multiple sources have told Moneycontrol.

“Kotak Mahindra Bank is a late entrant in the race for Lakshmi Vilas Bank and is evaluating the acquisition of a majority stake. It has joined other strategic and private equity suitors,” one of the sources said.

The bank submitted a proposal for Lakshmi Vilas Bank to the RBI, which has held discussions with other interested parties as well, another source said. “If the deal fructifies, it can further bolster Kotak Mahindra Bank’s presence in South India,” the source added.

Moneycontrol was the first to report on February 6 that DBS Bank India, Indostar Capital Finance, which is backed by Everstone Capital and recently struck a fund infusion deal with Canada’s Brookfield, and a private sector lender had joined the race for Lakshmi Vilas Bank. Other reports named Singapore’s Temasek and US-based Tilden Park as potential suitors.

Kotak Mahindra Bank declined comment to a query from Moneycontrol. Lakshmi Vilas Bank is yet to respond and the article will be updated once the reply comes in.

The road so far

Indiabulls Housing Finance and Lakshmi Vilas Bank announced their merger in April 2019 but the move was blocked by the RBI in October.

“The RBI informed that the application for voluntary amalgamation of lndiabulls Housing Finance and lndiabulls Commercial Credit with Lakshmi Vilas Bank cannot be approved,” Lakshmi Vilas Bank said in a regulatory filing. The bank did not reveal the reason cited for the decision.

The RBI had earlier put Lakshmi Vilas Bank under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework following a sharp rise in its non-performing assets (NPAs), insufficient liquidity and negative returns on assets for two consecutive years.

The PCA is meant to improve the performance of weak banks and protect their day-to-day operations.

LVB: A closer look

“We require about Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 2,000 crore to improve our loan book and operations,” S Sundar, interim managing director and CEO, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, said on February 14.

The market cap of the beleaguered bank is around Rs 456 crore and the stock has plummeted by 65% in the last six months.

The promoters hold a 6.78 percent stake. Indiabulls Housing Finance (4.99 percent), PE fund Jupiter Capital Private Ltd (1.08 percent), Srei Infra Finance (1.92 percent), Capri Global Holdings Pvt Ltd (2.62 percent) and LIC (1.62 percent) are some of the shareholders in the public category.

In the December 2019 quarter, the bank’s net losses narrowed to Rs 334 crore from Rs 357 crore a year ago and from Rs 456 crore in the previous quarter. But the asset quality and core capital base were far below stable. The capital adequacy ratio under Basel-III stood at a low 3.46 during the December quarter, more than halving from 7.57 a year ago, and gross NPA ratio as a percentage of total advances improved to 21.25 per cent from 23.27 per cent.

Capital adequacy ratio is the ratio of a bank’s capital to its risk and is a measure of the profitability of operations. Basel-III norms put the minimum capital adequacy ratio at 8%.

Lakshmi Vilas Bank operates in the retail, mid-market and corporate space. As of June 30, 2019, the operations were spread over 569 branches (including seven commercial banking branches and one satellite branch) and five extension counters, supervised by seven regional offices.

While the bank has a significant presence in Tamil Nadu, it is also present in 16 states and three union territories. It has 32 “B” category branches and 1,047 ATMs, according to its website.",634,-0.0033496469259262085

Private sector Kotak Mahindra Bank on Wednesday said the Reserve Bank has granted its final approval for reducing promoters' stake in the bank to 26 percent.

On January 30, the bank had informed about RBI's in-principle acceptance for reducing promoters' shareholding to 26 percent of the paid-up voting equity share capital (PUVESC) of the bank within six months from the date of final approval of the regulator.

The RBI had asked the bank to cut promoters' shareholding to 20 percent of paid-up capital by December 31, 2018, and 15 percent by March 31, 2020.

""Further to our intimation dated 30th January 2020,...the Reserve Bank of India has granted its final approval vide its letter dated 18th February 2020 in the matter relating to dilution of promoters' shareholding in the bank,"" Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a regulatory filing.

With this, the bank is also moving towards withdrawing a case concerning dilution of promoters' shareholding in the bank which it had filed against the RBI in the Bombay High Court.

""Our board of directors has resolved to abide by the above. The bank is withdrawing writ petition No. 3542 of 2018 filed by it in the High Court of Bombay,"" Kotak Mahindra Bank had said in late January filing.

As on date, the promoter and promoter group's shareholding in the bank stands at 29.96 percent.

Uday Kotak, also a promoter, is the managing director and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank.

In August 2018, it had proposed the issuance of perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) to cut promoter holding to 19.70 percent, which the RBI rejected.

The bank then challenged the RBI's contention in the Bombay High Court.

The RBI's bank licensing rules mandate that a private bank's promoter will need to pare holding to 40 percent within three years, 20 percent within 10 years and to 15 percent within 15 years.

In 2003, Kotak Mahindra Group's financial arm Kotak Mahindra Finance had received banking licence from the RBI, becoming the first NBFC in India to convert into a bank.

Effective April 2015, another private sector lender ING Vysya Bank was merged into Kotak Mahindra Bank.

""The Reserve Bank of India has granted its final approval in the matter relating to dilution of promoters' shareholding in the bank,"" the private sector lender said in its BSE filing.

In late January, the RBI had conveyed its in-principle acceptance for the shareholding plan.

Promoters' shareholding in the bank will be reduced to 26 percent of PUVESC of the bank within six months from the date of final approval of the RBI; thereafter, the promoters will not purchase any further paid up voting equity shares' of the bank till the percentage of promoters' shareholding reaches 15 percent of PUVESC of the bank or such higher percentage as may be permitted by RBI from time to time, the bank stated in its plan.

The promoters will be entitled to purchase paid-up voting equity shares of the bank up to 15 percent of the PUVESC of the bank or such higher percentage as may be permitted in the future, and exercise voting rights on such shares, the bank said.",280,0.997982382774353

The issue of promoter’s shareholdings being settled which is a near-term positive for the stock. It settled pending litigation with regulator without any operational repercussions.

The bank should prefer promoter diluting stake by sell-down or by value-accretive M&A.

UBS | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,750 per share

The uncertainty over promoter stake has been removed as it’s a positive development.

The stock already trades at premium valuations and expect limited upside.

UBS expect bank's earnings to grow at 30 percent CAGR over FY19-21 driven by 17 percent loan growth and RoE to improve to 14/16 percent in FY20/21 from 12 percent In FY19.

According to reseach house Citi the uncertainty ended and promoters can retain 26 percent stake.

There is no explicit requirement for reducing stake below 26 percent. The bank is well capitalised with tier -I of 17.7 percent as of Q3FY20.

Kotak Mahindra Bank and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seem to have reached a truce on the long standing battle to bring down promoter shareholding, and withdrew the writ petition filed by the bank in Bombay High Court against the regulator.

On January 30, Kotak Mahindra Bank wrote to exchanges stating that the banking regulator has agreed ‘in-principle’ to cap promoters’ voting rights to 20 percent of the paid up voting equity share capital until March 31, 2020.

In a letter dated January 29, the RBI has told the bank that the promoters’ voting rights should be brought down to 15 percent of the paid up voting equity share capital from April 1, 2020.

Once the private lender receives the final approval from RBI, it will also have to bring down the promoters’ shareholding down to 26 percent within six months.

As on December 2019, the bank’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Uday Kotak and other promoters held 29.96 percent of the share capital in the bank.

The letter also states that the promoters will not purchase any further paid up voting equity shares of the bank till their stake reduces to 15 percent of the paid up voting equity share capital of the bank or a higher level if permitted by the RBI over time.

“The promoters will be entitled to purchase paid-up voting shares of the bank up to 15 percent of the paid up voting equity share capital or such higher percentage as may be permitted in the future, and exercise voting rights on such shares,” the statement said.

Just as the government prepares to announce the Union Budget 2020-21, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor has called for more structural, fiscal measures to boost demand and economic growth in the country, citing limitation in the monetary policy to do so on its own.

He added that steps like prioritising food processing industries, tourism, e-commerce, startups and efforts to become a part of the global value chain could give significant push to growth.

This week a number of private lenders like ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank announced their third quarter results. While their profits showed improvement, slippages still continue to remain elevated.

Need structural, fiscal measures to boost demand and growth: RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das said that there is need for structural and fiscal measures along with monetary policy to augment demand and growth in the economy. ""Monetary policy, however, has its own limits. Structural reforms and fiscal measures may have to be continued and further activated to provide a durable push to demand and boost growth,"" Das said on January 24.

ICICI Bank classifies Karvy as NPA, slippages riseICICI Bank ,that posted 158.4 percent growth in net profit for October-December, mostly on account of recoveries from Essar Steel, saw two other big slippages in the third quarter, including its exposure to Karvy Stock Broking.

Budget 2020: Things to watch out for the banking sectorApart from bank recapitalisation that the government has already prioritised for the merging lenders, there may not be much in store that could directly impact the sector in Budget 2020. However, due to the banking sector’s linkages to all other sectors in the economy, they may be affected by the Centre’s decision on sectors where they have a reasonable exposure. And there could be more downside risks than benefits due to these measures.

Axis Bank says stressed asset pool back to 'normal' levelsAxis Bank on January 22 reported lower-than-expected net profit for the October-December quarter on the back of higher provisioning. The private lender said that it may continue to set aside more against bad loans going ahead, as slippages remain high.

Nomura: Maintains neutral rating, cuts target to Rs 1,600

Global research firm Nomura has maintained a neutral call on the stock and has cut target to Rs 1,600 from Rs 1,650 per share. It is of the view that the expectation of high growth and low credit costs is not sustainable. Growth disappointment has led to earnings forecast cut of 6-9 percent.

Jefferies: Retain underperform rating

Jefferies has retained an underperform rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank and has cut target to Rs 1,375 from Rs 1,380 per share. It is of the view that the bank delivered slower than expected loan growth while NII growth of 16.8 percent is supported by strong margins.

Credit Suisse: Maintains neutral rating

Credit Suisse has also maintained a neutral rating on the stock with target at Rs 1,450 per share. It is of the view that Q3 was below estimates which saw a sharp pullback in loans.

Citi: Neutral rating

Citi has a neutral rating with target at Rs 1,860 per share. It expects the bank to maintain its conservative stance in lending and is of the view that credit costs are higher in the last two quarters but is off low base and is lower than its peers. The research firm has lowered FY20 & FY21 profit estimates by 4 percent factoring in lower growth.

IDFC Securities: Outperform Call, target Rs 1,760

IDFC Securities has an outperform call on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a target at Rs 1,760 per share. It is of the view that slowing growth remains a key monitorable given its rich valuation. It has maintained an outperform rating given superior asset quality and high profitability. However, miss on loan growth in the quarters ahead would be viewed negatively.

Phillip Capital: Maintain neutral rating, target Rs 1,660

Phillip Capital has maintained a neutral rating with a target at Rs 1,660 per share. It is of the view that the bank remains cautious given unfavourable risk-return matrix and has cut its estimates due to lower than expected credit growth

Kotak Mahindra Bank that posted a lackluster credit growth of 10 percent in the third quarter, expects the pace to remain tepid going ahead, as it plans to stay cautious amid steady additions to bad loans.

""Safety is clearly more important than yields,"" said Jaimin Bhatt, Chief Financial Officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank. ""It's easy to show yields and growth but the problem arises when the account does not pay a few years later,"" he added.

Bhatt said that the bank is likely to achieve credit growth of 12-13 percent by end of the current financial year.

""On the wholesale side, capital expenditure is still very limited, it's still not happening big time. Working capital demands are also still very limited as cycles haven't changed,"" said Dipak Gupta, Joint Managing Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank. ""The opportunity basket going forward looks better now, but it is still limited to few players,"" he added.

Gupta said going forward, banks need to watch out for the 'unknown unknowns' referring to highly-leveraged, top-rated companies that unexpectedly defaulted on loans.

He said for Kotak Mahindra Bank, about one-third of the quarter's slippages came from such corporate entities, while others were downgraded from the bank's Special Mention Accounts (SMA) category that comprised of flagged stressed accounts.

The bank saw Rs 1,062 crore worth of new additions to bad loans in the third quarter. The lender had reported slippages of Rs 800 crore in the first and Rs 1,000 crore in the second quarter of the current financial year.

On a positive note, Gupta pointed out there have been no new additions to the SMA list in the third quarter. As on December 31, 2019, the bank’s SMA-2 book stood at Rs 274 crore, down from Rs 344 crore a year ago.

The bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio and net NPA ratio also inched up to 2.46 percent from 2.07 percent and to 0.89 percent from 0.71 percent in the same quarter last year, respectively.

However, the bank has maintained its credit cost guidance of 60 basis points for the current financial year.",356,-0.12984584910529

The profit growth was driven by higher other income (up 37.34 percent YoY), operating income (up 23.20 percent YoY) and lower tax cost (down 48.78 percent YoY), but was limited due to higher employee cost.

In the short term, the market has discounted geopolitical tensions and benchmark indices have hit all-time highs; we expect the market to rally ahead of Budget 2020, Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research - Investment Advisor, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Can we say the worst is over of Indian market and all eyes are now on the Budget and earnings?

The market remained volatile amid geopolitical tension between Iran and the US, but things have not stabilised just yet. In the short-term, the market has discounted geopolitical tensions and benchmark indices have hit all-time highs; we expect the market to rally ahead of Budget 2020. Also, third-quarter results, kick-started on Friday after IT major Infosys declared its result, should play a factor

What are the important support and resistance levels to watch out for in the coming week?

The Nifty needs to hold on to 12,300 level for the upside to continue. This will act as a make or break level. 12,100 level will act as major support and any dip will be a buying opportunity.

Metal and NBFC stocks may outperform indices. The Nifty50 is likely to touch 12,500 ahead of Budget 2020, as strong currency and lower crude prices may help the Indian market to move to this short-term milestone of 12,500.

Any crucial events which investors should take note that can impact D-Street sentiment?

Q3 financial results will be a key driver. Key economic indicator data which include IIP, CPI will also impact the January series.

Global markets are also trading with positive momentum and are likely to perform well. Union Budget 2020 will also drive the market.

What is your view on Infosys results? What do you recommend – buy, sell or hold?

The focus of investors will be more aligned towards the outcome of the investigation on the whistle-blower case, attrition levels, total contract value pipeline momentum, revenue conversion of past deals and improvement in margins.

The attrition rate at Infosys stood at 21.7 percent in the second quarter of FY19 which is much higher than its closest competitor Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) that reported an attrition rate of 11.6 percent in the second quarter of FY 19.

So, actions taken and their effects will be watched closely because client satisfaction and employee attrition are closely related.

The digital business of Infosys accounts for 38.3 percent of the total revenue during the second quarter ended September, but in December quarter we are expecting there will be margin pressure due to pricing pressure.

But, banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) segments may become a driver in its revenue going forward. Based on this, we can buy Infosys amid good quarterly results in the December quarter.

Any top three stocks which you think are good breakout buys as we saw a sharp recovery in the week gone by?

Here is a list of top three stocks fundamentally strong stocks for buy on dips:

L&T: Buy | Target: Rs 1,450 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,250

We are expecting that budget mechanisms will bring optimism in infrastructure stocks. The centre’s push towards infrastructure — road construction, electrification of railways and high-speed rail, airport expansion, and smart cities — will set the path of growth for infra major L&T’s order flow.

Good revenue visibility along with the company’s diversified business and strong financials also support buying the stock. The company has also added several private players, alongside a few overseas ones, to its client base.

We recommend buying L&T at Rs 1,325 and keep a stop loss at Rs 1,250 on closing basis with a target of Rs 1,450.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy| Target: Rs 1765| Stop Loss: Rs 1635

Kotak’s loan book has grown at a CAGR of 27 percent over FY09 – FY19. Consolidated earnings growth CAGR during the same period (FY09-19) was at 27 percent.

The prudence of its risk management is visible in its lower NPA, which means its net NPA ratio has been at 0.87 percent during FY09-FY19 (one of the lowest in the industry).

Over the last five years, while other banks have struggled with asset quality issues in their corporate loan book, Kotak’s corporate loan book has grown at more than 20 percent CAGR in a challenging environment.

We recommend buying Kotak Bank at Rs 1685 and keep a stop loss at Rs 1,635 on closing basis with a target of Rs 1765.



Titan Company Ltd: Buy | Target: Rs 1,255 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,130

One of the major organized players in the jewellery sector may take part in growth by demand-driven factors. Jewellery division is witnessing muted sales due to weak demand in line with the industry.

Sales were good during the Akshaya Tritiya period. To get back on its growth track, Tanishq launched “Lavanyam” (a range of traditional South Indian jewellery) during the quarter and the watches segment is in growth momentum.

We recommend buying Titan Company at Rs 1,171 and keep a stop loss at Rs 1,130 on closing basis with a target of Rs 1,255.

Q) Why have small & midcaps stocks started performing recently -- is it the FII flows, or pre-budget euphoria catching up?

A) The Nifty50 is getting significantly diverged from our slow-growth economy. From Nifty50, we can see nearly 30 companies (nearly 60% of Nifty stocks) – are from balance sheets heavy sectors like power, construction, metals, telecom, real estate and oil & gas whose 10-year return is less than 10%.

As these heavy sectors are not performing well to give attractive returns to investors, the smart money is trying to flow to smart midcap and smallcap stocks because less room is left for investors in largecap stocks.

Only the fittest will survive the difficult financial sector landscape and the ""consolidating"" environment presents Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) growth opportunities, its head Uday Kotak said.

In a New Year message to employees, Kotak urged everyone to be on the toes in the current environment where Charles Darwin's 'Survival of the Fittest' is most applicable and also gave examples of sectors like telecom, airlines, real estate and finance, where there have been troubles.

""It is a great opportunity for Kotak to grow in an environment which is consolidating,” he said.

The well-capitalised private sector lender's name has constantly featured in speculation as the entity looking out for acquisitions.

Possibly taking cue from the same, heads of its peers SBI and Axis Bank last month publicly said that KMB was the best suited to acquire troubled private sector lender Yes Bank. Both KMB and Yes Bank denied any such deal.

Kotak, the bank's managing director and chief executive, also has to decrease his stake in the bank from the present levels of over 30 per cent. He had tried to do the same by using a sophisticated instrument in 2018, but the RBI refused to play the ball and the bank dragged the central bank to court.

""As the financial sector goes through its throes, KMB must meet the challenges and take this opportunity to strengthen its position as a credible, high-quality, high on integrity, and value-based player in the system,"" Kotak said.

In the message, he said good governance matters in a company or a country as well, and affirmed to adhere to the same as he builds the bank in the new decade.

Accountability was also flagged out by Kotak as a key principle to be adhered to, with a nuanced take on freedom means.

""Freedom is not the right to do what one wants to do - it is the responsibility to do what one ought to do,"" he said.

He also exhorted employees to adopt a “digital first” approach in a changing world by focusing on faster turnaround times, technology and customer-first attitudes.

Kotak also affirmed commitment to work on clean air and water, education and healthcare through its corporate social responsibility programme.",380,0.5972410043080648

Noted banker Uday Kotak on December 17 said the country's financial system is currently in a Darwinian mode as only the fittest lenders are able to survive. The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank also that historically, whenever there has been a problem with a private sector lender, it has been merged with a state-run bank. ""India is in massive Darwinian mode of what I call as the survival of the fittest. ""Sector after sector has seen that it is going to be more consolidated than ever before. Consolidation in the Indian economy is happening more out of mortality and less out of combinations,"" Kotak said.

He also noted that historically, whenever there has been a problem with a private sector lender, it has been merged with a state-run bank. According to him, the government has to ""rework"" the Financial Resolution Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill since an exit route is essential for troubled lenders.

FRDI Bill, which had raised concerns over protection for depositors, has lapsed and the government is yet to introduce a new bill.

""As you are allowing entry in banking, we should be thinking more about exit policy. And one of the earlier bill that was planned earlier was the FRDI Bill. We need to rework on that,"" Kotak said, speaking at the Times Network organised India Economic Conclave here.

The comments come at a time when multiple lenders, especially non-banks and also cooperatives like PMC Bank are sailing through choppy waters, which has highlighted the need for a legislation to take care of exits by financial sector participants.

Kotak also welcomed rules introduced under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) wherein troubled DHFL has been referred for resolution.

Regarding infra-lender IL&FS, whose over RS 94,600-crore debt resolution process he heads, Kotak reiterated the company is confident of recovering over 50 per cent of its dues.

He said the biggest challenge in the IL&FS resolution was the distribution mechanism, which has been overcome after the Supreme Court judgement in the Essar Steel case.

Kotak said there has been a complex web of over 340 companies in the IL&FS group created over two decades which resulted in a lot of time taken by its new board.

He said the time has come to ""dramatically increase"" the flow of domestic savings going into risk averse assets like fixed deposits and gold, into risk capital which can help the economy better.

Further, Kotak said the government should choose a set of six core state-run lenders, and mark out three others where its stake would go down below 50 per cent through sales in the market and have the remaining three run as ""public private partnerships"".",463,0.3816204269727071

Two of India's top bankers on Tuesday opined that Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) is best suited to acquire smaller and capital-starved rival Yes Bank.

Yes Bank's capital buffers have dipped on accelerated non-performing assets recognition under new chief executive Ravneet Gill earlier this year.

The private sector lender's capital raising plan is also passing through uncertainties and there are speculations on whether Yes Bank is an acquisition target, which has been denied by its management.

""I think Uday (Kotak) is the best candidate to acquire Yes Bank. You need deep pockets, Uday has that,"" SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said at Times Network's India Economic Conclave here.

When the same question was posed to third-largest lender Axis Bank's Managing Director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry, it was answered with the same suggestion.

""We (Axis Bank) are a smaller bank. We are trying to ensure that we grow big so that at some stage we can acquire others. So, yes Mr Kotak, they are best suited rather than us,"" he said.

When contacted, Kotak Mahindra Group Chief Communication Officer Rohit Rao said, ""these are comments made by other bankers and reflect their views, and not ours"".

In the past, both Axis Bank and KMB have been discussed as potential suitors for Yes Bank.

According to some watchers, acquiring a bank can help Uday Kotak reduce the promoter stake in KMB, and help him get closer to the levels mandated by the RBI.

The regulator has been dragged to the court by KMB for not accepting an earlier attempt at stake dilution and the same petition is slated to be heard early next year.

Meanwhile, speaking at the same event, Kotak said there is a need to resist a ""colonialisation"" of Indian finance, hinting at share sales to foreign investors.

""I'm looking forward to best in class quality but strong Indian-owned and controlled financial sector and while we must attract foreign capital, we must ensure that there is no colonialisation of Indian finance,"" Kotak said.

Yes Bank had to cut its book size by 7 per cent in the September quarter because of the capital constraints and has been looking to finish the capital raising exercise at the earliest.

The lender had first announced it has interest from investors of USD 3 billion, and a few days later disclosed offers of USD 2 billion. It wanted to finalise the same at the last board meet on December 10 but was not able to take a decision.

Yes Bank's share price plummeted to Rs 32 apiece in October as against a high of Rs 400 just a year ago and has been one of the most volatile scrips on the bourses.",458,0.141445529460907

Global brokerage house Morgan Stanley remained bullish on Tech Mahindra, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank as it expects these stocks could return 10-20 percent in next one year.

While having overweight call on largecap IT company Tech Mahindra with a target price of Rs 850 per share, the research house said the company was confident of improvement in deal pipeline for communications business.

Hence, Morgan Stanley expects FY20 revenue growth of the company at 6.7 percent and FY21 at 8-10 percent against 4.2 percent in FY19.

With improving margin, earnings growth could be even better, it said, adding valuation looks cheap at current levels. Tech Mahindra share price was quoting at Rs 780.15, up Rs 7.20, or 0.93 percent on the BSE at 1027 hours IST.

Morgan Stanley also has overweight rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank, the fourth largest lender by market capitalisation, with a target at Rs 1,900 per share as it believes share price will rise relative to the industry over the next 30 days.

After the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman confirmed hiking statutory FPI limit to sectoral foreign investment limit from April 1, 2020, the company is a likely candidate to be included in MSCI Index with 5.7 percent weight, the brokerage said.

On Monday, Morgan Stanley said it expected MSCI India's weight to rise about 70 bps when it would do semi-annual review in May 2020. According to the brokerage, the increase in India weightage will lead to a passive flow of $2.5 billion.

The global research firm also has overweight rating on IndusInd Bank on the back of strong capital and focus on granularising assets/deposits. ""We see pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) growth increasing further and return on equity at 17.5 percent in FY21.

It raised target price of the stock to Rs 1,800 from Rs 1,700, though market is concerned with corporate NPLs, which could drive stock in near term.

Kotak Mahindra Bank was quoting at Rs 1,714.65, up Rs 10.30, or 0.60 percent and IndusInd Bank was up 0.6 percent at Rs 1,502.10 at the time of publishing this copy.

Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are looking to hire around 5,000 fresh graduates in total, The Economic Times reported.

The latest recruitment round would see a higher focus on on-boarding tech talent, along with an increased emphasis on design skills which are increasingly in demand.

Of the two private lenders, Kotak Mahindra bank is looking to hire around 2,600 fresh graduates. Meanwhile, Axis Bank would be hiring over 2,300 fresh graduates, of which 2,000 would be taken in for entry-level positions, while the remaining candidates would be sought from B-schools, IITs and NITs, the report stated.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

The report added that this would be the first time that Kotak Mahindra Bank turned towards engineering colleges, including them in their campus outreach activities.

Or should we wait before putting fresh money into markets? Well, these questions are running in your mind, rest assured, you are not alone.

Investors are caught between FOMO which is fear of missing out the rally and fear as the market could witness profit taking at higher levels which could take the index lower.

The S&P BSE Sensex hit a fresh record high of 40,483 on Monday while the Nifty50 is still about 200 points away from hitting its record high above 12,103.

Well, the good news is that the rally is here to stay and experts see the momentum continue and take Nifty50 towards 12,700-13,000 in the next 12 months. Hence, we are in a good buy on dips market.

“We have a one-year forward target of 12,700 for Nifty 50 post-Q1 result, which we are maintaining. The outlook for the equity market has improved post the cut in corporate tax and interest rate, as well as, the reduction in the cost of raw material. All these factors have contributed to better than expected Q2 results,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“Earnings from H2FY20 is likely to better on account of good monsoon and stimulus from the government. A further interest rate cut from the RBI & Fed may improve the liquidity in the medium-term,” he said.

The latest corporate tax cuts are a structural move, and it would improve the corporate earnings estimates by around 7-10 percent thus giving a northwards inflection, which would further continue backed by investments and subsequently consumption-driven demand, suggest experts.

“Over the long term, say 3-5 years, markets are poised for a move northwards backed by solid domestic corporate earnings growth supported by domestic consumption-led demand,” Pankaj Bobade, Head of Fundamental Research at Axis Securities told Moneycontrol.

“The earnings performance of corporates over the last couple of quarters has been picking up though not in a secular manner; the texture, quality of earnings is improving. The impact of corporate tax cuts could be seen from H2FY20 onwards; the impact of any other reforms would be seen 6 months down the line,” he said.

We have collated a list of top 13 fundamentally strong stocks by different experts for your portfolio which could turn out to be big wealth creators in the next 2-3 years:

Expert: D K Agarwal Chairman & MD, SMC Investments and Advisors Limited

Marico

The company will continue to drive sustained profitable volume-led growth over the medium term, through its focus on strengthening the franchise in the core categories and driving the new engines of growth towards gaining critical mass.

Over the medium term, the company retains the target of 8-10 percent volume growth and healthy market share gains in the India business.

The company aims to build Healthy Foods, Premium Hair Nourishment and Male Grooming into growth engines of the future and expects to deliver value growth at 20 percent plus CAGR over the medium term in these portfolios.

On the international front, the company expects to clock organic broad-based double-digit constant currency growth over the medium term.

Larsen & Toubro

The company looks forward to a period of increased investment momentum and continued growth. Initiatives towards improved productivity, cost efficiencies derived from leveraging digital technology, capacity utilisation, and capability enhancement are expected to help the company maximise its shareholder returns (RoE) on a sustainable basis.

Consolidated order book of the group stood at Rs 29,4014 crore as of June 30, 2019, with international order book constituting 21 percent of the total. The company successfully won new orders worth Rs 38,700 crore at the group level during the quarter ended June 30, 2019, registering a growth of 11 percent.

International orders during the year at Rs 9,005 crore constituted 23 percent of the total order inflow. Order wins in Infrastructure and Power segments were the major contributors to the order inflow during the quarter.

UltraTech Cement

The Government's firm commitment to revive the economy and the thrust on infrastructure spending augurs well for the growth of cement demand. The company with its presence across all the zones in the country is the best positioned to take advantage of the revival in cement demand.

As seen in the earlier acquisitions, the management’s ability to turn around the acquired assets provides confidence in the company and the management expects similar performance even in the newly acquired Century assets. UltraTech completed the acquisition of Century's cement business recently.

ITC

Despite an extremely challenging operating environment, the company has consolidated its leadership position in the industry and continued to improve its standing in key competitive markets across the country.

This demonstrates the resilience of the company's portfolio of brands, superior consumer insights and its relentless focus on value creation.

According to the management of the company, the company is focusing on growth of its FMCG business by entering newer segments and tapping the opportunity in the foods segment. This would be a catalyst for topline growth in the long run.

ICICI Bank

The bank is focusing on growing the core operating profit in a risk calibrated manner instead of loan growth. The bank aims to improve the share of profitable market opportunities by making delivery to the customers more seamless and frictionless through digitisation and process improvements.

Business performance of the bank such as domestic loan growth, overall corporate advances, retail loan growth, CASA ratio is continuously improving. The business of the bank increased at an accelerated pace of 18 percent YoY to Rs 12,53,147 crore at the end of June 2019, supported by loan growth improving by 15 percent at Rs 5,92,415 crore.

Meanwhile, the deposits growth galloped to 21 percent at Rs 6,60,732 crore at the end of June 2019. The bank had indicated that credit cost in FY2020 is expected to reduce significantly compared to FY2019.

Expert: Pankaj Bobade, Head of Fundamental Research at Axis Securities

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB)

The net interest margins (NIMs) of KMB are amongst the best in the industry and have been in the range of 4-4.6 percent over the last 3 years. The management expects better pricing power in certain high yielding segments which will help in sustaining NIMs.

KMB has maintained benign asset quality with limited exposure to stressed sectors and conservative lending practices. Further improvement in asset quality since FY18 was seen with G/NNPAs at 2.2/0.7 percent in Q1FY20 (Slippages 1.45 percent ann). Provisioning Coverage Ratio stood at 67 percent which provides comfort.

KMB is well positioned due to higher capitalisation (Tier I - 17.3 percent), a strong liability franchise (CASA: 51 percent) and benign asset quality, which would allow it to gain further market share.

RITES

RITES has a strong and diversified order book. RITES’ standalone order book stands at Rs 6,052 crore (3x FY19 revenue). The order book is expected to grow by over 17 percent in FY20 which provides strong revenue visibility for the next 2-3 years.

The Order book is well diversified with high margin consultancy and low margin turnkey business contributing 41 percent each. RITES has a competitive edge in winning orders owing to its over four decades of experience in transport infrastructure consultancy and its association with MoR.

Ample opportunities within railways (50 percent revenue share) being captured by RITES via venturing into turnkey projects and railway station development is increasing its scale of operations. Focus on strengthening EPC business, diversification and continuous infrastructure push by the government is expected to augur well for RITES.

Dixon Technologies

Dixon is a leading player in Flat Panel Display (FPD) TV with over 50 percent market share. It is also a leading player in Lighting accounting for over 35 percent domestic volumes and commands over 40 percent share in the Washing Machines EMS market.

Indian Consumer Electronics and Appliances market is expected to grow at a faster pace of 19 percent CAGR between FY19-21E as compared to global CEA market growth at 8 percent CAGR in the same period. High growth in consumer electronics and increasing EMS presents a huge opportunity for players like Dixon.

We expect strong growth in key segments viz., Consumer Electronics, Lighting and Home Appliances led by a strong order book. The addition of new clients, recovery in the mobile segment and robust growth in the security surveillance segment would aid revenue growth, going forward.

Amber Enterprises

Amber is the market leader in the OEM/ODM industry with 55.4 percent share in volume terms (outsourced market). AEL’s share stands at 19.1 percent in the overall residential air-conditioning (RAC) market in terms of volume.

Key customers include Godrej, Bluestar, Daikin, Hitachi, LG, Panasonic, Voltas, Whirlpool and Carrier Midea, which together account for 75 percent of the market share.

With the acquisition of Sidwal Refrigeration, the company has made a foray in the mobile air-conditioning segment. We believe that Sidwal Refrigeration Industries Pvt Ltd (SRIPL) is a strategic fit in Amber’s portfolio.

Amber will continue to deliver industry-leading growth and is a proxy play in evolving and fast-growing RAC market- the most underpenetrated segment in the white goods category in India.

Expert: Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services

Avanti Feeds

A leading exporter of processed prawn and fish feeds in India. Avanti has five shrimp feed manufacturing units with a capacity of 6,00,000 MT and two processing and exporting units with a capacity of 22,000 MT.

Being the market leader in the feed segment the company is aiming to become one of the largest players in the processing segment through its capacity addition.

The recent improvement witnessed in farm-gate and stabilisation in export prices provides a better outlook for both Feed and Processing segments. Going forward the revenue/PAT is expected to grow at 14/19 percent CAGR over FY19-21E.

Coromandel International

Largest privately-owned phosphatic fertilizer manufacturers in India with a considerable presence in its home market, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and other nearby states.

The subsequent improvement in monsoon and central government schemes like the Pradhan Mantri-Kisan scheme announced this year to help double farmer income and boost the demand for fertilizer products.

Expect PAT to grow by a CAGR of 17 percent during FY19-21E on the back of an increase in the share of new unique grade products and improvement in margins due to backward integration.

Mold-Tek Packaging:

It is one of the leading manufacturers and suppliers of high quality airtight and pilfers proof containers/pails in India for Paints, Lubricants, Food and FMCG.

The company is credited with shifting Indian paint and lubricant industry to plastic pails from metal containers. Going forward, MTEP is expected to capitalise on long-term growth opportunities, aided by higher volumes due to increasing acceptance of IML in paint and lubricant segments.

Further, focus on capacity expansion, diversification of end-users and penetration into newer markets will drive earnings growth.

Brokerage: HSBC

L&T Finance Holding

The brokerage has a buy rating on L&T Finance Holding with a target price of Rs 130. LTFH delivered a stable September quarter performance in a very challenging environment.

Focused loan book grew 19 percent on a YoY basis, while asset quality and margins (plus fees) remained largely stable on QoQ. It raise FY20-22e earnings on lower tax outgo.

The management has maintained a fine balance between growth and asset quality. Risks associated with asset quality outlook of the wholesale mortgage loans appear priced in.",1899,0.8930703453395678

We expect allocations to move to non-HRITIK stocks in largecaps and into midcaps (having a market cap above Rs 8,000 cr), Vinay Pandit, Head, Institutional Equities, IndiaNivesh, said in an interview to Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q) It was a historic week for Indian equity markets with gains of nearly 3% for the week ended November 1. What is your view of markets in the coming week? Will the Nifty hit a fresh high or have we topped out?

A) This is in line with our view, where we said that the Nifty will hit new highs around Diwali. Largecap earnings growth has gone up by 15-18 percent, which augurs well for the broader markets and the index earnings.

Two major factors are contributing to this. First, the lower tax rate has averaged out the higher tax provisioning of Q1 over the lower tax for Q2, thereby cutting the tax provisioning for Q2 to 15-18 percent.

Second, the low base effect over the last year’s Q2 is being seen now, especially in auto volumes. We don’t believe that the Nifty has topped out, though multiples may have topped out for certain frontline stocks.

We expect allocations to move to other non-HRITIK stocks (HDFC, RIL, Infosys, TCS, HUL , IndusInd, and Kotak Mahindra Bank) in largecaps and into midcaps (having a market cap above Rs 8,000 cr).

HDFC Life and SBI Life were seen diluting equity and are now in the race to enter the Nifty (free float methodology) potentially replacing Yes Bank/Bharti Infratel.

Q) What is your view of the auto sales numbers for the month of October? Do you think things have bottomed out and can the auto sector be a dark horse in 2020?

A) Auto sales numbers have been encouraging. However, Maruti Suzuki India is still a long way from getting the premium 30x multiples, which it commanded in the past. To get there, it will have to start doing sales volume numbers of 160-170K per month.

However, this will still yield lifetime low margins and ROEs, thereby offering profit-booking opportunity every time it crosses Rs 7,500-7,700. As a house, we have a ‘sell’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 5,700 based on 23x FY21E earnings.

TVS Motor numbers were disappointing on the two-wheeler side. We expect Hero Motors and Bajaj Auto to throw up positive surprises, led by festival season sales, rural demand and strong support to the channel, coupled with a focus on liquidating BS-IV inventory.

Eicher Motors may do well on liquidation of inventory in the system for the quarter. However, competition from Jawa and cannibalising its products portfolio between 500CC & 650 CC, as well as between Classic 350 and Bullet 350, could hamper expectations of incremental volumes.

Exports could throw up major surprises in the coming months as displayed in October data. We expect the pain in CVs (commercial vehicles) to continue for some more time before economic activity picks up significantly while being attractively valued.

The sector witnessed a bottoming out in Jul-Aug’19, and we may see positive spurts on performance for select companies such as Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motors.

Q) The last 11 years data suggest that November usually belongs to the bears. The Sensex closed in the red in November in seven of the 11 years. Do you think 2019 will be different?

A) While such data points will always pop up, we believe broader market trends need to be studied. November in the last 11 years has been positive four out of 11 years. At the same time, September, October, and December have been positive 50% of the time. September 2019 was up 6.3% vs September 2018 (-5.6%). October 2019 was up 4.6% vs October 2018 (-5.6%).

November has started on a positive note and can be expected to close on a positive note just like November 2018, led by good festive sales, lower tax rate giving a boost to corporate earnings and the bottoming out scenario in certain sectors.

These kinds of data points are of little relevance to long-term investment strategies and can be easily ignored. Overall earnings performances of most companies have been good for Q2FY20 vs Q2FY19 when there were more misses than hits.

Analysts continue to be conservative on the back of weak expectations for the year, which is a good hidden opportunity to invest for the long-term in quality stocks at low valuations.

Q) Any important events to watch out for in November?

A) While the government has addressed supply-side concerns, the demand-side concerns need to be addressed as well. While not as early as November, we expect rationalisation of tax slabs in the upcoming budget in February 2020, easing out of the Long Term Capital Gains Tax, and improving corporate governance to be the key factors for the market starting next year.

Indian IIP data may disappoint but seems to be bottoming out over there as well. Green offshoots are visible in several beaten-down sectors like autos and auto ancillaries, NBFCs, banking, infrastructure, defence, apparel retail, domestic pharma, among others.

Q) How is the November series likely to pan out for investors? What are the bright spots if we look at the October series rollover data? Which stocks are likely to be on the list of bulls and those that will remain in the grip of the bears?

A) There is money to be made on the table by investing and trading in quality companies. Good companies are offering enough investment opportunities at low valuations on the back of strong performances and quality corporate governance.

Autos (two-wheelers) and auto ancillaries, resolution of banking & NBFC issues, defence ordering, pick-up in retail, and the strong performance by companies in domestic pharma will keep bulls busy, while airlines, telecom, passenger vehicles, capital goods, real estate will keep the bears busy.

We believe that the overall direction of the market is positive now, having seen time as well as an earnings correction across sectors over the last 18 months.

The positive FII inflows seen over the last 10-15 days coupled with continued inflows into mutual funds (as SIPs inflows continue to make lifetime highs) augurs well for overall markets and long-term direction of Indian markets.

ICICI Direct's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a strong set of numbers. The operational performance continued to remain healthy at Rs 2509 crore, up 20% YoY on the back of healthy NII growth & stable core fee income. Net interest income (NII) was at Rs 3350 crore, up 24.6% YoY due to an improvement in margins of 41 bps YoY at 4.61%. Other income was flat YoY at Rs 124 crore. Benefit from lower tax rate was more than enough to offset higher provisions on advances of ~Rs 398 crore. Accordingly, PAT was at Rs 1724 crore, up 51% YoY. Overall asset quality broadly remain stable with GNPA ratio at 2.32% (13 bps increase) & NNPA ratio at 0.85% (12 bps increase).

Outlook

Value enrichment remains positive with contribution at 28%. Hence, we maintain HOLD with a revised TP of Rs 1700, based on SOTP valuation. Outcome of tussle between bank and RBI continues to remain key monitorable.

Top lenders in India posted their second quarter results this week, with fewer additions to bad loans. However, bank chiefs expressed concerns on the impact of slowdown and delay in resolution of large accounts on the asset quality and credit costs going forward.

ICICI Bank says asset quality steady as slippages ease in Q2

ICICI Bank said that fresh additions to bad loans had stabilized, which led to overall improvement in its asset quality. However, there was an uptick in the lender’s watchlist over concerns of an economic slowdown. The total slippages for the quarter were Rs 2,482 crore, lower than around Rs 2,800 crore in the previous quarter and Rs 3,100 crore in the same period in 2018.

SBI says fresh additions to bad loans will further ease by March 2020

In what seems to be a relief from incurring heavy slippages quarter after quarter, the State Bank of India (SBI) expects that fewer loans will turn sour going forward. The country’s largest lender aims to contain its slippage ratio within 2 percent of its loan book by end of the current financial year, Chairman Rajnish Kumar said. The bank’s loan book stood at Rs 22.48 lakh crore on September 30.

More slippages from watch list likely, says Axis Bank CEO Amitabh Chaudhry

Given the current economic scenario, Axis Bank is likely to witness higher slippages from its pool of stressed assets going forward, the bank’s MD & CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said. Slowing economy, funding issues faced by non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies, promoters facing legal issues and others under the lens of enforcement agencies are the several challenges that may have a bearing on the banking sector.

Economic slowdown likely to push up credit costs, says Uday Kotak

The slowing economy and a delayed turnaround are likely to push up credit costs for the private sector lender going forward, Uday Kotak, MD, Kotak Mahindra Bank said. “We do believe that the credit costs are going to be a little higher than what we had bargained for at the beginning of the year,” Kotak said in an earnings call, adding that the bank expected the credit costs to be around 60 basis points.

Bandhan Bank looks to ramp up home loan portfolio

Bandhan Bank, which specializes in micro lending, is planning to increase its presence in the home loans market after it took over the portfolio from Gruh Finance in a recently concluded merger. The loans of Gruh Finance now form 28 percent of Bandhan Bank's advances book.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB's s'lone earnings of Rs17.2bn (PLe: 15.5bn) was better than expectations on back of benefit from lower tax rate and decent beat in NII & lower opex. Loan growth further has come off to 15% YoY (12% incl Prime) mainly slower growth from corporate & auto loans. Key positives were (i) strong accretion in retail deposits especially CASA which grew at 21% YoY EOP & 18% YoY on average basis and (ii) strong tailwinds from focus on retail low cost liabilities & benefit from cut in savings rate has helped to reached peak NIMs of 4.6%. Debate continues on growth as risk adjusted margin have been not commensurate and slowing economy has led to uptick in stress as evident in this quarter's asset quality.

Outlook

Given the environment, we retain our HOLD rating with TP of Rs1,586 (unchanged) based on Sep-21 SOTP.

Brokerage houses have remained mixed in rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank after the lender reported higher-than-expected profit in the September quarter, but the asset quality weakened sequentially.

The stock gained nearly 40 percent in he last one year amid steady earnings growth. It was quoting at Rs 1,618.45, down Rs 10.45, or 0.64 percent on the BSE at 11:18 hours IST.

While having a buy call and raising the price target to Rs 1,960 from Rs 1,850 (implying 20 percent potential upside from current levels), global brokerage CLSA said the bank continued to fare well in strengthening its deposit franchise.

""Lower funding cost and taxes offered scope to de-risk further. We see a 25 percent profit CAGR over FY19-22 & return on equity improving toward 16 percent,"" said CLSA which disappointed to see a rise in slippage though stressed loans remained low.

Asset quality weakened in the September quarter with gross non-performing assets (as a percentage of gross advances) rising 13 bps sequentially to 2.32 percent and the net NPA climbing 12 bps QoQ to 0.85 percent in Q2.

The bank reported a profit growth of 51 percent in quarter ended in September YoY due to lower tax rates, and the net interest income jumped 25.2 perent YoY, with the loan growth at 15 percent YoY.

Sharekhan said the bank had performed steadily in a tough phase for the banking sector, demonstrating its stable business model. It believes, with a lot of other PSU counterparts still struggling to get out of the woods, well-capitalised banks like Kotak Mahindra Bank are placed to grab market share.

Hence, the brokerage maintained positive view on the stock and expects a 15-18 percent upside from current levels.

Credit Suisse has maintained its neutral rating on the stock but raised target price to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,340 per share as growth slowed further though tax cuts and NIMs boosted earnings.

The bank's net interest margin improved to 4.61 percent in Q2FY20 from 4.49 percent in previous quarter.

Private sector bank Kotak Mahindra Bank is scheduled to report its September quarter earnings on October 22, 2019.

Research and broking firm KR Choksey expects Kotak Mahindra Bank to report a net profit at Rs 1,511 crore up 32.3 percent year-on-year (up 11.1 percent quarter-on-quarter).

Net Interest Income (NII) is expected to increase by 23.7 percent YoY (up 4.8 percent QoQ) to Rs 3,326 crore. Pre-Provision Profit (PPP) is likely to rise by 18.8 percent YoY (up 3.7 percent QoQ) to Rs 2,488 crore.

ICICIdirect, on the other hand, expects the bank to report net profit at Rs 1,576.1 crore up 38.1 percent YoY (up 15.9 percent QoQ). Net Interest Income (NII) is expected to increase by 18.7 percent YoY (up 0.6 percent QoQ) to Rs 3,191.3 crore. Pre-Provision Profit (PPP) is likely to rise by 15.3 percent YoY (up 0.7 percent QoQ) to Rs 2,415.9 crore.

Motilal Oswal expects the bank to report loan growth of 18 percent YoY and post deposit growth at 18 percent YoY in 2QFY20. Margins are likely to contract slightly to 4.4 percent. Overall, the research firm expects NII growth of 21 percent YoY adding that CASA retention would be a key driver of NII and NIM.

With strong digital initiatives and fast-paced customer acquisition, fee income would be a key growth driver for the bank and factor in other income growth of 5 percent YoY in 2QFY20, driven mostly by healthy fee traction and expect the trend to continue, it said.

Motilal Oswal expects asset quality to remain stable, with GNPA at 2.2 percent and NNPA at 0.7 percent and standalone PBT to grow at 21 percent YoY to Rs 21.1 billion against Rs 20.8 billion in 1QFY20. PAT is estimated at Rs 15.4 billion for 2QFY20

Key things to watch:

Net-interest margin (NIM) above 4.2 percent will be positive while loan growth above 18 percent will be positive. Fee income should remain strong due to loan growth and digital initiatives. Low-cost deposit flow should be strong for the bank while GNPA below 2.25 percent will be positive, according to a poll by CNBC-TV18.",361,0.7617501467466354

HDFC: HDFC Ltd would also be a good option given the premium it earns for the management and the brand. This mortgage lender is well-positioned and despite the issues in the NBFC space, it has been standing strong fundamentally.

The company is well placed to serve the growing demand. As far as the financial position of the company goes, it is virtually debt-free and gives a 22-25 percent return on equity, as well as, return on capital employed.

Hindustan Zinc: Since zinc warehouse stock levels are at a near five-year low, any spur in demand would directly benefit Hindustan Zinc as it’s one of the lowest-cost producers in the world.

Q) Any top 5 stocks which are fundamentally sound and could turn out to be wealth creators in the next 2-3 years? A) Five Stocks which would be wealth creators for the next 2-3 years would be Hindustan Zinc , HDFC , SBI Life Insurance , Kotak Mahindra Bank and ITC .

Moreover, investing largely depends on the risk-taking appetite of the investor and his will as to where he wants to invest. Ideally, having a balanced portfolio across large, mid and smallcaps would be recommended.

Q) What are your views on broader market indices? We saw some outperformance last month – do you think the momentum will continue? A) The broader markets will outperform. The small and midcap space is in the initial phase of the bull market but during the mature stage, small and midcaps will catch up.

A recent 50 percent correction of the entire rally by the benchmark indices is very normal in such circumstances.

Trade concerns and corporate tax cuts are two diverging factors, but eventually, the fundamental reality will catch up with them as the tax cuts will play a domino effect to boost liquidity and increase the capex capacity of corporates.

Q) Indian markets seem to have caught up/stuck between trade talk woes, and muted economic data back home. Benchmark indices have also given up almost 50 percent of the gains recorded post the corporate tax cut. What are your views? A) The markets will always keep oscillating between varied sets of challenges. However, the underlying strength of fundamentals will eventually manifest in the stock prices in the long run.

Hindustan Zinc, HDFC, SBI Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ITC are the top five stocks to create wealth in the next 2-3 years, Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand. edited excerpts:

Also, millennials are seen educating themselves about the importance of life insurance which would act as a catalyst.

Kotak Mahindra Bank:

Kotak Mahindra Bank would be a great business to invest in given the brand and respect created by the management by succinctly allocating capital to use.

ITC:

ITC would be a good investment at this point. It is a sound company available at a fair price where the management is relentlessly working to improve its retail segment margins which can flair in the near term.

Q) What is keeping FIIs on the sidelines? They have turned net sellers in October as well? What are the big factors which are pushing them away from Indian markets?

A) “Uncertainty is a friend to no one” - FPIs were caught on the wrong footing when the exchequer brought the much-cheered corporate tax cut which overnight decreased the valuation multiples of frontline stocks, making Indian bourses more reasonable in terms of relative valuations.

That being so, FPIs have slowed down selling across Indian equities but have not turned buyers yet. There is every likelihood that they may turn net buyers after the Nifty50 corrects to around 11,000 levels.

Q) Equity mutual fund inflow hits a four-month low in September on profit booking. The total outflow has pulled down the asset base of the MF industry to Rs 24.51 lakh crore in September-end from Rs 25.47 lakh crore at end-August. A slowdown in domestic flows does not spell good news for investors – what are your views?

A) Taking an aggregate view of the mutual fund industry is not appropriate given the fact that around 35 percent of the AUMs are into equities on an AUM size of Rs 25.47 lakh crore base.

Liquid and debt funds are witnessing turbulent times because the economy is ailing under some sort of liquidity crisis. It is therefore natural to expect continued pressure on debt and liquid schemes in the medium term.

However, equity scheme flows are constant at around Rs. 8,200 crore a month which certainly indicates the confidence of retail investors in the equity market.

Q) What are your views on the September quarter earnings from India Inc? Do you think the recent cut in corporate tax rate will lead to more upgrades?

A) Corporate tax cuts will certainly lead to prolific onetime adjustments and not upgrades. However, at an aggregate level, revenues are expected to be slower on a YoY basis.

But, this will not act as a deterrent suppressing the mood of the market. Markets should begin pricing in the revival of the economy given the stupendous Government and RBI initiatives in place.

Q) Fixed income/liquid funds witnessed outflows in September which have been the case for many months now. What should be the strategy of investors while investing in fixed income funds? Important things to watch out for?

A) While investing in Fixed Income funds investors should check the portfolio of investments. The funds should be invested in fundamentally sound large corporates of India, only then one should commit to investing in such income funds.

Q) Which sectors are likely to lead the next leg of the rally for D-Street, and why?

A) The auto sector which faced a lot of flak recently will lead the next leg of D-Street rally with its vehicle scrappage policy.

Given the liquidity crunch and trust deficit in NBFCs, housing finance businesses should come back to become well-positioned biggies.

Q) Does it make sense to go overweight on consumption stocks after the Cabinet increased DA for government employees and the interest is heading lower? What is your outlook on Autos, consumer durable?

A) Dearness allowance to 17 percent which will entail an additional outflow of nearly Rs 16,000 crore may not be significant enough to create an impact on a Rs 2 trillion economy.

But, more than this, it sends out the right signal from the Government that they are using all their might to push economic revival.

Autos will get a boost only if the Government comes out with the scrappage policy and a reduction in GST to spur growth in this beaten-down space as this sector contributes a whopping 49 percent to India’s manufacturing GDP.

Q) Banking stocks have got plenty of attention from the investor community. What are the big reasons for the same?

A) Banking stocks are largely secular and defensive plays in the investor universe as interest income works 24X7 irrespective if the bank makes money or no.

However, the biggest challenge for any banking CEO is ‘asset management’. Due to slowdown and liquidity crisis, the banking sector is facing a lot of flux which is why investors have developed either extreme pessimism or extreme optimism on selected banking stocks which then underperforms or outperforms the index.

Q) Any particular sector which you are advising your client to avoid? If yes, what are the reasons?

A) The heyday for NBFCs are over and the valuation premiums these NBFCs used to enjoy will not come back. Additionally, the incremental growth which they were enjoying for the past couple of years due to the PSU bank clean up drive will not repeat and therefore, NBFCs should be avoided.

The government on October 1 extended the tenure of Uday Kotak on the board of bankrupt NBFC Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS). The extension has been given for another year, with effect from October 3.

Under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, a bank cannot be managed by a person who is a director of any other company. It can, however, be given a temporary exception for three or nine months if so recommended by the Reserve Bank of India.

Accordingly, Kotak was given a go-ahead for three months initially, which was followed up with a nine-month relaxation that ends on October 2.

After the government took over IL&FS' board, it appointed Uday Kotak to head it and help the troubled company come out of difficulties.

The statutes will ""not apply to Kotak Mahindra Bank in so far as it relates to its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Uday Kotak being on Board of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited as its Non-executive Director for a period up to the 2nd October, 2020"", a gazette notification from the Government said.

The notification was issued by the Department of Financial Services in the Ministry of Finance on October 1 and was signed by Joint Secretary Amit Agrawal.

Terming it as a ""historic development"", a source told news agency PTI that this is the first time RBI is giving the government a go-ahead to give an extension to a bank CEO, allowing him to continue as chairman of another financial institution.

The Uday Kotak-led board found that over 250 companies were a part of the overall IL&FS group, which has an outstanding of over Rs 94,000 crore to lenders. In addition to this, over 90 percent of the flagship company's assets are classified as dud.

The board is trying to keep the company as a going concern by focusing on asset sales and has appointed a resolution professional to steer the way.

According to an Economic Times report, While HDFC Bank took to Twitter to respond to a user's concern, Kotak Mahindra Bank informed a customer who faced the issue that the problem was due to a technical fault, apologising for the same.

Banks have been making the headlines for various reasons. A fraud that was discovered in the PMC bank, and the RBI having placed Lakshmi Vilas Bank under prompt corrective action and worries over government spending having dented market sentiment. As a result, they faced volatility in the markets amid rising fears over the asset quality.

Shares of YES Bank took a hit, plunging 30 percent intraday and touching an all-time low of Rs 29.05. Overall market capitalisation of the firm also fell below Rs 8,000 crore on BSE on October 1.

The government delivered just what the doctor ordered paving the way for higher growth in the economy and simultaneously giving investors the confidence that the bull cycle is still intact.

In a historic move, the FM announced bold corporate tax reforms. The reduction in the base rate of corporate tax to 22 percent (effective maximum tax rate 25.17 percent) for Financial Year 2019-20 subject to the condition that such companies will not avail any exemption/incentive is one of the boldest tax reforms.

The current base tax rate (excluding surcharge and cess) is 30 percent (effective maximum tax rate 34.944 percent) for companies having a turnover exceeding Rs 400 crores and 25 percent (effective maximum tax rate 29.12 percent) for companies having a turnover up to Rs 400 crores.

What does the tax rate cut mean for Nifty companies?

""There are only 20 Nifty companies which paid more than 30 percent effective tax rate and accounted for 43 percent of the overall net profit in FY19,” Kotak Securities said in a report.

Companies which are paying more than 30 percent tax include names like ZEE Entertainment, HDFC Bank, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindalco Industries, Axis Bank, ITC, GAIL India, and JSW Steel.

Fall in taxes will lead to a rise in EPS by double digits which is a positive sign especially at a time when earnings have been muted or largely in single digits for the last 12-18 months.

Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO, Envision Capital in an interview with CNBC-TV18 said that investors should look at buying companies with high tax rates. The other sectors which are likely to benefit are the ones in sectors like consumer, financials and technology services.

“Any company paying 33 percent tax rate will see its earnings go up by 12 percent. Overall, we can see Nifty earnings going up by ~5-6 percent in FY20 as the effective tax rate was already lower at 26 percent,” said Oza.

He further added that the sentiment booster angle and the way this will be taken positively by FIIs and local investors we can expect the Nifty to rally by 9-10 percent from today’s low of ~10,700. Hence, 11,500-11,600 is very much possible on the Nifty without considering any other factor.

The government has taken a hit on revenues of approximately Rs 1.45 lakh crore per annum by reducing corporate tax for existing companies to 22 percent (25.17 percent effective tax) from 30 percent.

There is a big boost for companies going for fresh capex and make in India as tax rates will be just 15 percent for companies making fresh investment and incorporated after 1st Oct 2019,” Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol.

Most brokerage firms retained their rating for Kotak Mahindra Bank after June quarter results but CLSA and Jefferies raised their respective 12-month target price.

Kotak Mahindra Bank on July 22 said its standalone profit in the April-June period grew 32.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,360.2 crore. The growth was largely driven by lower provisions and higher net interest income.

CLSA maintained its buy rating but raised its target to Rs 1,750 from Rs 1,665 earlier. The global brokerage firm is of the view that lower funding cost is likely to aid growth but valuation remains rich.

CASA has emerged as its key strength, and the recent cut in the savings deposit rate could lift its net interest margin (NIM).

The management indicated there were stable trends in the quality of personal loans. Valuation is at a premium to its peer group but seems justified by its better CASA.

The scope for re-rating is fairly limited. CLSA expects a 22 percent profit CAGR over FY19-22 and the return on equity (ROE) to improve toward 15-16 percent as leverage is optimised.

Another brokerage firm, Jefferies retained its underperform rating post Q1 results but raised its target to Rs 1,225 from Rs 1,175 earlier.

Also read: Kotak Mahindra Bank Q1 profit jumps 33% to Rs 1,360 cr, gross NPA rises to 2.19%

The bank delivered below expectation result led by weaker loan growth. The net interest income (NII) too was weaker than expected, it said.

Headline asset quality deteriorated with consolidated slippage ratio elevated at 1.7 percent. The NPL ratios deteriorated across the bank, car financing and real estate business. While earnings may grow, Jefferies is of the view that valuation at 4.8x P/B is slightly steep.

Auto loans, that form 8 percent of consolidated advances for Kotak Mahindra Bank, are witnessing a slowdown in demand, the private sector lender said on July 22, adding that it would also maintain caution while lending to the sector going ahead.

The bank’s credit growth at consolidated level stood at 15 percent in the April-June quarter as auto loans shrunk by around 4 percent over the last year, as well as compared to the previous quarter.

The bank said that there was a slowdown in demand from Tier-2 and Tier-3 centres. “The excitement to buy a new vehicle has to come back there, it also has a lot to do with overall confidence level,” said Dipak Gupta, joint managing director, Kotak Mahindra Bank.

He added that lending to auto sector, along with real estate and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), remained conservative.

While the repayments in auto loans remained largely unaffected, the bank said it would watch the segment closely for any stress going ahead as the situation may worsen if the slowdown led to job cuts.

The Indian automobile sector, which has been hit with sales slowdown since 2018, has also seen cuts in production volumes. Industry data released earlier in July showed decline of 12.34 percent in vehicle sales in June.

Overall bank lending for vehicle purchases also reflects similar trend. In May, bank lending grew 5.7 percent, as compared to 10.4 percent growth registered in 2018, the latest data from Reserve Bank of India showed.

Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank fell more than 3 percent intraday on July 22 despite brokerages indicating the lender is expected to report healthy numbers for the June quarter.

The sharp fall could be attributed to correction in other major lenders like HDFC Bank and RBL Bank.

The failure or default on repayment of interest on debts by select major corporates raised concerns over expected asset quality in coming quarters.

The stock was quoting at Rs 1,460.25, down Rs 39.55, or 2.64 percent on the BSE at 13:02 hours IST.

Country's third largest private sector lender by market capitalisation is expected to report healthy year-on-year growth in profit and net interest income, with stable asset quality on sequentially in Q1.

Profit growth in Q1 could be up to 40 percent on fall in provisions, and net interest income over 20 percent compared to a year-ago with stable NIM and strong loan growth.

""Most metrics like business growth, CASA, NIMs and earnings will be strong, while we also don't see major hiccups in asset quality with credit cost close to 50-55bps,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher that expects 35 growth in profit and 22 percent in net interest income for the quarter YoY.

The brokerage expects gross non-performing assets at around 2.16 percent in Q1FY20 against 2.14 percent in Q4FY19 and 2.17 percent in Q1FY19.

Kotak Bank has maintained its asset quality at 2 percent level (gross non-performing assets).

Key issues to watch out for would be guidance on balance sheet growth, CASA and fee income growth; trend in customer acquisition post the Aadhaar verdict; GNPAs in the MSME segment; and update on the stake reduction.

Motilal Oswal expects the bank to report loan growth of around 22 percent YoY and deposit growth of around 19 percent YoY in Q1FY20. It said margins are likely to remain at around 4.4 percent in June quarter against 4.48 percent in the previous quarter and 4.3 percent year-ago.

CASA retention would be a key driver of NII and NIM, the brokerage said, adding with strong digital initiatives and fast-paced customer acquisition, fee income would be a key growth driver for the bank.

Motilal Oswal, which expects 33 percent growth in profit YoY, further said it factored in other income growth of around 8 percent in Q1FY20, driven mostly by healthy fee traction and expects the trend to continue.

Most brokerages expect pre-provision operating profit growth could be over 15 percent YoY.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated June 06, 2019, imposed a monetary penalty of Rs 2 crore on Kotak Mahindra Bank for non-compliance of directions, a statement from the Central Bank said.

The directions issued to Kotak Mahindra Bank by RBI in the exercise of its powers were under sections 27(2) and 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (the Act) to furnish information specified therein, it added.

The Central Bank had in March directed Kotak Mahindra Bank to furnish information about details of the shares held by its promoters and to submit details of the proposed course of action/ plans/ strategy for complying with the permitted timeline for dilution of promoter shareholding. Subsequently, the bank was directed to convey its commitment to achieving the dilution as per the timelines stipulated.

However, the bank failed to comply with the directions and a show cause notice was issued to the bank advising it to explain why the penalty should not be imposed for non-compliance.

After considering the reply received from the bank, submissions made by the bank during the personal hearing and the documents submitted by it, RBI came to the conclusion that the bank had failed to comply with the directions issued by RBI and decided to impose a monetary penalty on the bank.

On its part, Kotak issued a statement which read: ""The RBI has levied a penalty of Rs 2 crore on Kotak Mahindra Bank. The penalty is for an alleged failure to comply with REI's purported directions to submit details of the promoter shareholding, the proposed course of action/ plans/ strategy by the Bank, and not conveying the commitment of the Bank for achieving promoter dilution as per the timelines stipulated.

Similarly, growth in credit cards and loans for small businesses was 32 percent.

Ambuj Chandna, Senior Executive Vice President and Head – Consumer Assets of Kotak Mahindra Bank expects to see steady heightened customer demand in consumption-driven lending. In conversation with Moneycontrol, he talks about their lending strategy, instant loans, competition from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and fintech lending players, USP of their credit cards and more.

Q: Briefly give an overview of your loan book (with break-ups in each segment). What is your banks gross and net NPAs in last financial year and expectations going further? What measures you are taking for a speedy recovery of NPAs?

A: The loan book for Kotak Mahindra Bank is Rs 2.05 lakh crore as on financial year ended 2018-19. The breakup is broadly corporate banking accounts for 30 percent (Rs 61,000 crore), home loans and loans against property at 20 percent (Rs 40,700 crore), personal loan, credit cards and lending to small business loan segments at 16 percent (Rs 33,160 crore), agriculture at 13 percent and commercial vehicle (CV) and construction equipment (CE) segments at 10 percent.

Our gross non-performing asset (NPA) is at 2.14 percent as on March 31, 2019 against 2.22 percent in the previous year. Our net NPA has also improved to 0.75 percent as on against 0.98 percent in the previous year. We believe our NPAs are very much in control and don’t expect significant movement in either direction. Our strength lies in our robust underwriting skills and process. We have a stable outlook on NPAs for the current financial year.

Q: What is your lending strategy while disbursing loans to consumers for buying homes?

A: For home loans, our core focus is to reduce the processing time of the application. Recently we have launched a couple of initiatives for our home loan borrowers i.e. for our salaried customers, we give home loan sanctions within four hours. Looking ahead, we are investing heavily in technology for a decisioning online platform, which shall shorten the processing time even further for home loan customers.

For self-employed customers, the home loan process is not as simple as it is for salaried customers. Over time, we have invested in technology and have partnered with key fintech players in the industry. We are working on a digital and paperless loan approval process for self-employed customers be it for a business loan, loan against property, working capital finance loan or a home loan for a businessman, where we can evaluate the data, use that for loan decisioning and revert with loan approvals within 24 to 48 hours for self-employed customers.

We have competitive interest rates across our products and our ability to do fast decisioning on loan approvals leads to our growth in this segment.

Q: Despite 50 bps cut by RBI, most banks have only cut the marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) by only by 5-10 bps. Discuss key reasons why banks are not passing on the rate reduction to borrowers?

A: MCLR is a function of the cost of funds in the marketplace i.e. cost of borrowing, liquidity in the system and demand-supply factors. Lending rates are also a function of the underlying risk involved. Transmission of interest rates by banks, both on deposits and loans, does take place in a sustained manner. We have been passing on the rate cut benefit to our customers in a structured way.

Q: While shifting existing home loan to a new lender what are the key parameters borrower needs to consider?

A: If a financial institution is offering very low interest rates on a loan than what your own bank is charging, then check how sustainable the new rate is. We firmly believe that a borrower must check the track record of the financial institution with the large banks, the process is very structured and very fair and that’s in favour of the borrowers. You may get 10-20 bps advantage today by shifting the existing loan to a new lender, but you may be taking a risk of an arbitrary increase tomorrow. Customers must be cautious of this.

Q: Are you facing competition from NBFCs and fintech that offer instant personal/consumer finance loans at attractive interest rates?

A: Since banks have a large deposit book, our cost of funds is typically much lower than it is for NBFCs and fintechs. This allows us to price ourselves much better than NBFCs and fintech players. Even in terms of ease, we have invested in technology to be able to give our customers convenience and quick processing of loans.

Q: In the credit card market, where do you stand and what’s your market share? What features of your credit cards make a huge draw?

A: We have a market share of close to 6 percent, which is increasing every year. Today, our growth in credit card spends is two times the rest of the industry. So, we are growing significantly faster than the rest of the industry. The key reason for this is, we have a good suite of products.

We have segmented the market, based on the requirements and needs of the customers with attractive offerings. We have a card which is designed for movie buffs. On this card, we give two movie tickets free every month to our customers. We also have a separate card that is designed for people who want value in terms of dining and entertainment. So, this card has a 10 percent cashback on dining and entertainment. In addition, there is a separate card that gives 10 percent savings on the purchase of groceries through online/retail partners. We also have a credit card designed for frequent travellers with several benefits attached to it.

Q: These days the banks have reduced forex mark-ups on credit cards to compete with forex travel card. Your views whether credit card or forex card is the best companion while traveling abroad for foreign transactions? Reasons.

A: Both are powerful products for customers and both these products serve different needs. The key benefit with the forex card is that you can lock in the forex rate while loading the foreign currency on the card. While, when a customer spends using a credit card, the transaction takes place on the forex price of that day.

Usually, say for a 2-week international tour, the cost will usually average out, so it is not that one is better than the other. Credit cards and debit cards are more flexible compared to a forex card since you don’t need to apply for a card just before travelling and there is no need to load any forex currency. So it is simple. Just swipe the same card with the same PIN while travelling abroad. Also, we offer preferential pricing in forex (conversion) rate on some of our credit cards.

KMB's s'lone earnings of Rs14.1bn (PLe: 14.0bn) were in-line with misses on slightly slower top line but held up on lower provisions on largely stable asset quality. Key discussions in industry has been on liabilities garnering and KMB has showcased continued robustness in CASA growth of 21% (both on EOP & Average basis) versus sluggishness for the industry. On the non-bank business, Insurance has outstood the industry with VNB margins of 37% from ~29% in FY18, APE growth of 21% YoY and EV growth of 25% YoY, while other subs related to capital market continued to be slightly subdued. Bank's performance has been leading improvement in return ratios efficiency and deserves better than peers multiple but constraint has been on other parts of lending business which has been slower especially Kotak Prime (Auto loans).

Outlook

Hence, we retain our HOLD rating with revised TP of Rs1,385 (from Rs1,291) based on 3.2x lending BV and SOTP of Rs441 as we roll over to Mar-21.

Dolat Capital's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank reported a consolidated PAT growth of 14% YoY, with the bank growing at a robust 25% YoY. Its AMC and life insurance businesses witnessed strong growth (in trend), and Prime showed early signs of improvement. On a standalone basis, the bank’s advances grew 21%; a healthy NIM expansion, lower credit costs and healthy other incomes growth aided a higher PAT growth. GNPA for the bank rose 7 bps to 2.14%. The risk perception for most of its products is currently stable. The CASA franchise witnessed further signs of strength, improving to 50.71% (up 48 bps, QoQ), on a deposit growth of 18% YoY.

Outlook

We expect the AMC and life insurance to perform well, however operating leverage is expected to gradually improve the bottom line for Prime; even as asset growth remains sluggish.

With the automobile industry facing a slowdown in demand, Kotak Mahindra Bank said that it is reviewing lending to the sector as it may have a significant impact on the economy.

""On the front-end, it is the sale of cars, viability of dealerships. On the supplier side, there is whole host of small and medium enterprises including auto ancillary,"" said Executive Vice-Chairman Uday Kotak. He was speaking after announcing the bank's fourth quarter results on April 30.

""One sector which we are watching very closely is the automobile industry. The passenger vehicle segment is going through a slowdown, so we have to watch the space,"" he added.

While the bank did not disclose its current exposure to the sector, senior officials said that it is well within the bank's internal sectoral cap of 2 percent of overall advances that stood at Rs 2.06 lakh crore as of March 2019. The bank witnessed credit growth of 21 percent in the financial year 2018-19 and expects to grow above 20 percent this year.

""The apparent reason seems to be the availability of financing,"" Kotak said, adding that banks need to be ready if the trend is reflecting any structural change in consumer behaviour.

Loan growth to the auto sector has taken a hit, data from Reserve Bank of India showed. In 2018-19, loans disbursed to vehicles, vehicle parts and transport equipment grew by 1.4 percent, as compared to a growth of 7 percent in the previous financial year.

Passenger vehicle sales in India rose just 2.7 percent in 2018-19 as weak customer sentiment led by liquidity crunch, high vehicle prices and uncertainty revolving forthcoming elections put brakes on the sales growth in the segment.",294,-0.19992295503616334

Banker Uday Kotak on April 30 warned of more liquidity crisis plaguing the financial sector, which is already passing through ""turbulent times"", for the next two quarters and stressed on the need to have strong balance sheets to withstand difficult times.

The next six months are crucial for the financial sector, Kotak, the executive vice-chairman of Kotak Mahindra Bank said, adding the fear this time is the financial sector impacting both itself as well as the real sector.

Comments come days after smaller rival Yes Bank under a new chief executive warned that up to Rs 10,000 crore of assets existing on its book as standard assets can slip into NPAs and massively provided for the same, resulting in a maiden loss of over Rs 1,500 crore, and also troubles with some of the Reliance Capital arms.

""We are in the midst of one of the significant challenges in the financial sector and I think the next few months are crucial in the sense how the financial sector shapes up across various segments,"" he told reporters after announcing the March quarter earnings of the bank wherein it reported a 14 percent growth in net income.

""This is the time when the quality of the balance sheet of financial players gets very crucial...the true test of a financial institution is the balance sheet,"" he added.

Rather than focusing on profits, market should look at the inherent strength of the balance sheet whether it can withstand difficulties, he said.

Kotak said the financial sector was the biggest beneficiary of the note-ban exercise as massive amount of liquidity flowed into banks, insurers and mutual funds. But soon, this money got invested in illiquid assets like land and realty, which was the biggest folly because once liquidity got tighter, exiting such assets has become tough.

He said the issues faced by infra lender IL&FS, which he chairs after its bankruptcy, was the ""first signal"" of the looming crisis. It can be noted that the same has been followed by the troubles faced by promoters who borrowed against pledged shares, especially from mutual funds.

Kotak said banks coming out of NPA pains was also one of the issues which led us into the present situation. ""We need a very strong approach both from the practitioners as well as policymakers to take the financial sector into safer waters from the more turbulent waters.""

As a way-out, he said the best solution is more equity infusion into struggling players or consolidation and in the worst case there can be some mortalities as well.",436,-0.6946216310773577

Experts who participated in a panel discussion on CNBC-Awaaz on the Kotak Mahindra Bank-Reserve Bank of India (RBI) dispute over promoter stake dilution feel the bank’s promoters need to comply with regulations in spirit and not just in letter.

The Bombay High Court on April 22 adjourned hearing in the Kotak Mahindra Bank versus RBI case to January 9, 2020, citing ‘paucity of time’.

Kotak Mahindra Bank in December 2018 had moved the Bombay High Court, contesting the central bank’s decision to reject its bid to issue perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PCNPS) to reduce promoter holding.

This was a rare case of defiance by a bank against the central bank.

Kotak’s defiance

RBI had directed Kotak Mahindra Bank to reduce its promoters’ stake to 20 percent from 30 percent by December 2018 and to 15 percent by March 2020.

RBI rules stipulate that the promoters in private banks shouldn’t own more than 15 percent stake. For banks in which promoters hold more than 15 percent stake, RBI has set a deadline to dilute equity to comply with the law.

It was commonly interpreted that the central bank meant equity capital when it wrote paid-up capital in its regulations. Most private banks have fallen in line with RBI’s directive. But Kotak Mahindra Bank’s move to issue PNCPS, or a kind of preference shares, to reduce promoter holding didn’t go well with the regulator.

By issuing PNCPS or preference shares, it was alleged that the promoter Uday Kotak’s stake reduction in Kotak Mahindra Bank doesn’t lead to any dilution in control as the voting rights are not attached to the issue of preference share capital.

Spirit of the law missing

Banking, legal and corporate governance analysts are critical of Kotak Mahindra Bank for not adhering to the spirit of the law, and also of RBI for giving Kotak repeated extensions to comply with the 15 percent economic ownership ceiling.

“It's very unfortunate that this matter had reached the court. RBI and Kotak should have resolved this amicably,” said Shriram Subramanian, Founder & MD of InGovern, told CNBC-Awaaz.

""It's kind of backdoor capital entry. There is not consultative process. At least, Kotak Mahindra Bank should have given an assurance to RBI on things related to voting rights,” Subramanian said.

Ironically, in the preface to the report of the SEBI Committee on Corporate Governance which he chaired, Kotak had written: “If one delves deeper (into corporate India), one could find that while the letter of the law may have been complied with, the spirit of regulations has not necessarily been embraced wholeheartedly.”

Sandeep Parekh, founder of Finsec Law Advisors, a financial sector law firm based out of Mumbai, said ambiguity over guidelines has compounded the problem.

“They haven’t (Kotak Mahindra Bank) followed the law in spirit, but the drafting of the law by RBI is sloppy. RBI should have provide clarity on paid-up capital. The courts go by the language,” Parekh said.

“The (Bombay High) Court stay on the preference issue prima facie means that RBI has a stronger case,” he said.

Hemindra Hazari, independent market expert, has called for stern action against Kotak Mahindra Bank.

“When Kotak Mahindra Bank or any of these new private banks accepted the bank licence, one of the terms was that they would accept RBI’s interpretation on all such banking matters. Clearly in this matter, Kotak Mahindra Bank's promoter Uday Kotak was in violation of the RBI norm as on December 31, and therefore there has to be a stern penalty imposed by RBI on Kotak Mahindra Bank,” Hazari said.

“Unlike other new private sector banks that dutifully followed the RBI norm of reducing promoter's stake close to 15 percent, Kotak Mahindra Bank was a noted exception. A regulator can’t make such exceptions to one bank,” Hazari added.

Moneycontrol has argued that a bank, whose Vice-Chairman and promoter, chaired a panel on corporate governance and is also the government’s go-to person to clear the IL&FS mess, should be held to a higher governance standard. Besides, the promoters of Kotak Mahindra Bank have benefited by holding on to their ownership, though that is partly on account of rising share prices of private banks.

Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has taken Ballarpur Industries arm BILT Graphic Paper Products to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for a default of Rs 218 crore.

An NCLT tribunal of VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy adjourned the matter to May 8 when they will decide on the admissibility of the bankruptcy petition.

""The respondent (BILT Graphic) can file its response during that time,"" the court added.

BILT Graphics owes over Rs 6,000 crore to lenders.

The company was on the second list of 29 defaulting companies of RBI, recommending that these firms be referred for resolution through the bankruptcy code.

In February 2018, IDBI Bank took the company to NCLT after an RBI direction to do so as the regulator rejected its debt recast package as only 70 percent of the lenders had signed it.

However, in March 2018, the company challenged the RBI directive in Delhi High Court, which ordered the lender to maintain status quo at NCLT. Later, the company moved the Supreme Court, where the matter is still pending.",184,

The policy rate reduction of 50 basis points by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) since February is expected to boost demand and aid economic growth in the current financial year, the chief of Kotak Mahindra Bank said on April 12.

Uday Kotak, vice chairman and managing director, Kotak Mahindra Bank also added that the focus should be on achieving GDP growth at the rate of 7 percent.

""With the interest rates correcting...which the RBI has done over last two policies...I think it was very much needed to give a boost to demand and going forward with liquidity getting better, I'd like to believe that, we should still be focussed on a 7 percent GDP growth for the current year,"" said Kotak while commenting on the dismal growth in industrial production in March.

India's industrial output growth slowed to a 20-month low of 0.1 percent in February, owing to a contraction of the manufacturing sector, data released by the government showed on April 12.

Kotak said that the private lender may look at further reducing its marginal cost-based lending rates (MCLR) by the end of this month. ""We have been reducing MCLR consistently over the last two months. We will re-look at the rates by the end of April,"" Kotak said.

In response to RBI's rate reduction of 50 basis points over the last two policy reviews, Kotak Mahindra Bank reduced its MCLR by 5-10 basis points in March and April.

Kotak Mahindra Bank has cut rates by 10 basis points for one-year tenor to 8.9 percent and five basis points for two-year and three year tenors to 9 percent. The private sector lender had reduced other rates by five basis points on March 1.

A division bench of Justices A S Oka and M S Sanklecha was hearing a petition filed by the bank challenging an RBI directive of August 13, 2018.

The RBI had directed the bank to dilute the promoter's shareholding from around 30 percent to a maximum of 20 percent of its paid-up voting equity capital by December 31, 2018 and to 15 percent by March 31, 2020.

The bench on April 1 sought to know as to why the bank had approached the court and why the promoters have not challenged the RBI orders.

""The bank cannot be the aggrieved party here. The RBI is not going to take any action against the bank. The aggrieved party is the promoters. Why have they (promoters) not come to court in challenge against the RBI directive?"" Justice Oka said.

""In our view, if the promoters have not challenged the RBI directive, then the RBI is bound and free to take action,"" the court said.

The bank's counsel Darius Khambata on April 1 told the court that the promoter share holding of the paid-up capital has been reduced to 19.7 percent.

The bench, however, noted that such a statement should come from the promoters and not the bank.

""The promoters shall file an affidavit stating this,"" the court directed and posted the petition for hearing on April 22.

The high court had in the past on two hearings refused to grant any interim relief to the bank.

In the petition, the bank sought a widening of the definition of the paid-up equity capital to include the preference shares as well beyond the present equity voting capital.

It also questioned the laws related to capping of the shareholding at a more fundamental level, asking if there is a legal basis to have shareholding caps.

According to the bank's plea, the RBI had initially asked it to only dilute promoter shareholding of its paid-up capital. However, the impugned letter sought dilution of paid-up voting equity capital.

As per the plea, after receiving the letter from RBI, the bank wrote two letters -- one on September 4, 2018 to the RBI and the other on September 24, 2018 to the RBI governor -- seeking clarification, but did not get any reply.

On a previous hearing on December 17, 2018, RBI counsel Venkatesh Dhond had opposed the plea and had said the reason behind asking for promoter stake dilution was to ensure voting power is not in the hands of one single group.

The lender in its petition has termed the RBI's directive as ""arbitrary, without any authority of law and contrary to the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, and Article 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution"".

""Even assuming that the RBI has the power to issue directions requiring reduction of promoter shareholding in banking companies, the said power can only be exercised, and has always been exercised by the RBI, with reference to the petitioner's paid-up capital and not in relation to its paid- up voting equity capital,"" the petitioner has argued.

The bank has requested the court to quash and set aside the RBI directions on equity dilution.

It has also pleaded with the court to declare that the reduction of promoter shareholding should be considered complied with, if it is achieved as a percentage of the paid-up capital and not the paid-up voting equity capital of the bank.",596,-0.7504737973213196

Locked in a legal battle with RBI over promoter stake dilution issue, Kotak Mahindra Bank has alleged the regulator is ""unfairly"" creating an impression that the lender was trying to further promoter Uday Kotak's interest.

Countering an affidavit filed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the Bombay High Court, where it has challenged a regulatory directive, Kotak Mahindra Bank said, “The reply unfairly seeks to create an impression that the promoters' interest is being furthered through the petition and seeks to question the locus standi of the petitioners (the bank) in challenging the Reduction Communications.""

RBI had asked the bank to cut promoter shareholding to 20 percent of paid up capital by December 31, 2018, and 15 percent by March 31, 2020.

As on December 31, 2018, Uday Kotak, the bank's vice chairman and managing director, held 29.72 percent stake in the bank.

The lender in August 2018 had proposed perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) to cut promoter holding to 19.70 percent, which the RBI rejected.

The bank has challenged RBI's contention in the Bombay High Court, which is hearing the matter.

The RBI's bank licensing rules mandate that a private bank's promoter will need to pare holding to 40 percent within three years, 20 percent within 10 years and to 15 percent within 15 years.

The RBI has told the Bombay High Court that the bank has petitioned the court, and not the promoters whose shareholding the central bank has asked to be lowered.

The RBI's decisions seek to regulate the shareholding rights of bank's promoters, the central bank said.

“They (the promoters) have no issue with holding being regulated in the manner provided for by the RBI,” the banking regulator had told the Bombay High Court in response to Kotak Mahindra Bank's petition challenging RBI's direction to trim promoter shareholding.

In response, Kotak Mahindra Bank has said in an affidavit filed with the court that if that were the case, “the RBI then cannot take any action against the petitioner (the bank) in relation to these matters (i.e. reduction of promoter shareholding)”.

The bank also said that in such a case, the regulator's series of correspondence over several years with the bank, and not the promoter, becomes questionable.

“The RBI has wrongly addressed correspondence to the petitioner (the bank) over the years, wherein it has also threatened regulatory action,” the bank said.

If the RBI's stand that such matters related to or affect the bank's promoters, then the RBI would have “no basis to initiate any action against the bank” for not paring promoter shareholding.

Moreover, the bank told the court that RBI's view “runs contrary to its own allegation that failure to reduce promoter shareholding would result in the bank being serious breach of law"".

The RBI has attempted to “unfairly allege” that the bank needs to be more independent and not reflect the interest of just one individual or family is “mischievous, incorrect, ignores the high standards of governance of the bank,"" it added.

The bank denied the allegations and what it termed as “insinuations” and said that “it also belittles the impact of the RBI's unreasonable and arbitrary position” on the bank, its shareholders, depositors and public at large.

The bank said reducing promoter shareholding would require to raise a “huge amount of capital not warranted for its business and growth which would be detrimental to all stake holders including the non-promoter shareholders and disruptive to the banking system”.

Any suggestion that the petition “is a device to benefit any vested interests is baseless, misconceived and devoid of any merit”.",601,-0.9448373556137085

Rising for the 9th consecutive day, the NiftyBank zoomed to a fresh record high as it surpassed the crucial psychological level of 30,000 to hit a fresh lifetime intraday high of 30,004 on Friday.

The rally in the index was led by gains in Axis Bank, Yes Bank, RBL Bank, Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, SBI etc. among others.

HDFC Bank which hit a fresh 52-week high of 2,307 in intraday trade on Friday witnessed some profit taking at higher levels.

The NiftyBank witnessed a stellar rally so far in March as the index rose by about 12 percent. It rose from 26,789 recorded on 28 February to a record high of 30,004 which translates into a rise of about 12 percent.

Most experts feel that the index after surpassing 30,000 will look for the next target of around 30,200 levels, as NiftyBank continues to make higher highs and higher lows, but after a sharp up move, a round of profit booking could be on the cards.

“Bank Nifty made a new lifetime high of 29,885 mark and managed to hold above 29650 zones on its weekly expiry day on Wednesday. It has been making higher lows from past fourteenth trading sessions which suggest supports are gradually shifting higher,” Chandan Taparia, Associate Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“It has to continue to hold above 29500-29600 zones to extend its momentum towards 30,200 zones,” he said.

Banking index witnessed one of the sharpest moves in the last couple of years and gained almost 1600 points during the week.

With continued buying seen from the foreign institutional investors (FIIs), almost every stock observed sharp gains where IndusInd Bank saw a surge of almost 12 percent during the week. While other private sector banks saw gains around 6 percent.

The open interest in Bank Nifty has swelled sharply along with the up move and the current open interest in the index is the highest seen since August 2018 suggesting long build-up, said an ICICIdirect report.

In the last week itself, more than 30 percent open interest was added in the banking index. Due to recently formed leverage position and sharp up move a round of profit booking cannot be ruled out, added the report.

From the options space, the highest Put base is seen at 29000 strikes for the upcoming weekly settlement. On the other hand, due to sharp upsides, no major Call base is visible.

ICICIdirect expects these levels to remain crucial support in the shortened week. Bank Nifty, being the leader of the current move, the price ratio of Bank Nifty/Nifty has also moved to its life high levels of 2.57.

The Bombay High Court on Tuesday once again refused to give any interim relief to Kotak Mahindra Bank in its row with the RBI over a regulatory diktat to pare promoter's holding in the fourth largest private sector lender.

The court turned down the bank's plea for an interim protection from regulatory action saying the matter is not as simple as the petitioner is making it out to be, and posted the matter for further hearing to April 1.

When the petition came up for hearing before a division bench of justices AS Oka and MS Sanklecha, senior counsel Harish Salve, appearing for the bank, sought an interim protection from the RBI directive and proposed capping voting rights of the promoters.

""We need interim protection. The RBI's concern is with regard to concentration of control of power. We will give assurance that till May 2020 promoters shall not vote in excess of 20 per cent,"" Salve told the court.

The court, however, shot down this suggestion and said, ""It cannot be that simple.""

Salve then said the RBI cannot force the bank's promoters to sell their shares.

The court adjourned the matter to April 1.

The bank had moved the court on December 10, 2018, challenging an RBI directive of August 13, 2018, which had directed it to dilute the promoter's shareholding from around 30 per cent to a maximum of 20 per cent of its paid-up voting equity capital by December 31, 2018 and to 15 per cent by March 31, 2020.

This is the second time that the bank failed to get any interim relief from the court. On the first day of the hearing on December 10, 2018, the bank had sought a stay on the December 31 deadline but it was rejected. In August 2018, the promoters had tried to lower the holdings through a complex perpetual non-cumulative preference shares sale but it did not make the regulatory cut.

Through this sale Uday Kotak, the founder and main promoter of Kotak Mahindra Bank, had said that his family's stake was coming down to 19.70 per cent from about 30 per cent.

However, within a few days, the Reserve Bank rejected the stake dilution method adopted by Kotak saying it did not meet its regulatory norms, something the private sector lender contested in its reply to the regulator.

Following this, in an unprecedented move, Kotak Bank had on December 10, 2018, taken the regulator to the Bombay High Court challenging the December 31, 2018 deadline to dilute the stake.

In the petition, the bank is seeking a widening of the definition of the paid-up equity capital to include these preference shares as well beyond the present equity voting capital. It is also questioning the laws related to capping of the shareholding at a more fundamental level, asking if there is a legal basis to have shareholding caps.

It can be noted that the Kotak shares are the most valuable banking stocks in the country today.

According to the bank's plea, the RBI had initially asked it to only dilute promoter shareholding of its paid-up capital. However, the impugned letter sought dilution of paid-up voting equity capital.

As per the plea, after receiving the letter from RBI, the bank wrote two letters -- one on September 4, 2018 to the RBI and the other on September 24, 2018 to the RBI governor -- seeking clarification, but did not get any reply.

On a previous hearing on December 17, 2018, RBI counsel Venkatesh Dhond had opposed the plea and had said the reason behind asking for promoter stake dilution was to ensure that the voting power is not in the hands of one single group.

The lender in its petition has termed the RBI's directive as ""arbitrary, without any authority of law and contrary to the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, and Article 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution"".

""Even assuming that the RBI has the power to issue directions requiring reduction of promoter shareholding in banking companies, the said power can only be exercised, and has always been exercised by the RBI, with reference to the petitioner's paid-up capital and not in relation to its paid- up voting equity capital,"" the petitioner has argued.

The bank has requested the court to quash and set aside the RBI directions on equity dilution.

It has also pleaded the court to declare that the reduction of promoter shareholding should be considered complied with, if it is achieved as a percentage of the paid-up capital and not the paid-up voting equity capital of the bank.",768,-0.5600620408852895

The move is significant as it comes in the wake of the regulator having been dragged to the Bombay High Court by Kotak Mahindra Bank. Its peer Bandhan Bank merged with Gruh Finance, in a deal widely considered to have been driven by the need to comply with the promoter shareholding norms.

""RBI has received at least three proposals and one of them relates to setting up a review committee on ownership norms for private sector banks and all options are being explored,” a source said.

Other proposals relate to individual cases including granting more time and more possible routes to meet the norms, unlike the review panel one which would have wider ramifications for the entire sector, the source added.

The common viewpoint on both sites is that the stand-off with Kotak Mahindra Bank needs to be resolved at the earliest as it might be sending a wrong impression to the investor community, including the foreign institutions.

An email sent to the banking regulator did not elicit a response immediately. Governor Shaktikanta Das had recently declined to answer a specific question on whether the RBI is mulling a re-look at the promoter shareholding norms, citing that the matter is sub judice.

It can be noted that KMB had taken the unprecedented action of dragging the RBI to court last year, days ahead of the December 31 deadline to get the promoter holding down to 20 percent from the around 30 percent loomed.

The Bombay High Court has refused any temporary relief to KMB and the matter is scheduled to come up for hearing on March 12.

The bank had proposed one preference share route to reduce the promoter shareholding in August 2018, only to be shot down by the regulator.

In late December, there was also speculation of billionaire investor Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathway entering KMB.

Kotak has found support from the right-wing bodies, who have been urging the RBI to not insist on the promoter holding requirements, saying this will naturally increase the foreign investors' play in the Indian banks.

The Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), a right-leaning think tank, has said it is high time for a review of regulations and for re-working the model of governance and ownership norms for Indian private sector banks.

The Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) has also said there was an urgent need for a rethink on the regulatory framework for private bank ownership so that it remains in Indian hands.

""None of us want Indian homegrown banks to go into hands of foreign players,"" the SJM had said recently.

Almost all major private sector lenders have ownership of over 50 percent by foreign investors collectively. The RBI wants the banks to have a diversified ownership in best interest of governance practices and also limits the voting rights in cases.

In the last few months, Kotak group has successfully tapped into foreign money like getting a $500 million commitment from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) to invest in stressed assets in the country.

In case of Bandhan Bank, the micro-lender turned commercial bank announced a deal months after facing regulatory pressure for not complying with promoter shareholding requirements.

The RBI had refused to allow the lender from automatically opening branches and had also frozen CEO C S Ghosh's remuneration.

The bank responded with the all-share Gruh deal, which brought down the promoter shareholding to 60 percent, which is still higher than the 40 percent requirement. In media interactions, the bank management has sounded confident of meeting the 40 percent level.",631,-0.286227285861969

Kotak Mahindra Bank on Thursday became the first private sector lender to lower its lending rate by a marginal 5 basis points, following the 25 bps rate cut by the monetary authority earlier this month.

It can be noted that the Reserve Bank had held a meeting with lenders earlier this month on the slow monetary transmission--which is lenders passing on their lower funding cost to their borrowers, thus reducing the overall cost of finance in the economy.

Punjab National Bank was among the first to respond with a 0.10 percent cut across tenors Wednesday.

Kotak Mahindra Bank cut the MCLR in four tenors, including the important one-year maturity ones to which all the major consumer loans including home loans are linked.

Under the revised rate structure which will be effective from Friday, the bank's one year MCLR will now come down to 9 percent from 9.05 percent, while the overnight MCLR has also been reviewed down to 8.30 percent.

Rally in financials and IT stocks, US Fed’s stance on interest rate hikes along with buying among index heavyweights propelled equity markets in India on Thursday. Additionally, investors bet on positive expectations from the Interim Budget 2019 as well.

The Sensex rose nearly 600 points, while the Nifty hit 10,800 in the afternoon trade. Buying was visible across all sectors, with maximum gains seen among banks, technology names as well as energy sector.

The likes of Infosys, GAIL and Kotak Mahindra Bank topped the gainers’ chart.

Here is a list of five factors that are fueling the rally.

Financials, IT stocks rally

Banking stocks have seen a surge during the day’s trade. The Bank Nifty index is up over a percent, and stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank and State Bank of India were trading higher by 1-3 percent.

Additionally, stocks in the technology space are soaring in trade, even as rupee showed some appreciation. The rupee touched 70 per US dollar intraday, but came back to 71 per US dollar levels.

The Nifty IT index surged over 1.5 percent with Infosys contributing the maximum gains. The stock rose over 3 percent, while other marquee IT names such as Tech Mahindra, NIIT Technologies, TCS, and Wipro gained between 1-3 percent.

US Federal Reserve stance

The markets reacted to a slight breather in the rate hike cycle by US Federal Reserve. The US central bank signaled that there could be some patience in the pace of hiking interest rates, amid fears of slowdown in US economy.

As it held interest rates steady, the US central bank also discarded its promises of “further gradual increases” in interest rates, and said it would be “patient” before making any further moves.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the case for rate increases had “weakened” in recent weeks, with neither rising inflation nor financial stability considered a risk, and “cross-currents” including slowing growth overseas and the self-inflicted wound of a federal government shutdown making the US outlook less certain.

“We are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong US macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of cross-currents. Common sense risk management suggests patiently waiting greater clarity,” Powell told reporters after the end of a two-day policy meeting.

Nifty breaks above 10,800: back above 20, 50-days EMA

Indian market witnessed a breakout on the January expiry day and a day ahead of Interim Budget. The S&P BSE Sensex reclaimed 36,000 while the Nifty50 also went above 10,800 levels on intraday basis.

It is now trading well above its crucial short-term moving averages such as 20, 50, 5-days exponential moving averages. However, it is still below 200-days moving average placed at 10,840 on the daily charts.

The bounce back was largely on the back of short covering triggered by US Fed response to future trajectory of rates. The US Central Bank kept rates on hold and said that it will be patient in raising rates further amid global slowdown.

A close above 10,840-10,850 level on Thursday will open room for further upside towards 10,900-11,000 levels. But, February 1 being the Budget day, volatility cannot be ruled out.

“It looks prudent on the part of traders to remain on sideline till the events are cleared out of the way. Technically speaking, strength in indices can be expected on a close above 10756 levels where as weakness shall get accentuated further on a close below 10580 levels with an initial target placed around 10333,” Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Budget expectations

Ahead of the Interim Budget to be presented on February 1, 2019, investors are seen placing positive bet on the kind of reforms that could be announced. As such, the buzz of a possible full Budget instead of a vote on account could be played positively by traders in the market.

Additionally, President Ramnath Kovind, in his address to the Parliament, stressed on the government’s focus on doubling rural incomes as well as helping the farming community through various initiatives.

""...As the general elections are just around the corner, the interim budget is the last opportunity for the incumbent government to woo a larger section of the society. It is likely to be more than just a vote-of-account and for now, we expect some alterations to the expenditure schemes. While a package for farmers is almost a given after Mr. Jaitley’s statement to tackle specific agricultural challenges that “can’t afford to wait,” there are also hopes that the government may announce some relief measures on the direct tax front,"" Suhas Harinarayanan, Head-Institutional Equity Research at JM Financial Institutional Securities told Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand.

Index heavyweights see buying

The likes of HDFC twins, Reliance Industries, Infosys, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Tata Consultancy Services have witnessed intense buying.

These are index heavyweights and a rally in such names usually boosts equity benchmarks. Apart from Infosys, HDFC Bank and HDFC have surged 2-3 percent, while TCS is up over 1.5 percent.

Advances grew 23% YoY, skewed towards corporate banking, unsecured loans; and deposits and CASA remained stronger with a 24% YoY growth and CASA at 50.71% (up ~400bps QoQ). We expect NIM and RoA to improve to improve 4.2% and 1.9% through FY21E, backed by improved margins, improved efficiency of its acquisition investments and lower stress assets.

Outlook

While the stake dilution is subjudice, the ensuing increase in free float remains a key risk to our target.

This is the verbatim transcript of Kotak Mahindra Bank management call with analysts.

Moderator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and a very warm welcome to the Kotak Mahindra Bank Q3 FY’19 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants’ lines will be in the listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes.

Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing ‘*’ then ‘0’ on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I am now glad to hand the conference over to Mr. Uday Kotak. Thank you and over to you, sir.

Uday Kotak: Good Evening, friends and wish you all a very happy 2019. We are now more than 20-days into it and this is the first time we are meeting in the New Year. So, I wish each of you and all of us a great 2019.

On the big picture, as I look at the situation, I do believe that overall the broader economy in the last quarter has been slower which is reflected in the numbers as well, compared to what appeared in the first half of the current fiscal. There is some sort of overall slowing economic impulse which was particularly visible in the October-December quarter. I do believe the economic impulses in the private sector continue to be slower than what one would like to see at this point of time. And an economy in the private sector which is primarily driven by consumption and very slow private investment despite increasing capacity utilization is something which should be a concern about on a macro basis. But I do feel at the same time with the broader current account in reasonable shape and as long as oil behaves itself, we should hopefully see a more benign interest rate environment in 2019.

In that context, I would like to talk about three sectors where one needs to have a careful eye on from lending and business point of view in 2019. The first one is residential real estate. I worry about the significant changes which have happened in that sector, lot of the developer industry is stuck with projects which are pre-RERA age and in the RERA age with GST coming in on any pre-completion basis it is postponing the buyer demand till projects are completed which is putting significant pressure on the developers for their ability to finance. And from an interest free

working capital which they had in terms of buyer advances, it is now interest bearing loans which they have to take for financing through the construction period, and that is putting pressure on residential real estate. And I do believe in the pre-RERA age, fair amount of advances which were received from customers actually moved into land and there is fair amount of financing of plan which has also happened. Therefore, residential real estate is a sector which I would watch pretty closely as we go forward. As a spillover of residential real estate, I think it is having some implications on the NBFC and the HFC sector because a very significant amount of financing

for the residential piece has also come from the NBFC and the HFC sector. Therefore, I think we need to watch those segments carefully as we go into 2019.

And the third of course is the SME segment where I think it is still in the correction phase and with the approach of the government and RBI to find solutions for the SME business; we should hopefully see that play out during the current year.

Therefore, these are the three inter-connected segments because there is a fair amount of SME lending also which happens through the NBFC sector as well. So, the real estate, the non-banking financial sector and the SME sector are the ones I would watch closely in terms of credit book of banks in particular.

From Kotak Mahindra Bank’s point of view, I am happy to share with you that we are seeing a reasonably robust loan growth and stability after a long time to see a better realization of our risk adjusted margin approach to lending and we have actually seen our NIM expand after a long time in this quarter. We are also able to price our loans in that context more efficiently than we did in the earlier quarters and with an ability to grow the book simultaneously. If you look at our overall bank numbers, they have been pretty robust, our continuing focus on the quality of our book is paying ongoing results with our net NPA now down to 0.71%. I just hope that no new shoe falls in 2019, something which we currently may not be able to look at. Considering some of the uncertainties which we will go through in 2019 we continue to be alert while being open to growing our business at a pretty rapid trot.

Our overall revenues in addition to growth in NII, and banking services in particular despite a slowdown in mutual fund distribution has shown a very significant growth, and we are quite pleased with that in terms of the core banking business beginning to sort of drive wealth.

The other issue which I would like to highlight which is both macro and micro is the fact that with significant increase of currency in circulation in recent times, it is going to put pressure on the deposit and the liability franchises in terms of our ability to finance faster growth. At Kotak

Mahindra Bank, if you see, and Jaimin will take you through greater detail, there is very high focus on granular retail deposits and broadly three big areas of focus are CA, SA and Retail TD deposits below Rs.1 crore and they are continuing to grow at very rapid pace compared to the other parts of the deposits. Therefore, the bank’s reliance on wholesale deposits is consistently coming down.

Also, if I have to do a fair analysis of our quarter, we have also noticed that there has been some increase in our non-people operating cost and it is an area of focus for us and we have been focusing on it. There have been some items which have been on higher advertising and some other specific costs which are very much in our focus. It is something which we will keep an eye

on to see how we are able to tighten ourselves on the overall operating cost side as we go forward.

Speaking for a short while on our subsidiaries, you would have seen a slowdown in both Kotak Securities and the investment bank. The investment bank, I think we are seeing a slowdown on the capital markets side. Having said that, we have a fair pipeline on the advisory side. So the

third quarter was probably a blip that there was no booking of most of those revenues, we shall see that in the quarters ahead particularly the advisory fee. Of course, capital markets side is dependent on markets so that is more external.

On the pure broking businesses, of course, with the overall market volumes, it is reflective of that. But it is something which has been slower than we would like.

On the Car finance subsidiary, the car sales and car volumes have been mixed and as a part of our conservatism and prudence both our NBFCs have had a very comfortable journey through this volatile period which the NBFC sector saw between September and December and we were therefore well stacked up on liquidity and some of that liquidity had negative carry which had an impact on the revenues and profits of the two NBFC subsidiaries as well. And of course, in the NBFC subsidiaries, we have been cautious in growing our real estate lending book for the reasons which I have already highlighted to you. But all in all, I do believe our continuing focus on some key health parameters of our financial business and the banking business is the reason why we feel pretty good about the health of our business and continuing momentum in the core banking business. We also see the life insurance business continuing to grow in a much tougher environment while our margins are very much protected and in fact we are feeling good about the level of margins which our life insurance business is having.

The Asset Management Company has seen a sharp jump in profits, because we may be seeing some moderation in the whole distribution model where distributors used to be taking disproportionate front end fees which have stopped especially after SEBI circular of October 22nd. So, this is the overall picture.

The health of each of our business is in good shape. The financial strength of the balance sheet of the subsidiaries and the parent continues to be in good shape. The overall stress levels in the balance sheet is under control. We feel the growth on the loan side in the 20s as we have guided seems to be very much in place with hopefully improving margin situation which has been reflected in our October-December quarter.

With that, I hand it over to Jaimin to take you through the presentation and the specifics.

Jaimin Bhatt: Thanks, Uday. Let me just take you through the bank standalone numbers first. For this quarter, we ended with post-tax profit of Rs.1,291 crore against Rs.1,053 crore for the same period last year, that is about 23% rise on YoY basis. The net interest income at the Bank again saw about 23% rise this quarter with Rs.2,939 crore as against Rs. 2,394 crore last year. On the other income side, the fees and services did see a jump of almost 25% on YoY basis. We clocked this year with Rs.1,000 crore plus on fees. The distribution side, while the insurance business did bring in good distribution fees, the mutual fund business, thanks to the circular which Uday mentioned, as a distributor had a negative impact on the fees. However, several items on the fee side which are linked to businesses; credit cards, mobile banking and several other business related stuff, LC, BG, commissions, those have grown significantly during this period, overall

clocking a fee growth of 25% on YoY basis. The other income which is the other part of other income which is a negative number of Rs. 74 crore. Honestly, that needs to be read together with slight accounting issue which we have explained on Slide #4 of the earnings update. Basically, what we have been providing the mark-to-market depreciation on both our AFS and HFT investments, all along as part of provisions and contingencies. So, just to give an example, if we had bought a security at Rs.100 and it has depreciated to say Rs.92, the Rs.8 instead of hitting the other income as a negative, was actually made as a provision and as I said this is as per our

communication we have got from RBI, we have been following that consistently.

In this quarter, what would have happened is assuming we sold the same security say at Rs. 98, the other income shows a negative of the two but the other aspect is reversal of provision and as a result the reversal of provision itself is a big negative number. The provision and contingencies as we have explained on Slide #3 of the ‘Earnings Update’ the provision on investments is a negative number of Rs.287 crore which includes Rs.271 crore and in a normal accounting would have taken it as other income. If we do that adjustment, the other income itself has grown up by about 22% and the overall operating profit would show a growth of 23% on YoY basis. Of course, the provisions and contingencies would be higher at Rs.256 crore. The cost-to-income if I make that adjustment would then show up a number of 47.1% as against 50.3% based on the current number.

Coming to expenses, this quarter we talked about the fact that with the interest rates going down, we had the treasury showing gains which is part of the other income and the reversal of provisions; however, the flip side of that is some of the retiral benefits particularly the pensionable employees which are defined benefits are linked to interest rates and resultantly that

cost has gone up on QoQ basis.

The other part of operating expenses as Uday mentioned have been growing, and some of it is related to advertisements where we ran a campaign during this quarter plus related to businesses, whether it is credit card or direct banking or business correspondent equation, the DICGS once

again hitting us there, but as Uday mentioned we are keeping that under lot of focus in terms of the other opex. NIMs for the period at 4.33% as against 4.27% in the same period last year.

With regards to segmental, this is as defined by the RBI where everything beyond Rs.5 crore sanction goes into corporate banking. The corporate bank clocks PBT of Rs.867 crore for this quarter. The retail bank is Rs.446 crore; retail bank being hit both on the advertisement and the retiral provisions the largest. The treasury and BMU segment clocking Rs.658 crore PBT for the quarter this year. The advances in the bank at Rs.1,96,000 crore overall, about 23% rise the same period a year ago. We have seen growth on YoY basis in the corporate bank, clocking about 26%. The commercial vehicles, construction equipment continuing to grow at 36%. The small business; personal loans, credit cards again showing a robust growth at 36%. The home loan and the LAP business at 24%. The one business which continues to remain flat is the business banking segment which has been flat both on YoY and QoQ basis. Our SMA-2 number at the end of December at Rs.344 crore which is about 0.18% of our overall advances book. Our gross NPA at Rs.4,129 crore which is about 2.07% of our overall advances book and our net NPA at 0.71% of the overall advances book. This was 1.09% a year ago and in effect improved the coverage ratio from 53.5% a year ago to now 66.2%.

Our exposures on some specific segments has come down on a sequential QoQ basis. The NBFC exposure, the home finance exposure has come down. Commercial real estate other than the LRD business has also come down; now it is about Rs.4,000 crore, about 1.6% of our overall exposure book.

On the Deposit front, as Uday mentioned, we run a pretty strong book there; our CASA at the end of December at 50.7%, this is not including the TD Sweep which is another 6.7% of our deposit base. Our TD below Rs.1 crore, now stand at Rs. 53,000 crore showing about 27% growth on YoY basis. Our average savings account which is daily average of savings account versus the same daily averages for the last year show growth of 34% on YoY basis and the current account on the same lines showing a growth of 19% on YoY basis. At the end of December ’18, we had 1,453 branches. We end the quarter with the balance sheet size of Rs.2,94,000 crore. At the bank level, capital adequacy overall at 18.1% and tier-1 of 17.6%.

Just taking some of the digital initiative which we did, we did launch India’s first AI-powered voicebot in the banking sector which is called “Keya” which is now integrated into mobile apps and also on Google Assistant. We also during the month of December had 3 lakhs users on WhatsApp and got about 10 lakhs opt-ins. We are also live now on the Ripple blockchain platform for inward remittance transactions.

If we look at the recurring deposits, almost 89% of our recurring deposits are now sourced through the digital platform as well as 68% of our fixed deposits are now coming through the digital platform.

Mobile Banking growth in terms of volume on YoY basis showed a growth of almost 200%-plus and in December we recorded the highest UPI transactions in a month which is 31 million for the month. Our transactions on Kay Mall which is both (mComm and eComm) grew almost 200% on YoY basis.

The Aadhaar-enabled payment systems, again, the volumes have grown. Salaried personal loans, digital share was 35% whereas the home loans which are also acquired through the digital means have grown significantly.

At the Subsidiary levels, Kotak Securities mobile banking cash ADVs have grown 37% during the period. At Kotak Life, large number of policies being sourced through the “Genie” which is a tablet-based end-to-end solution. And in the General Insurance business, the digital volumes have shown almost 90% growth on YoY basis.

If we look at the consolidated numbers, this quarter we end with the profit post tax of Rs.1,844 crore as against Rs.1,624 crore for the same period last year. Major contributors other than the bank, Kotak Prime clocked Rs.139 crore for the quarter while life insurance company with Rs.125 crore. The mutual fund and the trustee company put together brought in Rs.76 crore

whereas the securities business brought in about Rs.99 crore for the quarter.

Our consolidated advances at the group level at Rs.2,32,000 crore, about 19% rise on YoY basis. As Uday touched upon, the growth of both the auto business as well as the commercial real estate in the subsidiaries has been lower than what has been growing in the bank. Net worth at the group level at Rs.56,000 crore with the book value per share now at Rs.291.

On the Life Insurance business, Rs.890 crore of new business premium for this quarter against Rs.831 crores last year. Our ULIPs now share is 23% for the nine months this year versus 35% last year. Our AUM in the Life business is over Rs.25,000 crore and the solvency continues to be a healthy 3.1%.

Kotak Securities that we touched upon, lower volumes, lower realization, we therefore had a smaller profit this quarter and recognize that in the last year this quarter there were six transactions which in the ECM category a mix of QIP, IPOs and OFS.

At the Group level, our assets under management now crossed Rs.2,00,000 crore as at December end. The asset management company has now got close to Rs.1,40,000 crore as assets under management. The share on both the equity AUM as well as the overall market share has improved during the quarter and we improved our rankings in the overall ratings.

Prime and Kotak Investments, as Uday talked about, slower growth on loans, as well as the fact that we had negative carry on the liquidity amount which we had tanked upon, and to that extent we had slightly lower profit this year compared to the last year on both NBFCs.

Those were the broad highlights. Open to taking questions.

Moderator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Prakash Kapadia from Anived Portfolio Managers. Please go ahead.

Prakash Kapadia: I had two questions. On the corporate book, we have seen continued good growth over the last 7, 8 quarters. So, if you could give us some sense of the demand – is it NCLT-based lending, is it market share gains among very large corporates or large corporates and how much of this

would be working capital? Secondly on your opening remarks, you did mention about business banking being cautious. So what will make us positive or change our view?

Uday Kotak: Manian heads the Wholesale Bank and also the SME business. Maybe Manian, you can go ahead.

KVS Manian: Most of the growth is coming from market share gain, as you know, overall corporate credit in the system has not grown too much except the last two months, but even if you look at the last two months, the RBI data, large part of that growth has been lending to NBFC which is not the

case as Jaimin presented while back. So most of our growth is essentially coming from market share gain in corporate lending. Our book is about 60% working capital, 40% term, out of which around 25% will be what we call the long term about 3-year plus loan. So it is largely medium

term and short term oriented book. So that was your question on the corporate side.

Prakash Kapadia: Will it be very large corporate?

KVS Manian: It is a mix, across, in fact this year we have seen the large corporates side, not the very large corporate, mid-market and large corporate, both have also shown quite healthy growth. So, yes, very large corporate also we are focused on, that also is growing, but our growth is fairly spread across sectors. And on the SME, I would say that we have just now seen some stabilization on the slippage side and we have less slippage and we seem to be getting more in control of the portfolio, and I am hoping that in a quarter or two we will start seeing the growth on that. But SME as you know, there have been destabilizing instances of GST as well as demonetisation last year. I think lot of that sector is yet to come out of these. With the recent measures announced on restructuring as well as GST relief for Rs. 40 lakh, but the Rs. 40 lakh part is more in the consumer bank side, SME side is bigger than that, Rs. 40 lakh exemption on GST does not have the segment much positively. I would say that this segment has gone through rough times in the last couple of years. So we need to remain selective, because if you see the industry averages on NPAs on the sector they are fairly high. So we need to remain selective, but we hope to get that

right in the coming quarters

Uday Kotak: Within the SME sector also, one specific segment which has taken the most pain is the trader segment. So, lot of the intermediaries which were essentially arbitraging tax and other things, that is where there has been a pain and we carried a historical book including out of the acquisition of ING Vysya and now we feel we are bottoming out of this and as we feel better we will think about growing it over the next couple of quarters

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rahul Jain from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Rahul Jain: I have got two, three questions; First one is continuing from remarks on business banking. In commercial, retail even including loans against property, how has been your experience about the early delinquencies maybe both for yourself and for the industry because we are seeing some signs of early delinquency sort of inching up. So that is question #1. I will ask my follow up question later but if you can answer me on this first please.

Uday Kotak: I think there has been excessive focus on two segments within so-called smaller business or retail, which number one is LAP and the second is unsecured loans to retail. I think on both of those while the business continues to grow, I would certainly be more alert and it may still be early days, I mean, LAP again I think issue is level of valuation of the underlying assets. So, I would certainly be more alert. From our point of view, I am not sounding a panic button yet of any nature, but if you ask me, do I see a challenge to unsecured consumer for example, my sense is it is a second half 2020 around that period is when we should worry what happens, but the early signs are there, I would not say, it is as smooth as it was one year ago, and certainly time to be alert.

Rahul Jain: And even in loans against property, given the fact that real estate sector has been passing through a rough patch, property prices have been correcting, so do you think even LAP is alright for now, but of course as you said, you would be alert, so nothing to be concern about at this point

of time but maybe future could be little uncertain?

Uday Kotak: Yes, the trouble in all this is early signs, they get ignored for a long time and then suddenly there is the investors and analysts and the lenders themselves will say “oh! this is a big problem”. But I think the early signs for being alert are certainly there.

Rahul Jain: The second question is did you buy any loan portfolio in this quarter from any of the NBFCs and if yes what would have been the spreads at which you would have bought it?

Dipak Gupta: We have not bought any portfolio, but selective assets we have bought.

Uday Kotak: But nothing out of the ordinary.

Rahul Jain: Last question is around our Car subsidiary, Kotak Prime. As we know now that the environment for NBFC is getting little tougher with more liquidity transfer is required on the balance sheet, so maybe the competitive intensity versus operating this business out of a bank has clearly diminished. So, any thought process around if you would like to do this business from the banking umbrella rather than continuing to do this from the NBFC arm? Because clearly, I think now you have got cost of funds under control at the banking business, so maybe it would make more sense to do it out of the banking umbrella, any thoughts around that?

Uday Kotak: We constantly evaluate that from time to time. However, we are always are very cautious about taking a decision which is based on flavour of the season. So, right now the flavour of the season

is NBFC cost of funds is high, but we have seen times when NBFC cost of funds was even lower than the bank. So, if you take the overall book there, which is about Rs. 30,000 crore, in the context of a Rs. 2 lakh crore book at the bank, it is not that large relatively. So, it is a good diversification, very high quality operating cost metrics, well-seasoned group focused, I mean it

is always possible for us to look at. But keep in mind that we are obsessed with building a stable and low-cost liability franchise, that is our obsession number one, over everything else. And we think there is a long way to go for us on that, and at some point of time if it makes sense we can always take that call. And we are also watching at the bank our credit deposit ratio where our mix has changed, but we need a lot more throughput of that retail deposit flow to come to sustain a higher growth and make our credit deposit ratio much more robust for us to be taking that next move.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ojasvi Khicha from Axis Capital. Please go ahead.

Ojasvi Khicha: Just wanted to understand where does Kotak Mahindra Bank stand on its review for 811 strategy on the back of Supreme Court judgment? If you could comment on how is it impacting customer acquisition engine, specifically also on the cost front as we have mentioned in the opening remarks that increase in non-staff expenses. And lastly, if you could share your customer count data at the end of Q3 FY19?

Dipak Gupta: Well, post November we stopped acquiring through the OTP route. But acquisition of customers on the 811 platform through the wallet route continues. So the acquisition is on, the numbers are significantly lesser than what we were doing during the Aadhar days. What we have done really is we have reworked the entire process and we have just about launched the OTP mechanism on the net banking platform voluntarily. We will, over the next three, four weeks, also launch it on the mobile browser, which is when hopefully the volumes should start moving up again. In the

meantime if we do get confirmation that the revised Aadhar Bill gets passed by the Parliament, then it is great, then it is business as normal. On the operating cost, since we really did not do any significant acquisition, those costs have been saved.

Uday Kotak: And the customer numbers, Jaimin, can you?

Jaimin Bhatt: Yes, broadly what is happening is, when 811 was on we were doing more than 500,000 customers a month, that would have come down significantly as we speak, about 150,000 to 100,000 per month.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from IDFC. Please go ahead.

Mahrukh Adajania: I just wanted to know if there is any one-off in interest income? Or this is all co-margins and do you expect margins to stay stable for the next few quarters?

Jaimin Bhatt: No, Mahrukh, there is no spiky thing in the net interest income which we talked about. So it is pretty much the regular business. And we had in fact in the last quarter call talked about the fact that margins are coming back, and I think we are seeing that actually play out. So, at this rate at 4.33% we do expect margins to be somewhere around that range, maybe 10 to 15 bps either side.

Mahrukh Adajania: And that is largely because of pricing power returning to banks?

Uday Kotak: And also our stable liability base continuing to grow robustly, that also is helping us, because margins are a combination of two things, one is obviously the pricing power on the pending side and second is consistent improvement in the liability mix and cost.

Mahrukh Adajania: And just one more question for the record, you never do have any divergence, have you received this year’s divergence report from RBI?

Jaimin Bhatt: No, we haven’t yet got any final report from the RBI, so as of now we can’t talk about it.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kunal Shah from Edelweiss. Please go ahead.

Kunal Shah: Sir, again, touching upon in terms of margins, so do we see the pricing power having fully played out or we are much more confident in terms of margin trajectory being on the up side? Because as you highlighted, there is obsession with respect to building the low and stable liability franchisee, so that is very much there, and pricing power is also returning. So do we see that happening and maybe at what point in time would we see the tradeoff between the NIMs and slightly higher growth? So maybe NII also moving upwards of 25% on a sustainable basis in the near-term?

Uday Kotak: Kunal, as you know, the margin is a scissor, scissor has two parts, the cost side and revenue side. We believe we will continue to improve, so that is clearly there. On growing NII faster, the answer is clear, if we believe for the risk we are taking we are getting the price, we will lend and we are not obsessed by a number which is 20%, 25%, 30% growth, we are obsessed by the fact that the trouble with stress is it never comes at the time when you lend, it comes two years later so, we like to think about this as a journey. And on that, at this stage we are comfortable growing our book faster as is being demonstrated by this December quarter numbers. And as long as we get our metrics and as long as our improvement on the liability side continues and the risk is good, we have no hesitation in growing and getting share and exploring new avenues. We think banking is a business which you have to think about in a continuum rather than a quarter. And

my sense is, if we think about banking as looking at a block of one, two, three years at a time rather than three months at a time, we will take decisions which are consistent for a sustainable growth. And on the liability side, I do not think it is even a two, three year picture, it is like how are we going to transform who we are. And then on the asset side we have the ability to get our risk based pricing and be more competitive and aggressive if our stability is stronger. And if there is one thing which the last three or four months has shown, is a deep value of low cost and stable liability over everything else.

Kunal Shah: And in terms of this unsecured you highlighted early signals, so would that be largely in terms of the behavior of the portfolio or maybe in terms of the competition which is there or some kind of a dilution which we are seeing? So what is the kind of early warning signal?

Dipak Gupta: Basically it flows into 30 day bucket, cheque bounces, all these are early signs.

Kunal Shah: So we have seen some kind of a deterioration?

Dipak Gupta: Yes, it is a manual one, so still early days. But like Uday said, it is quite possible that it continues for the next one year or so.

Uday Kotak: And one of the things about these early signs, which I feel is what the industry at the street very often ignores is that the spreads are large enough therefore a little early sign is fine. But when the water fall or the deluge hits, there is nowhere to hide.

Kunal Shah: And lastly in terms of subsidairy, at least the earnings of many of the subsidiaries have been quite volatile, be it Kotak Mahindra Investments as well as Prime and if we get into that it is largely the other income. So, does maybe this accounting change, I do not think it will flow

through that, but there is lot of volatility out there, so how should we look at it? Like Kotak Mahindra Investments was going steadily in terms of the earnings, all of a sudden, we had seen a dip, same is the case with Prime as well, maybe in terms of the one-off it is largely other income.

Dipak Gupta: Like in Prime and all relatively higher spread businesses which we have consciously cut down, so Prime for example as Jaimin mentioned, the cars business is literally okay, growing normally, the CRE part of the business is sort of cut down. So those impact profitability margins a lot more. And that is why you see some of these spikes in the quarter.….

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Darpin Shah from HDFC Securities. Please go ahead.

Darpin Shah: Sir, you mentioned about some stress or early signs to be watched for real-estate, LAP and other businesses. So if you can share your thoughts on agricultural portfolio as well?

Uday Kotak: I think agriculture is a mixed bag. Kannan, you want to go for it?

D. Kannan: There have been slight disturbances because you hear about these loan waivers often. But the term loan portfolios on equipments and agriculture seems to be behaving okay, while the tractor portfolio, especially the tractor industry is growing and our share is also growing. On the working capital side or on the crop loan side, you see some amount of stress because of all these waivers getting announced and delays happening in some repayments coming in.

Kunal Shah: And one last thing, if you can just provide me with the movement of the NPAs?

Kunal Shah: Overall for the bank if you can provide the slippage number for the quarter?

Jaimin Bhatt: Slippage for this quarter was about Rs. 345 crore compared to last year if you look at it would be Rs. 422 crore.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ravi Singh from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Ravi Singh: First question on liabilities, clearly you have done a great job in terms of the low-cost liabilities without opening too many branches in recent years. And if I look at CASA per branch its one of the best in the industry. Do you think there is further room for productivity improvement or at some stage distribution related expenses will pick up? And you made a comment around deposits at system level being under pressure because of the cash in circulation being high, at system level do you see deposits interest rate maybe rising faster than maybe how the loan pricing rate

moves?

Second question on the asset side, any thoughts on the external benchmark which RBI proposes to introduce for retail, mortgage, MSME, personal loans, given not applicable on the corporate loans, relatively larger part of your loan book could be exposed to that? Any thoughts on that side please.

Uday Kotak: I think first on the distribution side just let me give you a sense that we are continuing to add branches but selectively and in a measured rifle manner. Our view is we need to have a fair distribution, but the future is less density than the past. Therefore, if you added a branch at a gap of say 1 kilometer earlier, you can now afford to have a branch at a gap of two or three kilometers. And I will ask Virat Diwanji to give his thoughts and include him on the branch network target which we are going by March 2019, and the current branch strategy. Virat, over to you.

Virat Diwanji: Look, as what Uday mentioned, we are going ahead with the branch expansion in a measured way and where we are focusing on particular area where we want to go and setup the branch. Means, if I tell you this year itself we will add close to about 100 branches by the end of March, which is incremental branches. Mind you, we also had advantage of shifting some of the branches which are in close proximity with the ING branches and that in that sense is an additional out let which we have created over last say 1, 1.5 years. So, from that point of view, our footprints are increasing and we will continue to grow the branch network in the coming year as well.

Uday Kotak: And to that let me also add to what Virat said, I believe the combination of smart, physical plus digital, what we internally called as Phygital, gives us a lot more bandwidth. And therefore one physical branch actually gives us a disproportionate expansion, thanks to the digital expansion as well. So the multiplier effect of the branch with really strong digital is how we see the future. We do not see ourselves on our own in any organic manner going to 5,000 branches. But do we see ourselves going to say 2,000 branches over the next few years? The answer is, probably.

And as you saw the deposits growth, the TD growth, bulk of it is coming digital now. Therefore a smart branch strategy combined with digital gives us a huge ability to expand the productivity of our low-cost liability and deposit base. And there is a culture, a culture which has been created which is highly focused on liability franchise, is something which takes a long time to build and which is a very different culture from pure distribution culture which is trying to make quick money on mutual fund distributions and insurance sales alone. What was the next question?

Ravi Singh: Sir, on deposit interest rates do you see any pressure?

Uday Kotak: First of all, system liquidity, as is known, is negative and likely to be negative till March. Our research believes that it should be in the region of negative around 100,000 crore by March. And there is continuing increase of currency in circulation, which is also a reality. And you can see

the credit deposit ratios of most banks, they are inching up, which is where we are focused on the liability strategy as a very important component of the overall banking strategy.

Ravi Singh: And your thoughts on external benchmark for loan pricing?

Uday Kotak: I think external benchmark, it does not bother us. If our internal cost of funds is low or is stable through our significantly higher liability franchise, and if the external benchmark is dependent on the wholesale money, we are at a place where we have a disproportionate amount of pool of low-cost stable liability, in fact who knows, it may be better for us, we do not know how it works but it could be better for us.

Ravi Singh: And if I could squeeze in last question, any medium-term ROE targets for the sort of risk pricing you are comfortable with?

Uday Kotak: We believe if we strip off excess capital, we are in a position to earn a 20% ROE.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Nitin Aggarwal from Motilal Oswal Securities Limited. Please go ahead.

Nitin Aggarwal: Sir, three questions. On real-estate side which pockets are you seeing signs of stress apart from premium properties in Mumbai and Noida in general? So if you can give some color as we are getting varied views here. Secondly, our SMA-II number this quarter has increased slightly, though the number overall base is low, but anything to read into that, what has driven this? And thirdly, over last one year our coverage ratio has improved quite significantly, so what levels will we look to maintain here over medium-term?

Uday Kotak: On real-estate, Manian?

KVS Manian: So, in the real-estate we see higher stress in high value kind of properties, and in specific locations it is even worse. What we see is in again selected areas in Bombay and even Noida, Gurgaon of course still remains very slow, in selected areas in Noida and selected areas in suburbs of Bombay, the affordable, I wouldn’t say affordable housing in definition of affordable housing under PMJAY, but I would say lower cost range of housing is moving better, broadly that is the sense. And of course, if I go city wise, Hyderabad is looking better than it has looked because Hyderabad has been extremely slow in the past. Chennai, again, lower cost properties

have moved better.

Yes, broadly that is how the real-estate is. But overall if I look, overall view if I take, housing does continue to be slow. The commercial is where we are seeing most cities reaching unutilized, I mean available commercial space is low and we are seeing demand for commercial going up.

Uday Kotak: And on SMA-II we do not think it is at this stage a major signal. There are a few accounts, no major large account out of this. But this is like a little bit of volatility up and down, if you look at year-on-year we are pretty flat, quarter-on-quarter movement last quarter was low. And we

are quite comfortable at this Rs. 300-odd crore SMA-II book on a loan book of Rs. 1.96 lakh crore, 0.18%. So we are watching it carefully, but at this stage we do not see that as an early sign of something major.

Nitin Aggarwal: And lastly on coverage?

Uday Kotak: On coverage, the way we think about coverage is what we think we will recover on a present value basis in a loan. I know the IFRS is still not on and coverage is an outcome of what we think is realizable value of our loan.

Nitin Aggarwal: So, where we will look to have it settled down?

Uday Kotak: I think if you look at most statistics, a coverage ratio of around between 60% to 70% is a decent ratio, depending on the nature of the security and everything else.

Nitin Aggarwal: And one more question if I can squeeze in, you mentioned that as a bank you are obsessed with building up the liability franchise, though we already have one of the highest CASA mix in the industry. So, any aspirational CASA level that you have and you would like to share?

Uday Kotak: Why should we think about a number, it is still very early days, we are barely 50%.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sameer Bhise from JM Financials. Please go ahead.

Sameer Bhise: Just quickly, if I look at sequential growth in some of the vehicle driven asset books, how do you see the growth outlook there, especially CVs, even the agri piece or auto where underlying is probably not as strong as it was in CY18?

D. Kannan: CVs could moderate, because if you really look at it quarter three numbers are even slightly lower than quarter two numbers. So, CV is moderate. Tractors are doing fine at this point in time.

Sameer Bhise: And from a medium-term perspective if one says that you continue to be cautious on the residential mortgages side?

Uday Kotak: Sorry, I am saying residential mortgage to the end consumer is a different ball game from lending against land to developers.

Sameer Bhise: So, from a medium-term perspective you still think that with this mix a 20%, 22% growth is achievable?

Uday Kotak: We have said that, I think we have given our guidance that we believe 20% growth rate is what we see as sustainable.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Adarsh Parasrampuria from Nomura. Please go ahead.

Adarsh Parasrampuria: Question on credit cost, just looking at this year you all had NPA provision of like Rs. 730 crore, out of which about Rs. 300 crore, Rs. 400 crore is only a ramp-up in coverage, implying that credit cost related to incremental slip has been pretty low. So, how should you look at it, this implies like a 20, 30 basis point kind of a credit cost. And when you look at CIBIL data or some other retail banks, they are indicating that we are off the bottom. So it is inching up but pretty much in control. So, given your business model, your cautiousness, what is the kind of credit cost you think is safe to kind of factor in?

Uday Kotak: See, we are going into a volatile phase in 2019. This is also a political year, it is an election year, there are lots of moving pieces in the country. If you go back last year we had given about a year ago when we came to you with March 2018 results our credit costs were around 60 basis points and we had guided you, trending down without giving a number of 50 but we had said we are trending down from 60 towards the 50 region. Therefore, my sense is, it is also about how do you want to have your risk mix in the pricing. If we have a significantly higher book which grew on, say for example unsecured which is not necessarily what I am saying, therefore do not read into that, but the level of credit cost is also linked to the returns you are making for the risk you are taking. Therefore, credit cost is a part of that risk adjusted return metrics. And if we took a little more risk, down the line credit cost will go up, but I have made it up in returns. Therefore, it is not a number in isolation, and this is what I find very difficult to explain that finally credit cost, NIM and my overall loan growth are all interconnected.

Adarsh Parasrampuria: What I am trying to ask, Uday, a good part of the 40, 50 that you are talking about is also a rampup in coverage, right, you are not going to go to 80 or 90, so you have experienced much lower than the 50 that you probably would have guided to. So, given your profile, your growth levels, your portfolio mix and your metrics, like obviously 20 something one cannot factor in, so the point I am trying to ask is, is still 50 okay or you think 50 is something you all can stick with because you are all more doing like 20, 30 basis point now?

Uday Kotak: I would not give you a guidance but I will give you history. If you look at pre-ING, we were at around 40 basis point, but this is not guidance.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kshitij Bansal from Albatross Capital. Please go ahead.

Kshitij Bansal: Most of my questions are answered, I was just hoping if you can give some color on the issue with the RBI where they are asking the promoter stake to be diluted below a stipulated amount. Just wondering, what would you possibly believe that the counter solution that you have

proposed, the chances that your confidence level of that getting accepted, what could be as investors we could expect out of that?

Jaimin Bhatt: I don’t know where you get the fact that there is a counter proposal or anything, as you are aware we believe that we complied and we have made that disclosure that RBI has come back to say that they believe that we have not complied. It is also known that we filed a writ petition in the court which is being heard, and to that extent right now it is sub-judice and that is where it stays.

Kshitij Bansal: Gentlemen, what I actually meant, I know that the compliance is in place but by virtue of this PNCPS instrument that you have proposed to bring down the stake, that is somewhere I believe the current debate is on. So I was wondering from your perspective what could you believe would be like a reasonable acceptance of this solution?

Jaimin Bhatt: I do not think we can comment on that, that is exactly the issue which we had and which is right now a subject matter in court. So I do not think it is proper to comment on what will be taken and what not.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Monika Agarwal from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Monika Agarwal: Sir, I just have one question on the unsecured loan book, that is the small business personal loan credit card book. So, what proportion of that book would be the small business part, if you could

just give some rough proportion mix?

Uday Kotak: We do not give that breakup. But this is the consumer bank piece, it is done out of the consumer bank, it is a combination of personal loans, business loans, loan against property, working capital for small businesses, that is the piece which you are referring to. And we believe that piece is actually growing quite okay. And what we are finding interesting is that the small business, PL and credit card is in very good shape, while the business banking which is SME is showing a very different trend.

Monika Agarwal: So, another on this follow-up, if you would be able share on the personal loan and credit card, what proportion mix do you have in existing versus new customers? Like how much are we sourcing from our existing customer base versus new to bank kind of a mix?

Virat Diwanji: As far as the sourcing from the existing customer base is concerned, in credit cards it is in excess of 80% of our credit cards that we do is through the customers that we already have. And in say personal loan, that percentage is also in excess of closer to 50% where, again, from the liabilities customers as well as the corporate salary customers that we have. So, in both these product mix perhaps our share to our existing customers is fairly large.

Moderator: Thank you. That was the last question. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Uday Kotak for closing comments.

Uday Kotak: Thank you very much. I really appreciate all of you taking the time on this call. As I said, this is the beginning of 2019, it is going to be very interesting, exciting and a challenging political and economic year ahead. We are positioned and to be able to navigate through this with a strong balance sheet and a business model which we feel should be able to not only withstand but also survive, sustain and grow through this reasonably volatile period which may come ahead. And I once again appreciate the time you have taken to be with us on this call. Thank you very much.

Moderator: Thank you. Ladies & gentlemen, on behalf of Kotak Mahindra Bank, that concludes this conference call for today. Thank you for joining us. And you may now disconnect your lines.",8867,0.12186033817437979

HDFC Securities' research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Robust operating performance (NII: +23/9% YoY/QoQ), book growth (+24/6%) and CASA traction (+28/5%), at KMB continued into 3QFY19. Lower GNPAs (~2.07% vs. 2.15% QoQ) coupled with a higher PCR (~66.2%) indicate further improvement in asset quality. Margins increased (~4.33%, +13bps) due to improving pricing power and rise in the share of low cost deposits. The contribution of most subsidiaries to consolidated net earnings reduced during the quarter, attributed to unfavourable environs.

Outlook

Management quality and corp governance practices reckon premium valuations. Maintain BUY with an SOTP of Rs 1,400 (4.25x Dec-20 core ABV of Rs 263 + Rs 281 for subs).

ICICI Direct's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Net interest income (NII) came in at Rs 2939 crore, up 22.8% YoY, on back of healthy credit growth of ~24% YoY and improvement in margins of ~13 bps at 4.3%. Core fee income growth remained healthy at 25% YoY to Rs 1038 crore Operational expenses came in a tad higher at Rs 1965 crore, up 21.8% YoY. Operational performance remained healthy with Profit prior to provision (PPP) at Rs 1938 crore. The bank had reversed investment MTM of Rs 272 crore in the quarter Write-back on investment book offset provisions on advances leading to higher PAT at Rs 1291 crore, up 23.6% YoY. Consolidated PAT came in at Rs 1844 crore, up 13.5% YoY Asset quality broadly remained stable with ~8 bps QoQ improvement in GNPA ratio at 2.07% (Rs 4129 crore). Bank continue to remain cautious on pedalling growth in MSME segment Advances growth remains healthy at ~24% YoY. Growth in CV, home loan, small business including personal loans and corporate portfolio remained healthy. Deposit growth came in 18.2% YoY to Rs 213804 crore, with CASA ratio stable at 50.7%.

Outlook

KMB has maintained consistent performance in terms of RoA at 1.7% and RoE of 12-14%. Going ahead, focus on pedalling balance sheet growth, maintaining risk adjusted returns will benefit return ratios. The performance of non-banking businesses (prime, life insurance and AMC business) remains strong on growth & profitability. Value enrichment remains a positive with contribution inching up to 35%. Hence, we maintain our target price of Rs 1400, based on SOTP valuation. However, given ambiguity on outcome of tussle between KMB and RBI and thereby promoter stake dilution, we downgrade the stock from BUY to HOLD.

We have collated a list of recommendations from different global brokerage firms for Tuesday, January 22.

Lupin: Underperform| Target: Rs 800

Credit Suisse maintained its underperform rating on Lupin with a target price of Rs 800. Levothyroxine is a key approval for the company as it accounts for 7-8 percent of FY21 earnings per share (EPS).

Credit Suisse expects the company to reach its peak sales of $30-35 million in FY21 in Levothyroxine and along with that expect two more generic approvals in FY20.

Just Dial: Buy| Target: Rs 765

Nomura marinated its buy rating on JustDial post Q3 results with a target price of Rs 765. The global investment bank is of the view that the company is most cost-effective SME advertising platform.

While competition remains high, Nomura sees wide scope for expanding in tier 2/3 cities, it said in a note.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy| Target: Rs 1500

CLSA maintained its buy rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank post Q3 results with a target price of Rs 1500. The global investment bank sees 21 percent CAGR in the standalone earnings.

A key positive was the 23 percent growth in the net interest income (NII) led by a 23 percent rise in loans. Going forward, better growth and return on equity (ROE) improvement are key variables in sustaining premium valuation, the note added.

Ashok Leyland: Sell| Target: Rs 75

CLSA maintained its sell rating on Ashok Leyland and slashed its target price to Rs 75 from Rs 85 earlier. The global investment bank sees a high likelihood of a downturn after 4 years of up-cycle for truck market. It expects competition to intensify in a downturn. The FY20-21 EPS estimates are 14-22 percent below the street.

Union Bank of India: Buy| Target: Rs 105

CLSA maintained its buy call on Union Bank of India with a 12-month target price of Rs 105.

The asset quality remains to be weak and it looks like earnings are likely to normalise from FY20 onwards. The global investment bank is disappointed by the higher level of slippage, at 3.8% of the past year’s loans.

If you thought only popular stocks made money for investors, this might come as a surprise. Neutral-to-moderately popular stocks outperformed significantly compared to the most popular stocks in the December quarter, according to a report from Motilal Oswal on contrarian investing.

In Q3FY19, neutral-to-moderately popular stocks performed the best, significantly surpassing the performance of the benchmark (BSE-100). The most popular stocks came in third, while the second-most popular stocks performed the worst, it said.

The report further added that out-of-favour low P/E stocks delivered disproportionate returns, significantly outperforming the benchmark. In contrast, the performance of high P/E stocks was dismal.

Similarly, out-of-favour low price-to-cashflow or P/CF stocks delivered disproportionate returns, again significantly outperforming the benchmark.

In contrast, the performance of high P/CF stocks is dismal. In Q3FY19, high P/CF stocks delivered the best returns, while the low P/CF stocks came in third.

The findings from the Motilal Oswal report suggest that simple strategy of investing in stocks for which analyst consensus has changed from net sell to net buy with a holding period of one year has delivered 21.1 percent annual returns over the last 10 years.

Top Contrarian buys or sell ideas:

A few days ago, I was reading an analysis report on Kotak Mahindra Bank by Jana Vembu. It explains how KMB emerged as a survivor by providing its banking services to consumers, corporates and commercial businesses. As per the report, Re.1 invested with Uday Kotak (Managing Director, KMB) in 1985 would be worth Rs 2 Lakh today.

Image: Journey of KMB | Data Source: Moneycontrol

Let me make it sound a little more fanciful. With lots of ups and downs in 33 years, Rs 1 Lakh invested in Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) would be worth 2,000 Crore. That’s an astonishing rise of 1,99,99,900 percent. Really amazing. Isn’t it? Besides, who doesn’t love to own such companies? Almost all of us. And yet, a majority of us fail to grasp such exemplary returns.

Why?

Because owning such companies can turn out to be real nightmares during the holding period. The fear that erupts inside us after seeing a decline in stock price outpowers the conviction with which we had bought the stock in the very first place. Thus, the fear makes us sell it even if its primary business is fundamentally strong. In fact, under panic, we fail to analyze the capability of the management that works day and night to make it really successful.

The pain of holding a stock.

***

In a span of 33 long years, KMB compounded at a CAGR of 45 percent. But this didn’t happen every year. The high returns did come at a cost. The below chart portrays totally a different picture altogether. The kind of torture that its investors had to go through, can easily be noticed.

Image: Drawdowns in KMB | Data Source: Moneycontrol

During the 2008-Recession, it lost its value by 84.9%. Post-recession, it took more than 5 years to reclaim its 2008 peak. Not only this. At least on 6 occasions, the stock fell down by more than 50 percent. Around 73 percent of the time, during its journey, it stayed below its previous all-time high open price. Besides, it tasted the aftermaths of Kargil War, Asian Currency Criss, the Dot-Com Bubble Crash, 2008-Recession and other global key events that made investors pee in their pants.

Despite all these sufferings, I wish I had owned the shares of KMB. I wish I could be one of those investors who was made filthy rich by KMB. But why? Because it’s headed by one of those intelligent fanatics, Uday Kotak, who has built the Kotak business worth billions of dollars from scratch. And this is not an easy task.

The truth is that all great companies go through such adverse stages. The pain of holding a stock lies in the fact that it can face a drawdown in extreme double digits. That too for a long period of time. Sometimes, it may never even recover within a stipulated timeframe. The other times, it may test your patience by staying stagnant. Be it the adhesive big player Pidilite or biscuit maker Britannia. They all have fallen down in the past.

Image: They All Fall Down | Datasource: Moneycontrol

On the other hand, the ones who have the stomach to ride such roller-coaster rides throughout the awful phases make the real money. All they need to do is ignore the short-term fluctuations in the stock prices and focus on the long-term business prospects instead. With a growing business and its earnings, the stock price eventually starts resonating.

Having said that, it reminds me of one of the quotes by Prof Sanjay Bakshi of MDI, Gurgaon:

“If you end up owning a fantastic business, then plan to hold it for a long time. And prepare yourself for a roller coaster ride. If you have chosen the right business to own, the ride will be worth it in the end.”

***

While writing this post, I happened to remember an old BBC interview on Charlie Munger (Vice-Chairman, Berkshire Hathaway). On 26th October 2009, he was asked, “So how much does Charlie worry when Berkshire’s common stock declines?“

He replied: “Zero. This is the third time that Warren and I have seen our holdings in Berkshire Hathaway go down, top tick to bottom tick, by 50 percent.”

Further, he added: “I think it’s in the nature of long-term shareholding of the normal vicissitudes, in worldly outcomes, and in markets that the long-term holder has his quoted value of his stocks go down by say 50 percent.”

Then, later in the interview, he said: “In fact, you can argue that if you’re not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50 percent two or three times a century you’re not fit to be a common shareholder, and you deserve the mediocre result you’re going to get compared to the people who do have the temperament, who can be more philosophical about these market fluctuations.”

That’s the pain of holding a stock. It can wipe off the gains that may go beyond our imagination!!!

The holding companies generally tend to outperform the underlying ones in a bull market. Thus, with a 2-year view, one should look at buying holding companies of strong groups, Ambareesh Baliga, independent market expert, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q) After a muted 2018, what are your predictions for the year 2019?

A) The initial period of 2019 would be lackluster unless one witnesses a fresh pro-BJP wave which seems remote as of now. We should see a decisive move post general elections — which could be either up or down depending on the outcome. Broadly there could be three scenarios –

1) BJP/NDA managing a workable majority: The markets will bounce back and we could witness a sharp rally. Could lead to a new high in 2019.

2) Congress forming the government with dependable allies – A knee-jerk reaction which would be limited leading to normalisation of the markets in a few months

3) An unstable weak formation: Markets will correct sharply and seek lower levels

Q) Any sector(s) which you think could turn out to be a dark horse in 2019?

A) The dark horse bet for 2019 would be sugar sector. I believe the policy change to allow sugar mills to produce ethanol directly without going through the traditional route of producing sugar is a “game-changer”.

With increased blending, the sugar mills will have a greater control over their operations. Secondly, I don’t believe the fortunes of Ethanol will depend only on the oil price as environmental considerations and the forex savings will ensure it remains in focus.

I would also suggest retail investors look at holding companies which have corrected sharply and most of them are quoting at more than 60 percent discount to the underlying.

The holding companies generally tend to outperform the underlying in a bull market. Thus, with a 2-year view, one should look to buy holding companies of strong groups.

One such pick is Pilani Investments. It is a holding company of the Birla Group having blue-chip investments like Century Textiles, Grasim, Ultratech to name a few. Among others, one could look at Uniphos Enterprises and BF Investments.

Q) A large part of the recovery in 2018 was led by heavyweights and on the other hand, small & mid-caps remain muted. Do you think the broader market is likely to remain under pressure?

A) Broader markets will remain lackluster due to lack of participation. However, we could see specific stocks in action based on news or developments in the specific sector or stock.

Q) 2019 strategy: Top five fundamental safe stocks which are good buys at current levels for a holding period of 1 year?

A) Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Ultratech Cement, TCS, and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories.

Q) Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in 2019?

A) Though I expect FMCG and pharma to do well in 2019, I expect a good recovery in cement and discovery of PSU banks as a sector.

Q) Where do you see the benchmark indices headed in the near term?

A) Global events, as well as impending election results, kept the markets on the edge in the first two weeks of December. The market absorbed the outcome of state election even though BJP failed to get an absolute majority in any of the Hindi heartland states.

Markets generally prefer continuity, except for 2014 when it was waiting for the Modi government to take over. However, it also expects a stable government after an initial period of knee-jerk reaction and volatility, whenever there is an upset for the incumbent government. Thus, I expect the markets to be back on track in 2019, even if there is an upset at Centre.

Q) Do you think the pain in the mid and smallcaps is here to stay in 2019?

A) Well, the small and the midcaps as a group is moving up after a sustainable rally in the largecaps. However, 2018 was different as even among the largecaps, the rally was limited to a few index heavyweights.

The pain the small and midcaps would continue in the initial months of 2019, but I see it as a stock pickers’ delight.

Q) Do you think rupee will continue to appreciate in the near term?

A) I think we have seen the worst for the rupee when it was trading closer to Rs 75/USD. Going forward, I believe INR/USD should stablise around Rs 70/71 and possibly appreciate if we have a stable government in 2019 with incremental foreign flows.

Q) What should be the ideal portfolio allocation for investors for the next one year?

A) One should look to increase exposure to equities since troubled times is a great opportunity to get invested. I would invest 60 percent in equities, of which 10 percent in cash, 30 percent in fixed income, and the rest 10 percent in gold/gold equivalents.

In response to the writ petition filed by Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB), the Bombay High Court has refused to stay the December 31 deadline for promoter stake dilution.

Brief background

RBI’s licensing norms require a bank to bring down promoter holding to 40 percent within three years of starting operations. Thereafter, banks are required to reduce their shareholding to 20 percent and 15 percent within 10 years and 12 years, respectively.

RBI had granted a five-year extension to Uday Kotak, MD of KMB, over the original deadline of March 31, 2015. As per RBI’s rules, KMB has to lower the promoter holding to less than 20 percent by December 2018 and 15 percent by March 2020. Uday Kotak currently holds around 30 percent stake in the bank.

In August, KMB proposed issuing non-convertible, non-cumulative, perpetual preference shares (PNCPS) to bring down the promoter stake down below 20 percent. The same was turned down by RBI following which bank moved Bombay High Court.

What does this mean for the investors?

With no interim relief, KMB is left with no option but to dilute the promoter stake within the given deadline or attract the regulator’s irk.

Earlier this year, RBI pulled up Bandhan bank for not complying with the shareholding requirement under licensing norms within the stipulated timeline. As a penalty, the regulator withdrew its general permission to the bank to open new branches and also ordered the freezing of the remuneration of the MD & CEO. KMB may also likely go the Bandhan way with regulator putting business restrictions on KMB as it is unlikely that it will meet the deadline of December end.

Bandhan too tried its luck just like KMB. While Kotak Bank tried using a very innovative way to avoid the equity dilution, Bandhan displayed a willful ignorance of clashing regulations to defer the dilution. But RBI’s message was very clear and consistent in both these cases.

In an immediate reaction to the High Court order denying extension of the December 31 deadline, the stock price of the KMB fell around 2 percent. The regulatory requirement of bringing down the promoter holding will remain an overhang for the stock. As such, we don’t expect a sustainable up move in bank’s stock price till it fully complies with the regulation. The speculation of a potential merger or acquisition will further add to stock’s volatility.

The banking space is ripe for some large M&A due to RBI’s licensing requirement. The stocks of private banks wherein the promoter need to reduce its holdings could be set for a wild ride. Investors need to tread carefully.

The Bombay High Court has refused to order a stay on the Reserve Bank of India's December 31 deadline to Kotak Mahindra Bank seeking dilution of promoter stake.

This means that the bank will have to reduce promoter stake by 10 percent in the next 15 days or risk facing action from the RBI.

Kotak Mahindra Bank had dragged the Reserve Bank to court, contesting the deadline that sought reduction of promoter stake.

The court will next hear the matter on January 17.

Uday Kotak, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra, holds a nearly 30 percent stake in the bank. In line with the RBI’s stipulation that promoters gradually reduce their stake in a bank, the bank issued non-convertible preference shares, a dilution that was shot down by the RBI.

Kotak has to dilute his stake to 20 percent by December 31 and 15 percent by March 31, 2020.

The bank's counsel Darius Khambata on Monday argued that the issue of dilution of promoter stakes has been going on since a few years.

""In the past, the RBI asked the bank to only dilute promoter shareholding of its paid-up capital. However, the impugned letter sought dilution of paid-up voting equity capital,"" Khambata said.

The bank further argued that RBI’s requirement is inconsistent with its own policy and directions and public interest, and “bear no nexus with the object sought to be achieved and contrary to the objects, purpose and provisions of the Banking Regulations Act, 1949”.

Appearing for the RBI, senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond and advocate Parag Sharma opposed the plea and said the reason behind asking for promoter stake dilution is to ensure that the voting power is not in the hands of one single group.

""In August 2018, the RBI issued the letter to the petitioner. Now when the deadline is approaching, the bank has come to the high court seeking stay,"" Dhond argued.

The bank in its petition termed the RBI's directive as ""arbitrary, without any authority of law and contrary to the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, and Article 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India"".

""Even assuming that the RBI has the power to issue directions requiring reduction of promoter shareholding in banking companies, the said power can only be exercised, and has always been exercised by the RBI, with reference to the petitioner's paid-up capital and not in relation to its paid-up voting equity capital,"" the petition mentioned.

The bank sought the high court to quash and set aside the RBI directions to dilute the promoter stake.

It has also prayed for the court to declare that the reduction of promoter shareholding shall stand complied with, if it is achieved as a percentage of the paid-up capital and not the paid-up voting equity capital of the bank.

Kotak’s senior counsel Darius Khambata also told the court that with the change of guard at the RBI, the new governor should be allowed to apply his mind to the issue.

Bandhan Bank is closely monitoring the developments in Kotak Mahindra Bank with respect to reducing promoter holding using preference shares, as the RBI has mandated a similar directive to the Kolkata- based lender.

Kotak Mahindra Bank on December 12 said it has moved the Bombay High Court against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which had asked promoters of the bank to bring down their stake to 20 percent by December 2018.

""We are observing the Kotak Bank development very closely,"" a Bandhan Bank source told PTI.

The bank's CEO and MD Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, however, declined to comment on the matter, saying he is not entitled to speak on regulatory issues.

RBI had imposed restrictions on Bandhan Bank's branch expansion after it failed to pare promoters' stake to 40 percent from close to 82 percent, within the stipulated three- year time frame.

The lender commenced operations on August 23, 2015.

Bank license norms require a lender to bring down promoter holding to 40 percent within three years of starting operations.

Bandhan Bank has a total of 937 branches, the number remaining below its target of opening 1,000 branches by March 2019.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had in October exempted the bank from the one-year promoter shareholding lock-in rule, allowing its promoter, Bandhan Financial Holdings Ltd (BFHL) to bring down holding.

In August, Uday Kotak, the founder and promoter of Kotak Mahindra Bank, has pared down his stake in the bank to 19.70 percent from about 30 percent following issuance of preference shares.

Within a few days, the RBI said the stake dilution by Kotak does not meet its regulatory norms on the same, something the private sector lender contested.",324,

Kotak Mahindra Bank shares plunged over 6 percent intraday on December 10 after the lender filed writ petition before Bombay High Court to validate its position w.r.t perpetual non-convertible preference shares (PNCPS) used for stake dilution.

It moved Bombay HC against the RBI which said dilution stake through PNCPS is not meeting the public shareholding norm.

""RBI has today communicated to us that our PNCPS issuance does not meet their promoter holding dilution requirement. We continue to believe that we have met the requirement and will engage with the RBI in this behalf,"" the bank said in its BSE filing.

The bank further said it has since clarified and conveyed to the RBI its position in relation to PNCPS being a part of paid up capital and the legal basis on the matter of dilution of shareholding under the Banking

Regulation Act. ""We have also shared with the RBI the opinions of eminent jurists and senior most legal counsels of the country, which confirm our understanding.""

Hence to validate its stance with respect to PNCPS, the country's third largest lender by market capitalisation moved High Court as it did not hear from RBI after it shared legal opinion.

""Given the milestone of December 31, 2018, the bank has been left with no option but to protect its interest. By way of abundant caution, the bank has today filed a writ petition with the Bombay High Court to validate the bank's position,"" it said.

As per RBI shareholding norms, every bank or any firm which directly owns stake in a bank, whether it is listed or unlisted, has to reduce stake gradually to 20 percent.

Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank promoters already brought down their shareholding below 20 percent.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bandhan Bank, Equity Small Finance Bank etc are among lenders wherein promoters have to cut down their stake to 20 percent within the stipulated timeline set by the RBI. The RBI had asked Kotak Mahindra Bank to meet public shareholding norm by December 31, 2018.

Hence, to meet the public shareholding norm, the NCPS issuance committee of the board of directors of the bank, on August 2, had declared the closure of the issue and approved the allotment of 100 crore PNCPS to eligible investors at the issue price of Rs 5 per PNCPS, aggregating to Rs 500 crore pursuant to the issue.

Subsequent to this issue of Rs 500 crore of PNCPS, the paid-up capital of the bank has increased from Rs 953.16 crore to Rs 1,453.16 crore, Kotak Bank said.

Post this issuance of PNCPS, promoter holding is 19.70 percent of the paid-up capital which meets the RBI's communications in this behalf for December 31, 2018.

But the RBI disagreed with the bank's way of stake dilution through PNCPS, saying it should be done through ordinary shares or equity shares.

The current market capitalisation of the bank stands over Rs 2.3 lakh crore, which values the 10 percent stake of Kotak's promoter and promoter group at around Rs 23,000 crore and total 30.02 percent over Rs 69,000 crore. Uday Suresh Kotak himself owns 29.73 percent stake in the bank out of total promoter shareholding of 30.02 percent.

The above paid-up capital, which the bank is using as a base for stake dilution, is just a 0.41 percent of market capitalisation.

As per shareholding pattern, if we assume the bank dilutes 10 percent stake through PNCPS route, then the promoter shareholding at the end of December 2018 quarter would remain as it is—30.02 percent.

If in case the court verdict comes in favour of Kotak, then every bank which has been directed by RBI to bring down stake to 20 percent over the time, can follow the Kotak route and not equity dilution.

Kotak Mahindra Bank stock had rallied 8.5 percent on December after sources told CNBC-TV18 that Warren Buffett-owned Berkshire Hathaway is in talks buy a stake in the private sector lender.

Sources told the news channel that Berkshire Hathaway wants to buy at least 10 percent in Kotak Mahindra Bank and is looking to invest $4-6 billion, but that it has not decided to go through with the investment as yet.

However, in its clarification, the bank informed the exchanges that it is unaware of any plans by Warren Buffett-owned Berkshire Hathaway to buy a stake in it.

Kotak Mahindra Bank has filed a writ petition with Bombay High Court seeking validation for its decision to dilute promoter Uday Kotak's stake to below 20 percent through a sale of perpetual non-convertible preference shares (PNCPS), the bank said in a statement to the exchanges.

The private sector lender had been asked by the RBI in August to dilute Kotak's stake in it to below 20 percent by the end of 2018, following which it conducted a sale of PNCPS.

Although this effectively brought down the promoter's stake to 19.70 percent of the bank's paid-up capital, questions were raised about whether the preference share issue circumvented the RBI's rules on stake dilution.

The bank decided to get its preference share issue legally validated because the RBI has not made it clear as yet about whether or not it is willing to recognise the dilution of stake achieved through the exercise.

RBI had communicated to Kotak Mahindra Bank in August that it did not recognise the manner in which it brought down Kotak's stake, prompting the lender to back its decision up with legal proof and opinions of eminent jurists and senior legal counsellors across India.

Legal experts had said that Kotak is legally right in doing so since his licence conditions require him to cut his share in the paid-up capital of the bank, and not in the number of voting shares.

However, others had argued that the intent of the RBI's rules was to ensure that a promoter's stake in a bank is brought down with respect to the number of ""voting shares"" he or she owns.",272,-0.618436336517334

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is looking to buy 10 percent stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank, multiple sources told CNBC-TV18 on December 7, adding that the deal is valued between $4 billion and $6 billion.

Berkshire Hathaway may look at buying promoter stake or via a preferential allotment, said the sources, who did not want to be named.

As per RBI guidelines, Uday Kotak needs to dilute his stake to below 20 percent by December 2018 in order to ensure a wider ownership of banks.

Uday Kotak had sought RBI's permission to bring down his stake in the bank to 20 percent from the current 30 percent by selling nonconvertible perpetual noncumulative preference shares (PNCPS) to a group of investors in August 2018. RBI, however, shot down this arrangement.

On August 14, Kotak Mahindra Bank said, ""RBI has today communicated to us that our PNCPS issuance does not meet their promoter holding dilution requirement. We continue to believe that we have met the requirement and will engage with the RBI in this behalf.""

In a statement to the BSE, Kotak Mahindra Bank said it is unaware of any plans by Berkshire Hathaway to buy a stake in the company.

CNBC-TV18 still awaits response from Berkshire Hathaway.

Though analysts remain unsure of the claims, they believe that the reports would be positive for the bank.

“At this point of time, it is source-based, speculative, etc. so to that extent, I wouldn’t react but then it remains a fundamentally very strong franchise. So if you take care of the technical overhang, a fair amount of supply coming into the market, you can get rid of the distraction then take a more fundamental view. We generally believe that it is a very strong franchise but the return ratio could be under pressure. That would be my take. It is a source-based information, very hard for a fundamental analyst to take a call,"" said Krishnan ASV of SBICAP Securities.

""Kotak has not commented anything on it but definitely this was being watched out for as to how they are trying to bring down the shareholding from 30 percent to 20 percent and I think if this happens, this takes away the overhang, which is there in the stock. Otherwise, I think Kotak in the current environment is very appropriately positioned to benefit of the overall conditions which are there in terms of gaining the market share, they have built up a very strong liability franchise as well and they have adequate capital on the balance sheet. So they are well prepared for a growth. So fundamentally, it is on a strong footing.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has informed the exchanges that it is unaware of any plans by Warren Buffett-owned Berkshire Hathaway to buy a stake in it.

According to a report by CNBC-TV18, Berkshire Hathaway is reportedly in talks to buy a stake in the private sector lender, which is the country's third largest by market capitalisation.

The stock, which rose nearly 8 percent on the report, shed its gains after the lender released its clarification to the bourses.

Sources told the news channel that Berkshire Hathaway wants to buy at least 10 percent in Kotak Mahindra Bank and is looking to invest $4-6 billion, but that it has not decided to go through with the investment as yet.

Uday Kotak owns a 29.73 percent stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank. The total shareholding of the promoter group in the bank stands at 30.02 percent.

In accordance with the Reserve Bank of India's norms, Kotak is required to bring down his shareholding in the bank to 20 percent or below before December 31.

Kotak Mahindra Bank's market capitalisation currently stands at around Rs 2.4 lakh crore ($34 billion), based on which a 10 percent stake would cost around Rs 24,000 crore ($3.4 billion). ($1 = Rs 70.49)

CNBC-TV18 reported that it was still awaiting a response from Berkshire Hathaway and that Kotak Mahindra Bank had not issued any statement or comment on the subject.

The primary trend of the stock is bullish. Oscillators and indicators have been holding strong. The private banking space has been performing well and Bank Nifty also holds its uptrend.

Considering the technical evidence discussed above, we recommend buying the stock at CMP for the target of Rs 1,325 and keeping a stop loss at Rs 1,160 on a closing basis.

The Nifty has been in an up move for the last six sessions, gaining more than 350 points. It recently surpassed the crucial resistance of its 200-DMA.

The Nifty's previous top was placed at 10,775 on the daily chart, which has also been taken out on a closing basis. The index is now trading above its 20, 50, 100 and 200-day EMA which indicates strength in the intermediate trend.

Higher top and higher bottom formation is well intact on the Nifty daily chart. At 10,882, Nifty has completed the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the entire fall seen from 11,760 (all-time high made in August 2018) to 10,004 (bottom of Oct 2018).

Now, the next target for the Nifty is placed at 11,089 which happens to be 61.8 percent retracement level. Oscillators and Indicators have also been showing strength on the daily chart.

RSI has been moving up and has now reached at 62, which is still at a fair distance from the overbought zone. The MACD has also reached above its signal line and equilibrium line.

Support for the Nifty is now shifted upward to the 10,700-10,775 range. It would be advisable to remain long in Nifty for the upside target of 11,089, keeping a stop loss at 10,700 on a closing basis.

As far as Bank Nifty is concerned, it has retraced more than 61.8 percent of the entire fall seen from 28,388 (August 2018 high) to 24,240 (October 2018 low). This development negates the chances of resuming downtrend, which initially started in August 2018.

The next resistance for the index is placed at 27,150 and 27,410 whereas support levels have also shifted upwards towards 26,380 in the spot market.

The Nifty Midcap index has reached the highest level since September 26. We expect market breadth to improve further. Going forward, we see an opportunity in the auto sector where momentum buying could emerge.

Two-wheeler companies are expected to outperform in the coming days. To conclude, the trend of the market is bullish and staying with the trend would be a better strategy. Do not try to anticipate the top. Investors should trade with trailing the stop losses at regular intervals.

Here is a list of 3 stocks that could return 7-8 percent in the next one month:

SBI: Buy| LTP: Rs 287| Target: Rs 308 | Stop loss: Rs 273| Return: 7 percent

The stock price of SBI has been consolidating for the last one month. The primary trend of the stock is bullish with higher tops and higher bottoms.

The short-term moving averages have been holding above the long-term moving averages. PSU Banking stocks have been witnessing a long build-up in the derivative segment.

Considering the technical evidence discussed above, we recommend buying the stock at the current market price for the target of Rs 308 and keeping a stop loss placed at Rs 273 on a closing basis.

Hero MotoCorp Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 3,040| Target: Rs 3,250| Stop loss: Rs 2,910| Return: 7 percent

The stock has fallen 26 percent from its all-time high of Rs 4,092 recorded in September of 2017. The stock price has nicely recovered from its recent low of Rs 2,648 and has given a bullish breakout from the inverse Head and Shoulder on the daily chart.

The stock is maintaining higher tops and higher bottoms formations on the daily chart. Moving average and oscillator setup seems bullish on the charts.

Considering the technical evidence discussed above, we recommend buying the stock at CMP for the target of Rs 3,250 and keeping a stop loss placed at Rs 2,910 on a closing basis.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,226| Target: Rs 1,325| Stop loss: Rs 1,160 |Return: 8 percent

The stock price has recently surpassed the crucial resistance level of 50, 100 and 200-DMA. The stock has been making higher tops and higher bottom formation on the weekly charts.

A day of consolidation for Indian markets. The S&P BSE Sensex which rallied by over 200 points in the opening trade pared gains and closed 46 points higher while the Nifty50 ended just 7 points up to close at 10,883 on Tuesday.

Markets settled almost flat for the second consecutive session. A rise in crude oil prices due to trade truce and a resultant strengthening of the dollar could have impacted the market sentiment. Additionally, investors are likely to have taken note of lower GDP print for the September quarter.

Also, there is some caution ahead of the outcome of the RBI's monetary policy review meet which triggered profit-taking as the session progressed, suggest experts.

Sectorally, Consumption, IT, Metals and PSU banks led the gains, while pharmaceuticals were the big losers. The Nifty Pharma slipped over 2 percent.

Investors are advised to remain cautious while picking stocks, and in case of any decline, Nifty would find support around 10,750 and the next major hurdle is placed at 11,100.

Foreign investors poured Rs 293 crore in Indian markets while DIIs pulled out Rs 806 crore on Monday, according to provisional data.

Rupee breaks 4-day winning run, drops 88 paise at 70.46 per dollar as crude rebounds.

Technical View:

Nifty formed a bearish candle as the closing level was lower than the opening level

The Nifty continued to face resistance around 10,900 levels but failed to hold the same.

Once it closes above 10900-10930, it would open doors for 11,000, suggest experts

Three levels: 10845, 10930, 11000

Max Call OI: 11000, 10900, 11100

And Kotak Mahindra Bank has hopped on to build their branding around the event, hoping it translates into massive sale of their limited edition Ranveer Singh debit card.

The scheme gives customers an option to choose from six personalised cards with Ranveer Singh’s image on them. As dreamy as it was, the big fat Bollywood wedding has indeed been a huge branding opportunity for some, and Kotak Group is definitely one of them.

The campaign promoting the debit card is being featured across TV, digital and social media. The outdoor campaign, which was kicked off early November in all major metros, had an image of Ranveer and a text reading 'Card mila kya?'. The punchline hinted at both the debit card and an invitation card to DeepVeer’s eagerly-anticipated wedding.

After a solid build-up, the teaser was followed by the main ad that let people know about the limited edition card.

“Once we got to know the official dates for the wedding, we came up with a catch line '811 celebrates 15.11'. And it has worked in our favour,” said Karthi Marshan, chief marketing officer, Kotak Mahindra Group. Kotak 811 is a new-age bank account offered by Kotak Mahindra Bank.

What’s more? The bank branches too were decked up like a wedding venue and customers were treated to sweets when they entered the premises. The initiative was interestingly captioned ‘ladki wale bhi muh meetha kijiye’, subtly addressing competitors as Deepika Padukone is the face of Axis Bank.

While the dreamy wedding of the actor at Lake Como was an expensive affair, how expensive was the campaign that banked on it? Without divulging too many details, Marshan said, “We want to make the campaign look like it costs a hundred crore.”

What does the one-month-long campaign mean for the bank? “Last time, we ran a special edition Paresh Maity (artist) card and we sold 20,000 of them, followed by another campaign around Independence Day where we launched the ‘fauji card’ and sold around 78,000 cards. This time, since we are talking about Ranveer Singh, our aspirations are not just in sync with our past success of limited edition cards, but our conservative estimates too are way higher,” Marshan added.

The group is also upbeat about their digital campaign. Social media has been abuzz with Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh’s wedding. Kotak Mahindra has cashed in on the nuptials, hoping holy matrimony for the two Bollywood stars ropes in some of Ranveer’s fans.

“The debit card has a sharp deadline because it is limited edition. But in this limited time, even if a reasonable share of Ranveer's fan following on social media translates to queries on the debit card, it's going to be good business for us,"" Marshan said.

Ranveer Singh debuted as Kotak’s brand ambassador in June 2018 and is the face of the bank’s #IndiaInvited campaign.",489,0.9997202356656393

This is the verbatim transcript of Kotak Mahindra Bank management call with analysts.

Moderator: Good Day, Ladies and Gentlemen. And a very warm welcome to the Kotak Mahindra Bank Q2 FY19 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the conference call, please signal an operator by pressing ‘*’ then ‘0’ on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I am now glad to hand the conference over to Mr. Uday Kotak. Thank you and over to you, sir.

Uday Kotak: Good evening, colleagues. Very happy to be on this call and to discuss, of course, the Kotak results and also a little bit of perspective on the financial sector as we stand at a very critical juncture.

My sense is we are actually now beginning to see some of the challenges which are coming out, essentially because of significantly broader financial sector than what India has seen for a long time. When I go back a little bit into the past, I think in many ways the turning point was the post demonetization period when we saw a significant growth in financial savings. And that lead to financial savings moving across the financial services sector, in addition to banking, into mutual fund, into insurance, and through that into the non-bank financial sector.

We have also seen a very significant growth in the non-bank financial sector in this period between 2017 and 2018. One of the challenges which the public sector banking faced, because of significant load of stressed assets, was some significant heavy lifting which was also done by the non-bank financial sector.

If you look at the total size of the financial sector, which is public sector banks, private sector banks and the non-bank financing sector, supported of course by sources of money which are mutual funds, insurance, pension funds and banks, the loan book growth of the NBFC sector is something which has been at a much faster pace than the banking sector.

And as we have seen from time to time with easy money, which is what we saw post demonetization, wholesale funding became cheaper than retail funding, which comes through the course of hardcore banking. And as wholesale funding became cheaper, it leads to a further fueling of the NBFC sector, supported by the fact that at the shorter tenure the rates were even more attractive. And that lead to significant ALM mismatches which is what we have seen happen.

Again, I think in addition to that, one of the issues is that a lot of the funds moved into essentially long-term assets, both in real-estate space and in the infra space, which were therefore not having the ability to create liquidity, should there have been a need at the shorter end. And combined with increasing stress, both in real-estate and infrastructure, as the money started getting delayed from the end use which is the infrastructure sector and the real-estate sector, we saw pressures coming in, particularly accentuated by defaults of some of the players which happened in August and September, starting with IL&FS. This was the first important trigger which took place in the market place. And then, of course, if you look at the size of money which has gone into NBFCs, and particularly housing finance companies, I think that has been the source of liquidity challenges which the sector has faced.

In my opinion, the way to address this is, the positive step taken by SBI to buy portfolios, and I would like to see larger, like NHB has done, a larger refinance window being made available to the housing finance sector to ease the liquidity mismatches which are prevalent in the sector. At the same time, it is very clear to me that the need for significantly higher focus on the quality of governance across the financial sector is clearly the need of the hour. And in cases where there are multiple companies being run under the financial services umbrella, the way the governance and management of different arms of these groups happens is extremely critical and it cannot be other than at arm’s length and at fair value. We have seen practices in many cases which have not necessarily adhered to these levels of core governance, on the basis of which large amounts of money are raised by the financial sector.

And of course in this context when we are talking about governance, the roles of all the fiduciaries are extremely important and it is critical that the different fiduciaries which are the backbone of the financial sector, i.e. the management, the board, responsible institutional shareholders, rating agencies, auditors, regulators and policy makers, all have a role to ensure the fair governance of the financial sector.

With these initial comments on the financial sector and the volatility which we are going through, I am happy to report a steady set of numbers from our bank. We have grown at 21% standalone and 18% consolidated. I would like to say that our businesses are in good shape. One of the important things which we have kept the focus on is avoiding concentration, therefore whether it is on a sector or on single companies, including the bank’s exposure to real-estate and to the non-bank financial sector, both at the sector level as well as at individual company level, we have managed the exposures which we believe are prudent. And therefore, we feel comfortable fundamentally with the quality of our balance sheet.

However, if the turbulence in the overall financial, infrastructure and real-estate sector dramatically increases, which I do not believe it should with proper handling by policy makers and regulators, but if it does get to more volatility and higher turbulence not only will we be stronger coming out of it, but like every other player in the same water we may at worst get some bruises but not get seriously impacted going forward. Of course, it is always dangerous to lower our guard, and I therefore encourage myself and my team not to lower our guard and continue our alertness to ensure that we withstand this volatility significantly safer than some of the challenges with players in this industry are currently facing.

And our capital base continues to be extremely strong, our net NPA at the consolidated level is 0.73%, at the bank level is around 0.8%. Continue to be prudent on provisioning, recognition; our SMA-2 is about Rs. 165 crore which is, again, probably amongst the lowest in the banking industry. So, hopefully we continue to do the right thing while seeing opportunity. And we are beginning to see opportunity, both in terms of better pricing power and ability to pick and choose the quality of credits we want, especially at the prices which we are more comfortable with.

Our liquidity position is extremely sound, in fact we currently run the challenge of managing surplus liquidity in our bank which we are handling with care, but always ready for opportunity as we go forward.

With that, I hand over to my colleague Jaimin Bhatt to take it further.

Jaimin Bhatt: Thanks, Uday. I will quickly take the earnings updatet which has been circulated. For the quarter we ended at the consolidated level with a profit of Rs. 1,747 crore, about 21% higher than the same period last year. The bank contributed Rs. 1,142 crore i.e. the highest.

Kotak Mahindra Prime had Rs. 157 crore of post-tax profit for the quarter. The life insurance company got Rs. 127 crore. Whereas the securities business raked in Rs. 112 crore. The mutual fund activity got us Rs. 52 crore, while the international companies got another Rs. 47 crore.

The overall capital and reserve position at the consolidated level now stands at Rs. 54,000 crore, which includes Rs. 40,000 crore of the banks.

Advances at the group level are at Rs. 2,22,000 crore, about 18% higher than same period last year. And as Uday mentioned, net NPA at the group level of 0.73%.

As for the bank standalone, we closed the quarter with post-tax profit of Rs 1,142 crore, about 15% higher than the same period last year. Net interest margin in the bank at 4.2% and the loan growth at 21%, we closed the period with a loan book of close to Rs. 1,85,000 crore.

We had started the launch of 811 in end of March 2017 with 8 million customer base. And we had said that we would want to double that in 18 month period. As of September, which is end of 18th month, we have crossed the customer base mark of 16 million customers.

At the bank standalone, we have seen the net interest income grow as well as the other income growing by close to 25% on a year-on-year basis, now at Rs. 1,205 crore. We have had provisions in this quarter, both on advances and investments which are, compared to a year-on-year basis, at a higher number. As a result, the provisional number for this quarter is higher than the same period last year. And we ended with a post-tax profit of Rs. 1,142 crore.

At the bank advances we have seen growth coming in variety of sectors. CVs and CEs grew on a year-on-year basis by 40%, the corporate bank book grew by about 19% odd, small businesses, credit cards and personal loans again did about 39%, whereas home loans which includes LAP did 23%. Our SMA-2, again, as Uday mentioned, at 0.09% of our advances at Rs. 165 crore, with gross NPA at 2.15% and net at 0.81%. Our total exposures, and by exposures I mean not just funded outstanding but off balance sheet investments, derivatives and whatever, at the bank level aggregates to close to Rs. 2,50,000 crore. Of which our exposures to the NBFC segment is about Rs. 13,000 crore, which includes about Rs. 1,200 crore of exposures to the other entities in the Kotak Group, including subsidiaries and it includes investments in subsidiaries.

Our commercial real-estate exposure at about Rs. 7,700 crore, which includes over Rs. 3,000 crore of LRD and CRE exposure on a year-over-year basis, has actually come down.

On deposits, we closed the period with CASA number of 50.2% as against 47.8% last year. On average numbers, we have seen current account grow at 22% whereas the savings account has grown by 43% on a year-on-year basis. Our focus on CASA plus TD is below Rs. 5 crore; now that aggregates to 79% of our total deposits. And the CASA does not include the Sweep deposits which are about 6.6% of our overall deposit base.

At the period end we have 1,425 branches.

The total balance sheet size at the bank standalone level is now at Rs. 2,88,000 crore.

I will request Shanti to take the digital ones before I come back on the subsidiaries.

Shanti Ekambaram: Thank you, Jaimin. We continue to focus on digital, both in terms of adoption by customers, as well as moving customer transaction volumes to net and mobile. Towards this, we have revamped our digital platforms, both net and mobile, to offer best in class experience and convenience. So we continue to be amongst the highest rated banking apps in India.

On an incremental basis, 90% of our RD volumes and 69% of our fixed deposit volumes are sourced digitally. We have seen a volume growth of 260% in our mobile banking transaction.

We have gone live with our chatbot, Keya. You may remember, we were one of the first to introduce VoiceBot, Keya, for servicing customers at the call center. We have gone live with chatbot for servicing customers on debit cards, credit cards and 811 and answering various queries.

As far as 811, we actually launched an India invited inclusive campaign, which really scaled new heights successfully across all platforms. From a customer perspective, as Jaimin talked about, we have crossed the 16 million total customer mark. In 811, 91% of the customers are between 18 to 40 years and we are completely focused on cross-selling into this customer base for TDs, RDs, credit cards, group personal insurance cover, etc.

We are reviewing the 811 strategy in view of the Supreme Court judgment. Also, UIDAI has introduced new guidelines yesterday, which will enable a paperless digital journey. We are revamping our processes and technology and will be following the new guidelines that have been outlined by UIDAI and in line with the SC judgment.

From a payment and digital lending solutions, we have seen volumes grow across our payment gateway, UPI transactions and our K-Mall, which is really the m-commerce and e-commerce transactions that customers can use on our platforms.

From a lending perspective, across all our products we have seen an increase in sourcing from digital channels, be it credit cards, personal loans, term loans, business loans. This is an area that we are continuing to invest in and we will see this continuing to improvise and scale as far as volumes for digital continue.

From a group company perspective, for Kotak Securities, mobile continues to be a way of life with increasing volumes i.e. 91% YoY on cash. And general insurance and life insurance as well, we continue focus on sourcing and servicing through the digital platform.

Jaimin, back to you.

Jaimin Bhatt: So, let me just quickly give some highlights of the subsidiaries. The life insurance company clocked a post-tax profit of Rs. 127 crore this quarter. Overall premiums, the new business premiums for this quarter at Rs. 824 crore, about 28% higher than last year. We have also had a change of mix, last year we had ULIPs for the full year at 36%, for the first half this year we are now at 25%. The solvency ratio there is at a healthy 3.1% as against requirement of 1.5%.

Kotak Securities clocking record volumes of Rs. 34,000 crore and an average market share in the cash segment on a half year basis at 8.7%, whereas for this quarter on an overall basis at 2.5%. The investment bank clocking a post-tax profit of Rs. 14 crore, has been involved in transactions both on the IPO side and the advisory side during the quarter.

Our overall assets under management, at the group level, grew by 18% on a year-on-year basis. We are just short of Rs. 2,00,000 crore at the group level. At the domestic mutual fund, average assets under management for the quarter has been Rs. 1,35,000 crore, and our overall market share has gone to about 5.53% up from 5.28% last year.

Our profit for this quarter at Rs. 52 crore. And the mutual fund also got the award for the best mutual fund house by CNBC for the last year.

Kotak Prime, an asset book of about Rs. 28,500 crore, clocking a post-tax profit of Rs. 157 crore for the quarter. Healthy capital adequacy at 18.2% and ROA of 2%. And completely sound on asset liability mismatches and pretty healthy on that front also.

Kotak Mahindra Investments, asset book just short of Rs 8,000 crore for the quarter, clocking a profit of Rs. 45 crore, again, capital adequacy at over 20% at the end of the period.

So, those were the broad subsidiary highlights. Open to take questions from you all.

Moderator: Thank you very much. Ladies & gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from IDFC Securities. Please go ahead.

Mahrukh Adajania: Could you throw some light on divestment of promoter stake as to what are you thinking? And if at all you think you would get an extension as you probably already applied to RBI for the same? And secondly, there was not much sequential corporate loan growth, so any comments on that?

Uday Kotak: We have had disclosures to the exchanges sometime in August about the fact that after the issuance of PNCPS that we are engaged with the RBI. So that is where we are right now, nothing further to report at this stage. And, however, if there is something we will of course talk about it.

KVS Manian: Towards the end of the quarter, as you know, there were some serious spike in costs and rates are under pressure, so we manage our short-term loan book slightly downwards during the quarter. But by and large we continue to get 20ish kind of growth rate, I mean, we still are close to 20% kind of growth rate, and that is what the guidance has been.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Amit Premchandani from UTI Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.

Amit Premchandani: Sir, on the 811 initiative, post the Supreme Court ruling on Aadhar what is the current status? And what would be the cost implication for customer acquisition now post that ruling?

Dipak Gupta: Well, like Shanti mentioned, at this point of time with the court’s judgment we have suspended 811i.e. any new acquisition for 811. However, what happened is UIDAI has given some clarification saying that some type of transactions are okay to be continued on the basis of Aadhar. Basically, the DBT and welfare benefits continuing with Aadhar enrolment. And we are working out on some technology solutions to take advantage of that and we will shortly come out with modifications.

Amit Premchandani: And there is no requirement per say for the customers who have already been on-boarded?

Dipak Gupta: At this point of time, no.

Amit Premchandani: And on the loan growth front, while the system loan growth has seen acceleration, from Kotak point of view consol growth has seen some relative slowdown. And you mentioned that you are having excess liquidity. So, why this shift in gears in terms of growth relative to the market?

Uday Kotak: First, if you look at on the bank standalone we have grown at around 21% and we think as we did earlier 20% growth rate, overall, is something at the bank level we are comfortable with. After middle of September we are also beginning to see pricing to improve, especially through September and beyond. Therefore, we see better pricing in what we are doing. And as far as the consol is concerned, keep in mind, if you look at the two places where the growth has been relatively slower, one is car loans; and the second is, as capital markets slow down the demand for financing on the capital markets by the NBFC segment also slow down a bit as we went towards the second half of the year. But overall we continue to guide 20s growth rate for the loan book and hopefully as we go forward we think pricing is getting better.

Amit Premchandani: And finally, do you see the current liquidity environment for NBFCs impacting the real economy as of now, or what are the risks like that?

Uday Kotak: I covered some of this in my opening comments but I want to give a balanced picture. I do believe that the factors which are going to affect the overall economic growth are going to be global macro and with a very high correlation to what happens to the price of oil which I think that is certainly an important factor. Second, as far as the NBFC sector is concerned, I think it was a scorching pace of growth, maybe partly driven by also the market pressures, maybe I think the analyst community also should be more realistic about kind of growth which is sustainable over long period of time, particularly managing risks and ALM along the way.

Therefore, growth has to be managed along with management of risk. So, when the two get disconnected you see the risk of discontinuity, which is probably what you are seeing. The early sense is that both in car demand as well as consumer durable demand in October, so far it is looking a little less enthusiastic then what we would like it to be. But I would say that, frankly, as some of the banks, as long as we get our risk return metrics we are happy to be there available to finance the growth required. And of course, with proper underwriting standards which are the key, therefore that is important, you do not want to see growth in consumer durables, cars and the broader economy, while this proportionate risks are being carried on balance sheets of financial institutions. So, getting that balance right I think is the key.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Manish Karwa from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Manish Karwa: Sir, I just had two questions. First, do you think that the current liquidity challenges which our system is facing will or could eventually lead to some credit issues? Are we there? And if this continues do you think that can lead to credit issue, something especially in housing or real estate?

Uday Kotak: I think we must separate liquidity issues and credit, I mean, obvious thing is, let me just say that if we look at any issue there are really three categories of players i.e. good players, middling players and not so good players. So, highest pressure obviously comes on the third, and normally the biggest beneficiary is the first. What the system and the policy need to ensure is that the middling players sustain their way through this turbulence. And that is where policy and communication of policy in a coordinated manner is extremely critical for the system. But we have to be clear, again, since you are talking about liquidity, one of the issues has been the challenges which the mutual fund industry has faced and it is back to Finance 101 risk management on concentration risk.

Yes, regulator allowed concentration of 40% of a scheme into NBFCs and HFCs into a single mutual fund scheme. But that did not stop from a risk management point of view, and that includes all mutual funds, to have their own risk management guidelines for concentration of risk in a particular sector. And rough and ready, if you look at the three segments between mutual funds, insurance and banking, the concentration risk on NBFCs and HFCs of mutual fund industry is the highest amongst the three categories.

And we all know that open ended mutual funds are like current accounts, therefore if you have a 35% to 40% exposure to paper, and particularly in the case of real estate and housing finance where the tenures are 5, 10 and 15 years and you have open ended mutual fund on the other side, with such a high concentration there is a fundamental risk management issue which needs to be addressed. And it is here that the competitive populism element of investor desire to get 10 basis point higher returns from Fund A versus Fund B, drove funds to take more and more exposure on illiquid paper and forgetting better returns. And from the point of view of ALM of NBFCs, the question you need to ask is, were they competitive because they were borrowing short? Was their pricing of loans consistent with ALM or maturity risk? They may have taken a view that since interest rates are variable and floating I can take the liquidity risk since my interest rate risk is covered by floating rates, but that is where I think the problem is.

There are two kinds of risk in long-term lending, one is interest rate risk and second is fundamental liquidity risk as well. And it is in this two that there has been some disconnect. And I think some moderation in percentage exposures, particularly of the mutual fund industry to the NBFC sector, and it has to be gradual, you cannot allow it to be something which is disruptive, but a gradual reduction in percentage exposure of mutual fund industry to the NBFCs and HFCs is the long-term sustainable answer. And for that, that is why I believe refinance lines from institutions like SBI, which is a good thing, as well as from NHB can help that correction of process. And on a relative basis, I think both insurance companies and banks percentage exposure to NBFCs is pretty much controlled and contained.

Manish Karwa: And just two small questions on the subsidiaries. First on auto loan, growth has been fairly muted for some time, in fact, last six quarters now. Why? And on the securities business with huge volumes, there is a decent market share pick up, but PAT has still declined, is there some one-off provision that we have taken here?

SA Narayan: Let me take car business. Yes, our volumes have come down little bit. We have consciously not gone for growth because we sense the margins on new cars essentially come down. And we always believe on the risk return matrix. So while we have retained our overall presence in a good manner in the market, on our growth, we have curtailed to ensure that our risk return matrix is maintained. As far as the securities firm is concerned, you are right, we have seen a growth in top-line but our profit before tax is on the same line, that is because what has happened is our overall market share in the options market in this quarter has gone up and has resulted in some costs being incurred i.e. the transaction cost and the stamp duty which we incur at the expense level. So that is why it is reflecting, besides we had an ad budget for this year incurred in this quarter also contributing to the expenses.

Moderator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anisha Khandelwal from Edelweiss. Please go ahead.

Kunal Shah: So, firstly, if you look at it maybe in terms of how we have evolved over last three years, so CASA of 50% odd, Tier-I of 17%, much lower asset quality stress, now the system is also looking at risk averseness. Then what is stopping us from growing at a pace higher than the industry average when pricing power is also returning and we could clearly see some gained momentum. So what would stop, I think return matrix definitely we have managed. So still not why grow better than the industry average over last five, seven years what Kotak has seen.

Uday Kotak: We are clearly open at risk return matrix which is appropriate. And keep in mind that some of the stress to the NBFC and the rest of the financial sector came towards the much later half of the last quarter. So what you are seeing in October really began sometime in September. And you saw the first signs of that actually around first or second week of September really beginning to play out. Because this is a very short time in the last quarter when you have seen some of these developments happen. So, we are clearly open as long as we get our risk return matrix we have absolutely no issues in growing faster, while we keep that fundamental discipline in place.

And we will take advantage of opportunity, but keep in mind there is a lot of stuff out there done by different players which you have to question about sustainability of that stuff from a basic underwriting point of view in the first place. Therefore, are we getting the returns for going down so much on the risk curve, that is the question we have to answer? Therefore, if you are going down the risk curve I think pricing of return is important.

But for the first time we are beginning to smell that the risk return matrix is certainly getting much better and more appropriate then it has been, especially for last three years. And you know last three years as a combination of taking greater risk and doing significant ALM mismatch for lower cost of funds was the game played by many players which, therefore, lead to us being pretty disciplined about what we do. But if the marketplace is beginning to price these risks in, and therefore credit spreads are based on pricing that risk in the borrowing market, we think that is a good position for us to be looking at from where we are.

Kunal: Yes, because the competitor dynamics is also now changing in our favor, so that clearly suggests that maybe in terms of outlook is it more in terms of the wider implication of the current liquidity crises which it could have on the economy that is making us worried or we want to preserve capital for some inorganic growth. So, besides these two, is there any other reason why we shouldn’t be growing at much higher than the industry average?

Uday Kotak: First, let me step back and make one point clear, I do not worry about a dramatic systemic risk of the kind which you saw in 2008. I do not see that. I think the problems are broadly manageable. However, I think there is a risk of volatility in the next few weeks and months, therefore any of us believes that there is going to be no volatility, I disagree. What we have to be careful about is that the practices of how the financial sector governs itself meets to be significantly introspected. And that is where I do see challenges for the financial sector, and that is where policy and overall conduct of financial sector players is critical in not making this a broader systemic risk issue. Therefore, the behavior of financial sector players, the approach of policy makers and regulators in handling this transition is critical for us to have, what I would call, a soft landing out of what is otherwise perceived as reasonable volatility. And that is important when I say that I do not see a broader systemic risk, I am assuming that these two corrections will happen in the market place. And subject to that being in place, we are certainly open for risk return matrix, undoubtedly.

Kunal Shah: And secondly, as you highlighted that RBI has taken various measures, so how Kotak would be placed in terms of be it either buying out the portfolios or even in terms of providing the further credit to NBFCs. So how would we be participating in these measures?

Uday Kotak: We are open to buying portfolios; we think that is a good way to find a solution versus disproportionately increasing entity risks, especially of the weaker players. Because in the entity risk for the weaker players, the challenges are unknown, while buying a portfolio it is more knowns.

Kunal Shah: So, any specific segments wherein we would look towards buying the portfolio?

Uday Kotak: I think particularly retail segment, including home loan segment, we are certainly open. We have been looking and we will continue to look at it certainly, and that is something which we are quite open to. And I know Shanti and team out of the retail also are quite eager to look at appropriate portfolios at the right price.

Shanti Ekambaram: Yes, right risk, right price.

Kunal Shah: And lastly, how long do you think that this liquidity situation would continue? So what would be your stance looking at various activities which have been there in the debt market? So, maybe broadly when we look at it in terms of spreads, call rates, they are still likely at a very manageable level. So, do you see these as a near-term issue or do you see it slightly prolonging beyond December?

Uday Kotak: I think it is back to the behavior of individual, retail and HNI customers having monies in mutual funds. And that is where I think the core of this issue is. Therefore, if each of you starts looking at your mutual fund portfolios in the debt schemes, and say these two-three names I am a little worried about and you start pulling out money, then the mutual fund has no choice but to sell.

And especially when you have a concentrated book where 35% to 40% of your book is NBFCs plus HFCs. So the issue which we have to ask ourselves, how do we get mutual funds refinance ability out of that portfolios to be able to handle the ability to manage redemption by individuals based on advisors who start looking at portfolios and get worried. So you have to look at it granularly bottom-up. And this is the marketplace; one of the reasons why we are beginning to see significant liquidity in the bank is because money has moved from elsewhere. So, how do you make sure that this behavior is stemmed, only way you can do it is by the level of percentage ownership of mutual funds in NBFCs and HFCs being steadily moderated to a more reasonable percentage of the total scheme AUM as a percentage?

And one of the questions which we have to ask is, and this goes back to history, until February 2017 the regulatory requirement for mutual funds was 25% NBFCs and 5% housing finance companies. In February 2017 that regulatory limit was increased from 25% per NBFCs and 5% of housing finance was increased to 15%, I mean, I do not want to get into merits or de-merits of it, as a result of which this concentration was further accentuated. Therefore, this needs to be moderated by refinance, by buying of portfolios whereby the NBFCs and HFCs can moderate their dependence on mutual funds and the game was simple. Mutual funds were 100 basis points, 150 basis points cheaper than banks in terms of the pricing at which they were giving money and they were giving more and more short-term money which is what NBFC did. So you need a structural fundamental correction and it is here that policy needs to look at the financial sector more holistically.

The history of Indian policy in the financial sector has always been looked at much more bank led. We now have number of players in this jungle with different animals of different sizes and shapes and risk management and policy management is therefore much more holistically required then what we needed in the past and you have seen a new breed of animals whether it is NBFCs, apparently NBFCs but really into infrastructure or apparently NBFCs, but really into disproportionately into real estate. So all those dichotomies need to be thought through.

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Nakul Gupta from CLSA. Please go ahead.

Prakhar: Just a couple of things I wanted to understand your views, one what is the optimal CASA mix for the bank which you have done fairly well, but CASA growth has been at one end term deposit and borrowings are working in a very divergent way. Term deposits is hardly earlyteens whereas borrowings are growing quite fast, so where does the CASA mix within deposits settles that is one and I will just ask a few follow up questions after that?

Uday Kotak: Fundamentally, my view about the bank is very clear. The bank liability side should be primarily driven by three things i.e. CA of course because it is lower cost, SA and Retail term deposits. Therefore, if there are three things I monitor it is these three things – term deposits below 1 crore, saving account growth, current account and therefore, for me wholesale deposits whether it is in the corporate market or even so-called retail or others are like any other purchase market. For me term deposits below Rs.1 crore is a very crucial aspect of a long-term stability. Therefore, we are seeing very significant growth in term deposits below Rs.1 crore and I have been consistently shading wholesale deposits which is why the mix of term deposits’ gross percentage which you see is not representing the mix change which we are undertaking. The mix change is significantly getting more retailed term deposits compared to wholesale that is point number one. Why should I have a target for CA and SA? Tomorrow, if I can keep on growing that it is much cheaper cost of money than other sources of money. Therefore, why have a target for something which is good. Infact you should be asking me the reverse question i.e. is 50% your floor.

Prakhar: Is it possible to share some numbers on how the mix of term deposits is moving as the direction that you mentioned? What is the share of less than Rs.1 crore term deposit, etc.?

Uday Kotak: I think Jaimin has given you the data on less than Rs.5 crore.

Jaimin Bhatt: So if you look at CASA, it is 50%. If you look at the total deposits and if I just take term deposits as the next 50 close to a high 40s number coming from less than Rs. 1 crore and maybe another of about 10% of the term deposits coming from the Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 5 crore. So we see significant growth coming in less than Rs. 1 crore that it if we look at year-on-year has grown by (+20%).

Prakhar: Secondly few data points questions, one what does the investment provision relate to and what is driving other OPEX spending?

Jaimin Bhatt: The Opex spending is where we have seen growth across segments this time around. So in terms of marketing cost on advertisement if you look at year-on-year it is gone up because last year quarter one we had launched 811 making that a significant expense in quarter one. So quarter two was a subdued number.

Uday Kotak: I am sure you would have seen Ranveer Singh ad. This quarter we relaunched that. And we did not have any inside information.

Jaimin Bhatt: Several cost items which have gone up there are linked to businesses. So a lot of credit card related stuff, POS related stuff, 811 related were significantly higher spends this year compared to what we had last year.

Uday Kotak: 811 was a large front- end acquisition cost, remember that.

Prakhar: That is why sometimes question whether digital is cheap or not?

Uday Kotak: It is not cheap front end but it is ultimately cheap.

Prakhar: And the investment provisions?

Jaimin Bhatt: Investment provisions typically I mean if you look at it is significantly lower than last quarter. Last quarter we had Rs. (+200) crore this quarter it is about Rs. 130 crore which includes largely coming out from fixed interest, but we have also equity led provision which has happened this quarter.

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Roshan C. from ICICI Prudential. Please go ahead.

Roshan C.: Just wanted to understand your view on the SME business. I know this has been covered but my apologies if you can just repeat yourself?

KVS Manian: On the SME business like we have still seen some slippages in the book this quarter as well. So we think like last time last quarter also we said it will take us two quarters to stabilize this. So I think we have at least one more quarter to go to stabilize that business and then we will look for growth in that business.

Uday Kotak: I think the SME business at the smaller end actually is something which Shanti will speak?

Shanti Ekambaram: So the small business which is really across small businesses SME. We continue to see growth, we continue to see demand, some amount maybe because coming from what the banking sector is going through and we continue to see reasonably good trend as far as delinquency, etc., is concerned. So that segment you are seeing growth and it is okay from a risk perspective as of now.

Uday Kotak: And just for clarification, the very small businesses are out of our consumer bank and the rest are run by Manian as a separate arm within the wholesale bank.

Roshan C.: And I presume you see better delinquencies in the smaller SMEs when compared to the one which Manian runs?

Uday Kotak: That is correct.

Roshan C.: And the other question I had is given the tightness of liquidity, do you see this percolating to real estate sector affecting it and therefore more problems going forward?

Uday Kotak: I think real estate sector again if you divide it into three categories within the real estate sector. One is financing against land which I think is probably under the biggest pressure. Second is financing residential particularly anything above mass residential is facing the pressure and commercial is still reasonably okay. I do not think commercial is as bad, but the real pressure is a lot of financing has gone out of the financial sector to finance land and that is where the lot of problems are coming or very high-end residential. So these are the two segments which are continuing to face the challenges and also in many cases there is pre-RERA era construction.

A lot of these developers who have not completed construction on time are now reaching a situation where the projects have become fundamentally unviable and those projects are therefore languishing and it is these things and I think a lot of funding has gone to these companies which is why the stress has been seen in the sector. The commercial side is fine, the mass residential is also still holding up, but the other pieces are what are coloring the environment.

Roshan C.: From a policy standpoint you are alluding to policy measures that can be taken to curtail this crisis from blowing up, now what kind of policy measures are you eluding to when you say this?

Uday Kotak: I mentioned refinance line say for housing finance company from NHB. I think they have given a line of Rs. 6,000 crore incremental. I would recommend a much larger line to finance some of the housing finance companies who have portfolios of reasonable quality and that would ease the pressure because to that extent a lot of the money which has gone from mutual fund can get sorted out and mutual fund in a non-disruptive manner moderate the percentage portfolio exposures they have to housing finance.

Roshan C.: But do you think monetary transmission will happen or will it get choked at the HFCs end as that is also a risk given fear psychosis in the system?

Uday Kotak: As I said that whenever you have friction in the system of the kind you had and friction happens when we let something grow for a while. Therefore, easy money post demonetization, banks dropping the deposit rates, financial saving growing up dramatically, a very high growth of mutual fund AUMs, in addition to equity in the fixed income segment, increase in limit of exposures in February ‘17 to finance companies and HFCs which basically allow the mutual fund to take 40% exposure to this segment and then cheaper money compared to what banks were ready to lend led to a significantly faster growth not matched by very character of an open-ended mutual fund and massive ALM mismatches at the financial institutions’ end. So this is a classic structural issue which has developed over last two years and therefore it needs time to heal.

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Seshadri Sen from Alchemy Capital. Please go ahead.

Seshadri Sen: Firstly, if you could give us some color on the quarter-on-quarter margin decline that you have shown because the loan mix and the liabilities mix seems to have panned out fine, is it because of the rising cost of term deposit and is there a lead lag here, is it likely to bounce back in the second half?

Uday Kotak: My view is, this is a lead lag issue because the base rate versus MCLR as I mentioned in the last call also is MCLR as you mean bulk of your lending is six months MCLR. So when you increase your MCLR for six months which is what our book is bulk of our lending is there. Therefore, assuming I say it is equated over six months it takes an average of three months for the MCLR transmission to move on the entire book. So that transmission period MCLR started moving sometime after April, May and that transmission is now beginning to play out as we talk and we believe that this is a classic lead lag issue unlike base rate where the moment you change base rate it had an impact on the entire book.

Dipak Gupta: Some of it is just simple leverage increase, as the leverage increases your equity saving come down and some of it is impact of that.

Seshadri Sen: Sequentially, that would not have a major impact.

Jaimin Bhatt: There is one technicality on that. There are certain loans which go as a quarter interest and to that extent on the daily basis if you look at quarter one has actually one single day which is higher than what we call quarter two had and that in fact has about if you look at about the 7 days difference that accounts for about half of that.

Seshadri Sen: Secondly, on how are you looking in post the Aadhaar Judgement, etc., are you relooking at your distribution strategy because earlier you had articulated that you would not look at significant expansion in your branch network. Are you revisiting that philosophy and are you also looking at diversifying your branch network little more across the country because at the moment you have a fairly large concentration in the West and South.

Uday Kotak: No, I disagree. Now if you look at our balance we have followed equal across all.

Jaimin Bhatt: The three geographies now almost (+30%) in each look at the Page #24 of the EU. We have got 32 in South, 31 in North and 31 in West.

Uday Kotak: So we are very well balanced. Having said that bottom line is I think we have gone out and said that this year we are adding 100 branches i.e.in 18-19 and we will add more branches than that next year.

Dipak Gupta: Like you mentioned digital will still be a strong part of the acquisition. We should come back with alternate shortly.

Uday Kotak: In my view Aadhar is not dead. Aadhar will be modified and in a manner which meets the requirement of the Supreme Court it will come back.

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Krishnan ASV from SBICAP Securities. Please go ahead.

Krishnan ASV: Just two questions, one is about given the fact that NBFC a lot of them are withdrawing because of their own ALM issues, how much of the NBFC lending is something that banks can actually find fungible that is part one and part two is given that you are now wearing the hat of maybe the key board member at IL&FS. Just want to understand there could be cases when the sum total of the assets may not be quite equal to the liabilities, just wanted to understand your sense of how big that would be?

Shanti Ekambaram: So if we look at the NBFC sector you have broadly seen two trends. One, a lot of home loans and LAP home loans particularly at a smaller end and in different parts of India and the LAP as well-being portfolio which had increased. Suddenly something banks are doing and banks have continued to be in that segment and can step up as far as that is concerned. The second segment has been very aggressive unsecured loans that have been given. I think that is really what you have to look at the risk return and one will have to see how that business pans out, but certainly as far as the retail home loans and some amount of LAP business that can be seen and from a risk return perspective some parts of the unsecured business, but the size of the plate were very large. So to that extent quantum in entirety is what we have to see.

Krishnan ASV: Would it mean to say at about 20% - 30% of the NBFCs withdrawing may actually not be credit worthy? I mean I just wanted to understand your sense, as would that number be at 20%-30% that you should not be touching?

Shanti Ekambaram: No, we are not saying anything like that. I am saying that to that extent in any case is fungible is not an issue.

Uday Kotak: Out of the total NBFC books he is asking whether 20% to 30% is non-touchable that means 70% is touchable, we cannot say that.

Shanti Ekambaram: We cannot say the number like that.

Uday Kotak: On IL&FS we have been communicating through media from time-to-time and all that I will say is that I am humbled by the responsibility which has been put as national duty. All that I can assure you is that the board will do its best to ensure that we preserve value to the extent feasible in the extent of everything that is there and our job is to really to do in a manner which is fair, transparent and meeting the best standards of what I think is good faith governance and however we can do to ensure that the interest of various stakeholders, different stakeholders in the different role is appropriately respected that is the best I can say and rest I am sure the board of IL&FS is fully ceased and we will do our best that is what I can say.

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Nitin Agarwal from Motilal Oswal Securities. Please go ahead.

Nitin Agarwal: So firstly kudos to you for raising red flag on the inflated collateral values being used as a basis for lending. My question is that if I have to connect the current situation to what you had pointed out earlier, do you think there is a danger of a contingent coming in from the real estate sector? I mean if I look at the buyouts of the portfolio happened, some HFCs will be left only with a known unknown which may be difficult to handle. So what is your view on that?

Uday Kotak: As I said there is a two part to this whole thing. One is the part of the balance sheet of institution which is related to the core business and then what part of their balance sheet is not linked to their core business is something which is very difficult for us to answer on an analyst call. And I think the biggest concern which needs to be addressed is a comfort that the noncore balance sheet portfolio for whatever reasons are sitting on balance sheets of institutions that needs to be identified, measured and dealt with rather than letting them festering, uncertainty in the minds of investors that is all I can say.

Nitin Agarwal: Secondly, do we plan to further increase our provisioning coverage and what is the PCR on NPL in the business banking segment now?

Uday Kotak: So if you look at our provisioning coverage we are at 2.15% gross NPA and 0.81 net NPA and quarter-on-quarter you can see that percentage is improving. So along with that you got to keep in mind our SMA-2 is only Rs. 165 crore that means all loans Rs. 5 crore plus more than 60 days old is only Rs. 165 crore in our book and we disclose this every quarter. Therefore, you are going to keep both these things in perspective and finally the stress on the balance sheet is a combination of various things and our provisioning is based on what we think is our estimate of what we will recover. It is not about what we can afford.

Jaimin Bhatt: SME business has normally some collateral, so your LGDs are not normally so bad. So the current coverage seems to be adequate.

Nitin Agarwal: So if you can disclose like the PCR on the business banking segment is it possible?

Dipak Gupta: We don’t calculate it separately, so it is difficult.

Nitin Agarwal: So lastly like if you can share their performance on some of the key matrix on insurance business like margins, what is the business mix like ULIP we have mentioned but amongst the other categories protection power, non-power if you can give that and any adverse economic variance that we might have absorb this quarter?

G. Murlidhar: The unit linked product that share in the total business has come down and it is now 25% and the year ending last year it was 36% and we do not disclose our margins quarter-on-quarter, but our margins will be disclosed only at the end of the year, but it continuous to be robust and our other parameters on quality like persistency and surrenders are been extremely good. So overall, we are in a good tick. On the total term business which you are doing now is 9% on an APE basis.

Uday Kotak: But I think the business mix changes making the overall mix more profitable.

Moderator: The next question is from the line of Nilanjan Karfa from Jeffries. Please go ahead.

Nilanjan Karfa: It is good to hear from you Uday about significant climb down I would think from the risk that you had highlighted for last several quarters now and specifically on the point of this pricing getting better which I understand is primarily because of current crisis and things are probably getting aligned. Could you elaborate within this context therefore, how do you look at your risk adjust at lending spread. Let’s say a year from now on how much improvement do you see so that is one. Second is on the saving or the overall CASA piece should we assume that the entire CASA is less than Rs. 5 crore i.e. whatever disclosure we make in our presentation but does the entire CASA is less than Rs. 5 crore this is second one. Third, I think last quarter we talked about possible two wheeler kind of program that we might have reached as we broached that topic, any thoughts on that and lastly if you could share the movement of nonperforming loans of basic the slippages, upgrades recovery at both the banks as well as the consolidated level those are the four questions.

Uday Kotak: First on the margins I think margins we have to be very careful not to look at margins absolutely. Margins have to be looked at in the context of nature of risk we are undertaking, but for the risk we are taking we think the margins are moving up, but you want to moderate that with the mix which we will run therefore for example nowadays I get scared to say AAA credit therefore I am saying high quality credit. So I am saying high quality credit we are ready to work at lower margin because we believe the risks are lower.

Therefore, two things will determine our final margins. Number one is the mix of our business and number two whether we are getting price for the risk for each segment of that business that is how we are going to look at the overall combined margin ratio. At this stage our sense is it is getting better on a combined basis, but we have to watch, we are going to see the situation if one year from now you say oil is going to be at $30 and the world may be different though it does not look like but I am just saying. Secondly on CASA we are saying term deposits below Rs. 5 crore CASA is the total CA and the SA numbers therefore I just want us to be clear about it.

Nilanjan Karfa: I am sorry will you give out that CASA plus TD less than 5 crore?

Uday Kotak: So it is TD less than Rs. 5 crore. CASA in totality plus TD less than Rs. 5 crore. Two-wheeler we are continuing with our plan and I think Kotak Mahindra Prime has begun that business and we will continue to develop that business, there is no change.

Nilanjan Karfa: The data points on slippages and all those.

Jaimin Bhatt: At the standalone level at the subsidiary honestly there is very little movement. The standalone level we have got slippage of about Rs. 420 odd crore this quarter if we look at the same period last year where we were at about Rs. 550 crore and recoveries upgrades would be maybe Rs. 200 odd crore this quarter.

Nilanjan Karfa: Could you talk about the MFI business?

Uday Kotak: So far looking good.

Moderator: We will take the last question from the line of Bharat from Quest Investment. Please go ahead.

Bharat: Uday, just on this 811 cost of acquisition when we see will be really a turning around and will be more beneficial what timeframe that we look and second we are also talking of converting of this liability in to asset so what are exactly your roadmap in that?

Uday Kotak: I mean 811 acquisition cost as we say is the front-end cost is taken. So 8 to 16 million, 811 plus regular account opening the cost are all in. We think now is a very big opportunity for us to be mining this better and while we navigate our way to the strategy on fresh acquisition on the digital channel which is what we are working on, but independent of that I think there is enough material we have with us in terms of customers for us to be doing significantly more in terms of deepening that relationship. So, while in the short run acquisition cost will drop because of the 811 currently been on hold, but we do not like that as a strategy. We like fundamentally to continue with our growing of acquisition as a core philosophy of what we are, but I think overall, I think 811 we are seeing reasonably good matrix on cross sale and we see deepen even further.

Moderator: I now hand the conference over to Mr. Uday Kotak for closing comments.

Uday Kotak: Thank you very much colleagues and I understand a lot of your questions were on the overall financial sector related concerns and issues. I still believe that with some amount of turbulence and volatility we should be able to navigate our way through this as long as we have significant focus on conduct, governance and how we as a financial sector run our business including in managing risk on the one side and also with support from policy makers and regulators to be able to ensure that this is not a hard landing and with that cautious optimism I look forward to talking to you over the next few quarters. Thank you very much.

Moderator: Ladies and gentlemen on behalf of Kotak Mahindra Bank that concludes this conference call for today. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.",9936,0.30726741202946367

Benchmark indices have gained little over 2 percent in the past one month, especially since the start of September quarter results. But broader markets outperformed frontliners with the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices gaining around 8 percent each.

Attractive valuations, stable earnings from several companies drove the broader indices higher, experts said. But according to them, overall earnings season has been mixed so far, and they expect a downgrade in Nifty EPS estimates for FY19 due to pressure on companies' margins.

""The overall earnings growth trajectory is still subdued and needs at least another quarter of strong performance to validate an earnings revival,"" Sahil Kapoor, Chief Market Strategist, Edelweiss Investment Research told Moneycontrol.

He said banks and financial sector companies have largely reported strong results with encouraging performance from HDFC, Bajaj Finance, and ICICI Bank. ""IT is also having a good quarter with a boost to earnings from international operations as rupee depreciates.""

Vineeta Sharma of Narnolia Financial Advisors said industrial sector companies reported good results while insurance companies came out with better-than-expected growth and management commentary suggests growth will remain intact going forward.

Automobiles and metals reported an in-line set of numbers while FMCG reported volume growth slightly lower than the last quarter but still around low double-digit figures on account of better rural growth, she added.

She feels cement reported worse-than-expected margins on account of elevated power, fuel and freight costs amidst lower capacity utilisation on account of weak volume growth.

Going forward, she believes price growth in Nifty will mostly come through earnings growth while valuation multiple will see continued contraction.

Nifty EPS growth for FY19 after the results are expected to come down from 15 percent to 12 percent, according to Vineeta Sharma.

Here is the list of 15 stocks which saw upgrade in rating from brokerages after July-September quarter earnings. These stocks are could return 10-50% over next one year:

Kotak Mahindra Bank

CLSA has upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'outperform' on reasonable valuations, but has slashed price target to Rs 1,420 from Rs 1,480 implying a potential upside of 25 percent from the last regular trade.

The private sector lender reported healthy growth in core profits, but investment provisions dragged. Its strong CASA and capitalisation will aid market share gains.

CLSA expects pick-up in earnings growth.

Marico

While upgrading the stock to 'outperform' from 'neutral' and raising target price to Rs 376 from Rs 331 per share, Macquarie said reversal in copra cycle & price increase would help boost margins in second half of FY19.

The management is confident of achieving volume guidance.

IRB Infrastructure Developers

Credit Suisse has upgraded IRB Infrastructure to 'neutral' from 'underperform' on sharp fall in share price, but slashed target price to Rs 165 from Rs 220 amid concerns lack of value accretion in several large assets.

Hence, it cut earnings estimates by 6-12 percent for FY19/20.

United Spirits

Morgan Stanley had upgraded the liquor maker to 'overweight' and also increased target price to Rs 700 from Rs 650 per share.

""We see signs of volume growth acceleration. Cost rationalisation and improved efficiency can drive earnings,"" it said.

JSW Steel

Emkay, which has upgraded the stock to 'accumulate' and raised target price to Rs 402 from Rs 352, said headline numbers were better-than-estimates on higher production volumes.

Overseas facilities are stabilised will add value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), going ahead, it feels.

Bharti Airtel

Deutsche Bank has upgraded country's second largest telecom operator to 'buy' from 'hold' with a target price at Rs 425 as stabilisation in India Mobile and Africa continued to improve in Q2FY19.

The lower-than-forecast result is on account of India business, it said. ""We don't believe there has been any material change in competitive landscape.""

It believes balance sheet offers significant headroom to fund $4 billion per year capex programme and forecasts 3-year CAGR in revenue & EBITDA at 8/13 percent.

Adani Ports

Macquarie has upgraded the Adani Group company to 'outperform' from 'neutral' but slashed target to Rs 358 from Rs 383.

The research house raised its earnings estimates by 0-5 percent over FY19-21 and expects growth to normalise in second half of FY19 as the base catches up.

Mindtree

JPMorgan has upgraded its rating on the midcap IT company to 'overweight' with a target price at Rs 1,050 as top client continued to drive company's performance in Q2FY19 and the rest of the business, too, has been growing comfortably at double-digit YoY.

According to the research house, the stock could get to this target of Rs 1,050 with just one strong quarter.

Current price appeared attractive entry for 26 percent potential upside over 9-12 months as it assumed comfortable double-digit percentage growth into FY20.

Mindtree's executable total contract value over 12 months stood at $457 million in first half of FY19, up 26 percent YoY.

However, the risks to its upgrade emanate from being unable to drive growth ex-top client, it said.

HDFC Bank

Equirus has upgraded the stock to 'long' from 'add' and raised target price to Rs 2,340 from Rs 2,320 as it expects total income at 17.4 percent CAGR over FY18-FY21 versus 20.8 percent in FY15-FY18.

The research house has largely maintained its FY19/FY20 estimates, with a 10 bps decline in FY19 NIM. It expects FY19/FY20 advances growth at 23/20 percent.

NIIT Technologies

Credit Suisse has upgraded the software company to 'outperform' from 'neutral' and increased target price to Rs 1,375 from Rs 1,250 as it lifted its earnings estimates by 11-12 percent.

While valuations are not low, upgrade is on better visibility of growth, it said, adding the outstanding order book to be executed in 12 months is 13 percent larger YoY.

The company looked confident of continued growth acceleration, it believes.

Hexaware Technologies

Maybank has upgraded the IT company to 'buy' from 'hold' and has also raised target price to Rs 470 from Rs 440 as it believes fundamentals are improving, backed by rupee depreciation against US dollar.

""We are anticipating catalysts from potential large contract wins and forecast revenue growth of 4.6 percent QoQ in constant currency & 3.8 percent in dollar terms,"" the research house said, adding EBIT margin is expected to improve 120 bps to 15.2 percent.

Colgate Palmolive

CLSA has upgraded the FMCG scrip to 'buy' from 'sell' and increased price target to Rs 1,265 from Rs 1,120 as valuations are at a discount to most peers. It expects current valuations to sustain as outlook improves.

Colgate has increased its growth focus and its promotion activity is at its best, the research house said, adding the worst seems to be over for the company as wholesale is stabilising and competition peeked.

SAIL

Edelweiss has upgraded the state-owned metal company to 'buy' from 'reduce' and also hiked price target to Rs 87 from Rs 70 as it believes that SAIL is a turnaround story with FY18–20 EBITDA CAGR of 35 percent.

Completion of modernisation & expansion plan aided its profitability in the quarter ended September 2019. Cost concerns are receding and are under control, the research house feels.

Greaves Cotton

Kotak Securities said the company's largest revenue segment (i.e. three-wheeler engines business) has been going through a prolonged phase of slowdown due to - 1) shift from diesel to CNG engines, and 2) emergence of electric vehicles. GCL is responding to this challenge by positioning itself as a fuel-agnostic engine maker including electric mobility, it feels.

GCL is currently trading at 13.5x and 12.4x FY19 and FY20 earnings, respectively, which is attractive compared to peers in the capital goods and manufacturing sector, it said.

However, considering the moderate growth profile of the business, we are giving it a lower target PE, Kotak said. ""We now value the stock at 15x FY20E (earlier 16x FY20E), thus arriving at a price target of Rs 146 (Rs 165 earlier). However, due to good upside, we upgrade the stock to buy.""

Sonata Software

Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers said given the recent fall in the stock price, it has upgraded the software company to a 'buy' with new target price of Rs 370 (earlier Rs 380).

Sonata Software's Q2 revenue was $85.9 million (down 16.4 percent QoQ, up 27.5 percent YoY). Its IT services business revenue came at $39.4 million, up 3.3 percent QoQ (constant currency: up 4 perent), 8.1 percent YoY.

The IT products business had $46.6 million revenue, down 28 percent QoQ, up 50.3 percent YoY. The EBITDA margin was 12.5 percent, up 182 bps QoQ, down 34 bps YoY.

Anand Rathi largely retained its FY19e/FY20e earnings and introduced FY21e. Consequently, it moved target multiple to 13.5x FY21e (earlier 15x FY20e).

While investors have been worried about returns amid steep market fall, some promoters have used the opportunity to increase stake in their companies during the September quarter.

Promoters of as many as 74 companies in the S&P BSE 500 index raised their stake in the second quarter. These stocks have fallen up to 80 percent in 2018 and on quarter-to-date basis, data from AceEquity showed.

Companies in which promoters raised their stake include Manpasand Beverages, Infibeam Avenues, HCC, Indiabulls Real Estate, Tata Motors, DB Corp, The India Cements, Dish TV, BPCL, Bharat Electronics, IDFC Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Ashok Buildcon, CEAT, and Punjab National Bank .

Most of the stocks which fell in double digits are small & midcaps. The fact that promoters are betting on their firm is a sign of confidence and after a double-digit fall, the valuations have also come down.

But, does that make them an attractive buy? Maybe not. Investors should do their own research before putting money in stocks which saw a rise in promoter holdings.

“Generally, it is a positive development for an investor but it should be followed by self-research to take an investment call. It usually happens when promoter foresees potential value or future growth in business which is expected to realise in future,” said Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“However, investors shouldn’t fall prey to false information related to value or growth in business, and they must do a diligent study to justify the stance of promoter raising the stake,” he said.

We have a list of 30 stocks out of 74 in which promoters increased their stake in the September quarter:

On the flip side, promoters decreased their holding in 87 companies in the S&P BSE 500 index including 8K Miles, Ajanta Pharma, Axis Bank, Avanti Feeds, Cipla, Cyient, DLF, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Eicher Motors, Kotak Mahindra Bank, JustDial, M&M, MindTree, MOSL, NATCO Pharma, NIIT Tech, Yes Bank, and Wockhardt.

Equity markets around the globe have been under pressure on account of trade war fears, interest rate hike and valuation concerns.

The domestic equity market also declined more than 10 percent from August peak while stocks also eroded a substantial wealth. Investors lost more than 6 lakh crore in terms of market capitalisation on the BSE in October alone.

On BSE, as many as 383 stocks saw a rise in promoter holding for the quarter ended September 2018 including Omkar Speciality (down 86% in 2018), Sintex Plastics (down 68%), and Mcnally Bharat (down 77%).

After hitting record highs in August 2018, benchmark indices have now corrected more than 14 percent triggered by a weak rupee, rising crude oil prices, trade war concerns, FII outflows and high valuations.

“Post this steep price correction in the broader markets, there is certainly value emerging in some the stocks as indicated by their promoters’ activity in the open market,” Soumen Chatterjee, Director- Research, Guiness Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Promoters have raised stake in many beaten-down names signaling that the promoters believe that their stock is trading below its intrinsic value,” he said.

Why do promoters raise stake?

Promoters could raise their stake in the company due to a variety of reasons, but usually, it is done when they find value or the market price is below the intrinsic value, suggest experts.

Analysts advise investors to examine the fundamental health of underlying company in terms of sustainability, earnings growth, exposure towards debt, and consistency of return on equity before putting money in stocks which saw a hike in promoter holding.

“The reason for raising stake by promoter may differ at times but the primary reason is when they find value in business or possibility of a positive turnaround in a future course. Promoters may also carry out this activity to prevent from possible hostile acquisition by other business,” said Rohira of 5nance.com.",650,-0.5629044704967074

JM Financial's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Bank reported a steady operational quarter in 2QFY19 with PPoP for the standalone bank up 21.5% YoY. However, provisions remained slightly elevated in 2QFY19 as the bank continued to shore up its PCR (up 200bps sequentially to 63%), as well as due to elevated MTM provisions on the investments book. As a result, standalone PAT growth was moderate (+15% YoY), although growth in consol. PAT was healthy at 21%. We believe that the reduction in margin for KMB (down 10bps QoQ to 4.2%), could well be transient, as the loan book (predominantly linked to 6-m MCLR) gets re-priced. Management indicated that the outlook for risk-adjusted margins for KMB seems to be positive, driven by a reduction in competitive pressures in certain segments. Growth on the deposit front was strong (+24% YoY), with CASA now at 50%. SA growth was at 36% YoY (despite having grown at 62% in base quarter).

Outlook

We continue to like Kotak for its diversified loan profile, impeccable asset quality and immensely value generating subsidiaries. We maintain BUY with unchanged TP.

ICICI Direct's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s operational performance continued to remain steady. Higher provision impacted earnings growth. NII grew 16.3% YoY at Rs 2689 crore, led by healthy credit offtake at 21.2% YoY to Rs 184940 crore. Margins declined by ~10 bps QoQ at 4.2% Aided by healthy growth in NII and other income, profit prior to provision (PPP) came in at Rs 2095 crore. Provision came in higher at Rs 354 crore, led by provision towards investment at Rs 132 crore. Accordingly, PAT came a tad lower than our estimate at Rs 1142 crore On asset quality, GNPA remained steady at 2.15% (Rs 4033 crore), while NNPA improved ~5 bps QoQ at 0.81% (Rs 1501 crore). SMA2 outstanding declined to Rs 165 cr (0.09% of net advances). IL&FS exposure is in double digit which is not substantial. Exposure to NBFC stands at Rs 13018 crore (5.2% of advances) and Commercial real estate came at Rs 7740 crore (3.1% of advances), of which Rs 3176 crore is Lease Rental Discounting. Traction in advances continued at 21.2% YoY, led by CV, home loan & small business at 40%, 39 & 23% YoY. Deposit accretion picked pace at 24% YoY to Rs 205830 crore with CASA at 50.2% The bank indicated that discussion are been held with RBI seeking approval on NCPS issue to dilute promoter stake.

Outlook

Consistent performance in terms of RoA at 1.7% and RoE of 12-14% provides confidence. Given focus on business growth maintaining risk adjusted returns bodes well in the current scenario. Recent restriction on usage of Adhaar could limit pace of customer acquisition in near term. With non-banking businesses (prime, life insurance and securities business) strong on growth and profitability, value enrichment remains a positive. Therefore, proportion of non-banking business in overall PAT is on the upturn at 35%. Valuing the stock on SOTP, we revise our target price downward to Rs 1400 (Rs1490 earlier). We maintain our BUY rating on the stock. Ambiguity regarding reduction of promoter stake will act as overhang in near term.

Aarti Industries, Reliance, Mindtree and Mphasis are among 8 names that IIFL has chosen as its Diwali picks for this year. In their report, analysts have highlighted the challenges faced by the economy and what lies ahead for the market.

The market returned just 4 percent in the past one year, while mid and smallcap indices plummeted 10 and 15 percent, respectively. Positive returns on the Nifty were largely due to names such as Infosys, TCS, Reliance, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.

“The carnage in mid and small-cap stocks was caused by selling by mutual funds owing to new categorisation of MF schemes, GSM/ASM circular of SEBI, change in equity taxation, etc. In addition, liquidity crisis led by IL&FS default, was extended to other NBFCs, which were already reeling under increasing interest rate environment,” analysts at the firm wrote in their report.

Among factors to look forward to, it listed crude oil prices, widening spread between bond and earnings yields and recent correction in equity valuations.

Here are its top picks for Diwali of 2018.

Aarti Industries | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,517 | Upside: 19.9 percent

Aarti’s business model is backed by presence across the value chain (final & intermediate products) and strong base in export markets (48% of FY18 revenue). We expect volume growth of 12-15% over FY18-20E.

The company’s multi-year project (10-years and 20-years supply contract) wins worth Rs 14,000 crore provides long-term visibility to generate robust earnings

Also, Aarti being a net exporter (26% of FY18 revenue), is a beneficiary in the rupee depreciation scenario. However, benefits of rupee weakness will flow through in FY20E, after the existing hedges roll off. We expect revenue CAGR of 18% with EBITDA margin expansion by 140bps and PAT CAGR of 24% over FY18-20E.

Biocon | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 768 | Upside: 19.3 percent.

It said that Biocon/Mylan had received USFDA approvals for Trastuzumab (Ogivri)/Pegfilgrastim (Fulphila) in US and Insulin Glargine (Semglee) in Europe. Ogivri and Fulphila are expected to be launched in Europe over next few months following recent positive CHMP opinion. Fulphila has been launched in US in Q2FY19, while Ogivri launch is expected in H2FY19E

“Biocon’s research subsidiary, Syngene, has tailwinds like rupee depreciation and rising penetration of R&D outsourcing in pharmaceutical R&D spend. Syngene’s revenue/PAT is expected to grow at 27%/30% CAGR over FY18-20E on the back of new client additions, foray in API manufacturing and strong outlook on biologics,” analysts wrote in the report.

Kotak Mahindra Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,380 | Upside: 17.2 percent

The lender continues to be at the forefront of gaining market share in its key businesses. Subsidiaries’ contribution could increase to 40% of consolidated net profit by FY20 (36% in Q1FY19).

The bank would continue to benefit from market share gains and superior profitability & capitalisation against its peers, the brokerage house said.

MindTree | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,081 | Upside: 34.2 percent

In its view, the correction has factored in concerns related to recent softness/macros and reckon that Mindtree is likely to outperform peers like L&T Infotech, Mphasis and Hexaware. Our belief is based on the company’s strong digital capabilities, which resonates well with clients, resulting in higher digital deal sizes

The view is also based on the fact that its large client (in Top 10) issues have bottomed out. Its Top, Top-5 and Top-10 clients have added 50% of the incremental revenues over the past eight quarters. “Led by high growth in top clients, we expect overall revenue CAGR of 23% and EBITDA margin improvement of 300 bps (FY18-20).”

Mphasis | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,328 | Upside: 29.8 percent

The brokerage house said that significant deal wins in new-gen services (across accounts and new clients) provide good revenue visibility and hence, it expects direct core USD revenue CAGR of 14% over FY18-20.

“We project overall revenue and PAT CAGR of 17% and 23% respectively with margins improving by 200 bps over FY18-20 to 18.3%,” the report further added.

Motherson Sumi Systems | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 293 | Upside: 20 percent

The brokerage is set to achieve FY20 revenue target of USD 18 billion (USD 10 billion FY18) via combination of organic (USD 12-13 billion revenues) and inorganic (USD 5-6 billion) initiatives. At the current market price, the stock trades at 15x FY20E EPS (35% discount to average 10-yr forward PE).

“We believe the recent correction is overdone (30% over past 6 months). We expect consolidated revenue, EBITDA and PAT to register 16%, 29% and 47% CAGR respectively over FY18-20.”

Petronet LNG | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 256 | Upside: 20 percent

Petronet LNG is set to benefit from 17% capacity expansion at Dahej terminal to 17.5 MMT by FY19 from current 15 MMT. It expects this to aid incremental Dahej volumes of 48 TBTU to 864 TBTU by FY20.

Company does not face the risk of upcoming competition as almost 100% of PLNG’s capacity has use-or-pay contracts along with the competitive tariffs. We expect revenue and PAT CAGR of 16% and 19% over FY18-20 respectively

Reliance Industries | Rating: Buy | Target: 1,310 | Upside: 25 percent

Reliance Industries is expected to witness improvement in petrochemicals segment with refinery off-gas cracker (ROGC) being commissioned and strong polyester & fiber intermediates demand.

The company’s largest petcoke gasification unit at Jamnagar is under commissioning, which is expected to bring full benefit of bottom-of-the-barrel conversion to its refining business. This is likely to improve GRM by up to $2/bbl gradually over FY19E-21E.

JIO continues to surprise with robust subscriber additions and steady improvement in profitability. We estimate steady state revenue market share (RMS) of 43% for Jio.

Dolat Capital's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak reported a stable quarter with a PAT growth of 15% (S) and 21% (C) backed by advances growth of 21% (S) and 18% (C) and aided by lower provisions. The cost did inch up in part due to front-ended digital costs. NIMs contracted marginally by 10 bps sequentially largely due to lag effect in costs pass through. Vehicles, mortgages and unsecured personal loans have grown at a robust 40%, 23% and 39% respectively outpacing the corporate book growth of 19%. Caution on business banking remain growing at a mere 3% YoY. On a consolidated basis, the insurance business cheered the overall performance but the capital markets and Prime remained a laggard due to slower financial market activity and weakness in passenger vehicle segment respectively.

Outlook

Kotak is preferred as our safe bet for its conservative, proactive management with higher ability to price risk, tighten belts and survive turmoil relatively unharmed. The overhang of significant increase in free float is likely to cap the upside. Timeline extension is a monitorable. The standalone business is likely to contribute ~60% in the medium term.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB's s'lone earnings was largely in-line with expectations with PAT at Rs11.4bn (PLe: Rs11.8bn) but operating pressure felt some pressure as NII growth was slower and higher other opex offset better other income. Loan growth continued to be across segments except business banking, while deposit traction especially CASA was good. On Subs, capital market businesses were soft, while financial services businesses were seen with steady trends.

Outlook

Post our downgrade in Jul'18 to ""Hold"" stock has seen correction of 12% and currently trades at 3.3-3.4x core book which is still premium/at par peers and promoter stake stance still remains unclear and hence we retain HOLD rating with revised TP of Rs1,291 based 3.2x Sep-20 lending book and SOTP for subs. Better liability profile, good loan growth and steady asset quality remain key catalyst for higher valuations.

Brokerage houses highlighted that Kotak Mahindra Bank’s Q2 show was healthy, but the uncertainty around its dilution of promoter stake remains an uncertain element for the stock.

The private sector lender reported 14.82 percent on year growth in second quarter profit to Rs 1,141.65 crore, driven by NII, operating and other income. However, higher provisions YoY limited profitability.

Profit in corresponding period last fiscal stood at Rs 994.31 crore.

Brokerage CLSA | Rating: Upgraded to Buy | Target: Cut to Rs 1,420

CLSA said that there was healthy growth in core profits, but investment provisions drag. Strong CASA and capitalisation to aid share gains going ahead. It also expects pick-up in earnings growth and valuations are reasonable for a buy call.

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,230

Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Equalweight | Target: Rs 1,365

Brokerage: Axis Cap | Rating: Hold | Target Rs 1,250

Axis Capital said that the bank has not shied away in sacrificing profitability for long term advantages. Promoter stake dilution remains the near-term overhang. It also said that business growth is robust with loans up 21% YoY & deposits higher 24% YoY.

Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Hold | Target: Cut to Rs 1,080

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank is likely to report double-digit growth in net profit, net interest income, advances as well as deposits with stable asset quality for the quarter ended September 2018.

The stock fell 14.8 percent during July-September period amid weak market condition, but rallied 16.7 percent year-to-date on stable asset quality and earnings growth.

Profit

Brokerage houses expect profit growth in the range of 14-20 percent for the quarter YoY, driven by strong net interest income, other income and operating income. However, higher provisions may limit growth.

While expecting steady performance on both growth as well as asset quality, ICICI Securities said profit growth is likely to be around 20 percent. (Healthy traction in NII and other income may lead to pre-provisioning operating profit growth of 22 percent YoY.""

Prabhudas Lilladher, which expects profit growth of 19.2 percent, said operating profit will benefit from lower operating cost.

Motilal Oswal expects profit growth of around 13.6 percent. ""We factor in other income growth of 24 percent in Q2, driven mostly by healthy fee traction and expect an improving trend in the coming quarters.""

Net Interest Income

According to brokerage houses, net interest income growth year-on-year could be in the range of 13-18 percent with strong loan growth.

ICICI Securities expects NII to grow 17.2 percent with advances growth at around 22 percent YoY led by retail and small business.

Prabhudas Lilladher sees NII growth at 18.4 percent but should lag slightly as higher bond yields will hit. ""Kotak Bank should continue show case strong loan growth of 20-25 percent led by both retail and corporate.""

Motilal Oswal expects the standalone bank to report around 22 percent loan growth and around 20 percent deposit growth in Q2FY19, with NII growth of 13 percent YoY. CASA retention would be a key driver of NII and NIM, it feels.

Asset Quality

Overall research firms feel the asset quality is expected to be stable for the quarter.

""We expect asset quality to remain stable, with gross non-performing assets (NPA) at around 2.1 percent and net NPA at 0.8 percent, led by a high provision coverage ratio,"" Motilal Oswal said

Axis Capital also said it does not expect any negative surprises on asset quality front.

On the provisions front, Prabhudas Lilladher expects 69 percent YoY increase and 22 percent QoQ decline while Nomura sees 74 percent rise YoY and 20 percent fall sequentially.

> Guidance on balance sheet growth and trend in customer acquisition

> Performance on CASA, fees and growth

> GNPAs in the MSME segment

> Management commentary on key subsidiaries will be keenly watched.

> Management's view on SME/retail demand and incremental margin trend will be keenly watched.

The pace of opening new bank branches has come down since the last two-three years thanks to the rise in digital transactions, a top official of Kotak Mahindra Bank said.

Over 85 percent of the bank's transactions take place in digital mode, its Joint Managing Director Dipak Gupta said.

""...But, nationally,we will continue opening branches. But it is not at the same pace as it was let's say two years, three years back. Because, a lot of customer acquisition today happens digitally,"" he told PTI.

The presence of branches is still important, but it is not as important as it was two-three years back, he said.

Branch presence, Gupta said, is required for trade customers who still deal a lot in cash and for retail ones who want to see a physical place to ""get comfort, trust"".

""For trade customers, what we call commercial customers, you still need physical branches. So you have to open physical branches for trade customers. But retail customers, less and less physical branches,"" he said.

The government’s decision to appoint GN Bajpai on the new seven-member board of debt-laden Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) is being questioned by proxy advisory firms, reports Mint.

This is because the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) had flagged a case of conflict of interest against Bajpai when he was an independent director on the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines’ board.

The firm run by Bajpai had received payments for services to the Vijay Mallya-promoted airline when he was on its board. He resigned from his post in January 2012, just before trouble started brewing at the airline.

JN Gupta, co-founder of Stakeholder Empowerment Services, blamed the government for having a short memory since Bajpai has been associated with companies with questionable corporate practices.

On October 1, the government superseded the board of IL&FS and appointed a board led by Uday Kotak, Managing Director and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The decision to appoint an active banker on the board also raised speculation, but it died down as specific information about KMB’s lending to IL&FS is not known, the report said.

In the case of KMB, it is 'too fine too far', since the bank’s exposure to IL&FS’s Rs 91,000 crore debt is negligible, Gupta told the paper.

63 Moons Technologies is another company Bajpai has worked with, which was under the radar of regulatory authorities. “The government knows what happened in Kingfisher Airlines and about Bajpai. But it seems those developments happened years back and so nobody wants to look back at your past when forming committees,” Gupta added.

The head of another proxy advisory firm questioned if Kotak and Bajpai were the most suitable to fill the posts on IL&FS board. “It looks like the government wants to get someone who can roll up his sleeves and get the work done. So, no one better than a banker like Kotak. Sure the government could have looked at other retired banking executives.”

Currently, the board includes GC Chaturvedi, Chairman of ICICI Bank, former bureaucrats Vineet Nayyar, Malini Shankar, Nand Kishore and CS Rajan, who was appointed on October 3.",359,-0.7830738127231598

Bandhan Bank, the youngest bank in India, attracted the regulator’s ire for non-complying with shareholding norms last week. Since the bank was not able to pare down the promoter’s shareholding to 40 percent as required under licencing conditions, the Reserve Bank withdrew its general permission to open new branches. The regulator also ordered freezing the remuneration of the bank's MD and CEO at the existing level till further notice.

The bank along with IDFC were the only two entities to be granted a banking licence by RBI in 2014. Accordingly, the microfinance company got converted into a full-fledged universal bank distinct from small finance banks (SFBs) and commenced operations on August 23, 2015.

Bandhan Financial Holdings (BFHL) is non-operative financial holding company (NOFHC) and acts as the promoting company for Bandhan Bank. The bank went in for an initial public offering (IPO) in March, after which its promoter holding fell to 82.28 percent from 89.62 percent.

The licencing norms require a bank to pare down its promoter holding to 40 percent within three years of starting operations, which ended on August 23 for Bandhan. Thereafter, banks are required to reduce their shareholding to 20 percent and 15 percent within 10 years and 12 years, respectively.

So, the question is what made Bandhan Bank sleep over the matter?

Dilemma or wilful ignorance?Seems that Bandhan Bank got entangled between the conflicting regulations of two regulators: Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and RBI.

As per SEBI rules, promoters have a mandatory one year lock-in period after the IPO. Since Bandhan Bank listed in March, promoters cannot sell shares till March next year as per SEBI’s rule. But this puts the bank in a tight spot as the promoter has to sell 42.28 percent stake to fulfil RBI’s licencing requirement. This one has turned out to be a curious case of overlapping regulations.

Bandhan Bank’s dilly dallying over the known requirement is surprising. Looks like the bank too tried its luck just like Kotak Mahindra Bank. While KMB tried using a very innovative way to avoid the equity dilution, Bandhan Bank displayed a wilful ignorance of clashing regulations to defer the dilution. But RBI’s message was very clear and consistent in both these cases. Earlier this year, it turned down KMB’s plan to dilute promoter shareholding by issuing perpetual non-cumulative preference shares. And now it has pulled Bandhan Bank over the same regulatory requirement.

Understanding Bandhan Bank’s holding structureIn all fairness to Bandhan Bank, though BFHL’s holding (82 percent stake) appears concentrated, underneath it is a well-diversified. Bandhan Financial Services (BFSL), which is the parent company of BFHL, is widely held. The shareholders of its holding company are the two trusts (set-up for the underprivileged) and institutional investors like International Finance Corporation, Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), among others. The current CEO and MD, Ghosh, who is also the promoter, holds a minuscule stake (around 2 percent) and that too through the employee welfare trust. In essence, high promoter holding is an optical illusion. It is actually widely spread out, but entangled.

While we feel RBI is being too stringent with Bandhan Bank, it wants to set a strong precedent.

What’s the way ahead for the bank?There are multiple ways through which the bank can comply with the regulations. It can consider change in the holding company structure or redefine promoter entities. For instance, one of the proposals being studied is the merger of the holding company (BFHL) with the bank. Giving shares of the bank to shareholders in exchange of their holding in BFHL would lower the promoter holding.

But this will require an active engagement and permission from RBI. Note that one of the guidelines for licencing of new private sector banks requires promoter to hold the bank through an NOFHC. Though dissolving the holding company structure could help achieve the objective, it will not be in true spirit of regulations. We guess Bandhan Bank will not like to circumvent the regulation but rather comply with it. Else, similar to KMB, it could end up with an embarrassment as RBI seems in no mood of going easy.

The most prominent option that lies before the bank is the inorganic route. As per media reports, Bandhan Bank explored acquiring PNB Housing Finance so that it could reduce its promoter holding but failed to conclude the deal. The management said it is open to an acquisition in the micro finance, affordable housing and micro, small and medium enterprise space.

What does this mean for investors?As per the management, the restriction on branch opening will not impact its growth. The bank can continue to open branches with prior approval from RBI. Bandhan Bank had planned to open 1,000 branches by March next year and has 937 branches as of June-end. The maturing of current branches can cover growth for the next 2-3 years.

The biggest concern for an investor is that acting under pressure Bandhan Bank may end up acquiring an unrelated business or cough out valuation that turns out to be difficult to digest.

In a knee-jerk reaction, the stock price nosedived following RBI’s order. Though we don’t foresee any big challenge to the regular pace of its growth, the regulatory requirement of lowering the promoter holding will remain an overhang on the stock. We don’t expect a sustainable up move in the stock price and would like to wait for the next board meeting on October 10 for further updates.

There is an indirect but an important takeaway for investors from restrictions placed on Bandhan Bank.

RBI had granted a five-year extension to Uday Kotak, MD of KMB, over the original deadline of March 31, 2015. As per RBI’s rules, KMB has to lower the promoter holding to less than 20 percent by December and 15 percent by March 2020. Kotak currently holds around 30 percent stake in the bank.

The banking space is ripe for some large M&As due to RBI’s licensing requirement. Stocks of private banks, wherein the promoter needs to reduce its holdings, could be set for a wild ride. Investors need to tread water carefully.

India's burgeoning shadow finance sector is likely to face a shake-up after defaults at one major lender battered the nation's financial markets in the past week and reinforced worries about credit risk.

Industry officials and experts say they expect Indian regulators to cancel the licences of as many as 1,500 smaller non-banking finance companies because they don't have adequate capital, and to also make it more difficult for new applicants to get approval.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has been tightening rules for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), did not respond to requests for comment.

Better capitalised and more conservatively run finance firms are likely to swallow up an increasing number of smaller rivals, the experts said. That could make it difficult for many small borrowers to get loans, especially in the countryside where two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live, and put the brakes on a surge in private consumption with a knock-on effect on growth.

Infrastructure Financing and Leasing Services Ltd (IL&FS), a major infrastructure financing and construction company, sent shockwaves through the NBFC sector when it defaulted on some of its debt obligations in recent weeks.

Then last Friday, a large fund manager sold short-term bonds issued by home loan provider Dewan Housing Finance at a sharp discount, raising fears of wider liquidity problems.

""The way things are unfolding, there is certainly cause for concern and the sector could see consolidation,"" said Harun Rashid Khan, a former deputy governor at the RBI and now a non-executive chairman at Bandhan Bank Ltd, formerly a microfinance company specialising in small-value loans.

""The whole issue is they have to take care of their asset-liability mismatch,"" Khan said in reference to concerns that some of the firms have borrowed short-term when their revenue streams are longer-term.

The spotlight has now been turned on thousands of ""high-risk"" small players dominating lending in villages and towns.

The shadow banking sector now comprises more than 11,400 firms with a combined balance-sheet worth 22.1 trillion rupees ($304 billion), and is less strictly regulated than banks. It has been attracting new investors, particularly as the nation's banks have had to slow their lending as they seek to work through $150 billion of stressed assets.

The NBFC loan books have grown at nearly twice the pace of banks, and the cream of them, including IL&FS, had received top credit ratings.

Those credit ratings are now being called into question - IL&FS has suffered a series of downgrades in recent months - and there are growing concerns that many of these firms took on excessive credit risk by lending to people with little means of paying them back. There are also growing questions about whether lax regulation has allowed some of these firms to be used for money laundering.

WINNOWING OUT

Rising borrowing costs, exacerbated by the turmoil in markets in recent days, will lead to a credit crunch in the sector and make it difficult for firms that aren't well capitalised to survive, according to top investors in the sector.

""Smaller NBFCs will face the problem of cost, their quantum of liquidity may not be the same as they are getting now. But medium and large-sized NBFCs should be able to achieve their volume as well as access to funds,"" said Rajesh Sharma, owner of Capri Global Capital, an NBFC that had a loan book of 12.5 billion rupees ($172 million) in the last fiscal year.

He added that in the absence of any financial incentive for NBFCs from the government, those who ""can't manage their portfolio performance will perish"".

The RBI has already been cancelling licences of those who do not have a minimum capital base of 20 million rupees ($275,330).

""RBI has issued show-cause notices, given them time and is now in the process of cancelling their registration. Ultimately up to 1,500 should go out,"" said Raman Aggarwal, chairman of Finance Industry Development Council, an industry body.

At the same time, Aggarwal said the central bank is ""flooded"" with hundreds of new applications to set up NBFCs.

He denied there was any wider asset-liability mismatch in the sector. But bankers and former central bank officials said the scrutiny will be higher for newer players now that ""asset-liability mismatches have magnified among existing NBFCs"".

Nearly 11,000 of India's NBFCs are small and medium-sized businesses with an asset base of less than 5 billion rupees. But the top 400, many of which are backed by banks and finance companies, control about 90 percent of the assets under management, Aggarwal said.

""NOT RIGID""

NBFCs have been differentiating themselves from banks by forming personal relations with customers despite charging up to 2 percentage points higher interest, said Aggarwal.

""They know the local market dynamics, they understand the local economics, so you can take a credit call based on the first few minutes of discussion with the borrower,"" he said.

Unlike banks, NBFCs are ""not rigid"" and lend to even those borrowers who may never had a bank account, credit history or tangible assets, Aggarwal said. That could include someone buying a motorised rickshaw or setting up a small restaurant.

Analysts say the current uncertainty in the market will mean NBFCs with financially strong backers such as LIC Housing Finance Ltd, Power Finance Corp, Rural Electrification Corp, Bajaj Finance and Cholamandalam Investment and Finance will stand out.

And there is set to be an acceleration in deals, they said.

Over the past two years, IDFC Bank has bought Grama Vidiyal Micro Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank bought BSS Microfinance, RBL Bank took over Swadhaar Finance while IndusInd Bank has announced the acquisition of Bharath Financial Inclusion.

""There should be some consolidation in the market and regulation,"" said S.S. Mundra, a former RBI deputy governor who is now on the board of Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd, a home loan provider.

""That would be good for the system in the long run.",990,-0.3101771831512451

KR Choksey's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

The Indian financial services space was always inhabited by a few visionary groups for whom demonetisation was a boon and the event only accelerated their agenda of financialization. One such visionary group is Kotak which offers financial products across the board – credit, deposits, wealth management, broking, life insurance, general insurance, investment banking, asset management, auto loans. With such a vast array of products in its kitty, the opportunity to cross-sell across the group is large. For example, 50% volume for life and general insurance comes from Kotak’s own distribution network. In this note, Decoding Kotak, we have tried to dissect each of the main subsidiaries that we believe will continue to grow larger and will be instrumental in driving synergy benefits and cross-sell opportunities as well as improving profitability level at the group level. While 811 continues to be the bank’s strategy to acquire customers, our recent interaction with the bank makes us believe strategies at each of the subsidiaries too are at play in full-force. We also believe that each business has (a) certain trigger(s) that will unfold gradually over time. As a group, Kotak has enough management bandwidth and a highly qualified and skilled bench to execute its evolution and ride the Indian financialization wave. Based on our SoTP, KMBL trades at 3.7x its FY20E consolidated book value. Given the opportunity and KMBL’s quality and pedigree, we believe it will be a steady compounder.

Outlook

Our estimates suggest the bank is currently trading at 3.7x FY20E consol. BV and our SoTP valuation implies a 4.5x P/BV. The bank is currently trading 4.6x its trailing book BV which is 13% higher than the average over the last 5 years. We are estimating a consolidated PAT CAGR of 23% over FY19/20E and BV CAGR of 14%. We maintain BUY (TP = INR 1,544).

Kotak Mahindra Bank plans to open over 100 branches to take the network to 1,500 from the existing 1,391 by the end of the current fiscal, a senior official said here today.

The bank's senior executive president, Puneet Kapoor said they are in the process of setting up a branch in Dubai International Financial Centre.

""We have now 1,391 branches as of June 2018 and supported by 2,231 ATMs... by March 2019-end we should be closer to 1,500 branches. In the current network of branches we have 45 per cent in metros, 21 per cent in urban and 34 per cent in semi-urban and rural,"" he said.

As per RBI's regulation if one branch is opened in urban or metro area one branch has to be set up in semi-urban or rural area and the bank is following the same matrix, Kapoor said.

Kotak will continue to expand its branch network across India using a dual strategy- a hub and spoke model in locations where the bank is already present, he said.

It is also expanding physical footprint in locations where the bank has received many requests to open an 811 account but where they do not have branches as yet, he added.

Kapoor said the bank is present in many countries not as banking entity bus as a financial institutions serving Indian investors in those countries.

""We have today in principle approval to set up a branch in Dubai. We have a representative office there already. We have approval to set up a branch in DIFC. So we are in the process of setting up a branch in DIFC,"" the banker added.

According to him Kotak Mahindra Bank has grown its customer base from eight million in March 2017 to 14.5 million as of June 2018 after the launch of ""811-Indias first downloadable digital bank account.

Kapoor said last year the advances grew to Rs 1.76 lakh crore from Rs 1.42 lakh crore in FY 17.

Kotak primarily has mix of 33 per cent corporate banking and 19 per cent mortgage portfolio.

Replying to a query, he said the bank expects 20 per cent growth in advances this fiscal.",394,0.3761979142824809

Kotak Mahindra Bank's preferential issue does not meet the dilution norms, the Reserve Bank of India has said.

Under the norms of the licence given to the bank, the Founder and Promoter Uday Kotak was to reduce his stake in the bank to 20 percent by 2019 and 15 percent by 2020.

In adherence to the licence conditions Kotak, two weeks ago, expanded his paid-up capital by issuing 52 percent more perpetual non-convertible preference shares. While this effectively brought down his share in the paid-up capital from 30 percent to a little under 20 percent, questions were raised if the preference issue circumvented RBI rules on stake dilution.

While preference shares are mid-way between debt and equity, perpetual preference shares are closer to equity 3. Basel rules recognise perpetual preference shares as tier 1 capital.

Legal experts said Kotak is legally right in doing so since his licence conditions require him to cut his share in the paid-up capital not in the number of voting shares. However, others argued the intent of RBI’s rules were to ensure a promoter’s stake is brought down as a percentage of “voting shares”.

In an exchange filing, Kotak Mahindra Bank said it continues to believe it has met the central bank's requirement and that it will engage with RBI on the matter.",230,

Uday Kotak, the founder and promoter of Kotak Mahindra Bank, has bowled a googly. Under the licence the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) gave him, he was bound to reduce his stake in the bank to 20 percent by 2019 and 15 percent by 2020. The 15 percent rule has support from other RBI press notes.

Guidelines on ownership and shareholding issued by RBI February 2013 and tweaked in May 2016, mandate that voting rights of promoters shall be capped at 15 percent.

In adherence to his licence conditions Kotak, last week expanded his paid-up capital by issuing 52 percent more perpetual non-convertible preference shares. Effectively this brought down his share in the paid-up capital from 30 percent to a shade under 20 percent. Legal eagles say Kotak is legally right. His licence conditions require him to cut his share in the paid-up capital not in the number of voting shares and so Kotak is kosher.

Here are the arguments in favour of Kotak’s plan:





Kotak Bank’s licence conditions, we are told, don’t refer to voting shares at all. They only require him to cut his stake as a percentage of paid up capital.



While preference shares are mid-way between debt and equity, perpetual preference shares are closer to equity 3. Basel rules also recognise perpetual preference shares as tier 1 capital.



Whether explicitly mentioned or not the intent of RBI’s rules were always to ensure that a promoter’s stake is brought down as a percentage of “voting shares”. The February 2013 and the May 2016 guidelines repeatedly refer to voting equity capital (February 2013) or to shareholding/voting rights (May 2016).

This leads one to believe that RBI’s intent all along has been that no single promoter should be allowed to have voting shares beyond 15 percent. Promoters of new banks are given time but ultimately they should reduce equity, shareholding and control to 15 percent. This appears to have been the RBI’s intent all along.

First, let us be clear, neither RBI nor Uday Kotak is violating any law. The Banking Regulation Act merely states that no one shall own more than 5 percent in a bank, except with RBI permission. And it is in the exercise of this power that RBI has been granting licences to several promoters and allowing them to hold even 51 percent stake for starters.

What is apparently violated is an RBI assumption that banks ought to be widely held so that no promoter or single entity can use deposits collected from savers to serve their relatives, friends or cronies. The underlying assumption is that a bank that is widely held will be professionally run.

The point is recent events have shown that this assumption may not often be correct. A widely held ICICI bank has been found to grant allegedly “conflicted” loans while the closely held Kotak Bank appears to be a squeaky clean bank. This reality has brought forth several responses. One set, like HR Khan, believe the assumption that wide distribution of ownership and control will prevent conflicted loans needs to be reviewed.

Promoters with higher stakes have more skin in the game and will hence run banks well. So the May 2016 and the Feb 2013 guidelines need to be reworked. (In fact both in 1995 and in 2003 when licences were granted to private parties RBI insisted that the promoters’ stake is locked in at 40 percent for 12 years precisely because it believed promoters with skin in the game will run their banks better).

The second set of experts believe an old rule must not be set aside summarily. RBI put in those shareholding caps with a reason. Will one want a Ramesh Gelli kind of promoter to have 40 percent ownership or for that matter a Tayal of Bank of Rajasthan fame? Bank licences today are available on tap and we must make rules for all time, not just for outstanding bankers like Uday Kotak.

A third set believes no rule needs to be changed. RBI must allow those promoters to bring down their share in the paid-up capital but allow them a larger control of voting shares provided they pass RBI’s “fit and proper” test and everyone will agree that Uday Kotak is one banker who passes this test with distinction.

There is another reason why Kotak should be permitted to maintain control. Most Indian private banks are increasingly held by foreigners and this isn’t a healthy development from a national perspective. Assuming there comes a time when FIIs want to flee Ems for some external reasons, these foreign funds can quit in a hurry and remain away for years. From a financial stability perspective, it may make sense to allow the likes of Kotak a larger stake in banks.

All these arguments have a point and that is why Uday Kotak’s googly leaves the regulator in a dharamsankat. RBI cannot ignore Kotak’s outstanding credentials but it can’t make rules assuming all bank promoters will be outstanding. There is no denying Uday Kotak’s preference issue amounts to circumventing RBI rules. Should the regulator allow itself to be dodged by a regulatee, however outstanding?

May be one way out for the RBI is to disallow the current issue to be treated as kosher, but give Kotak more time to bring down his stake. The market may not be able to absorb the 25,000 odd crore rupees of shares that Kotak will have to sell. In the meanwhile , RBI may amend the May 2016 circular to allow promoters who meet its “fit and proper” test to hold more voting shares.

There is no doubt it will be a right decision to allow Kotak more control over his bank, but one must not do the right thing in the wrong way.",975,0.8688836693763733

Uday Kotak, the founder and promoter of Kotak Mahindra Bank, has pared down his stake in the bank to 19.70 percent from about 30 percent following issuance of preference shares. The stake dilution of the promoter is in line with RBI's directive.

The bank has ""approved the allotment of 100,00,00,000 Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) to eligible investors at the issue price of Rs 5 per PNCPS, aggregating to Rs 500 crore pursuant to the issue,"" Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a BSE filing.

Subsequent to this issue, the paid-up capital of the bank has increased from Rs 953.16 crore to Rs 1,453.16 crore and the promoter holding is 19.70 per cent of the paid-up capital, it said.

Kotak's holding in the bank prior to the preference share issuance was 29.74 per cent.

The preference shares have been issued through private placement. The promoters' position in terms of voting rights will remain the same as earlier as banking laws cap voting rights at 15 per cent, irrespective of shareholding.

RBI had earlier asked promoters of Kotak Mahindra Bank to bring down their stake to 20 per cent by December 2018 and 15 per cent by March 2020 in line with the guidelines for new bank licences released four years ago.

Kotak had previously sold his stake in May last year. He sold 1.8 crore shares of the bank for a little over Rs 1,687 crore resulting in dilution of his stake to 29.74 per cent.",259,

Kotak Mahindra Bank will raise up to Rs 500 crore by issuing preference shares on a private placement basis. The Non-Convertible Preference Shares (NCPS) Issuance Committee of the board of directors of the bank today resolved to approved the issue of perpetual non-cumulative preference shares (PNCPS) on a private placement basis aggregating to an issue size of up to Rs 500 crore, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a regulatory filing.

The PNCPS will offer the allottees a fixed dividend of 8.10 per cent.

The funds are to be utilised to boost the capital under Basel III norms which are to be adopted fully by Indian banks by March 2019.

As per the norms, banks are required to shore up their capital adequacy ratios and maintain equity capital at 7 per cent of risk-weighted assets.

Being implemented in phases since April 1, 2013, India is expected to fully implement Basel III standards by March 2019, three months later than the globally accepted deadline.

Although banks in India have higher capital adequacy ratio than the minimum total capital requirement under Basel III, their Tier-I or equity capital needs to be shored up to meet the norm.

The growth in advances is majorly supported by small business/PL/credit card book which grew at a higher rate of 43% followed by CV financing which grew at 40%. NII at INR 25.8 bn grew 15% yoy/ flat qoq. Immediate effect of increase in the cost of funds led to 18 bps contraction in NIMs (calc.) qoq, which should be offset by increase in MCLR rates which is to come with a lag.

HDFC Securities' research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

A one-time MTM hit (~Rs 2.1bn) and higher NPA provisioning (LLP +49% QoQ, PCR rose to 61%) capped KMB’s net earnings (down 9% QoQ, missing estimates by ~7%). The business remains healthy as ever, with broad based loan growth (+24% YoY), best in class NIMs (4.30%) and negligible net stress incl. SMA-II (97bps, down 6bps). Opex growth of merely 10% YoY (flat QoQ) despite Rs 300-400mn invested in 811 was praiseworthy. Though the differential rate offering comes at an upfront cost (Rs 12-13bn a year), it will help KMB to garner low cost deposits (esp. with interest rates rising). Rapid asset growth will (more than) compensate for this as KMB commands a higher share in lucrative lending spaces. Cross sell opportunities on the acquired customer base will also help.

Outlook

Fast growing subs will help KMB flower into a full service financial conglomerate. With best-in-class return ratios (core RoAA of 1.77% in FY20E), premium valuations are justified. Maintain BUY with SOTP of Rs 1,378 (4.5x Mar-20 core ABV of Rs 238 + Rs 309 for subs).

Edelweiss' research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s (KMB) Q1FY19 consolidated earnings (excluding insurance) came in lower than estimate due to miss in profitability of the banking business. Despite steady asset quality, provisions came in higher due to: a) investment depreciation hit; and b) rising coverage in SME segment (management sees system-wide issue with collateral valuation and is thus strengthening coverage). Meanwhile, credit growth momentum was sustained (~24%). Liability franchise continued to strengthen with average SA jumping 59% YoY, leading to CASA ratio of >50%. Performance of non-banking businesses was on expected lines.

Outlook

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

KMB's standalone earnings was below expectations with PAT at Rs10.2bn (PLe: Rs11.9bn) growing at modest 12% YoY mainly on back of (i) lower NII with marginally higher cost of funds and (ii) higher MTM provisions on investment book with high non-HTM mix but with lower modified duration. Good opex control, moderate other income and steady asset quality were the positives in the 1Q results. Bank took conscious decision to increase provisions on the SME NPA loans on possible significant deterioration of value of collaterals in the market place than previously estimated in the last one year, but assured that PCR is now at reasonable levels.

Outlook

We increase our TP to Rs1,398 mainly on back of increase in insurance valuation from Rs59 to Rs118/share post the IEV disclosures in Q4FY18 and stretched our multiples slightly on lending business leading to limited upside on valuations front and hence we downgrade to 'HOLD"" from ACCUMULATE rating.

ICICI Direct's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s operational performance continued to remain steady. However, higher provision impacted earnings growth. NII grew 15% YoY at Rs 2583 crore, led by healthy credit offtake at 24% YoY to Rs 176927 crore. NIM declined ~5 bps QoQ at 4.3% Aided by healthy growth in NII and non-interest income, profit prior to provision (PPP) came in at Rs 2032 crore. However, provision came in higher at Rs 470 crore, led by provision towards advances at Rs 260 crore and MTM loss on investments at Rs 209.6 crore (bank did not utilise amortisation dispensation). Accordingly, PAT came in lower than our estimate at Rs 1025 crore (I-direct estimate: Rs 1170 crore) On the asset quality front, GNPA remained steady at 2.17% (Rs 3899 crore) while NNPA improved ~12 bps QoQ at 0.86% (Rs 1527 crore). SMA2 outstanding was Rs 189 crore (0.11% of net advances) Advances growth continued at 24% YoY, led by traction in CV, corporate banking and small business including personal loans at 40%, 25% and 43% YoY. Deposit accretion slowed down at 16% YoY to Rs 189744 crore with marginal dip in CASA ratio at 50.3% Additional details on subsidiaries were provided. AUM of wealth management business was at ~Rs 2. 5 lakh crore as of June 2018.

Outlook

The bank has been maintaining RoA of 1.7% with RoE of 12-14% consistently. We remain positive on the fundamental strength given steady NIM at 4.2-4.3%, healthy business growth and improvement in CI ratio ahead. Asset quality is seen to remain prudent in spite of marginal SME pain expected and GNPA seen at ~2% in FY20E. With non-banking businesses (prime, life insurance and securities business) strong on growth and profitability, value enrichment remains a positive. Therefore, proportion of non-banking business in overall profitability is on the upturn at 35%. Valuing the stock on SOTP, we revise our target price upward to Rs 1490 from Rs 1450 earlier and maintain our BUY rating on the stock.

The 2 decade old Indian wealth management industry seems to be coming of age. In line with global trends, wealth management and private banking is fast emerging as an attractive business model for many financial institutions in India.

India was the fastest growing wealth market globally in CY17. As per Boston Consulting Group, personal financial wealth in India grew 15 percent to $3 trillion in 2017 and is expected to grow to $5 trillion by 2022. Within this, the upper and ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWI) segment, i.e. individuals with investable assets of $20 million or more, witnessed the fastest wealth growth.

We see the wealth management market on a sustained growth path given India’s long-term economic growth prospects which will lead to a rise in income levels. The low penetration will only improve as more individuals seek wealth advice.

Market leadersAs per Asian Private Banker, the assets under management (AUM) of top 10 players increased by a whopping 48 percent in CY17.

Homegrown players have clearly emerged as leaders in the wealth space. Of the Rs 10,78,018 crore managed by top 20 players, 72 percent of the assets under management (AUM) is with domestic players. Some global heavyweights - UBS, Morgan Stanley, HSBC and RBS - have already exited this space. The remaining are struggling to maintain and grow their market share. For instance, despite a 35 percent year-on-year increase in AUM, Credit Suisse, one of the largest private banks globally, slipped from the top 20 ranking in CY17. The void created by the exit of foreign banks in the wealth space is being smartly captured by domestic players like Kotak Mahindra Bank, IIFL and Edelweiss Financial Services.

What we like about the wealth business?- Wealth services are relatively 'low risk' when compared to other activities like investment banking and extending credit to businesses and consumers. Revenue streams from wealth management are less cyclical compared to capital market-related businesses such as broking.

- Wealth business requires limited capital for growth, so it can potentially generate non-linear profit growth and return on equity (RoE).

- It does provide cross-selling opportunities. For instance, a large section of UHNWI clients globally use credit to enhance their returns. Hence, there can be an opportunity to grow the balance sheet with a thrust on lending and credit solutions to UHNWI.

What will drive the future profitability of wealth managers?At present, many non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are expanding their wealth unit. While the growing wealth pie can accommodate new entrants, rising competition can also increase pricing pressure. We don’t see competition impacting profitability of large well entrenched wealth managers for a couple of reasons. First, most players have increased headcounts of relationship managers (RM) in the last 1 year or so. The increase in vintage of newly added RMs can drive future growth and operating leverage. Second, the Indian wealth industry is still in a nascent stage in terms of product offerings. As it transits away from plain vanilla products to high margin products like lending and credit solutions, revenue yields can improve.

The current yield of around 80-100 basis points reported by large players like IIFL and Edelweiss is in line with global wealth managers.

Regulations and technology can be disruptiveGlobally, wealth management is undergoing unprecedented transformation, mainly emanating from stricter regulations (such as European legislation like MiFID II) and technology developments. The Indian wealth industry can be expected to follow suit. In India, these risks seems non-imminent at present.

Having said that, wealth managers need to adapt to a market environment that is evolving. For instance, the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) proposed investment advisor regulations, if implemented, can change business models and cost structures for many existing players. The market regulator has proposed a clear demarcation between an investment advisor and distributor, wherein the latter is someone who sells commission-laden mutual funds.

Contrary to popular argument, clients are willing to pay wealth managers for better experience. From a client’s perspective, experience constitutes performance, engagement and trust. Growth of online wealth platforms, increasing popularity of MF investing through direct schemes and falling alpha in largecap fund management are some of the changes that will reshape the wealth management industry.

Our preferred picks The wealth management industry in a sweet spot with multiple growth levers. The gradual but steady shift of household savings away from physical to financial assets is a big positive for the industry. The trend, referred to as 'financialisation of savings' received a fillip after demonetisation. This bodes well for wealth managers.

IIFL Holdings' recent capital raising of Rs 746 crore further enhances the NBFC’s ability to expand the wealth franchise and can result in higher profitability going forward. Read: IIFL Wealth's recent fund raising exercise only brightens its future prospects

Edelweiss Financial Services is rapidly gaining scale in the wealth management space and is now the third largest player in the segment. With wealth and asset management contributing only 14 percent to FY18 profits, its structure is more 'bank-like', with diversified revenue streams. Read: Edelweiss Fin Services & IIFL Holdings: Well positioned to tap high growth segments

Kotak Mahindra Bank: On the wealth management side, KMB has built a formidable business and caters to 40 percent of India’s top 100 families. Read: Kotak Mahindra Bank: Stock yet to fully value subsidiaries

Motilal Oswal Financial Services: Though the current size of MOFS’ wealth business is modest with assets of around Rs 15,000 crore, we see significant scope for an increase in retail AUMs, with cross-selling opportunity to broking clients. The company has ramped up its retail distribution business taking its AUM to Rs 7,500 crore in FY18. Read: Motilal Oswal: Investors with an appetite for some volatility can accumulate for the long term

While we like all players mentioned above, IIFL’s wealth franchise excites us the most in particular. We like Edelweiss as it has carved out a niche in certain segments like distressed assets. Its wealth business is like an icing on the cake.

In the case of KMB, banking operations still contribute 68 percent of FY18 profit. Going forward, as the wealth business continues to assume higher share of consolidated profitability, investors can expect valuation upside in the stock emanating from the wealth franchise. We expect growth in fee-based businesses such as asset and wealth management to support MOFS’ FY19 earnings, especially since its housing finance subsidiary’s performance is expected to remain weak.

Investors with a long-term horizon, wanting to participate in India’s growing wealth industry, should find these diversified financial institutions worthy contenders.

We spoke to various experts and here is a list of top five technical and fundamental stock ideas which are in the pink of health and are a good buy for the period of 6-12 months:

Analyst: Ashish Chaturmohta - Head Technical And Derivatives - Sanctum Wealth Management

Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company: Buy| CMP: Rs1,621| Target: Rs 1,850| Stop loss: Rs 1,580| Return 14%

The stock is in a long-term uptrend forming higher tops and higher bottom formation on the weekly chart. Like typical trending stock, recent correction in the stock has taken support at previous consolidation zone and has bounced back since then.

The price has seen a short-term consolidation between Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,620 levels. The stock can be bought at the current level and dips to Rs 1,580 with a stop loss below Rs 1,520 and a target of Rs 1,850 levels.

Mahindra CIE Automotive Limited: Buy| CMP: Rs 271| Target: Rs 320| Stop loss: Rs 250| Return 18%

The stock has been trading between Rs 265 and Rs 205 odd levels for the last one year. The price breakout is seen from the stock and is currently trading at a two and half year high.

The breakout has been on a strong price momentum and high volumes indicate buying participation. The stock can be bought at current levels and on dips towards Rs 260 with a stop loss below Rs 250 and a target of Rs 320 levels.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy| CMP: Rs 1,303| Target: Rs 1,450| Stop loss: Rs 1,250| Return 11%

The stock is in an uptrend forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. The stock is consolidating at all-time high levels in a narrow range above its previous highs of Rs 1,295 odd levels.

The stock can be bought at current levels and on dips towards Rs 1,285 with a stop loss below Rs 1,250 and a target of Rs 1,450 levels.

Analyst: Vinod V Nair, Head-Fundamental Research at Geojit Financial Services Ltd

TVS Motor Company Ltd: Buy| CMP: Rs 591| Target: Rs 691| Return 15%

TVS Motors (TVS) is the third largest two-wheeler manufacturer in India with a market share of 14 percent in FY18. During Q4FY18 TVS registered a revenue growth of 40 percent on a YoY basis largely led by 32 percent volume growth and superior product mix. PAT grew by 31 percent YoY.

Increased penetration in the high margin premium motorcycle is becoming a game changer for the company. The company registered a 31 percent YoY growth in its premium flagship brand Apache 150 during FY18 and also the executive segments remained robust at 19 percent YoY due to lower base and strong rural demand.

We factor 19/33 percent CAGR in Revenue/PAT over FY18-20E driven by improvement in export, revival in rural demand and growth in the urbanisation for high margin premium motorcycles.

Vinati Organics Ltd: Buy| CMP: Rs 985| Target: Rs 1,106| Return 12%

Vinati Organics Ltd (VOL) is a global leader in two speciality chemicals IBB & ATBS. In Q4FY18 VOL witnessed strong traction in its ATBS business driven by the exit of Lubrizol from the market.

Whereas, the off-take in IBB segment was impacted by prolonged shut down of plants due to de-bottlenecking of VOL’s client capacity.

Going forward, with higher off-take led by demand uptick from IBB in FY19E and pass through of higher cost, we expect EBITDA margin to improve.

Further, ATBS will continue to drive overall revenue growth & profitability led by strong demand, capacity expansion and incremental volumes led by the exit of the competitor from the business.

Given healthy earnings outlook of 21 percent CAGR over FY18-FY20E, we remain constructive on the stock.

Amid rising frauds in banking and conflict of interest allegations against ICICI Bank's Chanda Kochhar, banker Uday Kotak has said it is ""naive"" to think diversified or state ownership is a panacea for good governance as lenders.

""As reflected by events around us, it is naive for policy makers to believe that diversified ownership/state ownership is the way to good governance in banking,"" Kotak said in an annual message to Kotak Mahindra Bank shareholders.

ICICI Bank's shareholding base is very diverse, while the fraud-hit Punjab National Bank is a state-run lender. Policymakers insist on diversification of ownership and have put caps on single shareholding in banks.

Kotak, who has been asked to cut promoter stake in the bank to 20 percent by December 2018, wondered how directors and managers with ""no skin in the game"" or ownership are taking calls on lending and writing-off thousands of crores worth of sour loans.

Without naming any lenders or key executives currently mired in allegations, Kotak said bankers need to possess the qualities of prudence, simplicity and humility.

""Errors of Commission not Omission destroy banks,"" Kotak, who recently chaired a markets regulatory Sebi- appointed committee on corporate governance, said.

In the message titled ""tryst with trust"", he said laws and statutes need to be followed in ""spirit"" by the banking community and not in ""letter"" alone.

""The points which I have mentioned lie at the heart of restoring and sustaining trust in Indian banking,"" he said.

Kotak said the recent losses by banks look ""unreal"" and the present stress is a ""culmination of years of kicking the can"" and added that for the next few quarters, the provisions will continue to be higher.

Without naming Punjab National Bank, he said the over Rs 13,000-crore ""Letter of Undertaking scandal"" at the state-run lender is because of ""gaps in operational risk management"".

For a sound future, Indian banking needs a ""harmonious functioning"" between government and regulators, he said.

Kotak's annual remuneration for the year saw a 11.03 percent increase to Rs 3.18 crore, including basic salary, allowances, provident fund and annual incentives, the bank said, adding that the same has been approved by RBI.

The remuneration paid to Kotak was 48.44 times the median remuneration for employees, which grew 8.53 percent as against 10.26 percent in FY17, the bank added.

Bucking a trend of a dip in headcount observed in some private sector lenders, total number of permanent employees for KMB increased to 35,717 at end of FY18 from the year-ago's 33,013.

Kotak said the total number of customers has crossed 13 million as of March 31, while the bank is aiming to increase the same to 16 million by September 2018.

He added that the country needs to grow at 9 percent per annum for the next 20 years if it were to match China's current per capita income and it is pertinent for the wheels of finance to move seamlessly and speedily.",499,0.4066331187884013

Kotak Mahindra Bank is not looking to sell its 15 percent stake in Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), according to the bank’s managing director Uday Kotak.

Kotak said he has no plans to sell stake in the India’s largest commodity exchange. “We have no intention to sell stake. We continue to hold shares in MCX,” he told Moneycontrol on the sidelines of a CII event.

However, the billionaire banker refused to divulge more details on the reasons behind his decision to hold on to the stake.

Recently, there have been media reports that BSE and NSE were interested to buy the stake from Kotak Mahindra Bank.

Chicago Mercantile Exchange was also keen to buy Kotak Bank's stake in 2016 but differences over valuations had stalled talks.

In July 2014, the fourth largest private sector lender had bought shares of MCX from Jignesh Shah-promoted Financial Technologies India Ltd (FTIL) to hold 15 percent stake.

Kotak Mahindra Bank had bought the stake for Rs 459 crore, or Rs 600 per share, a discount of 24 percent to the then market price of Rs 783. It had made the investment after the

National Spot Exchange Limited scam broke out, and Forward Market Commission (FMC) directed FTIL to reduce its stake in MCX to below 2 percent.

Other prominent shareholder in the company includes ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, who has a 3.92 percent stake.

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s stake in MCX increases the confidence of other investors in the exchange including mutual funds.

With SEBI clearing the universal exchange policy from October 2018, stock exchanges can offer commodity trading without having to set up a separate exchange for the same. Market experts say MCX would be the most impacted exchange with this move.

NSE and BSE have already filed papers with the Securities and Exchanges Board of India. As per source, that both NSE and BSE may enter the non-agri segment – which at present is dominated by MCX and could shower customers with freebies. This will hurt MCX's revenues and thus its valuations.",352,-0.25258493423461914

Tech MNC consultant Ashish Kaul had to face the music courtesy two tweets calling for rape and trafficking of women which he published on May 8 and May 11.

Within a week, Ashish Kaul’s social media account was suspended by Twitter, he has been booked by Jammu and Kashmir police and has lost his job.

The US-based multi-national company for which Kaul used to work suspended him after a complaint was registered to them.

Development Dimensions International in a statement said, “On Friday, May 11, DDI was alerted to the fact that an employee who worked as a consultant in India had made statements on social media that condoned violence against members of the community in the Kashmir region.”

“We were shocked and saddened by the nature of these posts, which are in direct violation of our mission and values. As soon as we learned about the social media posts, we immediately suspended the employee and launched an investigation to determine the full scope of the issue. As of May 12, we have accepted the individual’s resignation.”

The company added that it “deeply regret[s]” the incident.

Kaul, in his May 8 tweet, had resorted to hate speech to vent out his anger against Kashmiri women.

DDI and Twitter’s step was lauded by users of social media.

It’s not, however, the first instance the corporate community has hit back at hatemongers. Kotak Mahindra Bank had in April sacked one of its employees, Vishnu Nandukumar, after he had justified the rape of 8-year-old victim in Kathua.

“It’s better to kill her now otherwise tomorrow she may become a human bomb against India,” Nandkumar had allegedly written in Malayalam.

“It is extremely disheartening to see such comments being made in the aftermath of such tragedy by anyone including an ex-employee. We strongly condemn this statement,” bank spokesperson Rohit Rao had said.

“We have terminated Nandukumar from the services on Wednesday, April 11, 2018 for poor performance,” he added.",347,-0.6236413717269897

Pristine asset quality was maintained—overall stress was curtailed at sub 2.5% levels with credit cost restricted to ~72bps. Commendably, liability franchise continued to strengthen with average SA jumping 58% YoY, leading to CASA ratio of >50%.

Considering this and given strong business profile, we revise our value for life insurance business and consequently revise our SoTP to INR1,366 (INR1,240 earlier). Maintain BUY.

Akash Jain

Kotak Mahindra Bank, at current valuations, seems very expensive at a P/BV of 6x. However, investors with a long term horizon might consider this company for investment on dips and gradually accumulate it as we believe there is lot of value in its subsidiaries which is not reflected in its price. We are impressed by Bank’s lending growth with a tight control on NPAs.

The bank is an extremely well-capitalised entity (capital adequacy ratio of 18.2 percent). The company’s Q4FY18 performance was brilliant and amazed by its sheer ability to control its NPAs in an environment where its peers in private banking space have been grappling with NPA problem.

In Q4FY18, the company’s PAT witnessed a YoY growth of 27 percent to Rs 1,789 crore. The company’s profitability was contributed by its well managed subsidiaries. Of this, strong growth was posted by Kotak Mahindra Investments, Kotak Mahindra Capital, Kotak AMC and its international subsidiaries. Net interest income (NII), was in line with expectations, having grown 18 percent year on year to Rs 2,580 crore.

Net interest margins (NIM) fell to 4.35 percent during the reporting quarter, from 4.63 percent in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Total income during Q4FY18 grew 9 percent to Rs 10,874 crore, as against Rs 9,954 crore during the year-ago period. Advances witnessed YoY growth of 25 percent in Q4 FY18 led by corporate loans, commercial vehicles loans and also personal consumption loans by individuals.

The management is witnessing a clear pick –up in demand for loans as result of which the growth has been higher than the guidance of 20 percent plus the management expects to clock 20 percent plus growth in the next fiscal as well.

The bank’s standalone gross NPAs were at 2.22 percent in March 2018 down from 2.59 percent a year earlier. The so called SMA-2 loans which are overdue for more than 60 days but less than 90 days were just 0.04 percent of net advances at Rs 72 crore.

Total income in FY18 saw a jump of 14.2 percent on YoY basis to Rs 38,724 crore. The company witnessed a rise in PAT by 26 percent to touch Rs 6,201 crore in FY18. Full year consolidated profit growth of 26 percent was led by capital market and asset management subsidiaries. Its asset quality improved during FY18 as its gross non-performing assets (NPAs) came down to under 2 percent from 2.25 percent at the end of FY17. Its net NPAs were 0.86 percent as against 1.09 percent a year earlier.

Edelweiss’ earnings estimates for Kotak Mahindra Bank

Growth momentum is likely to further improve this quarter (> 20% growth). Asset quality should be broadly stable, with in-line provisioning. NIMs may see some pressure following lower yields. Elevated marketing costs (towards 811), will keep opex elevated.

ICICI Direct has come out with its fourth quarter (Jan-March’ 18) earnings estimates for the Banking & Financial Services sector. The brokerage house expects Kotak Mahindra Bank to report net profit at Rs. 1,152.4 crore up 18% year-on-year (up 9.4% quarter-on-quarter).

Net Interest Income is expected to increase by 14.6 percent Y-o-Y (up 3.5 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs. 2,477.9 crore, according to ICICI Direct.

ICICI Direct’s earnings estimates for Kotak Mahindra Bank

We expect continuance of the steady performance on both asset quality as well as earnings. Advance growth is expected to remain robust at 22% YoY, led by retail and small business segment. Hike in MCLR may support margins at 4.2-4.3%. Therefore, NII growth is seen at 14.6% YoY. Asset quality remain resilient. Therefore, credit cost is seen remaining at 15 bps or 12.5% of PPP.

Launch of payments banks and small finance banks has not impacted private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB), a senior official said today.

However, there is a need for universal banks which offer the entire gamut of services to be more agile to take on the new entrants, the bank's head of retail liabilities, investment and payment products, Ambuj Chandna said.

""We do not see any impact. Our focus is how do we take the best to our consumers. Banks like us have to get more agile and offer the products to the customers,"" he told reporters on the sidelines of an event to launch new debit cards for its affluent customers.

It can be noted that ahead of the launch of the new banks, entrenched lenders including State Bank of India, had expressed concerns over the impact to their business because of the entry of the banks, which are backed by storied industrial houses like Reliance Industries and Aditya Birla Group, among others.

Many banks, including KMB and SBI, have picked up stakes in payments banks.

A majority of payments banks have started operations, with Aditya Birla's and Reliance Jio's being among the last ones to go live.

Commenting specifically on the small finance banks, Chandna said it is early days but made it clear that he welcomes more players in the market which gives choices to consumers.

Chandna said the bank launched its fully digital product 8/11 a year ago and has tasted sizeable success on it.

There are strengths like the 6 percent interest rate offering and an established business model taking care of all the associated risks which help the entrenched lenders like KMB, he said.

He affirmed that the bank does not have any plans of having a relook at the higher 6 percent interest rate offering. Some lenders in the system have cut the elevated rates after initially increasing it.

The bank started putting up point of sales terminals last year and has already achieved ""five digit"" mark in the network, he said, explaining that this is a part of its strategy to serve the small business segment and the rollout will continue.

The bank had commissioned artist Paresh Maity, a Padma awardee, to create 10 paintings which will feature on debit cards for its 5 lakh affluent customers having a relationship of over Rs 10 lakh.",427,0.03317558765411377

Government needs to re-look certain provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) as a situation might emerge where there is only one buyer for a stressed asset, Kotak Mahindra Bank Vice Chairman and MD Uday Kotak said today.

The president-designate of CII also said that one of the biggest challenges facing the Indian industry relates to ethics, values and governance.

Addressing the media, he said that ""quite a few areas need to be looked at"" with regard to IBC.

Referring to Section 29A of the IBC which prohibits promoters from buying back their own stressed assets, Kotak said: ""The challenge is not at this stage but as we go into the future, as we go into smaller companies where you may not get even one bid. How are we going to handle that situation. ""Are we going to force those companies into liquidation where probably in some of those situations the only buyer may be the promoter at some price.""

The choice is between the cost of liquidation versus whether a promoter of a smaller company should be allowed to bid for the stressed asset, he said. ""I think that is one area which down the road will be an issue which will need to be addressed"".

Kotak said the rules of bidding should be like a prospectus where it should be clearly stated what is the basis on which the bids will be evaluated.

""There are a lot of these things, there is grapevine, there are rumours and all that. So we need to put a very rigorous process in place of how bids will be evaluated. Will it be a standard process for all or for each of the companies the resolution professional puts down the rules of bidding clearly,"" he said.

On the 270-day moratorium for restructuring a company after its case is admitted by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Kotak said many companies are now close to 270 days in April.

""Will the courts allow more than 270 days. In that case is it a valid approach by the courts or will it be challenged in the Supreme Court, that is another big test which will happen by the end of April/early May. This 270 days in the first round is going to be tested for some of the companies,"" he added.

He said another area is the issues around contingent liabilities which have not become real liabilities.

""Is it an obligation for a buyer to pay for those liabilities or not pay the liabilities. Personal guarantees, do they survive in case the loans are assigned to the buyer, the personal guarantees of the individuals,"" Kotak said, adding however that the progress on IBC is very good.

Against the backdrop of a spate of scams which have come to light recently in the banking sector, Kotak said he is a firm believer that corporate governance is in place across all sectors including the financial sector and is undergoing a process of evolution

""We will navigate through this and hopefully down the line we will see significantly improved standards of governance as we go forward. Yes, we are running through challenges currently but I am pretty clear that they will get better,"" he said.

He said we need to certainly find ways of bringing in more capital into the banking system.

On the ICICI Bank controversy involving its CEO Chanda Kochhar in the over Rs 3,000 crore loan to Videocon, Kotak said the Board, regulator and the shareholders will be in a better position to comment.

Asked about the role of RBI, he said: ""I think essentially the function of a regulator, is broadly three categories: regulation, supervision and enforcement and as long as the regulator looks at these three both individually and holistically, I think that is how they should be looking at.""

He said as far as enforcement is concerned the regulator (RBI) has raised issues about the power of the regulator versus the significant shareholder if it happens to be the state (Indian government) terming it a matter of debate.

However, Kotak said: ""We have regulators which have been working very efficiently, in capital markets, in securities markets, and the insurance sector.""

He highlighted that one of the biggest challenges at present is ethics, values and governance. ""This is something which is at a premium. We need to move the Indian society to a much better level of governance as we go into the future.""

Kotak observed that the MSME sector is one area which has seen the pain of some of the bold reforms, and needs to be hand-holded.

CII President Rakesh Bharti said arbitration was ""very very frustrating"" and the industry body was engaging with the relevant ministries on this issue.

""The fear probably bureaucrats have is that if they don't appeal, they may be hauled up tomorrow for not having done that... I believe that once arbitration has happened because both parties agreed to, then that award needs to be implemented and this is something where the courts also need to take a very judicious and a positive view.

He said it needs to be ensured that the arbitration mechanism becomes more robust, transparent and implemented efficiently and effectively, adding that all foreign companies coming in will have faith in such a fair mechanism.

Mittal also stressed that Indian industry needs to ensure that they abide by the law.

He also called for broad-basing of GST by bringing alcohol, petroleum, electricity and real estate under its ambit.",930,0.16378368933995566

Billionaire banker Uday Kotak has suggested that the government must set up a full-fledged committee with significant analysis in three areas of ownership, governance and risks in order to tackle the current banking system's woes.

As underwriters of risks, bankers must share the blame, Kotak said in an exclusive chat with Moneycontrol, as he shared his views on the over Rs 13,000 crore-scam at Punjab National Bank, challenges to insolvency resolution, management changes at public sector banks and how Kotak Mahindra Bank is looking at the future of banking.

Kotak, who is also the chairman of government-initiated Corporate Governance committee, believes that even with data and technology is being used to boost his business, the operational and credit risks are keeping him awake all night.

Excerpts from the interview:

What are the top changes seen in the banking system in the last one year apart from Insolvency?

I think the first was demonetisation. This has brought in a huge drive of digitisation and biometric is a crucial part of this transformation. as a result of which we launched 811 (online opening of bank accounts through E-KYC).

Second big transformational change is formalisation of financial savings that is coming through GST, RERA or other steps which is giving a big boost to financial savings coming in an organised structure. This is a more sustainable trend over long term. Third is that finally the industry structure is changing and the whole ratio between public and private sector will be more balanced in the years to come. I believe in next five years, public and private sector share will be 50:50.

What will public sector banks need to do to meet competition from private banks?

I think we need pretty significant management change and an ability to take risks based on judgement and not constantly fear over the shoulder. My view is that finally we need a management who can deliver. Frankly, 25 management teams (of 25 different banks) is a fairly tough job for public sector banks.

So do you think consolidation is the way to go? And what about valuations of the public sector banks?

I think the government probably needs to set up a committee to look at issues on bank and public sector banking, This has to be a full fledged committee of the kind the UPA set up in 2007 on ownership, governance and risks. We need a broad brush with significant analysis of these three areas. What bothers me is that the issue (PNB scam) was in the system for 6 years.

Talking about the scams, do you think a scam like that at PNB is also possible in private sector banks?

I think private sector banks are also following the same rules, they have fraud committees and reporting requirements to the RBI. So, I don't think a public or a private sector bank can hide from it. I would be surprised but in life at times fact is stranger than fiction (smiles).

On digital, you have initiated the ABCD?

We are going back to alphabets ABCD. In this somber and sober mood, we have to look at the future and the future of finance is changing. Now we are saying Artificial Intelligence (AI), biometric, customer experience and data are the four big drivers of finance. And we believe, the finance of the future will not be the finance of the past.

What and how will it change business for Kotak Bank?

We think significantly more data will be the basis of our decision making for risks, more focus on information security, making sure we are more robust on our technology platform and finding operational gaps so that we don't have gaps between technology and manual processes which things seep through. So, this is a whole different mindset for the future.

If you are a banker, if you are in a business where your leverage is 10:1, and when you have the trust of people's money, it is very important to be awake.

Under insolvency, you have been looking at stressed assets for a while without much headway. What are the hiccups still remaining?

We have bid for a few assets. But I think the whole IBC process is just going through its early stages and we will certainly participate on the basis which we think makes sense for us but we don't need to be excessively carried away, If we get returns for the risks we take, we will buy it.

Does that mean pricing is still an issue?

I think there is pricing for known and unknown risks. I think we also need to price in for the unknown risks. Why do you think Indian banking went through the trouble it did, it is because they did not price in the unknown risks, in my view, they did not even price in the known risks. So I think do the diligence on pricing, focus on sustainability and based on that the bidding should be made. So, it is about valuations, conditionalities, the whole IRP process is also learning, the resolution professionals are also learning, so everybody has to think really differently. We have bid for a few assets but we will see how it goes.

Will you look at unlocking value in your subsidiaries?

We have gone reverse. We have bought the stake from our foreign partner. The shareholder of Kotak Bank has the full look through of value.The shareholder at the top will get the value. If we believe the business is valuable and if I list it, I am giving value of Kotak bank's shareholder to the third party. Therefore I don't need to list. The investors of Kotak bank can see value of my insurance business. People have the option of buy and sell in the market. So no listing plans, in fact a significant accretion is happening in our subsidiaries. In fact we are on the reverse model and are one of the rare companies who own 100 percent in our asset management and life insurance business.

How do you view the promoters fleeing the country? How can India avoid it?

My first question is much better diligence by the bankers. We are underwriters of risks. Of course, bankers have to share the blame in that. First and foremost, the accountability lies with the banker for doing the right underwriting. In PNB's case, I have no clue where the investigation is ongoing.

What is in for Kotak bank in the next financial year?

We will focus a lot on micro growth and at the same time we are clear that we have to see how we manage risks better. The one thing that differentiates banking, it is risks. That combined with the digital is the future. We run every risk — operational, credit, etc...and as the holder of public money, I cannot take it for granted and therefore be awake (all night).",1161,-0.4130609482526779

However, all gains till January 31, 2018 will be grandfathered and short term capital gains remains unchanged at 15 percent.

The Nifty was down 80 points or 0.71 percent on Friday morning and was trading below the 11K mark at 10,938 while the Sensex fell 256 points and was trading at 35,650. The fall in the benchmark indices was aided by midcaps, the Bank Nifty and the Infra space.

But the sectors which traded in the green included the IT space led by stocks like Info Edge, TCS, HCL Tech and Tech Mahindra. The CNX Pharma index gained over 1 percent led by stocks like Sun Pharma, Lupin, Glenmark Pharma, Dr Reddy's Labs and Aurobindo Pharma.

IT from the FMCG space jumped 2.4 percent. Edelweiss Financial has maintained a hold on ITC with a target price of Rs 313 as Budget 2018 left the tax structure for cigarettes unchanged which was much softer than our anticipation, it said.

The house expects the stock to re-rate due to improving prospects.

Morgan Stanley has maintained an overweight rating on ITC with target of Rs 320 as there was no change in cigarette tax. It is of the view that the next trigger is volume growth and outcome of GST Council meeting. The research firm expects very low probability of introduction of additional GST tax slab for cigarettes.

The top Nifty gainers included ITC which jumped over 2 percent followed by Dr Reddy's Labs, Sun Pharma, Lupin and HCL Tech. The most active stock apart from ITC was State Bank of India which was down 1 percent while Ashok Leyland, TCS and Reliance Industries were the other active stocks.

The top Nifty losers included names like Indiabulls Housing Finance which fell over 3 percent followed by HDFC, ONGC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank, each shedding 2 percent each.

The top Sensex gainers were Info Edge, ITC, Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, Bajaj Finserv and Fortis Healthcare. The top losers included PC Jeweller which tanked 15 percent followed by Vakrangee which was down 10 percent. Cummins India and eClerx were the other top losers.

""The Finance Minister focused the FY18/19 budget on spends in Agriculture, rural upliftment, the poor, health, education, Infrastructure and Digital India.""

""The fiscal deficit projected, thus, saw a marginal slippage to 3.3 percent in FY19, with the current year’s deficit estimated at 3.5 percent. Given the criticality of areas that spends have been allocated to, the money would be well spent and good for India and the Indian economy in the long run.""

""The National Health Protection Scheme to cover 10 crore families at Rs 5 lakh per family is commendable, as are measures to provide for basics to the poor, increase spends in rural India, and steps to ensure farmers get fair compensation and direct linkages to consumers and markets.""

""The continued spends on infrastructure – particularly roads, railways, ports, smart cities, are all steps which will give a boost to India’s economic growth and development in the medium to long term.""

""The steps to ensure increased credit flow to the MSME segment and a reduction in the corporate tax to 25 percent for companies with a turnover of up to Rs 250 crore will again go a long way in giving a significant boost to this segment, and will create more employment.""

""The salaried segment did not receive any added benefits other than a higher standard deduction. Benefits to senior citizens, including an increase in the tax exemption limit for interest income on fixed deposit returns, is welcome.""

""The much discussed and awaited Long Term Capital Gains tax (LTCG) was also announced. In what is a fair move, the 10 percent LTCG tax is applicable on an incremental basis and all holdings as on January 31, 2018 would be grandfathered and valued at prices on that day. However, Securities Transaction Tax (STT) was not reduced.""

Kotak Mahindra Bank is waiting for more cues on pricing and resolution of bad loans under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in order to aggressively invest in the distressed assets.

Dipak Gupta, joint managing director of the bank, said, “We have not bought very large amount of stressed assets. Out of 14 lakh crore (stressed assets), only 2.5 lakh crore are out in the first list (of the Reserve Bank of India). It is still evolving and will see how it goes, lot of laws are changing, getting modified, it has to stabilise, the pricing has to be appropriate. We are yet to see any closures…so, too early to say if pricing is appropriate but we are watching it closely.”

Kotak Mahindra group and Canadian asset manager Brookfield have also decided to jointly bid for 2,200 megawatts of power assets belonging to Jaypee Power Ventures, a unit of Jaiprakash Associates. Gupta said if Brookfield wins the bid, Kotak Bank will be the financial partner.

The Uday Kotak-led bank has been vocal about its interest in buying stressed assets but has not made much headway in the endeavour.

According to Gupta, the stressed assets space has not moved to the next stage where resolutions have started or it has moved to liquidation. This will happen in the next three months and we will then know which direction it has moved forward in, he said.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, for the October to December period, witnessed one of the slowest growth rates in the past 10 quarters, with a 19.7 percent year-on-year growth in net profit to Rs 1,053 crore.

Gupta said the bank has been gaining more market share in the corporate segment. “It is not really incremental financing but a lot of refinancing. We have taken some recognition which, not necessarily, would be 90 days due, but slippages are at about less than Rs 300 crore,"" he said.

The gross non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio of the bank was at 2.31 percent, as against 2.47 percent in the previous quarter. Net NPA ratio came in at 1.09 percent, as against 1.26 percent a quarter ago.

Among the loan accounts featured in the second list of NPAs put out by RBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank has exposure to six accounts, together worth Rs 300-400 crore. The bank has made provisions for about two-third of these assets.

On further movement of interest rates, Gupta said the two big events – the Budget and the upcoming monetary policy — will dictate direction going forward.

“There is a decent increase in the curve beyond one-year (rates). So we have seen movement in 1 to 10 years but short term hasn’t moved much and have to see how they move forward. It is generally on the way up, whether this is pause of structural reversal of direction, we have to wait and watch,” Gupta said.",487,5.650520324707031e-05

The country's richest banker and vice-chairman of Kotak Mahindra Bank, Uday Kotak, has expressed concerns over the surging stock market and India's financial savings going into selective stocks only.

""Money is coming to a broad funnel and it’s going into a narrow pipe where massive amount of Indian savers’ money is now going into few hundred stocks. And you come back to the question of how good is the governance of these companies.

The amount of money that’s going into small and mid-cap stocks is something on which we have to ask tough questions. You’re pushing all this (money) into a narrow funnel which inevitably runs the risk of a bubble,"" said Uday Kotak in an interview to Indian Express.

Kotak also headed a Sebi committee which submitted a report last year on changes in corporate governance rules for listed firms. Talking on the same he said, “Keep in mind now you have EPFO money, insurance money, pension, investors’ and savers’ money.

People think nothing can go wrong. I would increase my level of alert from the policy point of view and dramatically improve the level of governance and transparency.”

With the banking sector struggling with challenges from GST implementation and the residual impact of demonetisation, Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of the fastest growing private sector lenders, has been focusing on new customers in the last six months to build its book.

""The primary driver for growth is more the new customers and not so much from old or existing customers, which tells a story that the existing customers' requirement for capex or loans for financing their growth, that piece has not grown much,"" the bank’s Business Head for Corporate Banking and SME (small and medium enterprises), Manish Kothari told Moneycontrol News in an interaction. ""Existing customers have seen mild growth but a large part of growth is coming from new customers.""

The focus means that despite the challenges, the bank will witness 15-20 percent growth in the corporate banking and SME portfolio -- even higher if the challenges move away faster.

Kothari said that companies had not seen any new capacities being built up. ""(It is) happening in pockets for sure; say the auto sector, which is seeing some expansion; chemical industry is seeing investments in capex; roads, with NHAI coming out with bids; lot of new projects being given in renewables in the solar space.""

He added that a pickup in investments by corporates was perhaps still 6-12 months away.

Low loan demand from corporates has been the case for about more than a year now -- loan growth touched a multi-decade low of 4.1 percent in the month of May 2017.

Moreover, the Goods and Services Tax or the GST that got implemented from July 1 last year, has seen taxpayers struggling with teething problems such as delay in input credit refunds, lack of clarity on filing, errors in invoice matching and few other technical snags.

Additionally, there is also some degree of disintermediation which has happened. ""So the better quality corporates have raised money from the money market, instead of bank funds,"" Kothari said.

Kothari, who joined Kotak 22 years ago straight after finishing from the XLRI business school, expects the bank to keep performing better than many of its peers.

He expects that with the initial GST hiccups waning, and also with the resolution of the non-performing assets (NPAs) eventually coming in with the NCLT proceedings, corporates will make a comeback. ""(They will) expand capacities as better companies and players with more equity such comapnies. Those (distressed) companies are not operating at optimum levels,” the Kotak executive said.

Kotak bank’s standalone corporate and business banking (which includes SME) together contribute 32 and 12 percent, respectively. The total corporate portfolio as on September 30, 2017, stands at nearly Rs 49,000 crore while business banking book is just above Rs 18,100 crore.

This, for the corporate book, was a growth of 26.4 percent from a year ago period and a one-digit 6.4 percent over the June quarter.

However, business banking portfolio suffered as it grew by a meagre 4.3 percent from September 2016 and 3.4 percent from the June quarter 2017.

""Delinquency rates in ABS (asset backed securities) deals backed by loans against property to SMEs will increase in 2018, because of the tougher operating environment for SMEs. The introduction of a GST in July 2017 and the government's demonetisation policy have placed stress on the SME sector,"" said Dipanshu Rustagi, assistant vice president at Moody's, said in a report by Moody’s and ICRA on Monday.

However, like the government and many others, Kothari sees a fat silver lining with more organised players coming into the system with GST streamlining the processes in the next 12 months.

“Those in the organised sector are happy that the demand or business from a host of unorganised people is shifting to them. There is lesser of cash economy now than before and the differentiation is much more on who followed good practices who are getting stronger and those cutting corners face difficulties managing cash flows,” he said, adding that people who align to the change faster will be in a better shape.

Kothari is not worried even if a majority of India’s economy is thriving on the unorganised segment.

According to him, “Some mortalities will happen, (but) we cannot underestimate the power of entrepreneurship and they will come back into the business. The pain point is more with respect to the refund process taking longer because the reconciliation takes time and the system is new, so the cash flow cycle has to become faster, which will (happen).”

Kothari adds that the challenge is only in the last mile where the cash element is the highest. “Because he doesn’t need credit inputs but there is benefit that he also doesn’t add much value to the taxes.”",819,0.043465502121869254

Kotak Mahindra Bank , India's fourth largest private lender, will look at buying mid-sized assets of the companies undergoing insolvency proceedings but the pricing is yet to be at acceptable levels, says Dipak Gupta, Joint Managing Director.

In a chat with Moneycontrol, Gupta, who has spent over 30 years in the financial services space, says that resolution outside of NCLTs (national company law tribunals) requires bankers to “sacrifice reasonably and unconditionally” and also has been met with apprehension among buyers about many “loose ends” while buying a stressed asset. Hence, many cases from the RBI’s second list are being taken to the insolvency courts.

An electronics engineer and a post graduate from the prestigious Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A), Gupta opted out of his family’s saree business in Varanasi to join financial services. On weekends, he unwinds doing organic farming at his house in Alibag, near Mumbai.

Here are excerpts from the interview:

Why have out-of-court resolutions not fructified since August when the RBI came out with the second list of stressed assets to be taken to NCLT?

There is an apprehension that if I resolve before NCLT, there will be lot of loose ends. NCLT is court-directed and it is final.

Loose ends or what I call the unknown liabilities, are not necessarily in promoters’ control – service tax dues, labour dues, operational creditors, electricity, etc… Hence why settle for less? I don’t even know if I will get the entire leftover price after the resolution as there could be lot of hidden dues.

What is the status of the ongoing insolvency proceedings?

I see buyers coming through because some of the plants are good facilities. The only problem was that debt was too huge. Once the debt comes down, it is a good running plant. The round after that will start seeing more trouble coming through as they would be non-performing assets. The only way to resolve is to sell-off. In the second and third round, the fear is that the hits will be higher.

The first round of sale has good operating assets. The first round may see hair-cuts up to 50-70 percent and these are large accounts. The second round will be higher and close to 65-75 percent.

Do you think there is inconsistency in allowing promoters to bid within and outside NCLT?

I think there is a basic difference here. Before NCLT, it is more of a recovery process where the banker tries to recover from the promoter. The NCLT process is more about the resolution of the asset, not to help just the banker or promoter. During a recovery process, I (banker) would try and help the promoter as much as possible. But when it is a resolution, the existing promoter could have come in before it goes to NCLT. If he wants to buy it, why wait for the NCLT process. This means, he is trying to get the best price.

What about Kotak Bank’s interest in buying the NCLT assets?

We have always been interested in buying the mid-size assets because large assets require, in addition to financial structuring, strategic operating experience to run those assets. So, we are now just trying to wet our feet but still evaluating. The price has to be acceptable and the bets are too huge and will wait for the price to evolve.

What are the pain points for Kotak Mahindra Bank in this scenario of growth?

Margins! I can grow but everyone wants to grow. I think it should be around the current range (4.33 percent in Q2Fy18) by year-end. But normally as interest rates start going up, bank margins go up. So, in a funny way, interest rates going up may not be bad.

Inflation has come much higher, about 50 bps, than what was expected and it is further expected to go up. So, there is no chance of interest rates going up.

Technology has reduced the need for physical bank branches. Will that change your strategy?

Yes, with technology in the current scenario, we don’t need as many branches. It also depends on the location and how big the bank is. Absolute smaller ones still need to grow. For Kotak, we do not want to grow the brick and mortar as we had grown in the past and we also have ""811"". But that is only for retail customers as they will definitely move to technology very significantly further. The SME (small and medium enterprises) in India still has a lot of cash handling and that necessarily requires brick and mortar in some regions.

Are banks looking at data beyond the credit bureau because of competition from fintech (financial technology) players?

Yes definitely. Over last 3-4 years, fintechs are rising in the payments and lending space. Payments is not a very large profit pool but retail lending is. Now, retail lending contributes about 25 percent from our profit pool. If fintechs start attacking that pool, it is a worry. So we are experimenting on how we can do the business faster. It is the same business but more on how do we acquire customers and do business differently. Customers are savvier today so we have to be there for them.

Where does Indian banking system lag as compared to its peers?

China has moved far ahead on the digital environment, of course with some large outside players not allowed to enter. But they have the database ready. Rest of Asia is not growing as fast as China.. US is far more protected and it (digital) hasn’t dented the banking piece as much. But today, Google, Amazon and Facebook have better information about Indian customers than someone in India, which is not the problem in China.

I think there has to be a combination of customer awareness, consciousness and regulation.",979,0.07991037766138713

At a time when the financial sector is witnessing a major transformation, Indian savers have lost out on capitalising returns from large private players such as HDFC due to its foreign ownership, according to Uday Kotak, head of Kotak Mahindra Bank, and also one of the most successful entrepreneurs in the country.

As the chief of the fourth largest private bank, Kotak questioned that allowing global investments has come at a price to the domestic investors and India as a nation had to significantly give up its wealth to a lot of people outside India and beyond.

He said this addressing a panel of senior Indian economists including former chief economic advisors and Reserve Bank of India governors such as Bimal Jalan and YV Reddy, at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research in Mumbai.

“On a more fundamental basis, India in order to fund its P&L thereafter has raised a disproportionate level of equity and in a globalized world where global equity was easy, India found it feasible to fund these balance sheets. But this equity has come with a cost,"" Kotak said.

HDFC or Housing Development Corporation of India, the biggest private housing finance firm, has a total share of 75.99 percent held by foreign portfolio investors as on September end 2017, as per data on BSE.

On the other hand, foreign portfolio investors hold 39.86 percent in Kotak Mahindra Bank as on September end.

Uday Kotak mentioned that HDFC, one of the jewels of India, had in early 1980s, a small market capitalisation of Rs 500 crore and 100 percent Indian-owned. The same has now increased to Rs 2.80 lakh crore and it also has a major lender HDFC Bank as its subsidiary.

“It has created value but here is a company that has garnered domestic savings for domestic housing needs and 85 percent of that company is today owned by foreign savings. The entire benefit of this growth of Rs 500 crore to Rs 2.80 lakh crore has benefited a saver in Boston or anywhere else in the world,"" Kotak added.

India versus China

Drawing parallels between India and China’s economic growth from the 1970s to now, the private sector bank chief said, “Going by per capita income, India stands at what we believe is a lower middle income level of USD 1800 per capita and the same period with population marginally larger than ours, China stands at USD 8,500.""

Doing some math, Kotak pointed out that for India to get to where China is today, we have to grow per capita at 8 percent for the next 20 years…and if we add population growth of 1 percent per annum, then India has to grow at 9 percent in absolute real GDP for the next 20 years to get where China is today.

“That bothers me as an Indian and that we need to ask where did we really lose out in the race,” he said also asking if we are competitive enough even on the trade side which helps the profit and loss which is India’s current account.

Hard growth with softer aspects

Kotak also raised questions on the core area of hard growth versus soft aspects of the growth. ""Is India at a stage where it really will find it a challenge because of the softer issues, to manage a hard growth of 9 percent GDP? How are we going to get this balance? How are we going to get an ecosystem with better distribution, the whole area of teachers, judges, the whole machinery of the softer part of India and where is that getting lost?

Speaking about the way digital transformation is leading top five technology companies painting the growth story, he said, “If you see technology companies – Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon are all heading to be individually trillion dollar companies and even today they are larger than India’s GDP.""

According to him the financial sector is undergoing transformation including more financial savings and digital disruption.

""Financial sector is getting redefined. Does the financial sector still need 70 percent state-ownership or is it time to be thinking differently? And as the competitive pressures go up, how is India and India’s financial sector set to cope with the need for talent and a whole host of changes of the modern economy?” Kotak concluded as he put forth the questions before the experts.",741,-0.36086511611938477

KR Choksey's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Q2FY18 performance was a strong with advances growing 21.1% yoy (7.2% qoq) to Rs. 15,25,741 mn, while interest income grew 7.9% yoy (2.2% qoq). With NIMs remaining within the bank’s guided range of 4.25%, NII grew at a good pace of 16% yoy and 3% qoq (CoF down 90 bps yoy and yields down 130 bps). Calculated annualized NIM was 4.1% against 4.3% for Q2FY17 and 4.2% for Q1FY18. CASA saw healthy growth of 44% yoy and 10% qoq, (CASA ratio – 47.8% versus 43.9% for Q1FY18, 39% for Q2FY17). Cost/income ratio stands at 47.2% versus 49.1% for Q2FY17 and 49.4% for Q1FY18. PAT was slightly below our expectations, at Rs. 9,943 mn, up 22% yoy and 9% qoq. On the asset quality front, the Bank has shown improvement as its gross NPAs stand at 2.47%, down 2 bps yoy and 11 bps qoq. Net NPAs, at 1.26%, are up 6 bps yoy and 1 bp qoq. Despite the strong traction in corporate loan book and given the current corporate lending environment, the Bank has been able to maintain its asset quality over the last many quarters.

Outlook

We expect the bank to deliver 20% loan book CAGR over FY18-20E on back of faster customer acquisition through its 811 strategy and focus on consumer segment. We believe the bank’s asset quality to improve tremendously on account of undeterred focus on quality loan underwriting without compromising on risk-adjusted returns (although we remain watchful on the NIMs as further contraction will be a negative). The fact that the bank has negligible exposure to the RBI-identified accounts makes the bank stand out. Further, we expect significant value creation through diversification of revenue streams by way of penetration into consumer durables finance, ~100% acquisition of BSS Microfinance and through asset management, securities and insurance businesses. Given the ROEs and scope for improvement, at current market price of Rs. 980 per share, we feel most of the value creation that is to come is priced in. Hence, we assign ACCUMULATE recommendation on the stock, valuing it at 4.8x FY20E BV translating into a value per share of Rs. 1,104, offering an upside of 9%.For all recommendations report, click here

Key positives during the quarter were a) significant decline in cost-to-income ratio (down ~200bps YoY) despite additional expenditure pertaining to ‘811’ and priority sector certificates, b) Strong SA growth of +61% YoY driven by government business, and c) management disclosure that Post-IFRS networth of the bank will be higher than under the current accounting methodology. Subsidiaries, too, showed healthy growth especially on life insurance, asset management and retail securities businesses. After nearly eight quarters of single-digit growth, Kotak prime delivered 15% YoY PAT growth with nearly 8% sequential growth in car loans. Despite rich valuations, we like Kotak for its clean asset quality, diversified presence and encouraging growth trends.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

PAT grew 22% YoY to INR9.94b (3% miss). Operating profit increased 20% YoY, led by healthy NII growth (+16% YoY, even as NIM shrunk 17bp QoQ to 4.33%), steady fee income growth (+29% YoY) and controlled operating expenses. Asset quality remains healthy, with the GNPL ratio declining by 11bp QoQ to 2.47% and the coverage ratio by 260bp QoQ to 49.7%. The bank received RBI inspection report and no divergence was reported as of March 2017.

Other highlights: a) CASA growth remained strong at 44% YoY (62% YoY growth in SA deposits). CASA ratio thus increased 390bp QoQ to 47.8%. b) SMA2 advances declined to 16bp of loans v/s 21bp in 1QFY18, while OSRL declined to INR650m (4bp of loans).

Among subsidiaries, KM Securities, KM Life Insurance and Kotak AMC reported healthy earnings growth. We expect ~26% earnings CAGR over FY17-19, led by a revival in loan growth and controlled opex. Strong presence across geographies/products and healthy capitalization (Tier1 of ~19%) place the bank in a sweet spot to capitalize on growth opportunities and gain market share.

Edelweiss' research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) reported robust performance, as Q2FY18 was characterised by crystallisation of synergy benefits (revenue and opex). Key highlight was the sustained delivery on loan growth—>20% YoY (moving to pre-merger level). This, along with superior NIMs (4.3%, albeit down 20bps QoQ on competitive lending yields) and strong core fees, helped KMB register robust core revenue momentum. Meanwhile, higher opex (albeit lower than Q1FY18) and softer treasury led to marginally below estimated PAT. Asset quality continued to strengthen—overall stress (GNPLs + restructured) at 2.5% with credit cost contained at <60bps. Impressively, the bank highlighted no major divergence with RBI; this, along with lower stress pool, lends comfort. Liability franchise continued to strengthen with average SA jumping >50% YoY, raising CASA ratio to ~48%. With limited levers in credit cost & opex, sustained revenue traction will be key for RoE improvement (recent capital raising will cap RoE at low mid teens). Maintain ‘HOLD’. Growth traction building

Outlook

Synergies playing out; maintain ‘HOLD’. H1FY18 performance reflects synergy benefits playing through on cost as well as revenue fronts. With recent equity infusion, leveraging of this capital in financing business & efficient allocation across other businesses will be critical for RoE improvement. With significant benefits likely to flow from formalisation of financial savings, subsidiaries could see strong business tailwinds. Valuations at 3.8x FY19E P/ABV (banking business for RoE of 14% by FY19E) factor in fair bit of upside. Maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ with TP of INR1,056.For all recommendations report, click here

Majority of analysts have maintained neutral rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank despite better earnings performance for the quarter ended September 2017, citing fair valuations.

""Valuations leave little room for further upside,"" said Macquarie while retaining its neutral rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 940 per share.

The research house feels the guidance of 20 percent YoY loan growth looked achievable owing to traction seen in Q2. It expects 21 percent loan CAGR over FY18-20.

Strong loan growth & stable asset quality are key catalysts for the stock, it said.

Macquarie feels Kotak's well capitalised but lower leverage is suppressing return on equity. Hence, the research house advises buying HDFC Bank as it is quality franchise, equally impressive and offers much higher return on equity for slightly higher valuations.

Credit Suisse has also maintained its neutral rating on the bank with a target price of Rs 950 per share as the stock remains expensive at 26x FY19, while cutting earnings estimates by 3-4 percent on lower margin & other income.

""Kotak needs to deliver consistently on higher loan growth and fees to justify its rich valuations,"" IDFC Securities said while retaining neutral call with a target price of Rs 910.

It expects Kotak to deliver better earnings than sector as it does not face corporate stress.

Kotak on Wednesday reported profit growth of 22.2 percent year-on-year Rs 994.31 crore and net interest income grew by 15.9 percent to Rs 2,312.66 crore for the quarter ended September 2017.

Loan growth was 21 percent, but net interest margin contracted to 4.33 percent from 4.47 percent YoY.

Asset quality improved nicely in the quarter ended September 2017 as gross non-performing assets (NPA) fell 11 basis points sequentially to 2.47 percent and net NPA slipped 42 basis points to 1.26 percent.

""The bank reported robust performance, as Q2FY18 was characterised by crystallisation of synergy benefits (revenue and opex), Impressively, the bank highlighted no major divergence with RBI; this, along with lower stress pool, lends comfort. Liability franchise continued to strengthen with average SA jumping over 50 percent YoY, raising CASA ratio to around 48 percent,"" Edelweiss said while maintaining hold rating with a price target at Rs 1,056 per share.

Large banks may soon follow State Bank of India (SBI) and reduce their interest rates on deposits and loans after the Reserve Bank of India’s 25 basis point (bp) cut in key policy rate on Wednesday.

With this, customers may benefit from lower loan rates but also get lower interest on their deposits parked with the bank.

Anticipating a policy rate cut, the country’s largest lender, SBI, on Monday cut the interest rate on savings accounts by 50 bps to 3.5 percent from 4 percent to protect its margins in the dwindling interest rate scenario.

One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Urjit Patel: One Year As RBI Governor

In the landmark move, SBI has introduced differential pricing for savings deposits, revising it downwards for the first time after rate de-regulation was announced in October 2011.

Other big lenders including Bank of Baroda, Bank of India and Union Bank of India have indicated that they may look at a possible replication of a similar or lesser reduction at their asset-liability committee (ALCO) meetings by next week.

""With the RBI rate cut, there will be some savings in cost of funds and the MCLR (marginal cost based lending rate) computation will get re-priced by default. Also, since SBI cut deposit rates, large banks would follow suit with some reduction. This will help in some reduction in lending rates,"" said a senior Bank of India official.

Loan Rates

Lending rate cuts typically follow a deposit rate reduction. Previously, large lenders have usually matched the rate set by SBI in both deposit and lending rates.

Parthasarathi Mukherjee, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer at Lakshmi Vilas Bank, said: ""Funding is generally comfortable for banks now. And cost of funds for private banks comes down faster because of shorter maturities and re-pricing happens quicker so there is some scope (for reduction). So, as bigger banks reduce, the smaller banks will also gradually reduce rates.""

As per an Edelweiss report, ""With SBI making the move, we expect others to follow suit…We expect this move to cushion NIMs (net interest margins) at sector level (versus anticipation of decline) and earnings to bolster up to 2-6 percent for private banks and 15-20 percent for PSU banks (everything else remaining same).""

Further, Governor Urjit Patel said, ""Given the liquidity conditions prevailing and that we have reduced policy rates by substantial amounts since the easing cycle started, there is scope for banks to reduce lending for those segments that so far have not yet benefited to the full extent of our policy rate cuts.""

Since January 2015 when the easing cycle began, the RBI has cut repo rate by 2 percentage points while banks’ lending rates on fresh rupee loans have declined by about 1.38 percentage points, especially on the base rate.

Average reduction in MCLR since its inception in April 2016 has been about 92 bps. During the same period, average base rate on fresh loans has been cut by 75 bps, while on outstanding loans, it is even lower at 57 bps.

RBI has observed that while the extent of change in Base Rate has not necessarily mirrored the revision in MCLR, the rigidity of Base Rate is a matter of concern for an efficient transmission of monetary policy to the real economy.

""Given a large part of the floating rate loan portfolio of banks is still anchored on the Base Rate, the RBI will be exploring various options in the near future to make the Base Rate more responsive to changes in cost of funds of banks,"" RBI said.

Deposit Rates

However, smaller competitive banks may stand to gain market share marginally as they would continue their offerings which are higher by 1-2 percentage points (100-200 bps) on deposit rates.

On Thursday, Kotak Mahindra Bank announced that it will continue to offer 5 percent and 6 percent interest rate on savings account balances up to Rs 1 lakh and above Rs 1 lakh and up to Rs 1 crore, respectively.

Shanti Ekambaram, President - Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said, ""Our focus continues to be on building a quality retail franchise. Hence, we are holding our savings interest rate in the retail segment.""

Similarly, Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank which offer similar rates in the 5-6 percent range also have gained market share with an additional 20 percent coming from their current account savings account (CASA) deposits with such differential pricing.

CASA deposits are low-cost funds for banks and considered to be a stable base of deposits.

However, because customers tend to use savings accounts for convenience rather than investment gains, it is a long haul for banks to garner a significant pool of savings.

Mukherjee said, ""There is no fun in gaining tiny market share as pricing is not the only factor for customers to come to banks. So, most of them will see some reduction in their deposit and lending rates.""

According to data from Credit Suisse, while private banks have captured more than 90 percent of incremental loans in the past one year, less than 40 percent of the incremental deposits have been taken by them.

In a report released on Tuesday, it said there is a risk that the deposit rate cut could accelerate market share losses for public sector banks on the liabilities side.",894,0.23226653039455414

The Nifty50 has fallen 124 points from its record high of 10,137.85 recorded earlier in the month of August after a strong 5 percent rally seen in the month of July.

The momentum might have slowed down but nearly 100 stocks from the S&P BSE 500 index hit fresh record highs in the month of July which most experts say could be your winning bets.

The momentum has slowed down but history suggests that correction in the market has not lasted for more than 200 points in the past. If the index closes below its 13-DEMA and 20-DEMA convincingly, further correction cannot be ruled out in that case.

The index might be going through consolidation but the good news is that there was lot of stock specific action which was seen in the month of July as nearly 100 stocks rose to fresh all-time highs which include names like Eicher Motors, Page Industries, Maruti Suzuki, RIL, HDFC Bank, Avanti Feeds, IndusInd Bank, ACC, Yes Bank, VST Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, etc. among others.

“It undoubtedly makes sense to hold stocks in the portfolio which have hit record highs provided they are backed by core business fundamental which supports a growth prospectus,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“Given that a current rally in the market is partly driven by excess liquidity despite a marginal growth in earnings, an investor should remain caution towards this euphoria,” he said.

Analysing quarterly performance of companies can be used as an add-on filter before making an investment decision, suggest experts.

“If on the quarterly basis their performances are good and have already given significant upside, one should not mind entering at high because the upside is very much justified,” Abnish Kumar Sudhanshu, Technical Analyst, Aadya Commodities Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“I would advise investors to observe the quarterly performance and also focus on the future growth trajectory. We advise investors to look to enter in Kotak Mahindra, Voltas, Piramal Enterprise, Maruti, and Hindalco etc.,” he said.

Before making an investment decision, investors should analyse the company’s fundamentals on the basis of business outlook, revenue track record as well as demand environment.

The stock specific action is likely to continue as benchmark indices might stay in a range. But, investors should remain watchful of the stocks they want to put fresh money while in some case it makes sense to book partial profits.

“While expensive valuations (post sharp run-up) warrant a re-evaluation of the fundamentals of companies, it should be noted that the quality companies with a moat in terms of brand, market leadership, and capital efficiency, always command premium multiples,” Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICI Direct told Moneycontrol.

“These premium multiples, therefore, should be seen in conjunction with reasonable growth visibility and strong balance sheets that these companies have,” he added.

Pandey further added that if the investment thesis and growth visibility is in line with expectations for a quality company, one should stick with such companies. Otherwise, one can book profits where current levels have priced in most of the growth.

Investing in small & midcap space:

Among the small and midcap names, stocks which have hit fresh record highs last month include names like Manappuram Finance, Rain Industries, Jindal Stainless, Gayatri Projects, NBCC, JSW Steel, Chambal Fertilisers, Sterlite Technologies and Apollo Tyres etc. among others.

Mid cap and small cap investing have always been a bottom up phenomenon rather being a top down approach. The S&P BSE 500 index has most of the top quality stocks across largecap, midcap as well as smallcaps.

“While it is difficult to gaze through quality names the focus needs to be sticking with quality business models with superior return on capital over a sustained period of time,” Pandey of ICICI Direct said.

“We believe that people need to be cautious while downgrading in quality. We continue to advise that comfort over management, business model, growth visibility and sustainability is a key in midcap investing,” he said.

Days after the top lender State Bank of India slashed its savings account interest rate by 0.5 percent due to excess liquidity, Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) said it will continue with its elevated offerings.

The private lender said it will continue offering 5 percent per annum for deposits of up to Rs 1 lakh and 6 percent for those above it but up to Rs 1 crore.

""We feel this is the right time to build a retail franchise and the higher savings bank rates have helped us significantly over the last three to four years,"" its president for consumer banking Shanti Ekambaram told PTI.

The only revision the bank has done is a 0.5 percent cut for savings account deposits between Rs 1 crore and Rs 5 crore to 5.5 percent but Ekambaram was quick to add the rates for 99.9 per cent of KMB customers are unchanged.

""Borrowers matter so do savers. Kotak Mahindra Bank holds rates for savers up to 1 crore. 6 percent continues for saving between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1 crore,"" KMB Vice Chairman and Managing Director Uday Kotak tweeted.

On July 31, SBI slashed interest rate on savings deposits by 50 bps to 3.5 per cent on balance up to Rs 1 crore, citing ""muted credit demand and very high real interest rates"".

The state-run lender's move was seen as a precursor to more banks adopting the same stance, even though there was increased interest on how the smaller private lenders, wanting to grow their customer base and looking at cross-sell opportunities, react to it.

It can be noted that such private sector lenders, including KMB, are growing their loan books at over 20 percent as against sagging system growth.

Ekambaram said the blended cost of the savings account deposits for the bank stands at 5.5 percent, as against the 6.75 or 7 percent it would pay for a term deposit.

However, by paying the higher interest rates, it has been able to forge deeper client relationships and sell investment and loan products to them, she said, adding cross-sell is the ""basic model"" of a bank.

These include life insurance, general insurance and mutual funds on the investment side, and multiple forms of assets like home loans, she said.

Ekambaram said after demonetisation, there has been a large flow of savings into the formal economy, which needs to be routed to better-yielding investments through the savings account.

SBI had said that 60 percent of the excess funds it received as deposits following demonetisation has gone out of the bank.

Ekambaram did not spell out anything on how long it will continue with the high offerings and said the bank has the choice to cut these rates whenever it wants.",491,0.3234614431858063

KR Choksey's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Q1FY18 performance was a mixed bag with advances growing 18% yoy (4.6% qoq) to Rs. 1423590 mn, while interest income grew only 6.1% yoy (5% qoq). Despite the low interest income growth, NII grew at a robust pace of 17% yoy and 3.9% qoq on back of reduced cost of funds (CoF down 102 bps yoy). Calculated annualized NIM was 4.20% against 4.29% for Q1FY17 and 4.24% for Q4FY17. CASA saw healthy growth of 37% yoy and 3.6% qoq, helping bring down cost of funds and eventually aiding NIMs (CASA ratio – 43.9% versus 37.4% for Q1FY17, 44.0% for Q4FY17). PAT was below our expectations, at Rs. 9127 mn, up 23% yoy, down 6.5% qoq. On the asset quality front, the bank saw stable performance with gross NPAs of 2.58% versus 2.50% for Q1FY17 and 2.59% for Q4FY17, while net NPAs were 1.25% versus 1.21% for Q1FY17 and 1.26% for Q4FY17. Capital augmentation (Rs. 58030 mn equity raise) during the quarter should help the company pursue its industry-leading growth going forward.

Outlook

We expect the bank to deliver 20% loan book CAGR over FY18-20E on back of faster customer acquisition through its 811 strategy and focus on consumer segment. We believe the bank’s asset quality to improve tremendously on account of undeterred focus on quality loan underwriting without compromising on risk-adjusted returns. The fact that the standalone entity did not have any exposure to the 12 identified accounts makes the bank stand out. Further, we expect significant value creation through diversification of revenue streams by way of penetration into consumer durables finance, acquisition of BSS Microfinance and through asset management, securities and insurance businesses. However, at current market price of Rs. 980 per share, we feel most of the value creation that is to come is priced in. Hence, we assign ACCUMULATE recommendation on the stock, valuing it at Rs.1104 per share which is 4.8x FY20E BV, offering an upside of 13%.

Q) What are your views on the market which has already delivered about 20% return so far in the year 2017? How is the second half of the year expected to pan out? Do you think it is time for investors to book some profits and buy again on dips?

A) We remain cautiously optimistic on markets. First half has been very strong owing to positive macro fundamentals (inflation trending down, stable currency, twin deficits under control) and policy reforms (GST) coupled with very benign liquidity (1HCY17 FII equity inflows are more than inflows of CY15+CY16, 1HCY17 DII MF inflows are already approaching the DII MF flows of entire CY16).

Upside from here will be a function of earnings recovery – unless strong macro translates into equally strong micro, valuation re-rating from these levels look slightly difficult.

We expect earnings growth to pick up the pace from 2HFY18 owing to the low base of demonetization, re-stocking in consumption sectors post GST implementation and transmission of lower interest rates in the P&L of corporate India.

Timing the markets is always fraught with difficulties, we advise investors to invest systematically over a period of time.

Q) Your list of top five stocks (with rationale) which could turn out to be multibaggers in the next 2-3 years?

A) Predicting multi-baggers in advance is tough. However, we like following themes and sectors in the market today:

Private Banks: Shift from physical to financial assets coupled with value migration from public to private sector banks provide multiple years of visibility for earnings growth. Our top ideas include HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, Yes Bank, RBL.

Consumption: The consumption opportunity in India is sizeable and there are multiple ways to play this opportunity. GST implementation will hasten the shift towards organized players and benefit multiple categories.

We like discretionary Consumption themes and prefer companies like Titan, Pidilite, Tata Motors, Crompton Consumer, Amara Raja.

Pharmaceuticals: Most of the negatives around regulatory issues, base price erosion in the US, buyer consolidation in the US are known and are in the price. The sector is trading at a 12% discount to its average multiples.

While near term could be challenging, we believe it offers a good entry point from a medium to long term perspective. We like Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma, and Jubilant Life.

Q) Gush of liquidity has already pushed markets across the globe to fresh highs. What are your views on global markets and experts say that a big correction in India market can only be triggered if there is a global trigger? What are your views?

A) Global triggers for correction are difficult to foresee but tightening of liquidity globally can have implications for India and other emerging markets.

However, we believe that globally lot of capital is still sitting on very low-interest rates and will always be hunting for yields till interest rates remain soft.

Q) What are your views on the companies which have reported results for the quarter ended June so far. Do you think the numbers are largely on expected lines? A recent poll did by Moneycontrol highlighted that analysts expect more downgrades than upgrades this quarter?

A) So far the numbers declared by the companies have been in line with expectations. For the 28 companies in our MOSL universe which have declared results so far, PAT growth has come in at 7.7% vs. expectations of 8% while EBITDA growth of 9.3% if bang in-line with estimates.

More than the number, we will be keenly watching the commentary of companies on GST implementation and any teething troubles, consumer demand, de-stocking/re-stocking as it will have implications for the rest of FY18 earnings growth for broader markets even as Nifty remains relatively insulated from GST impact.

Q) How are you seeing ITC stocks after a recent increase in cess by the government? Do you think the smart money will move out of ITC to other stocks like HUL, Britannia etc?

A) Some re-allocation of flows within the sector is a possibility given the sharp outperformance of ITC in recent months. Fundamentally, the U-turn on Cigarette taxation has created fresh headwinds for ITC in terms of Cig volume and EBIT growth from near term perspective and could lead to some de-rating.

On the other hand, strong rural consumption outlook owing to good monsoons, 7th pay commission awards, best in five year MSP hike and farm loan waiver will be positive for other consumer names like Britannia, Emami, Dabur, Colgate, and HUL.

Q) Investors grapple with fear of investing at peak. What do you tell your clients to calm their fears?

A) Peaks and bottoms are known only in hindsight. Systematic investments in fundamentally sound companies with growing addressable market, good pricing power which accords earnings visibility, high-quality managements and reasonable entry valuations is a strong antidote to overcome the fear of investing at peak.

Q) If somebody comes with you with a monthly investment of Rs15000-20000 to realise his crorepati dream. Can he realise his dream by investing in direct equities or it is better to go via MF route? What is minimum capital required to start trading?

A) It is better to go via mutual fund route if one is not equipped to spend enough time in the market and understand the various nuances of investing. Fortunes have been made in Indian equity markets with patient and long term investing in good quality companies bought at reasonable price.

Time spent in the market is far more important than timing the market. There is no minimum capital required for trading. It depends on one’s disposable income and risk appetite.

Q) Any particular instance you recall when you were interacting with your clients which were funny or made you think twice about the problem or taught you something?

A) One thing which interacting with a diverse set of clients has taught me is that Investing by looking at one year forward P/E is a sure shot way of missing multi-year compounders and eventually potential multi-baggers.

Second, patience in investing and ability to think away from the herd is something which is easier to preach but tough to practice.

Q) Do you relate any particular Hollywood sitcom with the market? For example, some analysts have related Game of Throne with US markets while some have written on investment lessons from movie Bahubali. Do you also relate stock market to any movie or a serial?

A) I relate to the stock market to a test match in cricket where one has to survive tough sessions and stay at the crease long enough to create records and take the team through to victory.

In test cricket a batsman has to be patient, bide his time when the bowler is in his elements in hostile condition and protect his wicket before scoring runs. Similarly in investments, one has to first avoid capital loss before thinking of multi-baggers.

Q) What are your views on the upcoming Fed meeting next week and RBI policy meet in the month of August? Do you see Fed raising rates in the upcoming policy meet or RBI reducing rates next month?

A) Predicting Macros is always difficult, more so when there are multiple moving parts and global liquidity is abundant. That said, we think RBI may decide to cut rates given the well-entrenched moderation in CPI print and continued stable currency dynamics. As far as Fed is concerned, we will be more interested in knowing the future course of normalizing its balance sheet.",1287,0.32641434243747164

Debt in the balance sheets of most public sector banks may not get drastically reduced as bankers expect less than 50 percent recovery of the loans under insolvency.

A month after the insolvency and bankruptcy process kick-started, three companies -- Jyoti Structures, Monnet Ispat and Energy and Alok Industries -- have been admitted into proceedings by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the company court.

A senior State Bank of India executive said, “Insolvency is a process which has empowered us to take decisions. The real test is yet to be seen but I do not expect much recovery in the loans as most of them have been NPAs for more than 2-3 years now. In some cases there may be recovery of up to 50 percent but in some EPC (engineering, procurement, Construction) companies, the economic situation in itself is not conducive.”

On June 13, the Reserve Bank of India identified these companies and nine others including Essar Steel, Bhushan Steel and Electrosteel Steels and Amtek Auto to be immediately filed under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

Dipak Gupta, Joint Managing Director at Kotak Mahindra Bank, on the sidelines of the bank’s results announcement, said, “Insolvency is a long shot…It’s like a bullet that is released from the gun once the case is admitted by the NCLT. The purpose ultimately is recovery. It remains to be seen how much of it will happen as there is limited time after the court starts the insolvency proceedings. So, unless we get a good buyer or restructure it, recovery could be long drawn.”

However, Gupta is hopeful that this process would bring in more definite decision-making and the promoter also has something to lose.

There is a considerable fact that Indian banks also need to accept significant hair-cuts that will be required to be taken in order to arrive at a resolution as several of the NPA cases are in sectors where market conditions are still stressed, such as steel, power and textiles.

Lenders may have to forget 60 percent of its outstanding dues or about Rs 2.4 lakh crore from top 50 stressed companies that could not repay their loans leading to insolvency battles, said a Crisil rating agency’s analysis. Total value of bad loans from that universe is about Rs 4 lakh crore.

A majority of the debt requiring deep haircuts belong to companies with unsustainable businesses so asset sales are necessary to recover monies. Companies needing moderate or aggressive haircuts had gone for debt-funded programmes.

""Some of these assets offer M&A opportunities for companies with strong credit profiles,"" said Ramesh Karunakaran, Director, Crisil Ratings. “Also, potential synergies could allow for a significant reduction in haircut – an aspect that has not been considered in our analysis.”

Finding a new buyer to run the company with the same expertise in this environment at a price acceptable to both creditors and the buyers is a tough nut to crack.

At the end of it, it would be how to reduce the losses on NPAs and create a reform such that it would deter future potential defaulters, the SBI executive added.",530,-0.4749481678009033

There was much relief in store for the banking sector this past week after Essar Steel’s case was dismissed by the Gujarat High Court on Monday.

This provided a big boost to banks which have filed cases against defaulting firms under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Now, there is a better chance they will be heard.

Additionally, the National Company Law Tribunal also decided to not give adjournments of beyond one week while hearing such cases. Loaded with multiple petitions filed under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC), which became operational in December last year, the government and RBI will force the court to fast-track the proceedings.

Further, State Bank of India was asked by the NCLT to take the Monnet Ispat and Energy's case with ""seriousness"" after there was confusion over its default and the amount.

The next day, NCLT admitted the case after SBI clarified the default amount to be Rs 1,539 crore, which would be claimed by the bank. Also, with SBI refusing to accept the offer terms of JSW Steel, which agreed to make an offer bid to buy the bad assets, the steel firm will be making a fresh offer.

No closure, Only merger!

After a series of whatsapp messages circulated on various groups on closure of nine banks, the Finance Ministry and the Reserve Bank asked consumers not to get swayed by such rumours. The nine banks are only put under supervision due to the weakness the bank is undergoing in the last one year

The government is also considering merger of several of the 21 public sector banks to reduce the number of banks to about 10-12 in a few years and about 3-4 big global banks eventually.

However, bank unions are not too pleased with the idea given that they are not too hopeful of mergers strengthening the weaker banks.

ICICI Bank, country’s largest private lender, started offering personal loans of up to Rs 15 lakh at ATMs for a fixed tenure of 60 months based on pre-checked CIBIL scores.

SBI and PE investor Carlyle Group announced that it would buy GE Capital Group’s entire 26 percent stake in SBI Card.

Following the transaction, SBI and Carlyle will own 74 percent and 26 percent, respectively, in each of the two entities. Further details of the transactions were not disclosed. According to reports, Carlyle was in talks to buy the 26 percent stake for Rs 2,000 crore.

Kotak and India Bank post financial results

On the results front, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Indian Bank reported their financial performance for the first quarter from April to June for fiscal year 2017-18.

Kotak posted a 23 percent year-on-year rise in its standalone June quarter net profit at Rs 913 crore.

Kotak has an exposure of Rs 236 crore to four of the 12 large bad loan accounts referred by the RBI to be filed at the NCLT on priority.

The mid-sized lender also said its shareholders have approved raising up to Rs 65,000 crore to fund business expansion.

While south-based Indian Bank’s profit increased 21 percent to Rs 372 crore in June quarter despite higher provisions, its asset quality improved during the quarter as gross non-performing assets declined to 7.21 percent from 7.47 percent and net NPAs declined to 4.05 percent from 7.39 percent.",584,-0.1714065596461296

Edelweiss' research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s (KMB) Q1FY18 performance was marked by delivery on loan growth at 18% YoY (moving to pre-merger levels suggesting synergy benefits). This along with superior NIMs (4.5%, commendably sustained through merger exercise) and strong core fees helped KMB register robust core revenue momentum. Meanwhile, higher opex (marketing cost on “811”) and lower treasury led to below estimated PAT. Asset quality continued to hold forth - overall stress (GNPLs + restructured) was stable at 2.6% with credit cost at <60bps (commendably through entire integration process, AQR among others). Liability franchise continued to strengthen with average SA jumping >40% YoY, keeping CASA ratio at ~44%. With limited levers in credit cost and opex, revenue traction improvement will be key for RoE improvement (recent capital raising will keep RoEs capped at low mid teens). Maintain ‘HOLD’ as valuations, at 3.7x FY19E P/ABV (standalone), factor in fair bit of upside.

Outlook

Q1FY18 suggests strong beginning to the year with green shoots visible in terms of synergy benefits, both on cost and revenue fronts. Performance of other subsidiaries was broadly in line with estimates. With significant benefits likely to flow from formalisation of financial savings, subsidiaries could see strong business tailwinds. With recent equity infusion (INR58bn), leveraging of this capital in financing business and efficient allocation across other businesses will be critical for RoE improvement. Valuations at 3.7x FY19E P/ABV (std. for RoE of 16% by FY19E) factor in fair bit of upside. Hence, we maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ with revised TP of INR 1,001 (earlier INR896), factoring recent capital raising.

It is time to be stock specific, maybe that’s the approach mutual fund managers are taking right now at a time when the market trades near record highs. The Nifty50 which has come off slightly from its record high but has gained over 17 percent so far in the year 2017.

Fund managers remained selective when they shopped for stocks in the month of May. They remained net buyers in 65 percent of the Nifty50 stocks, Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Stocks in which funds have more than 2 percent stake include names like Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Power Grid, Infosys, TCS, L&T, State Bank of India, ITC, M&M, ICICI Bank, Eicher Motors etc. among others.

Among the Nifty50 names, highest net buying in the month of May on a month-on-month (MoM) basis was witnessed in Vedanta (up 27 percent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 17 percent) and Tech Mahindra (up 17 percent).

The Equity asset under management (AUM) rose for the sixth consecutive month in May to scale a new high of Rs 5.2 trillion, highlighted the report.

In the month of May, MFs showed interest in private banks, metals, consumer, technology, auto and infrastructure — these sectors saw a MoM increase in weights.

Among the Nifty50 names, top conviction buys include names like HDFC Bank where almost 19 funds have more than 2 percent exposure, followed by ICICI Bank with 16 funds having an exposure of 2 percent and 12 funds have exposure to State Bank of India.

Almost 5 funds have exposure in both Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC while 4 funds have exposure in Yes Bank and 3 funds have holdings in Axis Bank.

Rate sensitive stocks have been fund managers’ darling in the last few months especially private sector banks. Private Banks sectoral weight rose 17.3 percent which as the top sector holding in May, followed by Auto (10.7 percent), Capital Goods (8.7 percent) and NBFC (7 percent).

“Since banks are a play on the economy, they can sustain earnings growth for a long time. Particularly, ICICI Bank is attractively valued while HDFC and Kotak are high-quality stocks that have a track record of delivering superior returns,” Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

Among the IT or technology sector names Infosys remained in the spotlight. Despite global headwinds which have contracted margin for some of the top IT companies, almost 11 funds have holdings of more than 2 percent in Infosys while for TCS it is just 1 fund.

Mutual funds are betting on stocks which have good earnings visibility are stocks from sectors like IT and pharma which are facing some headwinds are valued very low.

Some quality names in both these segments are available at attractive valuations which are attracting smart money into these stocks.

“Clarity from Managements of IT majors on underperformance has helped to rope in some Bargain Hunters into the sector,” Rajesh Shanbhag, Advisory Head – Alternate Channels, Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“However, Indian Prime Minister’s meet with US President which is scheduled for this month-end will be closely watched where the H1 B VISA issue is to be addressed,” he said.",543,0.9866700427872794

The total category wise asset under management (AUM) of the mutual fund (MF) industry slipped by 1.2 percent or Rs 22,327 crore to Rs 19.03 lakh crore for the month of May 2017, but equity funds saw an increase of 2.7 percent in the same period.

Of the top 10 stocks in terms of value increase on a month-on-month (MoM) basis, four were from Financials namely ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and HDFC.

Apart from rate sensitive stocks, companies which hogged the limelight in the month of May include names like ITC, Infosys, Tata Steel, Maruti Suzuki, L&T and Vedanta.

Retail investors stepped up the purchase in the month of May as benchmark indices hit a fresh record high. The Nifty50 rose 3.4 percent in the same period.

“Major changes over the month in terms of a number of shares has happened in Kotak Bank and HDFC. In the case of Kotak Bank it has happened because of QIP of 6.2 cr shares during the month (out of which MFs added 1.62 cr shares in the month),” Deepak Jasani, Head - Retail Research, HDFC Securities told Moneycontrol.

“In the case of HDFC, MFs would have added positions due to the whole sector coming under the limelight in May 2017. Among other sectors, MFs bought Shares of metal companies like Tata Steel, Vedanta, JSW Steel, Hind Zinc and Hindalco as the outlook on these companies improved,” he said.

The AUM of Equity Fund increased by 2.7 percent or Rs 13,394 crore to Rs 5.18 lakh crore for the month of May 2017 over April 2017, IDBI Capital said in a report.

The assets of ELSS increased by 2.2 percent or by Rs 1,393 crore to a Rs65,192 crore, meanwhile Equity Fund registered net inflow of Rs10,208 crore and ELSS Fund saw a net inflow of Rs 531 crore, said the report.

Equity schemes witnessed inflows of Rs102 billion in May – the highest since June 2015. Equity AUM, as a percentage of total AUM, rose 100bps on a month-on-month basis to 27.2 percent in May. Equity AUM accounts for 4.1 percent of India’s market capitalization.

The month saw a notable change in the sector and stock allocation of funds. On a month-on-month (MoM) basis, the weights of private banks, metals, consumer, technology, auto and infrastructure increased, while those of healthcare, oil & gas, PSU Banks, cement, capital goods and utilities showed signs of moderation.

ICICI Bank, one of the preferred stocks among MFs in May, saw net buying by 10 funds. The value increased by Rs42.4b and the stock gained 17 percent for the month.

“Since banks are a play on the economy, they can sustain earnings growth for a long time. Particularly, ICICI Bank is attractively valued while HDFC and Kotak are high-quality stocks that have a track record of delivering superior returns,” Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“Expectation of rate cut is one factor, but that has already been factored in. In 2017 only one cut of 25bp can be expected,” he said.

There was good buying seen by MFs in the midcaps space. Fund managers increased their stake in Apollo Hospitals, Dabur India, Voltas, Hindalco, Power Grid etc. among others.

Vedanta, which entered the Nifty-50, was also one of the preferred stocks among MFs in May, with net buying by 14 funds. In the auto space, MF increased their stake in Tata Motors, and Hero Motocorp.

“The recent actions from States on Farm Loan Waivers shows Government's clear focus on rural India growth, the same was visible in the Financial Budget. This should help in rural demand for Autos and Two wheelers which got a setback post demonetisation,” Rajesh Shanbhag, Advisory Head – Alternate Channels, Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Further good monsoon favouring India should also add icing on the cake for the sector,” he said.

There was some value buying seen in technology space as fund managers lapped up Infosys as well as TCS in the month of May.

“Stocks having good earnings visibility are very highly valued while stocks in industries like IT and pharma which are facing some headwinds are valued very low,” said Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services.

“Some quality names in both these segments are available at attractive valuations. There is the high margin of safety in these stocks at the present valuations,” he said.",742,0.9561078429222107

At a time when there is a lot of regulatory overhang in the public sector banks (PSU), fund managers were busy pouring money into private sector banks in the month of May for second consecutive month in a row to a 1 year high of 17.3 percent.

The month of May saw a notable change in the sector and stock allocation of funds. On a month-on-month basis (MoM), the weights of private banks rose, Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Private Banks maintained its positive momentum for the second consecutive month to attain a high of 17.3 percent up over 90bps on a MoM basis and 30 bps above May 2016 weight of 17 percent.

Top three gainers in the private banking space include names like ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and HDFC Bank which saw huge buying interest by fund managers in the month of May.

There is a general feeling that small and midcaps are excessively valued. Consequently, funds are switching from small and midcaps to largecaps.

“Within large caps, banks are being favoured since they are expected to do well when the economy goes into a higher growth trajectory. Since banks are a play on the economy, they can sustain earnings growth for a long time,” Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“Particularly, ICICI Bank is attractively valued while HDFC and Kotak are high-quality stocks that have a track record of delivering superior returns. The expectation of rate cut is one factor, but that has already been factored in. In 2017 only one cut of 25 basis points can be expected,” he said.

There is another reason why private banks are attractive investors’ attention apart from stable asset quality and that is their share which has increased up to 30 percent.

Private banks’ market share growth in deposits increased sharply, and the best in recent history, at 180 bps in FY2016, a report highlighted.

“After the global financial crisis, which had some ripple effects in India, we have again started to see an acceleration in market share gains in savings account by private banks,” Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report.

FY2016 saw an improvement of 130 bps on a year-on-year (YoY) basis as compared to 100 bps in FY2015, 80 bps in FY2014 and 70 bps in FY2013. It is going to be extremely challenging to reverse these gains as the decline is being driven by public banks with SBI maintaining a healthy share,” it said.

The report further added that the private banks have 30 percent share in North, West and South India and they are steadily penetrating in Central India, which is a large market for savings deposits.",459,0.6233981576832858

Large issues by banks have pushed the value of qualified institutional placements (QIP) in just six months since January to over Rs 31,000 crore compared to Rs 31,684 crore for the full year 2014.

Prime Database, a leading market tracker, says 13 companies managed to raise Rs31,406 crore through QIPs in less than six months.

QIP is a tool used by listed companies to raise capital from its domestic markets by selling securities - shares, debentures or any securities convertible into stocks. The listed companies are not required to submit any pre-issue filings.

“QIPs are a bull market phenomenon. In a depressed market, you will hardly see QIPs, but in a bull market, when the markets are seeing new highs, you will definitely see high activity. It is a very good time for issuers,” Prithvi Haldea, Chairman of Prime Database group, told Mint.

The QIPs surge is driven by large offerings by State Bank of India which raised Rs 15,000 crore last week in the largest QIP in the country. Similarly, the largest QIP by a private sector bank was launched by Kotak Mahindra Bank which raised Rs 5,803 crore.

Experts told Mint investors who are convinced about financial services being the key recipient of the economy's growth and believe India's political stability is here to stay, are investing in bank QIPs.

On the other hand, the issuers are keen to replenish capital on their balance sheets.

""Valuations of many private sector banks is at a cyclical peak which helps them raise capital with limited equity dilution,"" Munish Aggarwal, director at investment bank Equirus Capital, told Mint.

Experts also pointed out that flows from both FPI (foreign portfolio investors) and DII (domestic institutional investor) have revived this year for the first time since the Lehman crisis. According to Kotak Capital Co. flows may together touch USD 30 billion.",318,0.7080812354882559

Kotak Mahindra Bank's promoter Uday Kotak today sold 1.8 crore shares of the private sector lender for a little over Rs 1,687 crore, bringing down his stake to below 30 per cent to meet the RBI directive.

The shares were purchased by several entities, including Canadian pension fund -- Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec -- and Fidelity Funds.

According to bulk deal data available with the BSE, Uday Kotak, Vice Chairman and Managing Director, sold a total of 1.8 crore shares, amounting to 0.95 percent stake of the bank.

The shares were offloaded on an average price of Rs 937.35, valuing the transaction at Rs 1,687.23 crore, the data showed.

Following the transaction, Kotak's personal stake in the bank declined to 29.79 percent from 30.74 percent.

Earlier in March, Kotak had sold 1.5 percent shares of the private sector lender to two Canadian pension funds for an estimated Rs 2,255 crore through open market transactions.

The stake sale by Kotak is part of an effort to comply with RBI's directive.

The lender has been asked by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to bring down its promoter shareholding to 30 per cent by June 30, 2017.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked banks to improve their banking systems including their ATM networks with a Windows security update to enhance security and protect them from the malware attack that took place over the weekend.

Ransomware or popularly known as WannaCry, ravaged computer systems in over 150 countries, locking up critical data. The hackers dubbed Shadow Brokers promised to free up the data files only after USD 300 dollars were paid in bitcoins. While the spread of the virus has slowed over the weekend, more than 2 lakh computers have been affected so far.

Even as most banks suggest they are not infected, they are required to upgrade their systems with the latest Windows “patches” as a precautionary measure.

Bankers and ATM operators suggest that ATMs work in isolation and are not exposed to the internet on which the malware has roamed free.

Meanwhile, many ATMs may remain closed for software updates as they are seen as being vulnerable since almost all of them are run on Windows software. Also, over 60 percent of the total 2.25 lakh ATMs in the country operate on the outdated Windows XP.

An ATM operator said ATMs may not be as susceptible to this particular attack as there is no data stored in the ATMs which the attackers can hold to ransom. At the most, it can stop ATM functions.

A senior Bank of Baroda official said, “ATMs, mobile applications and core banking solutions work on closed networks, so this attack may not directly impact them. We have updated our patches on an immediate basis under the RBI’s directions. RBI even asked us to get our anti-virus, firewalls and other security measures updated.”

A Kotak Mahindra Bank spokeperson said, “The bank has robust security controls to guard against various cyber-attacks. We have an on-going process of identifying risks and enhancing controls. We monitor our systems round the clock, and our systems and ATMs are well secured. We have educated our employees on the issue, and are keeping them updated on the secure operations of systems. Action has been taken to validate our systems to ensure that they are protected with appropriate patches against ransomware. We have not encountered any incident due to this attack.”

According to another banker, many banks work on outdated systems for not so important functions due to high costs attached to upgrading. Some smaller branches at remote locations may not be working on updated systems and, hence, could be vulnerable.

Microsoft has issued a statement saying that it has developed and released a special update for Windows XP although this particular version of its operating system is no longer serviced by the company.

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) today said the newly launched 811 digital banking platform has received huge response and the service would help the bank in doubling its customer base in the next 18 to 24 months.

According to a senior KMB official, the 811 banking platform, which allows customers to do various banking activities through the mobile App, would serve as the ""primary vehicle"" to double the existing customer base.

""As against last year, we are seeing a growth of 143 percent in our digital transactions this year. It shows that India is convincingly moving towards a digital economy after Centre's demonetisation decision in November last year,"" said Ambuj Chandna, Head-Retail Liabilities, Investments & Payment Products.

""From the current 8 million customers, we are now eyeing to double our customer base to 16 million in the next 18 to 24 months. And, 811 service, which was launched one month ago, will be the primary vehicle to do that journey"" Chandna told reporters here.

He said that 811, inspired from the November 8, 2016 note-ban decision, allows customers to open a zero balance account using the bank's mobile application.

According to Chandna, there is clear shift in the way people are using their bank accounts after demonetisation last year.

""In many ways, India is becoming less cash and more digital. 52 percent of our customers use computers or mobile phones for doing transactions.

""Out of them, 54 percent only used mobile phones and never visited our bank branches,"" he said.

Majority of the new customers who are opening 811 bank accounts are below 40 years of age.",276,0.9995831847190857

The banking sector this week saw a few major private banks announced their financial results for the January to March quarter and the full fiscal year 2017.

Several banks reported higher bad loans — a pain point for the industry which has been battling slowdown in economic activity and stalled projects over the past two years. Banks including HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, IDFC Bank posted increase in their gross non-performing assets (NPAs), however, portrayed a promising financial year 2018.

Also, the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) asset classification guidelines to provide more for the good loans which have potential stress didn't impact most of the banks.

HDFC Bank

For HDFC Bank, country’s second largest bank by asset size, profit grew by 18 percent but it also reduced its employee base through less recruitment and expansion during the year.

HDFC Bank reported 18.25 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit to Rs 3,990.09 crore which was higher than the CNBC-TV18 estimate of Rs 3,966.60 crore. The private sector bank reported a net profit of Rs 3374.22 crore in the year-ago period.

Also, the bank cut employee strength for the second straight quarter on the back of its digital outreach and slower branch expansion. The bank's staff strength has fallen by 6,096 or 7 percent to 84,325 in the quarter ended March 2017 from 90,421 in December 2016.

Aditya Puri, HDFC Bank's CEO, said he sees the bank to be in the sweet spot in the economy and that the best in loan growth is yet to come.

Axis Bank

HDFC Bank's peer Axis Bank, third-largest private bank in terms of asset size, posted a 43 percent slump in its net profit at Rs 1,225 crore due to worsening asset quality woes. However, it managed to halve fresh accretion of bad loans from its peak levels.

The bank plans to close its Rs 9,436 crore watch-list of bad loans by the end of 2018, even as challenges continue into the year ahead.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank didn’t disappoint the Street with its high quality earnings performance for the March 2017 quarter. However, the business growth numbers were significantly softer compared to some of its peers. While being more than adequately capitalised (capital adequacy ratio 16.8 percent), the caution from this savvy bank is intriguing.

The country's fourth-largest private bank posted robust results even as some loans inherited from the ING Vysya merger soured. The private bank saw a 40 percent increase in its net profit for the March quarter at Rs 976.5 crore, driven by other income, operating income and net interest income.

IDFC Bank

New age lender IDFC Bank’s net profit inched up by 7 percent and was helped by asset sale worth Rs 2,000 crore during the quarter.

The infrastructure heavyweight plans to expand its retail book which has been the growth area for all banks given the untapped market in the banking services space.

IDFC Bank, which set up its banking operations in 2015, is now aggressively betting on the ""Bharat"" banking segment for the next 2-3 years. Listing out the bank's medium-term goals, Rajiv Lall, MD and CEO of IDFC Bank said they plan ""to systematically build a mass retail bank in the next 24-36 months"".

Bandhan Bank

The Kolkata-based Bandhan Bank which started banking operations just before IDFC Bank has been a micro financer and has been keen to expand its small and medium enterprises spot and capitalize on its retail and micro lending strength.

The private sector lender reported net profit of Rs 1,112 crore for the full year ending March 2017 on the back of healthy CASA (current and savings account) deposits and loan growth. For the fourth quarter, the net profit grew to Rs 323 crore from 142 crore a year ago.",640,0.17566976944605509

Edelweiss' research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

While synergy benefits are reflecting in cost metrics, key concern for KMB has been slower revenue traction, largely due to below-trend loan growth. Integration challenges in H1FY17 followed by demonetisation took a toll on 9mFY17 growth. However, Q4FY17 saw marked improvement with loan growth at 5% QoQ, largely on account of 8% QoQ spurt in business banking.

Outlook

With significant benefit likely to flow from formalisation of financial savings, the subsidiaries could see strong business tailwinds. Valuations at 3.9x FY19E P/ABV (std. for RoE of 16% by FY19E) factor in a fair bit of upside. Hence, we maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ with target price of INR 896.

Following its stable set of numbers for the March quarter, Kotak Mahindra Bank was slightly weaker due to brokerage views.

Analysts tracking the stock, though retained their positive calls, but largely held on to their target price.

Goldman Sachs maintained a buy rating on the stock due to favourable risk reward. Based on the bank’s results on Thursday, it observed that business banking saw the strongest QoQ growth since its merger with ING Vysya. Further, it feels that cost-to- income ratio could improve to 44.3 percent by FY19. Higher NPLs and lower growth could be the key risks to the stock, it added.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy call on the stock and called it one of its top picks. It also raised the target to Rs 1,090 from Rs 1,050. Furthermore, it believes that the lender can continue to trade at similar multiples one year out.

Based on the bank’s results, it cheered the revenue during March quarter beating estimates, comfortable asset quality, and downward trend in credit costs as well as growth in loan book. Going forward, it expects benefits of the integration with ING Vysya in growth, CASA and credit costs as well.

However, Nomura has maintained a neutral stance on the stock, but increased the target price to Rs 975 from Rs 917. It also raised earnings estimates by 5-7 percent for FY18 and FY19, driven mainly by cost improvement. The global brokerage firm prefers HDFC Bank within retail banks.

Jefferies, meanwhile, has a hold rating on the stock with an increased target price to Rs 930 from Rs 845. While weak growth, asset quality, valuation are the key downside risks, stronger loan growth, lower credit costs are key upside risks.

The stock gained over 3 percent in the past one month, while its three-day gain stood at 0.45 percent. At 14:57 hrs, the stock was quoting at Rs 902.20, down Rs 12.35, or 1.35 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week high of Rs 922.00.",344,0.25746603310108185

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) on Friday announced that it is buying out British partner Old Mutual's entire 26 percent stake in its life insurance arm for Rs 1,292.7 crore.

""In line with its philosophy to deepen and expand in Indian financial services, KMB has entered into an agreement to purchase the entire 26 per cent equity stake held by Old Mutual in Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance for a consideration of Rs 1,292.7 crore,"" the bank said in a statement.

The buyout is subject to regulatory and other approvals, and will result in the Kotak Mahindra Group holding 100 per cent equity in Kotak Life, it said.

The life insurance joint venture was formed in 2001 with Kotak owning 74 per cent and the rest being with the British partner.

Over the time, there has been a liberalisation in foreign holding caps in the insurance sector to 49 per cent and many foreign entities have increased their holdings.

KMB's president for asset management, insurance and international business Gaurang Shah said the two partners have had a ""fruitful relationship"" over the past 16 years.

""India is in an exciting phase of its economic journey and the financial services sector, especially the insurance sector, is poised for significant growth. Kotak Life will continue to leverage this opportunity,"" Shah said.

The announcement comes within a month of the bank announcing a plan to raise up to Rs 5,000 crore through a share sale, amid a string speculations that it may be in the market looking for acquisition opportunities in the banking space.

KMB's executive vice chairman and managing director Uday Kotak had confirmed their interest in inorganic growth opportunities and said that they will also look to deploy the capital in the stressed assets management space.

The KMB board had approved a proposal to raise equity capital by issuing up to 6.2 crore shares of Rs 5 each, through a rights issue, public issue, private placement, including a qualified institutional placement, or any other permissible mode.

The capital raising will also help bring down the promoter family's holding in the bank to 31.1 percent. It has been mandated to get it down to 30 percent.

Announcing its earnings for FY 2016-17, Uday Kotak had said that the bank is working on multiple options and hopes to work out something ""sooner rather than later.",449,0.8843525350093842

Kotak Mahindra Bank, country's fourth largest private lender by assets, witnessed an uptick in bad loans in the fourth quarter of FY17 from the overhang of the ING Vysya Bank's books that they inherited two years ago.

Posting the annual and fourth quarter results on Thursday, the private bank saw a 40 percent increase in its net profit for the March quarter at Rs 976.5 crore, driven by other income, operating income and net interest income.

However, the asset quality deteriorated with a 12.6 percent rise in gross NPAs (non-performing assets) at Rs 3,578.6 crore and net NPAs jumped 24.6 percent to Rs 1,718.1 crore compared with previous quarter.

Uday Kotak, Executive Vice Chairman & Managing Director of Kotak Bank said a large portion of about 75-80 percent is from the ING Vysya book and the rest from the corporate accounts. ""So, we have virtually recognised all ING Vysya's stress,"" he said.

In percentage terms, Kotak Bank's gross NPAs were up to 2.59 percent of total loans from 2.36 percent a year ago and 2.42 percent in the previous quarter. Net NPAs worsened to 1.26 percent of total loans from 1.06 percent and 1.07 percent respectively.

Even as the bank maintained its credit costs on the lower side, the bad asset quality increased its provisioning costs.

However, Uday Kotak is upbeat on the situation from here on with its credit costs set to broadly decline. The costs have already seen a reduction to 61 bps (basis points) from 82 bps in March last year.

The retail-focused bank's corporate growth shrunk by 2 percent while retail saw annualised growth of 21 percent driven by demand for loans from agriculture, commercial vehicles and small business loans.

The bank expects the momentum in retail loans to continue in this financial year and this will drive the overall loan growth upwards of 20 percent, higher than the 15 percent growth last year.

The bank has been actively buying stressed assets and will continue to look at mergers and acquisitions to further its growth, Kotak reiterated.

In February this year, Kotak had urged the government to create an atmosphere which would boost hostile takeovers.

Kotak has always been vocal in being open to acquiring new entities and portfolios and stressed assets.

This also comes amid meeting RBI's regulatory mandate on bringing down its promoter shareholding to 30 percent by June this year from 32 percent currently.

This will also be helped by the fund raising of about Rs 5,300 crore which would be kick-started after shareholders' approval on May 9.",435,0.16641857028007506

While maintaining neutral rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank, JPMorgan has raised target price by 17 percent to Rs 875, mainly on higher implied price-to-book value.

""We are factoring in a fully leveraged return on equity for valuation, implicitly assuming that the excess capital will be utilised on a normalised basis. We are looking through the depressed near-term return on equity as we believe that the fortress balance sheet and high capital ratios is a strength in the current environment,"" it reasons.

Effective use of the capital will be a factor in the long-term, but not for the next 2-3 years, according to the research house.

The brokerage house says, ""Kotak Bank's exceptional performance on asset quality and strong capital position gives it a major competitive edge at this point in the cycle. The stock is reflecting that and has started to reverse its CY16 underperformance (around 10 percent) versus NSE BANK index.""

It thinks this is an opportune time to leverage this advantage and M&A would be an attractive option. A bank merger makes strategic sense, notwithstanding the potential integration risks, while portfolio acquisitions would be more immediately accretive, it feels.

The research firm says long term investors should stay in the stock though valuations could weigh on near-term performance.

It expects a sharp earnings bounceback from FY18.

""We forecast around 31 percent and 25 percent EPS growth for FY18/FY19, with cost-income and credit costs driving return on asset improvement. Loan growth is expected to bounce back to around 20 percent off a low base, but would still lag peers,"" it explains.",273,0.7151621409824916

Private lender Axis Bank has touched 1 million micro-borrowers mark and is not keen on acquiring stake in any microlender, a senior official has said.

Three years after getting into the segment, the bank touched 1 million borrowers mark recently and all of them are women who have availed of credit through the joint lending group model, Axis Bank's retail banking head Rajiv Anand told PTI.

Stating that the book stands at Rs 1,100 crore now, he hinted that the bank will focus on expanding the business organically rather than buying into a microfinance company.

""As of now, we don't believe there is any need for us to take on any equity stake in an MFI,"" Anand said.

It can be noted that other lenders like Kotak Mahindra Bank and IDFC Bank, among others have acquired stakes in MFIs, while IndusInd Bank is in talks with Bharat Financial (formerly SKS) for what can be one of the biggest acquisitions in the space.

As many as 90 per cent of Axis Bank's borrowers have been tapped by the bank's dedicated team of 1,600 people, while the rest have come from intermediaries, Anand said.

The average ticket size of its micro loans is Rs 18,000 and there is a three-tier rate structure with interest ranging from 12 to 22 per cent, he said, asserting that this is a ""profitable"" business for the bank.

Axis Bank is present in 18 states with its microlending offerings and is targeting to take it to 22 states by 2020, he added.

Even as the bank faces regulatory action for alleged irregularities during the note-ban period, Anand said he is ""proud"" of the work done by his retail banking staff.

Anand said the average transactions jumped four times of the usual during the period, and the bank also had to work with the rules getting changed every day almost.

Asserting that Axis Bank is not the only one to have been found of indulging in irregularities, Anand admitted that ""there have been a few stray incidents and we have a zero tolerance on such issues. Strictest action has been taken against all those indulged in irregularities.""

He also said, speculation of the bank merging with another one does not have any bearing on its expansion strategies, underlining that such talk has been denied.

Even as the advent of digital banking raises concerns on the relevance of the network-led model, Anand said 90 per cent of customers for the banking system do not use digital alternatives.

Private sector Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) today announced plans to float an infrastructure debt fund.

The Uday Kotak-led bank, which received a board approval recently to raise over Rs 5,000 crore, said it has obtained the RBI nod for floating a subsidiary to manage the fund.

""The RBI has issued a certificate of registration to Kotak Infrastructure Debt Fund Ltd, a subsidiary of the bank, permitting it to commence the business of non-banking financial institution as infrastructure debt fund (NBC-IDF),"" the lender said in a regulatory filing this evening.

It can be noted that the country's fourth largest private sector lender has so far stayed away from lending in the infrastructure segment.

The RBI had floated this vehicle in 2013, allowing banks and non-banks to float IDFs for meeting the requirements of the infrastructure sector.

According to the RBI, IDFs are envisaged as vehicles for refinancing existing debt of infrastructure firm, thereby creating fresh headroom for banks to lend to fresh projects.

At present, three IDFs are in operation, promoted by ICICI Bank, IDFC and Larsen & Toubro.

Fast-growing Kotak Mahindra Bank wants to play the role of a consolidator in the banking sector, calling for “shout-outs” from potential sellers.

“We are actively looking at the role of a consolidator in the whole gamut of financial services,""' said Jaimin Bhatt, Chief Financial Officer at Kotak Mahindra Bank. ""This goes beyond banking. We are looking at consolidation opportunities in banking, NBFCs (non-banking financial companies), insurance – both life and general, mutual funds, stock broking or any role that we have been in.”

In 2015, Kotak, the fourth largest private sector bank now, completed its merger with ING Vysya Bank for about Rs 15,000 crore in an all-stock deal, the biggest merger in the banking sector space.

“One of the good things with the ING acquisition is that we are certainly more active now and having done that we have reasonable comfort that we do get a shout-out in the industry,"" said Bhatt. ""Yes, we are interested and it could be companies, portfolios, asset pools or even in the microfinance space which we have already done previously and any other of such segments would be interesting.”

Bhatt admits to have received quite a few shout-outs, which the bank is continuously evaluating.

Uday Kotak, Vice-Chairman of Kotak Mahindra Bank, said last week he was a ""big believer in the consolidation theory"".

On Sunday, he said there will be strong consolidation in the financial services sector and eventually only five players will dominate the space.

Last week, amid buzz of a merger announcement, Kotak Mahindra Bank launched its 811 digital banking strategy, which involves a zero balance and zero charges mobile platform aimed at doubling its customer base from the current 8 million.

The following day, the bank’s board approved a proposal to raise equity capital worth about Rs 5,300 crore by issuing up to 6.2 crore shares of Rs 5 each. The closing price of Kotak’s shares on the day of the announcement was Rs 865 per share.

The total dilution impact on the equity owing to this fund raising would be 3.3 percent.

Also, after it received a communication from the Reserve Bank on February 1, Kotak requires the bank to rejig shareholding pattern to bring down promoter stake to 30 percent by June 2017.

The capital raising will partly serve that purpose. It will bring down the promoters’ stake in the lender to 31.1 percent from 32.11 percent as on today.

From the 811 initiative, Bhatt sees acquisition cost of new customers to be down by 75 percent with its digital initiatives.

Bhatt said, “Basically, the big advantage of getting customers through this route (811) against the traditional route of getting the full KYC (know your customer) done is the cost of acquisition. If I get him (customer) through the regular traditional means i.e. the physical documentation, originals verified, reaching out through sales teams and advertisements, etc…the cost of getting this done would be significantly higher at about Rs 5,000 plus.”

On the other hand, he said the customers on 811 come to Kotak on their own with just PAN and Aadhaar card and the cost of acquiring at that stage is less than Rs 100.

The 811 customers are not allowed to use ATMs and get only virtual debit cards to make online or digital payments. The account holder gets total credits (or loans) up to Rs 2 lakh in a financial year and maximum balance not exceeding Rs 1 lakh.

However, to go beyond the limitations and avail larger benefits from a full-fledged bank account, the customer, after producing the full KYC proof and coming on board, the cost then comes to 25 percent of Rs 5,000.

“This is about Rs 1000. So there is significant cost saving in getting a customer as against the traditional way which is Rs 5000 plus,” Bhatt adds.",647,0.5201728790998459

Motilal Oswal's report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Steps directed at addressing the limitations: KBL’s lower margin profile is an outcome of its lower loan to deposit ratio (LDR) and limited reduction in deposit rates. However, with the continued approach towards addressing this inefficiency which led to improvement over FY13-16, we expect the bank’s NIM trajectory inch further up to 2.9% by end-FY19 (from 2.6% in FY16). Based on our calculations, the following factors would contribute to NIM expansion, a) further reduction in the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) exposure (positive 8bps impact), b) increase in LDR (positive 8bps impact), and c) further enhancement in the overall CASA proportion (8bps positive impact).

Outlook

We initiate coverage on Karnataka Bank (KBL), with a Buy rating and TP of Rs170. This franchise, contrary to market perception, merits consideration for its inherent strengths as evident in its business ratios. We expect the bank’s efforts to further enrich these ratios, which will push up RoA / RoE to 1.0% / 14.4% by end-FY19, best ever since FY09. Banks with improved earnings quality, higher credit growth and efficient capital consumption tend to graduate into higher valuation multiples and we see a similar kind of re-rating due for KBL. BUY.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

CLSA has maintained an outperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 920. The research firm believes that the bank’s strong asset quality and healthy growth supports valuations and a clarity on strategic positioning will further support it.

The bank may look at mergers and acquisitions (M&A) among non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), insurance companies and asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), it said. On the lender’s fundraising plan, it believes the amount is less with respect to expectations, but does not lower the chances of a big acquisition.

Cipla

Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML) has downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral with a reduced target price of Rs 570. The rating is largely driven by likely delays in key product launches in the US and that regulatory delays are not factored in.

The brokerage house believes that the current valuation to peers is unjustified and has cut earnings per share (EPS) forecasts to 11-13 percent below Street expectations. It also sees margin expansion over the next two years to be lower than market expectations. The research firm prefers Torrent Pharma in the space over Cipla.

Yes Bank

Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on the scrip with an increased target price to Rs 1,700. The focus here on will turn to how quickly retail revenue mix changes. Analysts at the firm estimate 28 percent loan CAGR over FY16-19— highest among private banks that they cover.

Cadila Health

JPMorgan has initiated coverage on the stock with a neutral rating and a price target at Rs 475 per share. It believes that a catalyst for the stock is a recovery in US growth. The research firm sees improvement in earnings visibility, but approvals remain the key. Monetisation of much-delayed launches in the US are also key to estimates. While the premium valuation discounts strong underlying business mix and earnings growth.

Voltas

Nomura has maintained a reduce call on Voltas as rising competition could put margins at risk. However, the brokerage house has an increased target price to Rs 337 from Rs 323. Tier-II or III cities could have a continued impact from demonetisation, Nomura said.

Dr Reddy's

Credit Suisse has cut its target price to Rs 2,300 due to cuts in FY18 and FY19 earnings per share (EPS). It believes that the Srikakulam Plant clearance should remove a key hurdle for Copaxone, which is 20 percent Of FY19 EPS, but is not included in the target price.

Dabur

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has reiterated its underperform rating on the stock with a cut in the target to Rs 280. It sees weak recovery in Indian business and continued pressure in West Asian business.

Power Grid

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has reiterated a buy call on the stock with a cut in target price to Rs 227. The research firm sees opportunity for the stock to compound by 15 percent per year over three years. It believes concerns of investors on TBCB portfolio is misplaced. It believes that growth visibility is high despite likely cut in regulated RoEs. Furthermore, a re-rating is likely if it monetizes assets under InvIT .

Colgate

HSBC has maintained a buy call with an unchanged target price at Rs 1,110. The brokerage house believes lower GST and rural demand revival are the main drivers for the firm, while volume growth revival is the main catalyst. Rise of naturals emerged as a challenge to toothpaste volume growth, it said. Loss of market share remains a key risk for the stock, it said.

Media

CLSA believes the recently-launched tariff plans by telecom companies may boost subscriptions by 35 percent. It further believes that mobiles will complement TV viewership and estimates India’s high ARPU market to rise to 300 million by FY19. Currently, the market is at 170 million.",646,-0.09055248173800381

Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank rose 1.5 percent intraday on Thursday as investors cheered its fundraising plans.

The bank, at its Board Meeting, decided to raise Rs 5,500 crore through the issue of up to 6.2 crore equity shares. The fundraising will lead to an equity dilution of up to 3.4 percent and will see Uday Kotak’s stake coming down to 31.2 percent from 32.1 percent.

The bank was in the news recently due to the buzz around consolidation in the banking space. Earlier reports indicated that the lender had approached the government to seek Axis Bank’s hand.

At 13:05 hrs Kotak Mahindra Bank was quoting at Rs 865.50, up Rs 6.55, or 0.76 percent on the BSE. It touched an intraday high of Rs 872.00 and an intraday low of Rs 861.15.",143,-0.9191279709339142

Although Kotak Mahindra Bank's press conference yesterday may have disappointed some market participants who were expecting a big bang announcement, the bank made a pitch for a digital play that was in line with the government's own push in that direction. Talking to Moneycontrol's Beena Parmar, Executive Vice Chairman and Managing Director Uday Kotak also spoke on consolidation in the banking industry. ""It is never easy,"" he said. Kotak also sees potential for private sector participation in resolving Rs 10 lakh crore worth of recoverable stressed loans. Edited excerpts.

Why 811 when you already have your own mobile application, internet, Twitter, Facebook and Whatsapp banking?

About 2-3 fundamental changes have happened in banking in India. One is Aadhaar-based biometric. In December last year, the RBI allowed Aadhaar-based OTP. With thrust on digital initiatives, we have seen a dramatic change in the mindsets of people post 8/11 (November 8 last year) which is why we have named the programme 811. We see the ease of opening accounts dramatically easing and combined it with an on-mobile facility. You can open an account anytime 24/7 even in the middle of the night from anywhere. That is the flexibility.

With the increase in connectivity and customers getting significantly more used to mobile as the basis of its interaction, we think this is a game-changing development in the Indian banking.

Will it not clash with your current digital offerings?

Ease of account opening is the key to customer acquisition. Customers today face a lot of pain in open accounts. Even in the telecom sector, once biometric was allowed, the speed at which accounts opened dramatically increased and fast. It has happened in the telecom sector and now banking could do it.

But don't we have to move beyond account opening?

811 will allow over 100 features to use banking services. We are also offering customer convenience on e-commerce or movie tickets. It is also integrated to the UPI, BHIM, BharatQR code and even virtual debit cards.

Coming to the debit and credit cards business, will the card industry lose business with cards going virtual?

So, our view is that we will not decide. Let the customer decide that. Virtual card or real card, let the customer make the choice. Our ability to provide both is there now. Another important point which is the defining moment in the banking industry is the zero balance and zero charges for digital. The biggest issue for customers is charges today. We are saying be digital and decide what balance you want. You can use 811 as a wallet, a banking account, an app to a full-fledged branch banking.

You said capital and goods management is important to resolve stressed assets. We have seen interest from capital heavy special situation funds with good management ready to come forward. Where does the gap lie in fixing bad loans?

The size of capital needs is huge. The size of challenges is huge and the stress is significantly high and needs to be resolved in the next two years. So now is the time. Our view is that the size of total stress is Rs 14 lakh crore, taking a loss ratio of 30 percent. Rs 4 lakh crore is a 50 percent of the banking industry's capital. In addition, there is value of assets worth Rs 10 lakh crore which require resolution capital. Even if you take 3:1 ratio, we are talking about Rs 2.5 lakh crore worth of equity. So, the size of capital is lakhs of crores.

Do you think this is the right time for a consolidation in the private and public sector banking space?

We are not the right people to give a view on public sector banks. On private sector banks, each one has its own destiny and [it is up to the] Board's decision. From a longer term basis, I think the financials services industry will be more consolidated than it is today. Consolidation is never easy. I think as long as it is a free and fair market, the market place will figure out how.

What is the growth outlook for your bank?

We are seeing positive signs in our bank's growth. We are seeing some recovery in, say, the SME (small and medium sector enterprises) sector, broad commercial banking space and the overall mood is looking positive.

What about the overall banking industry growth?

Industry is going through its challenges including the fact that there is movement from loans to the market. So, you have to capture that as well, build a business model and be flexible.

What are your thoughts on policy interest rates which will be announced in the upcoming credit policy review in April?

Neutral policy means, it could go anywhere from here. Unless things change, I expect a quarter percent (25 basis points) plus/minus or flat in 2017.",818,-0.19739187955856324

Voltas

Citi has a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 429. It believes ‘below normal’ monsoon forecast will help room air conditioners (ACs) industry to do well and will continue to stay in vested in the stock.

However, structural theme continues to be low AC penetration and hotter weather. The move to 4-5 percent EBIT margin band in EMP business and beyond is not far away.

Navneet Education

Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage with a buy call and a target price of Rs 210. The brokerage house believes that it is well poised to gain market share in the growing CBSE market. Change of syllabus provides strong growth triggers over two years.

In terms of market positioning, it feels that Navneet dominates the market for supplementary educational material and this domineering position makes it a key beneficiary.

The brokerage house expects 22 percent revenue CAGR and 26 percent PAT CAGR over FY17-19.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

Citi has a buy call on the stock with a target of Rs 930. It has cited the company’s aim to double 8 million customer base in 18 months with the help of ‘811’ facility. However, the intent behind raising additional capital does remain unclear, it said.

Insurance

CLSA foresees strong premium growth in the insurance sector for FY17 and expects 15-20 percent CAGR growth to stay. While the underwriting profit remains low, divergence is high, the research firm observed. A hike in premiums could improve profitability along with investment income, but lower yields remain a risk for the sector.

The research firm sees better participation by PSU insurers in crop insurance from FY18. Moreover, PSU listings could be a boon for private players, it feels. On deals in the sector, the space has seen M&As worth USD 700 million with valuations at 30-40 times PE and 4-5 times PBs.

Pharma

CLSA sees no overall greenshoots visible for Indian generic companies in the US market. In fact, US IMS data for February shows a month on month decline in T3M sales for most Indian generics. The data decline is due to continued pricing pressure in the US market.

Among companies, Aurobindo’s sales declined 4 percent MoM due to loss in market share of key products. Meanwhile, Lupin’s decline in top two products led to 4 percent sales decline MoM. Sun Pharma’s products are stable, but sales of Taro continue to decline due to competition. Furthermore, Glenmark’s gZetia sales show no pick up MoM and is tracking weaker than expectations.

BS-III ban

Kotak Institutional Equities believes the ban by the Supreme Court will see minimal impact on two-wheelers and limited impact on three-wheelers. The loss to the entire industry is difficult to estimate.

On a sectoral basis, total loss for two-wheeler sector will be a moderate Rs 110 crore, while maximum revenue loss to commercial vehicles’ industry will likely be around Rs 2,700 crore.

Among companies, the brokerage house sees Hero MotoCorp to be most impacted, but on a smaller scale. Meanwhile, Bajaj Auto and Eicher Motors do not have any unsold BS-III inventory.

Commercial vehicle firms can now sell the inventory to SAARC and African countries and it also sees companies giving significant discounts to clear the inventory.

Meanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML) has an underperform rating on Ashok Leyland and Hero MotoCorp based on the developments around Supreme Court’s judgement. The apex court on Wednesday ordered a ban on sale of BS-III vehicles from April 1, 2017. It sees both the companies to be most impacted.",599,-0.013774613539377848

The banking industry has an opportunity of Rs 10 lakh crore worth of bad loans at fair value after providing for a loss of Rs 4 lakh crore from the total stressed assets, according to Uday Kotak, Vice chairman and MD of Kotak Mahindra Bank.

""Based on our internal research, net of provisions made on gross non-performing loans (NPLs), the total stress in Indian banking is about Rs 14 lakh crore,"" Kotak said.

The stressed assets include all net NPLs, assets under various resolution schemes such as SDR (strategic debt restructuring), S4A, those with assets reconstruction companies (ARCs) and other restructured assets.

With a roughly 30 percent estimation, he said, ""Out of Rs 14 lakh crore, Rs 4 lakh crore is the further pain which we believe the banking system has to take.""

The Rs 4 lakh crore is 50 percent of total capital of Indian banking industry today, he added.

With a capital base of about Rs 8 lakh crore to solve Rs 10 lakh crore worth of bad loans, Kotak said the challenge in the Indian banking system is the need for strategic capital and strategic management.

""I mean, 2-3 well-capitalised bad banks is what I see as the way we should be thinking,"" he said adding that Kotak is prepared to take that opportunity.

He pointed out that ARCs are ""horribly under-capitalised"".

Kotak added that with the banks loss of Rs 4 lakh crore and additional Rs 2.5 lakh crore for resolutions converts to a USD 100 billion worth of capital requirement.

Grabbing this is an opportunity for the private sector to enter resolution and turnaround, he said, ""We'll be ready to take more risks, including on our loan growth and the book, provided it meets our risk adjusted returns.""

Kotak has been buying stressed assets since 2003 and hence, can understand the business well.

On Wednesday, at the 10th floor office of Kotak Bank in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex, media professionals beyond the banking sector showed presence anticipating a big acquisition announcement.

However, even as the expected announcement wasn't made, Kotak launched ""811"" signifying the day of cash ban implementation - 8th November (11th month).

Kotak calls 811 the WhatsApp moment of Indian banking - a digital channel that helps one ""download a bank account"" with zero balance and no charges on making payments, etc all by using an Aadhaar-based OTP (one time password).

According to him, creative disruption and giving what the customer needs will drive growth in the near future. An optimistic Kotak also mentioned that he is seeing a pick up in the economy and that India can move sustainably to 8-10 percent growth but ""requires significant private investment, a bold one with animal spirits"".",462,0.0008258670568466187

Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol Research

The eagerly awaited Kotak Mahindra Bank’s press meet got over and instead of big bang announcements pertaining to likely acquisitions of Axis Bank or Mahindra Financial, Uday Kotak delivered what he termed “811” banking.

811 is a digital banking platform which is available on Google Play Store and will soon be available on Apple’s App store. By downloading the app, a customer can open a so-called “banking account in 2 minutes” by providing Aadhaar and PAN numbers and enjoy full-fledged banking services.

The ambitious banker has set a goal of doubling customer base in 18 months. Moneycontrol did some back-of-the-envelope calculation to figure out if the tall targets on customer acquisition will make any incremental difference to the consensus projection of Kotak Bank’s numbers for FY19.

As per the management, the bank has a current customer base of little over 8 million. Since Kotak has been a rather urban-centric bank, the arithmetic average deposits per customer works out to Rs 1,86,690 and by end of FY19, the existing customer base will take the total deposits to Rs 1,74,990 crore from the present base of Rs 1,49,352 crore.

The bank in its annual report has mentioned that post the merger of ING Vysya it is adding close to 1 lakh customers per month. While this is a healthy number, each incremental addition, comes with lower average ticket size. If we assume incremental customers to have average annual deposits of Rs 93,345, it will add Rs 22,403 crore of incremental deposits in FY19. However, as per our understanding, Kotak is looking to add 8 million customers and not 2.4 million which is the current run rate. It will certainly bank on this 811 platform for this fast organic growth in its customer base.

However, to grow at a faster clip, it predictably will have to settle for customers with a thinner wallet size. Although due to much reduced cost of acquisition, profitability per customer might stand protected. We assume the average deposit per annum of this incremental 5.6 million at Rs 23,336 resulting in an addition of Rs 13,608 crore of deposits in FY19.

To sum up, we arrive at a deposit figure of standalone Kotak Bank for FY19 at Rs 2,10,461 crore – not at variance with what the Street was expecting from the bank prior to today’s announcement. So while 811 will be a big leap for Kotak in the digital world, it wouldn’t be a similar leap for the financials.

The bank is expected to report a very healthy consolidated profit growth of 24 percent and at the current market price is available for a reasonable valuation of 3.6X FY19 book.

However, make no mistakes, Kotak has not abandoned its inorganic dreams. In the press meet, Kotak mentioned the bank's wealth creation journey – “an investment of Rs 1,00,000 made in Kotak Group in November 1985 is worth around Rs 1400 crore today – a compounded growth of 40 percent over the past 32 years”. It is hard to believe that such journey in the future will be without big-bang acquisitions. Investors may be in for a pleasant surprise from this astute banker.",537,0.8576649030049642

Kotak Mahindra Bank today announced its strategic plan to double its customer base in next 18 months. With this in mind, the bank has launched a ‘unique phenomenon called 811’.

Kotak currently has a little over 8 million operational customers.

The number 811 is inspired from Narendra Modi’s cash ban that was implemented on November 8, 2016.

Talking about the plan, Uday Kotak bank's Executive Vice Chairman and Managing Director said, ""811 offers a completely digital and paperless account opening that can be done anytime, anywhere.""

811 will continue to offer customers up to 6 percent interest on their savings account balances, Kotak said.

Kotak Bank will become the first bank to integrate Aadhaar offering OTP-based financial services.

The new initiative will be a part of Kotak’s existing app and customers can maintain a zero balance for zero charge for all digital transactions. Only Aadhaar and Pan card will be needed to open and operate the account.

The 811 initiative will offer complete digital banking experience to customers in nearly 700 locations across the country. The account can be opened anytime, anywhere using the Kotak mobile banking application.

""With 811, we embark on a bold organic growth journey. 8/11 changed India. 811 aims to take our Prime Minister's vision forwar,"" Kotak said at the press conference.

811 will offer access to over 100 services on the mobile app including financial transactions, fund transfer and a lifestyle app for e-commerce companies.

The acquisition cost to get new customers under 811 is 80-90 percent lower than the current costs, says Kotak.

Currently, 811 is available on Google Play Store and it will be available on Apple store soon.",286,0.8488099873065948

As market awaits Kotak Mahindra Bank's announcement today, speculations over a possible big buyout have sent some stocks -- including Axis Bank, Mahindra and Mahindra Financial Services and Shriram Transport Finance -- high up.

On Tuesday, the stock of these companies shot up by 3-5 percent in intraday trades amid expectations of a big buyout or merger announcement in the press conference which billionaire Uday Kotak, Promoter, Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Bank will be holding at 3.30 pm today.

However, today all the above-mentioned stocks are down excepting Axis which is up by about 1 percent.

Kotak Bank has also called for a board meeting on Thursday to raise funds triggering another reason for an acquisition announcement.

Kotak Bank is flush with liquidity with a capital adequacy ratio of over 16 percent.

According to a filing by the bank with the stock exchanges, the board will decide on “raising of equity capital through rights issue, private placement, FPO (follow-on public offer), QIP (qualified institutional placement), GDR (global depositary receipt), ADR (American depositary receipt) or through any other permissible mode”.

However, market participants are awaiting the likely announcement by Kotak on Wednesday.

After IndusInd Bank said it was in talks to buy stake in Bharat Financial Inclusion, Kotak was also said to be eyeing stake in the microfinance firm.

Kotak has been actively looking to reduce his promoter stake from 33.61 percent (as on December 31, 2016) to 30 percent by June this year as mandated by the Reserve Bank of India.

Earlier this month, he sold 1.5 percent stake in the bank to two Canadian pension funds for an estimated Rs 2,255 crore through open market transactions.

At a panel discussion of a CNBC-TV18 event recently, Kotak said that the Indian market needed to see some hostile takeovers.

A buyout of Axis Bank may seem unlikely as the government is yet to announce the tender process for selling the 11.5 percent stake in Axis Bank held by Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI).

Analysts say Kotak may look at buying a stake in one of the NBFCs (non banking financial company) which will help him trim his promoter stake in the bank.

According to reports a sales note by Macquarie said, Kotak may look to buy M&M’s 52 percent stake in M&M Financial as the company’s actual value is seen as being lower than the current market capitalisation.

M&M Financial’s consolidated net worth is Rs 6,700 crore. After deducting Rs 2,200 crore for current net non-performing loans and pegging the price to book at 3.5 times, Macquarie arrived at a value of Rs 15,800 crore for the firm against its market capitalisation of Rs 18,729 crore, it said in a note.",468,-0.9684740900993347

CLSA has a buy call on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 1,680 from Rs 1,450. The bank remains its top pick in the sector. The research firm sees 25 percent earnings CAGR over FY16-19 and believes that the bank’s growth will be led by higher share of non-retail loans over the next three years.

Additionally, cross-selling customer base may lift the share of non-retail loans to 25 percent over three years. It highlighted that the CASA franchise was doing well and recent rate cuts may add to the upside. Furthermore, it sees a scope for another 100 basis points cut in rates in three years. On risk, it sees pressure on corporate loan growth on the back of soft demand.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

JPMorgan has a neutral rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 750. The research firm believes that the stock could stay under pressure ahead of its board meeting on March 30. The current valuations are expensive as well in the context of slow revenue growth potential, it said.

Analysts at the firm also believe that the merger and a stake dilution by the promoters is unlikely. The only motivation for a possible fundraising could be acquisitions in NBFCs and loan assets. Overall, it sees long term growth potential as it is a bank with a strong balance sheet.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a buy call on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 1,050. It pointed that the growth in FY17 was weaker as the focus was on integrating the bank with ING Vysya Bank. From the next fiscal, the bank will focus on growth and operating leverage. The research firm sees consolidated earnings per share (EPS) growth of around 44 percent, 25 percent and 25 percent in FY17, FY18 and FY19, respectively.

Goldman Sachs believes the fundraising exercise by the bank is a surprise and could have been done either to reduce stake as per RBI’s directive or for acquisition purposes. The bank has a strong CET1 ratio of 14.9 percent, over the fully loaded Basel required ratio. The research firm expects the bank’s ratio to be still comfortable at 15.90 percent by FY19.Divi's Labs

Ambit is upbeat on Divi’s Labs as it believes the worse is over for the pharmaceutical major with the import alert on its Unit-II facility. It further adds that the current stock price factors in worst case scenario. In fact, one can use the current skepticism in the stock as an opportunity for a bargain buy. But it also expects stock to be volatile in the near term. The company has an excellent capital allocation track record and outlier chemistry skills, it said.

Media

CLSA has Dish TV and Zee as the main picks in the media space. It sees digitization in phase-IV markets seeding over 40 percent and expects it to gather momentum by FY19. On Zee Entertainment, it expects domestic subscription revenue to see 18 percent CAGR over FY17-19.",513,0.5030137151479721

Shares of Axis Bank rallied 3 percent intraday on Wednesday following the bank’s clarification on its MD’s resignation as well as Kotak Mahindra Bank founder’s comments on Tuesday.

“… (The rumour) is false, speculative and is being circulated with the malafide intention of misleading the investors and the general public,” the lender clarified in a notification to the exchanges.

Meanwhile, Kotak on Tuesday appealed to the government to send “strong signals” to encourage the private sector to take “honest risks” and “grow fearlessly” and said the time had come for hostile takeovers in the country.

He was speaking in a panel discussion at The Growth Net event.

“I would love to see the merger and acquisition (M&A) market in India get developed further,” he said, adding,” may be a time has come where we should see some hostile takeovers as well. We have not seen them for a long-time in this country.”

“The time has come to move forward and be bold and there will be challenges in sectors. You are seeing telecom sector going through its challenges and moving forward,” he said.

Kotak’s remarks are significant considering the persistent speculation that Kotak Mahindra Bank was likely to make a bid for Axis Bank.

Before posting Wednesday's gain, the stock fell over 4 percent in the past three days. At 11:20 hrs, it was quoting at Rs 494.25, up Rs 6.25, or 1.28 percent on the BSE. It touched an intraday high of Rs 502.35 and an intraday low of Rs 484.30.",262,-0.06111425161361694

Mid-sized private lender IndusInd Bank said it is in talks with multiple entities for business expansion, including the widely speculated merger of Bharat Financial Inclusion (BFI).

""...the management has been exploring strategic alternatives, and engaging in discussions from time to time with various parties, including Bharat Financial, as and when required,"" the bank said in a late evening exchange filing.

In the statement issued to bourses following media reports that IndusInd and BFI (formerly SKS Microfinance) are likely to announce a merger in an all-stock deal, the bank said the management has been authorised to evaluate strategic opportunities for business expansion.

It soon added that no decision has yet been made in this regard by either the board or any of the committees and also termed the media reports as ""speculative"".

As per the reports, the merger ratio is likely to be 10:7, wherein shareholders will get seven shares of IndusInd Bank for every 10 shares of BF. In its clarification to bourses yesterday, BF said it had been exploring various options but termed the media reports as ""speculative"".

Speculation regarding a deal between the two has been on for many months now and some reports had said the Hinduja Group-promoted bank may be looking at buying a minority stake in BFI. But off late the buzz has shifted to takeover.

There have been a slew of deals between private sector lenders and MFIs as the former eye to expand their network in the hinterland which will help them meet the priority sector lending mandates and offer cross-sell opportunities.

In a note yesterday, Australian brokerage Macquarie had said such a merger was positive from a medium-term perspective for the bank but flagged execution as the key given the stress on MFI's books. A merger can enhance IndusInd's return on assets by up to 0.25 percent and make it among the highest in the industry, it said.

BFI already has a business correspondent relationship with IndusInd in Karnataka for many years now. The then SKS had a tumultuous time four years ago as it first faced a repayment crisis in its largest market of Andhra Pradesh and a corporate battle over leadership which ended with the exit of founder Vikram Akula.

If the merger fructifies, it will be the third deal for IndusInd Bank, after Deutsche Bank's credit card portfolio in 2011 and RBS' diamond financing book in 2015.

Both IndusInd and BFI counters have seen a rally this year, but the stocks today corrected 0.26 percent and 1.40 percent respectively on the BSE.

Other banks, including IDFC Bank, Kotak and RBL, have either acquired or taken minority stakes in MFIs in past 18 months.",454,0.11074337363243103

Tech Mahindra

Bank of America Merrill Lynch says acquisition of US-based CJS Group provides Tech Mahindra with an entry in the healthcare vertical. Business exposure of CJS is mainly to clients in US & UK.

Acquisition transaction is likely to be mildly earnings accretive and deal valuation at USD 110 million appears to be in-line with industry trend, the brokerage house feels.

Tech Mahindra is likely to use existing cash for CJS' acquisition. BoAML sees a contingent mull of USD 130.5 million based on 2017-19 revenue and EBITDA targets.

The brokerage house has maintained underperform rating on sensitivity w.r.t H-1B visa program in the US. Every 10 percent increase in H-1B wages may hurt earnings by 11 percent, on gross basis, BoAML feels.

However, Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock as it finds CJS acquisition attractive on reasonable valuations.

CJS' large US-employee base should provide company with better employee mix, it believes. Based on current revenue & margin, Credit Suisse believes acquisition to be earnings-neutral.

Bharat Financial

Kotak Institutional Equities cautioned the street of higher-than-expected stress in Bharat Financial's portfolio. It has retained reduce call with a target price of Rs 730.

While maintaining neutral rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 720, Credit Suisse says there has been no sharp recovery in collections and over 4.4 percent portfolio remained overdue for more than two months.

It feels, shortfall in collections in off-book remains significant.

Bajaj Finserv

Goldman Sachs has revised its target upwards on Bajaj Finserv to Rs 3,220 from Rs 2,960 as it incorporated updated valuation. Demonetisation impact faded but earnings headwinds remain, it feels.

The brokerage house is continued to apply a 10 percent conglomerate discount on the company. Securing major bancassurance partner and better-than-expected margin are key risks.

ACC

CLSA says it has reiterated sell call on ACC as company's internal & external pressures impacted 2016 performance and lack of growth focus drove market share losses again.

It believes new unit in East India should help volumes in the medium-term. CLSA still see company as a key beneficiary in an upcycle.

Potential merger with Ambuja Cements could help drive synergy benefits, it feels.

Tata Power

Goldman Sachs has retained neutral rating on Tata Power as it factored in the Welspun acquisition in estimates.

The research firm has increased target price to Rs 81 from Rs 79, though FY17-19 topline estimates declined by 12-19 percent & profit by 3-12 percent.

Axis Bank

Goldman Sachs has maintained sell rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 398 on weak fundamentals in the near-medium term.

The stock is trading at 2.6x book adjusted for 70 percent provision coverage, it says.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

Goldman Sachs has a buy rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank, with a target price at Rs 925.

Jindal Steel

Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock, with increased target price at Rs 150 from Rs 110. It feels operational recovery will continue as volumes ramped up.

Higher steel prices/coal output resulted in 3-7 percent higher EBITDA. Any favourable outcome of the pending cases could be an added plus, Credit Suisse feels.

Media

Nomura says it feels new tariff order by TRAI for broadcast & cable services is positive for media industry. According to the brokerage house, cost per pay channel is likely to go up, especially for MSOs (multiple system operators).

It says there is no clarity over how TRAI’s order will be implemented in analogue areas. Uniform pricing formula favours DTH & broadcasters, but may be negative for MSOs, it feels.

Nomura believes large broadcasters such as Zee Entertainment will be less affected on strong demand. Operators such as Dish TV may benefit from higher carriage costs and better ARPUs, it feels.

Digitisation & better monetisation will be key medium-term drivers, Nomura says.",648,0.14488498653684342

Morgan Stanley has overweight rating on Reliance Industries, with increased target at Rs 1,506 from Rs 1,280 as it feels energy earnings should exceed market expectations.

Energy return on capital employed is set to rise 500 bps by FY20 to 15 percent, the brokerage house believes.

ONGC

Credit Suisse has maintained neutral rating on ONGC, with unchanged target price at Rs 176.67 as it sees no near-term catalysts for the company.

It says oil-heavy project sanctions & improving gas output are positive.

The brokerage house believes company's capex should add meaningfully to output by second half of FY20 but it expects FY18 output for oil & gas to miss management target by 2-4 percent.

Bharti Airtel

With maintaining underperform rating on Bharti Airtel and unchanged target price at Rs 295, Credit Suisse 'tit-for-tat' aggression from Bharti is a departure from its historical passive response to competition.

This will likely pressure ARPU, revenues, margins and capex further, it feels.

The brokerage house continues to stay cautious and sees the recent strength in stocks as an opportunity to trim positions.

Moneycontrol NewsIn a free-wheeling interview with Economic Times Axis Bank CEO Shikha Sharma said a marriage isn’t on the cards. She was responding to market speculation that a a bunch of suitors have come calling. Axis Bank doesn’t need a merger in order to grow, she said, explaining how the bank hasn’t been approached by anyone so far.

“We haven’t been approached by anybody, and frankly for Axis at this point in time, there is so much to do,” she told the newspaper.

Last week Kotak Mahindra Bank was learned to have approached the government seeking a merger with country's third largest private sector lender Axis Bank, sources have told CNBC-TV18. They add that the move has sparked an interest from other industry players, including HDFC Bank,HDFC, ICICI Bank and IndusInd, who have all approached the government informally expressing an interest in picking up stake in Axis.

Sharma was skeptical of mergers when they are undertaken for a transaction value. Only from the point of view of a synergy, do mergers work, she said. “We think that scale for the sake of scale to take out costs is not the thesis that is right for us at this point in time.”

Asked whether she was open to another term as bank chief in 2018, she said it was up to the board to decide her fate.

She admitted that of all the calls the bank took infrastructure was a bet gone awry. Although the bank’s watchlist guidance didn’t play out the way it wanted, Sharma believes it will be prudent to give a range rather than a number in future.",280,

State Bank of India (SBI) will merge its five associate banks with itself from April 1, in the largest consolidation exercise in the banking history of India.

After the government notified April 1 as the effective date of merger, SBI today said in a regulatory filing, “The assets ofState Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur (SBBJ), State Bank of Mysore (SBM), State Bank of Travancore (SBT), State Bank of Patiala (SBP) and State Bank of Hyderabad (SBH) will be transferred to SBI from April 1, 2017.”Merging of another state-run lender Bhartiya Mahila Bank into SBI hasn’t been finalised yet.

With the merger of all the five associates, SBI is expected to become one of the top 50 banks in the world with a balance sheet size of over Rs 32 lakh crore (about USD 500 billion), 22,500 branches and 58,000 ATMs. It will have a customer base of over 50 crore.

Following the SBI merger, officers and employees, with the exception of the board of directors and executive trustees of the associate banks, will become employees of SBI.SBI's immediate course of action is to enact the swap of shares for all the shareholders of the associate banks in 30 days period.

For every 10 shares of SBBJ, the shareholders will receive 28 shares of State Bank of India. In the case of the other two associate banks, for every 10 shares of SBM and 10 shares of SBT, investor would get 22 shares of SBI in each case.

The shares of the listed associate banks will be delisted from both the stock exchanges following the merger.

SBI had approved separate schemes of acquisition of State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Hyderabad. There will not be any share swap or cash outgo as they are wholly-owned by SBI.After the audit, SBI will start the process of data integration, streamlining its IT (information technology) platform, rationalise 20 percent of its branches, integrate its five treasury operations into one and getting the employees on the SBI payscale among other things. The integration should be completed in the first half of FY18.

SBI first merged State Bank of Saurashtra with itself in 2008. Two years later, State Bank of Indore was merged with it.

SBI has a 200 year history and is largest commercial bank in India in terms of assets, deposits, profits, branches, customers and employees. The Government of India is the single largest shareholder of this Fortune 500 entity with 62.22 percent ownership as on January 20, 2017. Currently, SBI is ranked 63rd in the list of top banks in the world.

The origins of State Bank of India date back to 1806 when the Bank of Calcutta (later called the Bank of Bengal) was established. In 1921, the Bank of Bengal and two other banks (Bank of Madras and Bank of Bombay) were amalgamated to form the Imperial Bank of India.

In 1955, the Reserve Bank of India acquired the controlling interests of the Imperial Bank of India and SBI was created by an Act of Parliament to succeed the Imperial Bank of India.

The latest consolidation in the banking sector was in 2015 when Kotak Mahindra Bank completed acquisition of mid-sized private lender ING Vysya Bank for about Rs 15,000 crore in an all-stock deal. The deal was touted as India's biggest banking merger.",565,-0.6489696502685547

Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol ResearchAxis Bank has turned out to be the 'sought-after bride’ in the banking space. With a diversified shareholding (largest shareholding belonging to LIC at 13.85 percent and SUUTI at 11.5 percent) the bank looks game for the marriage, at a price. The 16 percent rally in the stock price albeit the muted Q3FY17 earnings may be partially attributed to the buzz of match-making.From the only eligible reported proposal of a Kotak Bank, the list has now widened to include other big names like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and HDFC. There could be some over-ambitious mid-sized players also queueing up over the next few weeks. For the conservative strategy of HDFC Bank of 'growth with quality’, acquisition of Axis Bank with no overt complementarity of network doesn’t look like a natural choice. HDFC Bank might not find it easy to walk an uncharted path – corporate/term lending, asset quality issues etc. However, the lure of size can’t be ignored. With a Balance Sheet size of Rs 8.2 lakh crore, growing organically without facing the impact of macro headwinds might not be easy for HDFC Bank. The acquisition, in one stroke, translates to growth of four years (at CAGR of 15 percent). While the reported trailing price/adjusted book of Axis at 2.6X doesn’t look expensive, factoring in the poor asset quality (5/25, SDR and part of restructured book), the price/adjusted book works out to 3.1X. It is unlikely for HDFC Bank to pay a premium for Axis similar to what it enjoys itself for its pristine quality. If at all growth imperatives push HDFC Bank to take such a decisive step, it is unlikely to cough up beyond 3.5X adjusted book – implying an upside of 11 percent from the current market price. While the name of its parent HDFC is also doing the rounds, a pure mortgage lender might not receive the same attention from the decision-makers. The considerations are slightly different for ICICI Bank. ICICI, although 30 percent larger in balance sheet size compared to Axis and a conglomerate with successful businesses beyond the bank, has broadly similar liability and asset profile as Axis. The reported level of stress in asset quality is higher for ICICI Bank at this point in time (according to our calculation the total assets that needs to be watched are about 12.9 percent of advances for ICICI Bank as against 8.7 percent for Axis); that partially explains its valuation discount.ICICI would certainly not be comfortable with an Axis-Kotak combine that relegates it to a position of No 4 in the industry. Given the asset quality headwinds, an acquisition/integration deflects the attention of the Street from asset quality issues, thereby giving it more time to put its house in order. However, the top management of Axis (ex-ICICI) may not relish the idea of a union, and such softer issues do play an important role.ICICI Bank quotes at 1.8X trailing reported adjusted book compared with our calculated adjusted book of 2x. We doubt if it can match offer of a competitor like Kotak that might be willing to pay much more.We have delved in detail about a probable Kotak Axis merger earlier (Read: COMMENT: Kotak & Axis - good together or better alone?) A savvy entity like Kotak might be enticed to catapult to No 3 position in the industry quickly while complying with the RBI stipulation pertaining to promoters’ stake with this union. However, it is likely to conduct a thorough due diligence to avoid probable asset quality surprises in the future. Inorganic expansion has never come at an inordinate price for Kotak.

Moneycontrol BureauAxis Bank was in the news on February 21 when CNBC-TV18 reported that Kotak Mahindra Bank had informally approached the government for a merger. Following this, other private players also threw their hat in the ring and had asked the government for a competitive bidding field. Based on the reactions, the stock soared 5 percent in late trading hours on Tuesday.

Morgan Stanley feels that the lender could have seen interest from private banks based on its retail deposit franchise, but concerns on its profitability remain as well.

The brokerage feels that the market is under-appreciating the deposit franchise of the bank. ""Axis is one of the few banks with a strong retail deposit franchise. Its current account savings account (CASA) market share has increased from 3.9 percent to 4.9 percent between FY11 and FY16. Retail deposits now make up almost 80 percent of funding. It is not very far from the best in class—HDFC Bank,” Morgan Stanley said in a report. Among private banks, only HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have good retail deposit franchises. While other private banks have shown strong CASA (current and savings account deposits) growth in recent years, that it has been driven by offering significantly higher interest rates, implies that their savings deposits are essentially fixed deposits with on demand characteristics, Morgan Stanley said.

On its financials, the brokerage feels that the bank has been under pressure for the last one and a half year due to concerns around asset quality. While Axis Bank has reported large bad loans and provided for them, the concern is behind the curve. “Investors have been worried especially after the last two-quarter surge in bad loans that there is a significant amount of NPL's yet to be recognised. This would hurt profitability.”

CNBC-TV18’s story substantiated earlier buzz about Kotak-Axis merger, which was reported by the media earlier this month. Axis had strongly denied any such talks, while Kotak said it would not comment on market speculation.",341,-0.33332931995391846

The Finance Ministry has not received any communication with regard to reported merger of Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank, a senior official said.

Mergers of private banks do not come to Finance Ministry, rather it is for the regulator to see, said another official.

""We are not aware of any such plans. We have not received any expression of interest for Axis Bank by any company,"" the official said, when asked about reports on merger of Kotak Mahindra Bank with Axis Bank.

Government indirectly holds stake in Axis Bank through public sector insurance companies and SUUTI.

The Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI) holds about 12 percent stake in Axis Bank while LIC has 14.49 percent holding in the bank.

Remaining promoter category stake is with four PSU general insurance companies and one state-owned re-insurer GIC Re.

Generally, the official said, the Finance Ministry don't comment on SUUTI stake sale but at the moment there is no immediate plan to sell.

Yesterday, Axis Bank also clarified that ""in light of repeated reports appearing in some sections of the media, we reiterate that the said news (merger between Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank) is baseless and unsubstantiated."" In 2015, Kotak Mahindra Bank completed acquisition of mid-sized private sector ING Vysya Bank for about Rs 15,000 crore. The deal was touted as India's biggest banking merger.

The merger catapulted the nation's fourth largest private bank to nearly Rs 2 lakh crore balance-sheet size entity.",256,

Larsen & Toubro

CLSA has a buy call on L&T as it believes the stock is a good proxy for domestic capex.

First order is around the corner, but new bids are key, it says, adding, the needs to win 1 of the 2 large navy orders to utilise its defence yard.

The brokerage house believes company will be a significant beneficiary of defence capex. Its's tie-up with Navantia, Spain, may endow with certain competitive advantages, it feels.

L&T has emerged as the No 1 player in prequalification for USD 8 billion FICV project.

Havells

Citi says Lloyd's consumer durable business acquisition by Havells for Rs 1,600 crore enterprise value does not look excessive prima facie. For funding the acquisition; some debt may be needed.

Impact will depend on competitive dynamics, cost reduction and synergies, says the brokerage house.

Macquarie feels that the deal is reasonably priced and is likely to be neutral for the company’s near term earnings. However, it sees potential risk to return ratios as well as cash flows of Havells on the back of this deal. Furthermore, it says there is no overlap in the distribution channel for Havells and Lloyd Electric and that the lack of synergies could make this integration challenging for the firm. Its target price for stock was unchanged at Rs 404.

Goldman Sachs says Lloyd deal would provide Havells an entry into consumer durables. Acquisition would allow company to deploy cash generated post Sylvania exit, it adds.Kotak expects a dilution in Havells EBITDA margins on the back of this transaction. The brokerage states that Havells is set to enter the most competitive market segment of consumer durables. It will be far more challenging for it to execute strongly in the air conditioner market. On the deal’s dynamics, Kotak feels that EPS for Havells will be neutral at present. But, going forward, it may be come significantly EPS accretive in the medium term.

Yes Bank

Goldman Sachs has retained buy rating on Yes Bank but removed it from the conviction list. The brokerage house expects improving earnings quality on higher retail in the loan mix.

It has not changed its estimates for the bank but raised stock target price to Rs 1,533 from Rs 1,466.

Goldman expects further re-rating to 15.9x FY18 P/E against 14.7x now.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

Goldman Sachs says Kotak Mahindra Bank may outperform on improving growth prospects & top quartile EPS growth. Lending book is likely to grow at 25 percent hereon, it feels.

Hence, the research firm has upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, with increased target price at Rs 925 from Rs 815.

Shift augurs well for Indian firms amidst ongoing US policy debate and evolving product mix will drive a manufacturing shift towards the US, it adds.

Aditya Puri, Managing Director and Chief Executive of the second largest private lender HDFC Bank, today backed the idea of setting up a national bad bank, saying anything that can help resolve the perennial bad loans problem is welcome. His comments come a day after Uday Kotak, Managing Director of Kotak Mahindra Bank said the present state of the financial sector requires an institution like a bad bank so that banks can continue to oil the fast-growing economy, while also eradicating the stress in the banking system.

""I don't think a national bad bank is a bad idea. The Government and the regulators are coming up with various discussions as to how solve the issue relating to NPAs and that is necessary so that the banking system has the ability to do more.

""Bad bank is one of the ideas being discussed, there are other ideas like the Bankruptcy Code which should also help, we bankers are also working (on tacking NPA issue),"" Puri told a panel discussion at the concluding day of the three-day annual Nasscom leadership forum here.

It can be noted that almost 20 percent of the banking assets are stressed with the NPAs alone topping 13.5 percent as of the September quarter. While more than 70 percent of the system are with the state-run banks, over 90 percent of the stressed assets with them, leaving them starved of growth capital.

While its banks are starved of cash, the Government finances are not adequate to recapitalise them which was visible from the paltry Rs 10,000 crore for capital infusion into 24 state-run banks in the Budget 2018.

In fiscal 2017 and the previous year, the Government infused Rs 25,000 crore each in to these banks, while their demand is at least Rs 91,000 crore between the next two fiscal years, as per an India Ratings estimate in the core tier I capital alone to meet the stringent Basel 3 capital norms.

For the system as a whole between fiscal 2015 and 2019, the banks need more than Rs 3.9 trillion for the banks to meet the Basel III capital norms. Of this Rs 1.8 trillion are only tier I core capital for the public sector banks.

While the idea of a national bad bank has been doing the rounds ever since the NPA issued ballooned out, one the most concrete banking for the idea came in the recent Economic Survey, which made a strong case for such an entity to address the festering twin balance sheet problem.

The Economic Survey called for creation of state-owned asset reconstruction company under the moniker of Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA), as it noted that at least 13 of the 24 PSU banks account for around 40 percent of total stressed loans, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian said in the survey.

Subramanian has been a votary of bad bank to be funded by the RBI surpluses but the former RBI chief Raghuram Rajan opposed it citing an issue of moral hazard. (more) PTI AA BEN RSY .",517,0.2860548297564189

Cadila Healthcare

CLSA says Moraiya outcome for Cadila Healthcare is a big surprise but approvals may take time. The brokerage house has maintained outperform rating on the stock, with a target price at Rs 480 after raising FY18-19 US sales estimates by 4-10 percent leading to 3-9 percent rise in FY18-19 EPS.

It feels near-term outlook for the company is challenging. It expects investor interest to return once more companies resolve US FDA issues.

CLSA believes benefit of Moraiya clearance will be more visible in FY19 than FY18.

Cadila Healthcare on Thursday said it did not receive any observations from USFDA for its formulation facility at Moraiya indicating successful resolution of the warning letter on the plant. USFDA inspected the plant from February 6-15.

Motilal Oswal expects Cadila's US sales to increase to USD 950 million in FY19 from USD 550 million in FY17 and raised FY18/19 EPS estimates by 5 percent. The brokerage house has set a target price at Rs 510.

Macquarie also raised multiple from 18x to 20x FY19 PE and target price to Rs 525 from Rs 425, while maintaining outperform rating on the stock.

Deutsche Bank revised target price on the stock to Rs 404, while maintaining hold rating.

Morgan Stanley stayed overweight on the stock, with increased target price at Rs 539 from Rs 439. The brokerage house estimated sales & net profit CAGR for FY18-19 of 18.9 percent & 29.8 percent.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank

CLSA says if Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank are merged then the merged entity would be among the largest private banks and the merger would allow banks to capitalise on individual strengths.

According to the research firm, branch rationalisation may aid improve productivity/reduce cost-income ratio and Kotak promoters' holdings could fall from 34 percent to 19 percent post merger.

Key challenge would be to align asset quality of the two banks, it feels while saying higher stressed loans at Axis Bank than Kotak Mahindra Bank may raise credit costs.

CLSA says merger would also raise HR integration as Axis Bank is a much larger bank. Merger might stretch return on equity expansion timelines for Kotak Mahindra Bank, it feels.

According to the firm, combined market capitalisation would be USD 40 billion and share-swap ratio may be 0.6:1 for Axis Bank. Kotak’s share of the banking business SOTP (some-of-the-part) would rise to over 90 percent, it feels.

The brokerage house has an outperform rating on Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, with target price of Rs 550 & Rs 920, respectively.

Shriram Transport

Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on the stock, with increased target price at Rs 1,100 from Rs 1,070 as the stock is attractive at current valuations.

The brokerage house says management sees collection efficiency normalise by March. Share of cash in collections has fallen sharply & staying low.

HCL Technologies, Tata Motors

CLSA has made changes its model portfolio. It raised rating on IT sector to overweight in its model portfolio.

Out of 113 companies under its coverage, 46 saw above expected earnings, 47 companies saw an upgrade in earnings and 43 disappointed & 36 saw earnings downgrades, the brokerage house says.

Earnings downgrades have been lumpy but upgrades have been broad-based, it says.

During the earnings season, consensus cut FY18 earnings by 2 percent but CLSA's earnings remained unchanged.

The research firm forecasts 8 percent Nifty earnings growth for FY17 & 17 percent For FY18. It downgraded foreign business earnings by 3-4 percent during the quarter.

Pharma was the worst, with 6 of 9 companies witnessing downgrades of 2-10 percent.

CLSA says margin improvement has been an earnings driver for domestic companies and expects margin expansion in FY18 for domestic companies on operating leverage.

Its model portfolio has outperformed MSCI India by 25 bps/360 bps year-to-date. The brokerage house has removed Tata Motors from the portfolio and downgraded the stock to sell.

Kotak Mahindra Bank chief Uday Kotak today called for a national bad bank, saying the present state of the financial sector needs such an institution so that they can continue to oil a fast-growing economy.

""The stress in our banking sector must be eradicated to allow the system to lend to small businesses and other growing sectors of economy. And the present health of our public sector banks do not allow them to do so.

""Therefore, a national bad bank is a good idea,"" Kotak said delivering the Pravinchandra Gandhi lecture at the Mumbai University organised by the industry body IMC.

Describing the 24 PSU banks as ""the 70 percent problem"" (in reference to the over 70percent market share of these banks), he wondered what was the need for so many state-run lenders, which is the highest in the world after China.

""I am all for public sector banks. Their service to the nation is humongous. Without them small and medium sector would have been in difficulty. The entire PSL sector lending would not have been possible till some years ago without them. But my point is do we need all of them as many as 24 of them?"" he said.

Kotak said since the issue of PSL (priority sector lending) is no longer a burden to any one, as private sector lenders are only happy to buy such credit from the PSU banks, it is time to move on and merge them.

""The management and governance teams to run 24 state- run banks need huge investments and faces challenges...merger among the public sector banks will help in resolving this problem,"" he said and rued that successive Governments since the 1969 nationalisation have done little on this front.

However, he said just by creating a bad bank will not solve the issue of bad loan which he pegged at around 20 percent of the system. It should be ensured there is a solid basis to price the stressed assets at a fair value and a strong management is in place to run it.

""We need to have a very solid basis of transferring assets at fair price to the bad bank and then having a strong recovery team which can manage this well by being surgical, logical and ruthless,"" Kotak said.

It can be noted that after the Economic Survey, which called for setting up such a bank, the industry was expecting an announcement in this regard in the Budget to tide over the mounting NPA problem in the banking sector.

While banks need close to Rs 1 trillion in fresh capital by fiscal 2019, the Government had budgeted only Rs 10,000 crore in the next financial year, while it gave Rs 25,000 crore each in fiscal years 2016 and 2015.",471,-0.2635212540626526

Moneycontrol Research

Kotak Mahindra Bank, in a recent intimation to the stock exchange, has informed the investors that the bank has received communication from Reserve Bank of India to bring down its promoters' shareholding to 30 percent by June 2017, 20 percent by December 2018 and 15 percent by March 2020. Promoter shareholding currently stands at 33.6 percent. While this is unlikely to be the driving force for an acquisition, a reduction in stake would be a useful side-effect of any deal.

The Street has been abuzz with rumours of Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank coming together. The gains in terms of size is obvious: It catapults the entity to the position of Number 3 by size and perhaps only next to the most valuable bank by market capitalisation. If we assume the deal at 15 percent premium to the current market price (3.5X our calculated adjusted book), the stake of Kotak Bank’s promoter will stand reduced to 17.4 percent, killing a second bird with the same stone.

The last big merger in the private sector banking space in 2014 between Kotak Bank and ING had a few very obvious synergistic gains for Kotak Bank – access to geographies where Kotak had relatively less presence (South), ready network and hence reduced time to market, access to ING’s SME business and the modest valuation of the acquisition did justice to the relatively inferior quality of book that was inherited.

The rumoured union now is vastly different. As the exhibit shows, Axis is 2.8X in assets, 2.5x in deposits and has 2.7x loan book. It has enviable pan-India touch points – in terms of branches Axis is 2.4x of Kotak and has 6.7X the number of ATMs. With an enviable CASA (current and savings account) ratio of 48 percent, this is a franchise that anyone would like to own. But in terms of geographical complementarity, it has nothing much to offer to Kotak as both the banks are now pan India players with a similar distribution of branches. Kotak is predominantly in urban areas whereas Axis’ is a bit more entrenched in Tier II & Tier III towns.

The bigger challenge for this entity comes from the asset side. While Kotak's loan book is tilted more towards retail/ SME (72 percent of the book) and exhibits pristine quality, Axis, albeit its steady reorientation towards retail, has a sizeable corporate book (46 percent) which is under stress. The deterioration in asset quality has been a concern for Axis shareholders for a while.

However, for a potential buyer, the bigger risk would emanate from the possible future surprises in the book that is considered ‘standard’ as of now. Theoretically, it is still possible to conduct stricter due diligence of the loan book and take provisioning for the same, and the result of this exercise would be critical in determining the “valuation of the deal” and the relative gains/losses for the shareholders of the two entities.

Our analysis suggests that at the current market price, while Axis prima facie quotes at 2.5X trailing adjusted book (Kotak 3.8x), if we factor in the assets under 5/25, SDR and even a part of the restructured pool, there is a substantial erosion in the reported book.

The wide gap between the two could turn out to be the deal-breaker. At the current price, the valuation works out to 3X our calculated adjusted book, compared to the reported valuation of 2.1X book (similar to the valuation of ING deal).

Finally, for any match-making to work, the softer issues are more relevant than the hard numbers. Culturally integrating workforce that is larger than its own is not an easy task for Kotak. In an age where technology, products etc. are key differentiators in the banking business, does size really matter?",645,-0.3255469799041748

Beena ParmarMoneycontrol BureauAmid legal agencies investigating bank officials on loan sanctions, bankers fear taking hair-cuts on bad loans. Now, lenders seek more teeth to resolution mechanisms in order to get a fair a deal on their bad loans.

According to a senior bank official with a Mumbai-based public sector bank said, “After the Kingfisher episode, it is becoming difficult to get all banks on board. Bankers are worried they might be questioned on their decisions…Taking hair-cuts is still a taboo.”A hair-cut is a discount banks have to bear on selling their bad loans.

The Central Bureau of Investigation has arrested five former IDBI Bank officials and four Kingfisher Airlines officials relating to the IDBI Bank’s Rs 1,300 crore loan default case.

Another senior large public sector bank official handling stressed assets said, “We are working on a number of cases. A consortium is a long-drawn process and we need co-operation from the borrowers, too. The existing schemes need more strength as we lose out on the pricing factor.”

Existing mechanisms initiated by the Reserve Bank of India have already seen a few modifications but to no avail as banks are often required to take major cuts on their loans and borrowers use delaying tactics given the limited time period of less than two years given to banks under various schemes.

Starting with Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR), Joint Lenders’ Forum (JLR) which empowers smaller lenders, Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR), 5:25 refinancing scheme and the latest S4A or the Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets have not seen any major success rates.

Bankers say they are currently looking at multiple loan accounts to be resolved under the SDR and S4A but are yet to find the right buyers and management change due to resistance from existing management and fear of legal ramifications.

A few stressed assets funds which forged tie-ups with banks last year are yet to make headway.

SBI Chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, in the post results interaction, said, “No deal in the Brookfield tie-up is close to closure yet. They are evaluating proposals and probably early next year, one or two deals could be closed.”

On the government proposed bad bank, Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency (PARA), she said, “Anything that helps put stressed assets back (on track) is welcome. We need capital on the bad bank front and the government has to take that decision.”

The RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya also approved the idea to set up PARA “if designed properly.” “The big piece of the problem is - can you get banks to sell the assets at the right price to ARCs (asset reconstruction companies) and private investors who want to come in? How to get that right price to come in using a portfolio or a bad bank kind of approach? I think that’s going to be key.”

The Economic Survey of 2016-17 pointed out the persistence of the twin balance sheet problem—over-indebtedness in the corporate and banking sectors.In a clear message to the government to help resolve up to nearly 15-20 percent of stressed loans, the Survey said such a resolution will require “difficult decisions about burden-sharing and perhaps even forgiving some burden on the private sector”.",542,-0.8666225433349609

Amid stock market buzz about a possible merger between Kotak Mahindra and Axis Bank, the private lenders have denied that the biggest consolidation in the banking space is on the cards, according to a report in The Times of India.

A merger between the two banks could be worth around Rs 2.5 lakh crore, which would make it the second most valuable Indian bank after HDFC Bank.

A top fund manager was quoted as saying that a merger deal is being explored by the shareholders of the two banks. He said a merger would unlock huge synergies, as Kotak Bank has a strong corporate banking franchise while Axis is strong on the retail front.But both banks issued denials.

""Axis is one of the strongest financial institutions in the country with a large customer franchise,” an Axis Bank spokesperson told the paper. “We urge you to exercise extreme caution in dealing with this misinformation,""

Kotak Mahindra Bank spokesperson Rohit Rao said he would not comment on “rumour and speculation”.A merger would also serve specific interests for both companies. Currently, the government holds 12 percent in Axis Bank through Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), which is worth about Rs 14,000 crore. It holds an additional 18 percent stake in the bank through Life Insurance Corporation and other state-owned insurance companies. With a Rs 72,500-crore divestment target for next year that was announced in last week's Budget, the government will look to offload part of its stake.

Other people in the know were quoted as saying that another private bank would be interested in picking up the government’s stake in Axis Bank.

For Kotak Bank, its promoters need to need to pare their stake in the bank to 15 percent by 2020 from 33.6 percent in accordance with a Reserve Bank of India directive.

Over the last fortnight, while Bank Nifty ran rings around headline Nifty, lenders with a retail focus within the banking pack outperformed by a significant margin. Their valuations were stretched, and corporate lenders, in contrast, looked attractive.

It begs the question: is it time to put your faith behind corporate lenders?

Our analysis of a majority of private lenders which have reported results so far suggests it may be an early call. Our research suggests that investors may still find attractive options in mid-sized, well-run banks.

Banks with a sizeable exposure to retail credit (IndusInd, Kotak, HDFC Bank) and corporate-focussed outliers (RBS and Yes Bank) left no room for complaints in their broad Q3 numbers. The smarter ones weathered the demonetisation storm well. Retail fees, which came in below estimates for HDFC Bank, were too minor a blight on the bank’s otherwise positive Q3 show.

While sector rotation – an investment strategy of moving your bets to a more profitable sector – in markets could make it tempting to consider a switch to corporates in your portfolio, it is important to analyse the detailed numbers before jumping the gun.

It worthwhile highlighting that headline profitability numbers of many of these private banks have got a boost from trading gains and lower provision cover. Excluding Axis, other lenders have provision cover of sub-50 percent which is bad news signalling banks haven’t bargained for write-offs.

The other number to track would be growth in advances, which tells us where the earnings will be headed in the future. Here, too, barring Axis (at 10 percent) and South Indian Bank (11 percent), growth for the rest, which is in the abysmal single-digits, doesn’t inspire confidence.

The micro trends seen in the results of these banks – namely, waning of asset quality pressure and resumption of growth – don’t give us hope. Some of these banks have seen a reduction in bad loans on a sequential basis. Older private peers like Karur Vysya, South Indian, Lakshmi Vilas, and some large corporate lenders like Axis and ICICI have their pulse on their watchlist. But a definite turnaround is still elusive.

The much-awaited capex revival is still some time away – recent commentary from L&T also corroborates the same. The lone silver lining for the banking sector could be a further drop in rates translating into healthy trading gains. We need to wait for the Budget math to get further clarity on the same.

In contrast, a couple of mid-sized banks like DCB and Federal Bank, appear to have crossed the hump of asset quality stress and started showing traction in business growth, all of which could lead to an improvement in Return on Equity (ROE). Hence, the narrowing of valuation discount to larger retail lenders cannot be ruled out.",476,0.1723201721906662

ICICI Direct's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Provision came at Rs 192 crore, in line with our estimate of Rs 197 crore. Credit cost came in at 15 bps (16 bps in Q2FY17). On asset quality front, QoQ net GNPA declined by Rs 3 crore (Rs 122 crore in Q2FY17). Absolute GNPA stood at Rs 3178 crore and GNPA ratio at 2.42% (decline 7 bps QoQ). Restructured assets remained steady at Rs 146 crore (Rs 147 crore in Q2FY17), forming 0.11% of its loan book.

OutlookAsset quality is also expected to remain prudent with GNPA seen at 2.5% in FY17-18E. Consequently, we revise our target price upwards to Rs 840 from Rs 810 earlier (based on SoTP model), thereby maintaining our HOLD rating on the stock.

Malini BhuptaMoneycontrolIn uncertain times, defensive sectors are good places to hide, but a contrarian view this time around would be more profitable. Even though 2017 is expected to be a year of uncertainties, equity strategists are advising cyclical stocks over safe havens.While impact of GST rollout and pace of economic recovery after demonetisation are known domestic variables, Trumponomics and the impact of protectionist policies adopted by several developed economies remain key global uncertainties. In such challenging times, a good place to hide would be defensive sectors like consumer, pharmaceuticals and IT services, but this time around the market is betting on cyclicals, in the hope that infrastructure spending will get a boost in this year’s Budget.Don't expect consumption to revive anytime soonThe economy may be limping back to normalcy after high value currency notes were invalidated in November; consumer companies are not likely to see a 'U’ shaped recovery. Small wonder then that the market is placing its bets on cyclical stocks. While IDFC Securities expects relatively higher fiscal stimulus on the consumption side (compared to capex), it believes the move will only help bring consumption demand back to normal levels (which was dented by demonetization). Hence, the brokerage prefers non-consumption themes – B2B businesses, high dividend yield stories and businesses with stronger outlook outside the country.Earnings of cyclicals to outpace defensivesEarnings recovery in some sectors is another trigger for select cyclicals. Given that select commodity prices have been moving up, earnings trajectory of metal companies is expected to improve. Religare Capital Markets expects earnings growth of energy and metals to rise to 16.5 percent while IT is expected to report stagnant earnings. Cement, construction & infrastructure and capital goods are among the few sectors that are expected to report double-digit earnings growth. According to Motilal Oswal Securities, December quarter’s earnings growth would be driven by cyclicals – cement, capital goods and oil & gas are expected to post 24 percent, 59 percent and 42 percent earnings growth, respectively. Consequently, the share of defensives in overall earnings will also decline in FY17.Budget to give a leg-up to cyclicalsThe immediate trigger for cyclical stocks will come from the Budget, scheduled to be presented by the Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on February 1. By now it is an accepted fact that the government will deviate from the path of fiscal consolidation and stimulate the economy by transferring more money in the hands of tax payers to ease the pain of demonetisation. If this were to actually happen in a meaningful way, consumption would get a boost. But given the FM's limited fiscal room, a section of economists believe that the stimulus may come in the form of higher capital expenditure by the government.Morgan Stanley’s base case view is that the government will not use fiscal stimulus to revive domestic demand, considering the starting point of tight fiscal space. Sectoral analysts at the global investment bank expect the Budget to be positive for autos, cement & metals, consumer, Internet and e-commerce, media and real estate. Most economists and strategists do not expect remonetisation to substantially revive consumption to levels higher than the pre-note ban era.Scorecard for key stocksTop Performers of 2016 Hindalco (+83 percent), Yes Bank (+59 percent), Tata Steel (+51 percent), BPCL (+42 percent) and Power Grid (+30 percent).Worst performers of 2016Idea (-49 percent), BHEL (-28 percent), Aurobindo (-24 percent), Sun Pharma (-23 percent) and Bharti Infratel (-20 percent) were the worst performers.Winners for five straight yearsSix Nifty stocks – Eicher, Maruti, IndusInd Bank, Zee Entertainment, Asian Paints and Kotak Mahindra Bank – delivered positive returns for five straight years.Stocks that delivered negative returns for first time in five year.Stocks delivering negative returns for the first time in the last five years wereAurobindo, Lupin, M&M, HUL and HCL Tech.",638,0.0

Motilal Oswal's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

PAT grew 39% YoY to INR 8.8b (9% beat). Strong core operating performance (+29% YoY), led by healthy NII growth (16% YoY; stable NIMs of 4.5%), acceleration in fee income (+15% QoQ and 27% YoY – a positive surprise), controlled opex growth (+12% YoY), and stable asset quality (NSL at 1.2%; drop of 10bp QoQ) were the key highlights.

Outlook

KMB’s premium multiples are likely to sustain, considering strong growth and operating leverage available across businesses, and a clean loan portfolio. Comfort on asset quality remains the highest, with no SDR/5:25, negligible SMA2 and OSRL (11bp). We roll forward target price to FY19. At our SOTP of INR 940, KMB will trade at 3.3x 2019 consolidated BV with cons. RoE of 15-16%. Buy.

HDFC Securities' research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s (KMB’s) 3QFY17 performance was positive on all parameters, namely (1) Loan growth (3% QoQ), which, though modest, was better than estimates and improves the growth outlook, (2) Fees grew 15% QoQ (after 12% QoQ in 2Q), (3) Strong CASA growth, (4) Steady and healthy NIMs, (5) Stable C-I ratio at 48%, despite demonetisation related opex and (6) Superior asset quality. Amongst subsidiaries, the capital market-related businesses (AMC and IB) reported strong earnings growth.

Outlook

KMB is in a sweet spot with strong presence across geographies, diversified products, healthy CRAR and integration related costs and challenges already behind. Superior growth, steady margins, uptick in core fees and a tight leash on cost will improve efficiencies here on. Further, with a decline LLP, ROAAs will improve to 1.8% (+40bps) by FY19E.

Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol ResearchWhile banks have been battling a combined NPA load of Rs 668,825 crore as on September 2016, a class of private lenders have largely remained unaffected. Banks that were formed after the second round of licences were issued in 2003, haven’t been impacted as much as the private players who came before them or the more entrenched state lenders. Kotak Bank, Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank began life in the early aughts. Their net non-performing assets for the third quarter of FY17 were on the lower order of 0.5 percent compared to an industry average of 4 percent -- an indication that the newbies took better lending decisions and steered clear of overexposure to sectors under stress.So, what secret sauce helped the new banks pull ahead of their peers?First, they were relatively new when the financial crisis in 2008 hit them and thus had fewer big loans on their books. Their banking activity revolved around retail banking and trade finances. The average ticket size of their loans were small. The second reason is that these banks grew at a faster click after the financial crisis of 2008. Thus, the size of NPAs measured as a percentage of current total assets is small.

New private banks have stolen a march ahead of their older rivals. No wonder then that they are reporting strong numbers and attracting investors. The three relatively new banks -- Yes Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank -- are all trading near 4.4 times their book value. As compared to this, ICICI Bank trades at 1.78 times while SBI the best of the public sector banks is trading at 1.12 times its book value.

The distinction between banks is clear, need we say more.

A Creaky Older Generation

After announcing its Q3 numbers for this fiscal year, Axis Bank management in the post result interaction pointed out that slippages were on account of legacy issues originating before 2011.

That tells a story in itself: Axis is a new bank with old problems, having started life as a bank promoted by the Unit Trust of India (UTI). The old banks have the old problems, and plenty of them.

Until private banks were given licences for the first time to operate in 1990, nationalised banks, about 27 of them, were in a prolonged snooze mode. They dispensed credit, met priority lending targets, and kept off innovative product offerings. This changed in the decade leading to the new millennium when they were competing with private players who were agile and took risks in what was now a free-market era.The government’s intention was noble. In addition to waking up the state commercial banks, it wanted to promote new blood. Subsequently, the banking sector got split down the middle into two commonly held divisions: the public and private sector banks. Lending as a tool to support their growth flourished.However, a majority of these loans which were given before 2011 still continue to remain toxic. So, what gave? Earlier, nationalised banks’ loan books were marked in red. Now, private players, thanks to their risk-taking prowess, were staring at bad loans.With the entry of private sector banks, the rules of the game changed. The three key pillars of a bank’s market strategy became better technology, aggressive focus on adding current accounts and saving accounts (CASA) deposits and a thrust on retail segment.In the last two decades many of these private banks grew bigger than most of their public sector counterparts. As they garnered deposits they picked on bigger projects for lending. When slowdown struck post the financial meltdown these banks were left holding on to loans which were no longer feasible, especially in infrastructure, power and steel sectors.Many banks continued to hide their non-performing assets by ever-greening these accounts. It was only after the RBI warned of stern action that these banks started disclosing these toxic assets. These loans were so bad that even after restructuring they had to be written off.",670,0.1962257226308187

SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com is positive on banks and his prime picks are YES Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and RBL Bank. He also expects a path breaking Budget this time. Below is the transcript of SP Tulsian’s interview to Anuj Singhal and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18. Anuj: Your thoughts on two of your favourite stocks, where numbers have come out today, Kotak Mahidnra Bank and Maruti. A: First on Kotak. Excellent numbers and if you recall, we have been taking three private sector banks on top-priority as our prime picks – YES Bank, Kotak and RBL Bank. If you really collate all the numbers having declared till now, probably all three will appear on top of the table in all respects. Probably, I will put IndusInd Bank at fourth place. So, excellent numbers and the kind of performance which we have seen, there is no point in talking on all the features of the asset quality, moving the stressed assets to the standard assets, reduction or improvement in the asset quality. Taking all this into consideration, the results are really seen quite good. Coming on Maruti, actually if you really ask me, though the market has received it well on the expected lines, but I will take these numbers as subdued for the simple reason, if you see the realisation in this quarter, per vehicle has increased to Rs 4,95,000 against Rs 4,85,000 on a sequential basis in Q2. In spite of that, the operating profit margin has reduced from 11.86 percent to 9.67 percent and this is a big miss which the market has not considered and probably this may disappoint the party going forward. Maybe because of the expiry considerations, people are keeping the share at the constant level, but I will not be surprised to see profit booking coming in, in the Maruti stock. I am not saying that this will slide or this will maybe by Rs 500 or so, but it can definitely correct by about Rs 200-250 because if you really see, the operating profit fell from Rs 2,400 crore to Rs 1,850 crore in spite of, not the similar, I have given you the per vehicle sales amounts, so I am not happy with Maruti numbers. And considering the share now ruling at Rs 5,600-5,700, there is very little scope because obviously the numbers for March has to be seen first starting with January. So, I will not be taking a buy call, maybe those to whom we have advised going for the buying maybe in the last 3-4 months. We will advise to go for profit booking and look to buy Maruti at a fall of about Rs 200-250 in the next one week or so. Anuj: Your thoughts on Arvind? They are merging Arvind Brands with the listed company. A: I do not think that this is such a big news which warrants the rerating for the stock because if I just focus on the results as of now, the results have been quite flat. And if you see, on the branded apparel segments, the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) has fallen from Rs 18 crore to Rs 10 crore. So, that is seen to be a disappointment. So, overall if you take a valuation call, the way the infusion or taking stake in the retail space by a private equity investor that has really made the shares to move up quite high. And in fact, we see the stock moving up swiftly whenever the informed buying starts coming into the stock. But looking at the results and even considering this news of subsidiary merger, I will not be rerating the stock and taking a positive view.

Anuj: For February series, what are the key stocks that you would be watching out for? Of course, we will have Budget up front in the February series and then of course, we will move on. What would be the key stocks to watch? A: First let me recap when this January series has started, I have given the level of 8,500 when the street was all circumspect and we were talking of 7,500 levels. And in fact, on Bank Nifty, I gave a level of 19,300 when it was ruling at 17,900 or sub-18,000. I am happy that both the targets of Nifty 8,500 and Bank Nifty 19,300 having surpassed way ahead. Now, actually if you really go by the Budget theme because Budget is a very big event, so till February 1, that is Wednesday, we will be having Friday, then Monday, Tuesday and obviously the Budget day has to be excluded, for first three days, in fact I am seeing good positive bias, difficult to take a call but on a ball park basis, I can say that about 150 point rise on the Nifty can be seen maybe at a level of 8,700 plus, 8,700-8,750. On the Bank Nifty, again I have seen one news getting flashed on the channel about half an hour back that government is going to put the recapitalisation amount of Rs 10,000 crore. Sometimes, I feel that it is really very funny. How can that amount get allocated or provided for in the Budget when last time it has been provided at Rs 25,000 crore. In fact, I am expecting this to be much higher, anywhere between Rs 25,000 crore and Rs 40,000 crore. And if you see the renewed buying momentum which we will be going to see in the PSU banks, in fact if you see, the whole Bank Nifty management today has happened largely due to the rise seen in the private sector bank. The public sector banks have yet to perform. If you really see 3-4 public sector bank results have come and I do not think there is much disappointment on the asset quality. Maybe in cases of some of the banks like Indian Bank and Indian Overseas Bank, in fact, I am impressed with the numbers having posted by them. Similar is the story going with the larger PSU banks like maybe Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India (SBI). So keeping a positive bias on the PSU banks for the next three days and the kind of swift rally which we see, take the case of foreign institutional investors (FII) people will start all talking of the FII buying only who have all been talking of the FII selling. So, for the next three days, I am keeping the positive bias and obviously no point in speculating that thereafter the market will remain positive, because everything has to be considered in light of the majors or the announcement being made in the Budget which again I am expecting it to be a very path breaking Budget this time. Sonia: The basic numbers are 12 percent growth on the topline which was largely expected. The profits have come in at Rs 151 crore, so that is actually a 10 percent growth that we are seeing on the bottomline. As I await the margins, how would you read prima facie into these two numbers? A: If I compare Exide Industries with Amara Raja Batteries, these numbers are definitely looking better, but again, one has to really go through and see the results in total because you just cannot take on these two calls, but overall, when I compare it with Amara Raja Batteries, the numbers are looking slightly better.",1256,0.0

Wipro shares lost 1.6 percent ahead of earnings that announced after market hours. The company expects Q4 IT services dollar revenue in the range of USD 1,922-1,941 million, a growth of 1-2 percent over third quarter, which was far lower than analysts' estimates of 2.5-4.5 percent growth.

2:50 pm FII view: With Budget round the corner, the market might take a breather now, says Nitin Jain, Principle Investment Manager at Kotak UK. However, he believes there will be continued support from domestic funds on market dips.

Foreign investors might also return after recently having pruned their exposure, Jain says, adding, funds only seem to be awaiting clarity on corporate earnings in the wake of demonetisation, Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout, and taxation treaties.

Some sectoral baskets like banking, consumer discretionary and to some extent cement have positively surprised on earnings this quarter and Jain feels this raises hope the earnings growth story, which had been belying analysts for some time, can come back.

2:40 pm Earnings: Textiles firm Arvind today reported a 16.40 percent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 75.62 crore for the December quarter, on the account of higher expenses.

Kurian said margins at 14.8 percent were higher than their estimate of 14.4 percent and that too in a tough quarter where there was pressure from higher commodity prices, lower utilisation and demonetisation.

Maruti's profits for the third quarter grew by 47.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,744.5 crore. It was largely driven by other income and partly by operational and revenue growth.

The EBITDA margins were a bit lower at 14.8 percent compared to CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of 15.5 percent.2:00 pm Market Check:

Other income (non-interest income) jumped 26 percent to Rs 910.22 crore, largely driven by fees & services business that increased 26.5 percent to Rs 725 crore YoY. Operating profit surged 26.8 percent to Rs 1,527.7 crore compared with year-ago period.

Earnings were slightly ahead of estimates. Profit was estimated at Rs 808.7 crore and net interest income at Rs 2,016.1 crore for the quarter, according to analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Tarun SharmaMoneycontrolThe Serious Fraud Investigations Office (SFIO) has written to Kotak Mahindra Bank seeking documents related to the bank’s acquisition of 15 percent stake in Multi Commodity Exchange in July 2014, sources told Moneycontrol.This is part of the SFIO’s investigation into the scam at the National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL) in 2013, where investors in paired commodity contracts lost money after the borrowers defaulted on interest payment. Subsequent investigations showed that the borrowers had not deposited any commodities as collateral in warehouses, as required under the rules of NSEL.Financial Technologies India Limited (FTIL), the erstwhile parent company of NSEL, was also the promoter of MCX.SFIO has asked Kotak Mahindra Bank to submit the documents on due-diligence and valuation in the next 15 days.In July 2014, Kotak Bank had bought the stake for Rs 459 crore, or Rs 600 per share, a discount of 24 percent to the market price of Rs 783 at that time.Ten days before this deal, high networth individual Rakesh Jhunjhunwala had bought a two percent stake in MCX at Rs 664 a share.“SFIO wants to know the structure of deal and if the specific reason for MCX selling stake to Kotak Mahindra Bank at a discount,” the source said.Kotak Mahindra Bank did not respond to an e-mail questionnaire on the matter.Interestingly, the SFIO is the first of the investigative agencies probing the NSEL scam to seek details of MCX stake sale.

Country's third biggest private sector lender Axis Bank today cut its interest offering by up to 0.70 percent, following similar moves by all the major players in the system due to high liquidity post demonetisation.

The Shikha Sharma-led bank cut its marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) for one year tenure-- which serves as the benchmark for a slew of loans including home loans--by 0.65 percent to 8.25 percent, it said in a statement.

The new rates, decided by the bank's asset liability committee which met today, are effective from January 18.

""We have passed the entire benefit accruing from a surge in the current and savings account and a drop in deposit rates to the borrowers,"" its head of treasury Shashikant Rathi said.

He added that the bank had effected a cut of between 0.75-1 percent in its deposit offerings right after the November 8 government announcement to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which has led to a surge in the low-cost current and saving account deposits.

When asked about his outlook, Rathi said there is no more room for a cut at present and any further action hinges on events like a cut by RBI in its key rates or a surge in low-cost deposits.

The bank had also cut its ase rate by over 0.10 percent earlier this month. MCLR replaced the base rate in April last year for a better transmission of the RBI's policy actions in borrower costs.

He said 30 percent of the bank's loan book is on the MCLR-based system, but the number is very dynamic as more people are switching to the lower-priced MCLR rates at a faster pace.

The bank's overnight MCLR has come down by a similar 0.65 percent to 7.90 percent while the highest cut of 0.70 percent has been effected in the 3 month and 6 months MCLR which has been reviewed to 8.05 percent and 8.15 percent, respectively.

Country's largest lender SBI led the pack by first announcing a very sharp reduction of 0.90 percent in its MCLR on January 2. Its one year MCLR stands at 8 percent, while the overnight MCLR is 7.75 percent.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley inaugurated Airtel Payments Bank of Bharti Enterprises, which is being rolled out across the country with an investment of Rs 3,000 crore.

""As more and more telecom companies enter the fray, I think we will hopefully see competition not only amongst telecom companies which we read a lot about these days but we will probably see competition between conventional and the new mode of banking that you are going to introduce,"" Jaitley said at the launch.

Bharti Enterprises Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said this is the first payments bank which will be opened across 29 states in India by leveraging retail partners of Airtel. The focus of the payments bank will be to serve people in rural and semi-urban areas, he added.

""With Airtel Payments Bank, we are starting another important chapter in our journey, with the potential to truly transform lives and contribute to financial inclusion in the country,"" Mittal said.

Airtel is offering 7.25 per cent interest per annum initially to attract customers, who can deposit up to Rs 1 lakh in their accounts.

Customers will be able to operate their accounts with the help of a mobile application, and withdraw and deposit money at authorised retail outlets.

The interest rate is a welcome offer and will come down in the future as subsidisation cannot continue for long, Mittal said.

Without naming Paytm, which is set to launch its payments bank, he said, ""They will have to go through processes that we have gone through. We have few months with us. There will be competition which we can meet head on like we have done in telecom."" Mittal added that Bharti holds 80 per cent stake in the payments bank, while the rest is held by Kotak Mahindra Bank.

""We have invested around Rs 1,000 crore. We are looking at total investment of Rs 3,000 crore over a period of time. We will look at getting some more equity partners but there is no immediate plan as of now,"" Mittal said.

He said that Airtel and Kotak Mahindra Bank will follow RBI guidelines on shareholding dilution, which requires shareholding by promoters in the bank to be brought down to 40 per cent within three years from the date of commencement of business of the bank.

Kotak Mahindra Bank Vice Chairman Uday Kotak said the cost of opening a bank account is extremely high in conventional banking while it is low in non-traditional or differentiated banking system.",422,0.20419275760650635

SBI, on January 1, 2017, reduced its lending rate by a good 0.9% after prime minister Narendra Modi in his new year eve address, urged the banks to focus on the needs of poor and lower middle-class and middle-class.

Following the reduction, lending rate of SBI for a one-year loan, has come down to 8% from 8.90%.

SBI’s move, was quickly followed by PNB and Union Bank of India, who also slashed lending rates by up to 0.9%.

The reduction in lending rates, may prompt increase in credit offtake, which has moderated substantially putting burden on the balance sheet of banks.

Home loan rates for ICICI Bank will come down between 0.45% and 0.6%, depending on quantum and category. Another private sector lender, Kotak Mahindra Bank, too reduced the MCLR rate by up to 0.45%. The bank has reduced MCLR by 0.20% to 9% from 9.20% for one-year tenor, Kotak Mahindra Bank said in a statement. However, the MCLR for the three-month period has been reduced by 0.45 percentage points to 8.40%, while the lending rate for two and three years, has been brought down to 9% from 9.25%.

As far as the youngest player, Bandhan Bank is concerned, it has cut its MCLR by 1.48%, to 10.52%, effective from January 3, 2017. With this, the bank has cut its loan rate for small borrowers by almost 4 percentage points, since it started operations in August 2015, Bandhan Bank said in a statement.

Oriental Bank of Commerce has reduced the one-year MCLR rate by 0.8% to 8.60%, while Andhra Bank has brought it down by a similar percentage point to 8.65%, effective January 3, 2017. Dena bank has reduced the MCLR by 0.75%, to 8.55%, for 1 year tenor, the bank said in a statement.

Joining State Bank, PNB and several others, ICICI Bank also cut the base lending rate by 0.70 percent making home, auto and other loans cheaper.

The bank has reduced marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 0.7 percent to 8.20 percent for 1-year tenure, ICICI Bank said in a statement.

Similar cut has been made effective in other tenures, the bank said.

""The revised MCLR benchmarks effective from January 3,"" the bank said.

The reduction in interest rate will bring down interest rate on home and other loans linked to one-year MCLR by similar percentage point.

The one-year MCLR of SBI was reduced to 8 percent from 8.90 percent yesterday.

Banks are cutting lending rates after spurt in deposits following demonetisation of old high denomination currency notes of Rs 500/1,000.

Besides ICICI Bank, other lenders like Kotak Mahindra Bank, Dena Bank, Bandhan Bank, Andhra Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce also slashed MCLR.

Banks have switched to MCLR as their new benchmark lending rate from June last year, replacing the base rate system for new borrowers. It is calculated on the marginal cost of borrowing and return on net worth for banks. It was introduced by RBI to ensure fair interest rates to borrowers as well as banks.

MCLR also seeks to address the regulator's primary objective of expediting monetary policy transmission along with augmenting uniformity and transparency in the calculation methodology of lending rates. MCLR rates are revised every month.",286,-0.4547731280326843

Housing demand will get a big boost with interest rates on home loans becoming cheaper following steep cut in lending rates by major banks, including SBI, according to real estate developers and consultants.

Banks are cutting lending rates after spurt in deposits following demonetisation of old high denomination currency notes of Rs 500/1,000.

Housing sales have been sluggish since last few years due to low demand.

""Good news has started coming for housing and construction sector. Interest rates cut by all the banks will lead to demand being raised substantially,"" DLF CEO Rajeev Talwar told PTI commenting on the lowing of interest rates.

""If project finance is also extended by the banking sector and moratorium on repayment of principal is also allowed, then there will be a huge jump in the number of projects being completed and new supply coming into the market.

""This would ensure that housing prices, which has already fallen by 25-30 per cent in last 3 years, will continue to remain at the lower levels,"" he added.

Property consultant JLL India Chairman and Country Head Anuj Puri said: ""Banks have brought down the interest rate significantly. That will definitely help in improving the sentiments as well as purchasing power in the hands of home buyers. Initiative like this will help in improving the demand in residential segment across various cities"".

Commenting on the lowering of interest rates on home loans, Sobha Ltd VC & MD JC Sharma said: ""The steep cuts announced in the home loans, up to 90 basis points, will be a shot in the arm of the home buyers as their borrowing costs will come down significantly and their affordability factor improves simultaneously. It is expected that demand for homes will get significant boost with this welcome step"".

Several banks, including top lender State Bank of India, announced sharp cuts in lending rates after a surge in deposits following a government ban on high-value bank notes.

SBI, the country's biggest lender by assets, said on Sunday it had cut its so-called marginal cost of funding-based lending rates (MCLR) by 90 basis points for maturities ranging from overnight to three-year tenures.

Still, lenders also took steps to protect their margins. SBI, for example, raised the premium it charges on home loans to 65 basis points above the reduced one-year MCLR of 8 percent, according to details released on Monday. The lender did not specify why it raised the premium.

Banks have received an estimated Rs 14.9 trillion (USD 219.30 billion) in old 500, and 1,000 rupees notes from depositors since the government on Nov. 8 unexpectedly banned the banknotes in a bid to fight counterfeiting and bring unaccounted cash to the economy.

That had raised expectations banks would have room to cut lending rates, which is seen as vital to increase credit growth and spark a revival in private investments.

Although India's gross domestic product grew 7.3 percent in the July-September quarter from a year earlier, the fastest pace of growth among large economies, much of that has been led by consumer demand.

Lower lending rates will be welcome by the Reserve Bank of India, which has cut the policy rate by 175 bps since the start of 2015 but has felt banks were being too slow in cutting their lending rates.

SBI's move comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday admonished banks to ""keep the poor, the lower middle class, and the middle class at the focus of their activities,"" and to act with the ""public interest"" in mind.

Modi's comments were made in a special New Year's eve speech in which he defended his ban on higher-value cash notes and announced a slew of incentives including channelling more credit to the poor and the middle class.

Among others, state-run Punjab National Bank cut its MCLR rates by 70 basis points, Union Bank of India cut its MCLR rates by 65 to 90 basis points, while Dena Bank cut its one-year MCLR rate by 75 basis points. Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank cut rates by up to 45 basis points.",394,-0.08344688585826329

A day after SBI slashed its rate offering steeply, country's fourth biggest private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank today announced a cut of up to 0.45 percent in its lending rates.

The bank has cut marginal cost of funds based lending rate by 0.20 to 0.45 percent across tenors, it said in a statement.

The one year MCLR, which is used as the benchmark for a bulk of long-term consumer loans, has been reduced by 0.20 percent while the maximum cut of 0.45 percent has been effected in the one month and three month MCLRs.

After revision, the one-year MCLR comes down to 9 percent, while the one month and three month MCLRs will be 8.25 percent and 8.40 percent, respectively.

The overnight MCLR --- which is generally a bank's most aggressive MCLR offering --- has been cut by 0.40 percent to 8.20 percent.

The revised rates are applicable from January 1, 2017 onward, the statement said.

A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi exhorted banks to prioritise lending towards poor and lower middle class, SBI cut its MCLR by a steep 0.90 percent, setting the stage for its smaller peers to follow-suit.

Some smaller banks like State Bank of Travancore and IDBI Bank had already announced MCLR cuts in the last week of December.

""While respecting the autonomy of banks, I appeal to them to move beyond their traditional priorities and keep the poor, lower middle class and middle class at the focus of their activities,"" Modi had said.

Banks have moved to MCLR as their new benchmark lending rate from April 2016, replacing the base rate system for new borrowers. It is calculated on the marginal cost of borrowing and return on net worth for banks. It was introduced by RBI to ensure better transmission of its policy actions.",311,-0.7158594727516174

Sarbajeet K SenMoneycontrolSoon you may be able to retain your bank account number even if you decide to switch to another bank. Just like you can retain your mobile phone number after changing your service provider. The Reserve Bank of India is already working on a proposal to allow bank account number portability.What does it mean for you as a saver? Banking experts feel that this would lead to increased competition among banks leading to better interest rate offers for consumers and improved services.“Most new banking sector entrants such as Yes Bank, IDFC Bank, Bandhan Bank and Kotak Bank are offering higher interest rates than their older counterparts like Axis Bank, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank,” Radhika Binani, Chief Product Officer, Paisabazaar.com told Moneycontrol.“The introduction of inter-bank account portability may force older and larger players to pay higher interest on savings deposits for acquiring new customers and retaining older ones,” she said.Also, banks would be forced to improve customer service once such inter-bank transfer is permitted, Binani felt. “The introduction of account number portability will increase healthy competition within the banking system and this would, in turn, push banks to focus more on customer service and product development for retaining their existing customers. Thus, there will be an overall improvement in the banking services,” she said.RBI had initiated the concept of account number portability in 2012 when it asked banks to allow intra-bank account portability in cases where full KYC details of a particular account were ascertained. With this facility, customers now can shift their savings account across branches of a particular bank any number of times without any change in the account number.Adhil Shetty, CEO, Bankbazaar, feels account number portability will take this a step further by enabling this kind of transfer of savings accounts between banks. “The idea of moving across financial institutions seamlessly is a good concept. It will make the process more seamless and frictionless and bring about better services and greater innovation,” Shetty said.However, he feels implementation may not be easy. “It will be time-consuming and painstaking and will entail heavy expenses on technology as well as scale of implementation,” Shetty said.He pointed out that firstly all accounts will have to be linked to the Aadhaar database. He points out not all account holders have linked their bank accounts with their Aadhaar. Unless this happens, Aadhaar-based authentication will not be possible,” he said.Secondly, different banks follow different systems for generating account numbers. Banks will need to switch to a uniform pattern of savings account numbers to enable seamless portability. Banks will also have to adapt a uniform core banking solution (CBS) for implementing the kind of interconnectivity that this savings bank account number portability policy demands.Thirdly, a standardised form of KYC and centralized agency to maintain all KYC documents would be required so that banks can ascertain KYC details while making the switch. “In its current shape, the central KYC has a long way to go before it can be a truly versatile replacement for all the KYC systems currently in place,” Shetty told Moneycontrol.",520,0.0

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank today said it has received RBI approval for its maiden international branch at the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC).

""This will be the first international branch of Kotak. The approval from RBI is subject to the necessary approvals to be received from the host regulator, viz Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA),"" the bank said in a statement.

It can be noted that DIFC is a favourite with Indian lenders looking to have an international presence and many have branches at the location. However, interest has waned post opening of an IFC at Ahmedabad.

Kotak Mahindra Bank said DIFC is one of the leading global financial centres with sizeable business opportunities and it wants to access offshore markets and improve capabilities in forex operations through a presence there.

The bank said it will be able to raise offshore deposits from individuals and non-individuals and also offer offshore asset products through the branch.

The presence will enable it to participate in financing the increasing global trade flows with India, provide loans and develop a platform to build the bank's syndication and structuring capabilities, it said.

At present, the bank has international offices in London, New York, Texas, California, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Mauritius and Singapore.",218,0.5204723358154297

The humble Rs 100 bill had several takers on an otherwise normal weekday evening in the financial capital, even as police had to be deployed outside ATMs to control the crowd waiting eagerly to get their hands on the banknote.

There was a beeline to acquire the 'hottest commodity' or dispose-off the high value Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes, which will become illegal tender at midnight.

As the citizens of the Maximum City went through the process, high drama played out at ATMs, the only operational arms of the banks at that hour, which involved serpentine queues in the hope of landing up the Rs 100 bills and the obvious dejections.

Many guards at the automated teller machines (ATMs) downed their shutters following the surprise announcement by the PM to make Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes invalid, while in many cases, where machines have the capability to accept cash, anxious customers were keen to deposit the high value notes into the accounts.

Citizens of the metropolis had already made their way home after a tiring day at workplace and the residential neighbourhoods saw the maximum rush of people.

A Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) machine in the north east suburb of Mulund was still operational with a long queue of customers keen to deposit cash.

Banking customers in north west suburb of Goregaon wanting to withdraw cash were dejected as ATMs were not dispensing the much in demand Rs 100 bills.

Many of the ATMs in the financial district around the Fort area were closed, while there was a long queue outside a lone operational ATM run by foreign lender Citi.

The unease reached such proportions across the city that police had to take a decision to deploy its personnel outside every operational ATM.

Joint Commissioner of (Law and Order) Deven Bharati issued instructions to police stations to this effect and beat marshalls were deployed for patrolling, officials said.

The beat marshals, who patrol the mean streets to curb any untoward incidents, were proactively telling the citizens not to worry, assuring them that they will be able to withdraw their money from the day after.",367,-0.7883806824684143

Moneycontrol Bureau The new year Samvat 2073 is likely to see good growth as analysts are bullish on the market. Motilal Oswal says strong pick-up in earnings and return to double digit growth in revenue is crucial for the market to move up on a sustainable basis. The brokerage firm is betting on Indian market and expects Sensex earnings per share (EPS) to grow at 17 percent CAGR over FY16-18 as compared to 6 percent CAGR witnessed during FY08-16.

ICICI Direct sees Sensex EPS to grow 16.4 percent YoY to Rs 1600 in FY17 and then witness growth of 17.5 percent YoY in FY18 to Rs 1880. It has set a one year forward target of 31000 for the Sensex and 9400 for the Nifty.

Reliance Securities believes that large caps will outperform from current levels because the valuation gap between Nifty and Small Cap Indices are at all time high.

So, as Diwali glitters shine on Dalal Street here are stocks that you can bet on

HDFC Bank

Motilal Oswal has set a target of Rs 1500 per share, indicating 18 percent upside. It says strong fundamentals and near-nil stressloans would enable the bank to gain market share. Further, continued strong investment in people and branches indicating management positiveoutlook on business. Return on equity (RoEs) are expected to be the best amongst private banks at 20 percent.

LIC Housing Finance

Motilal Oswal thinks the stock can give 24 percent upside at Rs 600 per share. It feels the NBCC company will be the biggest beneficiary of falling GSec yields as more than 80 percent of borrowings come from capital markets. Since the RBI started open market operations 10 months back, GSec yields have declined more than 100 basis points from 7.8 percent to 6.7 percent.

Tech Mahindra

ICICIDirect.com prefers Tech Mahindra due to its lesser exposure in Banking, Financial services and Insurance (BFSI) which is currently facing macro headwinds. Currently BFSI vertical contributes only 11 percent to revenue versus 35-40 percent among other IT peers.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

HDFC Securities is betting on it with target at Rs 854 per share. It says with the e-VYSB integration nearing completion (costs and management bandwidth), and a gradual uptick in macros, it foresees core improvement led by loan growth, improving operating leverage and LLP reverting to normalised levels.

Ashok Leyland

Geojit BNP Paribas sees 32 percent upside in the stock. It expects valuation to improve ahead due to better earnings outlook in the second half of FY17. It has set a target price of Rs 116 per share.

Hero MotoCorp

Geojit BNP Paribas expects the stock to maintain leadership position with a domestic market share of 40 percent in FY18 on capacity expansion and new launches.

Aurobindo Pharma

Reliance Securities expects the pharma stock to deliver a 19-20 percent CAGR in PAT over FY 16-18 It says reduction in capex would result in strong free cash flow generation. It forecasts return on equity (RoE) and RoCE at 24 percent and 26 percent respectively by FY18. It has a target price of Rs 981.

L&T

Centrum Wealth believes L&T is one of the best positioned companies to capitalise on investments and reforms in the infrastructure sector. The company aims to achieve revenue of Rs 2 lakh crore and order inflow in excess of Rs 2.5 lakh crore per annum by 2021, without compromising on margins.

Sun Pharma

Centrum is betting on Sun Pharma as it finds the company to be best placed to navigate the slowdown in the US generic business. However, it says key risks are lower revenues from US Markets, delay in resolution of USFDA warning letter for Halol plant and regulatory risk for its manufacturing facilities catering to global market.

M&M

Kotak Securities sees 16.1 percent upside in the stock. It says profit margin for M&M's auto segment is likely to stay subdued. However, tractor business is expected to witness strong margins due tohealthy demand recovery. Overall, increased share of tractor revenues will be positive for overall EBITDA margins.",680,0.6944812994736892

India's crackdown on undisclosed foreign assets and income is curbing demand for gold in the world's second-biggest consumer, while rising real interest rates and better returns from other financial markets are also hurting purchases, a banker said.

Although consumption should pick up from now until the end of the financial year, when India buys more for gifting during festivals and weddings, weak demand so far has dragged on the global gold price that has shed nearly 9 percent from a two-year high in July to USD 1,258 an ounce on Tuesday.

""There is a crackdown on black money in India and many people who were looking at gold as an investment for unaccounted income are no longer investing in gold at all,"" Shekhar Bhandari, executive vice-president of Kotak Mahindra Bank, told Reuters on the fringes of an industry meet.

Unofficial estimates suggest funds illegally deposited in banks outside the country to avoid tax, known as ""black money"" in India, account for about 10-30 percent of the country's gold demand, said Bhandari.

A tax evasion amnesty scheme, led by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that closed in September disclosed nearly USD 10 billion in undeclared income.

India's gold demand has also been hit by higher returns from other asset classes, Bhandari said, with returns on equities and bonds at 12-13 percent dwarfing gold's 0.9 percent in terms of rupees since 2013. Rising real interest rate due to declining inflation is dimming gold's draw as well.

'PATHETIC'

""The returns on gold in rupees is pathetic,"" Bhandari said.

""I think it won't be advisable to invest in gold given current levels where investment returns are likely to be negative in Indian rupees.""

India's gold imports fell for a ninth month in September as weak retail demand and higher discounts prompted banks and refineries to cut overseas purchases.

But imports in the second half of India's financial year to March will probably be 25-50 percent more than the first half, said Sunil Kashyap, managing director for global banking and markets at Scotiabank.

""With Diwali just about two weeks away from now, demand so far looks good. Expectation is that it'll sustain until the end of the year,"" Kashyap said.

Gold discounts dropped to the smallest in nearly nine months last week as the festive season began.

""If stability of the rupee continues and gold prices are stable, then we can expect positive trends. But any kind of volatility could hamper gold,"" said Scotiabank's Kashyap.",422,-0.5156191810965538

Gold is likely to recover to above USD 1,300 an ounce next year as a pickup in physical demand counters more potential US rate increases, a Reuters poll at an industry event showed.

The precious metal had lost nearly 9 percent from July's two-year highs to trade around USD 1,255 an ounce on Tuesday, hit by expectations the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in December for the second time in a year.

Next month's closely watched US election could spur some safe-haven buying, but any Fed moves will remain key to gold's fate, according to 11 analysts, bankers, traders and refiners attending the London Bullion Market Association conference in Singapore.

Gold will end the year at USD 1,275 an ounce, before rebounding to USD 1,305 in 2017, based on the median estimates in the poll.

""The road is going to be bumpy, but the general trend next year will be upward,"" said Joshua Rotbart, managing partner at Hong Kong-based bullion service provider J. Rotbart & Co. He sees the price at around USD 1,350 in 2017.

Rotbart said he was initially predicting gold to spike similar to its June rally after Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union, with US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gaining ground over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton ahead of the Nov. 8 election.

""Now, when it seems like he's losing the support, we'll have to look for the next challenge,"" he said.

But HSBC analyst James Steel said market participants would be more focused on the Fed's tightening cycle.

After averaging at USD 1,275 in 2016, the metal should recover to average at USD 1,310 next year, he said, as ""the market would have absorbed the rate hike impact and improvements in physical demand would likely push the price up"".

A Fed hike in December would be the second since December last year when the US central bank raised rates for the first time in nearly a decade.

Gold is sensitive to higher US interest rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.

""Next year, I expect the Fed to be a bit more aggressive in tightening,"" said Shekhar Bhandari, executive vice-president of India's Kotak Mahindra Bank , who sees at least two US rate increases in 2017 which should cap gold at USD 1,275.",404,0.10649960381644112

S&P Global Ratings today affirmed its ratings on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a stable outlook on its strong capitalisation and risk management, but ruled out any upgrade in the next one to two years.

S&P has a 'BBB-' long-term rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank with a stable outlook.

The rating also reflects the bank's increased size and reach following its acquisition of ING Vysya bank in 2015.

However, Kotak Bank's below-average funding profile moderates these strengths, it said.

""We affirmed the rating on Kotak Mahindra Bank to reflect the bank's strong capitalisation and risk management,"" S&P Global Ratings Credit Analyst Nikita Anand said.

S&P said it expects Kotak Bank's capitalisation to remain strong over the next 12-18 months, adding that its core earnings are strong and support internal accruals.

""We expect Kotak Mahindra Bank's margins and return on average assets to remain stronger than the industry average over the next 12-18 months,"" it said.

S&P expects the bank's asset quality and credit costs to remain under pressure at least over the next year due to the tough operating conditions for corporate sector in India, but it would remain better than the industry average.

The stable outlook reflects that the bank will maintain the strength of its capital and risk management over the next 12-24 months, despite some deterioration in its capitalisation.

""An upgrade of the bank in the next one to two years is unlikely,"" it said.

S&P also affirmed 'BBB-' long-term ratings on the bank's core subsidiary, Kotak Mahindra Prime, an auto finance company.",265,0.29079078137874603

State-owned Canara Bank, Indian Bank and private sector Kotak Mahindra Bank today cut lending rates by up to 0.1 per cent, following the 0.25 percent repo rate cut by the RBI.

Canara Bank has effected downward revision in the base rate by 0.05 per cent to 9.60 per cent from 9.65 per cent, it said in a regulatory filing.

The new rate would be effective from October 11, Canara Bank said.

Another state-owned lender Indian Bank has reduced marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by up to 0.1 per cent.

For 1-year tenor loan, Indian Bank has reduced MCLR rate by 0.01 per cent from 9.45 per cent to 9.35 per cent, effective October 7.

For all other tenures, the rate of reduction is 0.05 per cent.

Private sector Kotak Mahindra Bank has reduced base rate by 0.1 per cent to 9.40 per cent from 9.50 per cent, it said in a statement.

It, however, has not cut the main marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) on which banks price their assets now. The cut in the base rate will help its existing borrowers as prior to this April. The MCLR framework came into being from April 1 this year.

""Our MCLR meeting will be held at the end of the month and the movement will be in the same direction,"" joint managing director Dipak Gupta told PTI, adding a bulk of its loan book is under the base rate system.

Another private sector lender Karur Vysya Bank announced reduced MCLR rate by 0.35 per cent on various maturities.

These lenders join others, including ICICI Bank and Syndicate Bank which have cut their rates.

On Tuesday, RBI lowered the repo rate or the rate at which it lends to banks by 0.25 per cent.

The 6-member Monetary Policy Committee, which has three members nominated by the government and the rest from the Reserve Bank, lowered repo rate to 6.25 per cent from 6.50 per cent.",339,-0.9834202527999878

The overall value of top 50 brands in the country witnessed a marginal dip of 2 percent this year, almost entirely driven by the decline in brand value of state-owned banks, according to a recent study.

However, the brand value of India's top 50 brands has increased by 30 percent over the last three years, as per the BrandZ study conducted by research agency Millward Brown and commissioned by WPP, which was released here.

The total value of the country's top 50 brands stood at USD 90.5 billion from USD 92.2 billion in 2015.

""The 2 percent adjustment is primarily attributable to state-owned banks, which declined 33 percent in brand value because of loan performance difficulties. With the same state-owned banks removed from the 2015 and 2016 rankings, the value of the India BrandZ Top 50 actually rose 2 percent year on year,"" it said.

Private sector lender HDFC Bank topped the rankings for the third consecutive year with a brand value of USD 14.4 billion, following a 15 percent growth over last year.

Telecom major Airtel and the country's largest lender State Bank of India retained the second and third spot, respectively.

Asian Paints was placed at fourth, followed by ICICI Bank, Bajaj Auto, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Hero and Axis Bank in that order.

The list is dominated by banks and financial companies, accounting for 38 percent of the total value of the top 50 brands.

Retail and aviation brands have entered the top 50 for the first time with Indigo (26) and Jet Airways (36) representing the airline industry while Reliance Retail secured the 50th position.

The study covered 60,000 consumers with over 600 brands across 50 categories in the country.

""Over the past year, brands have had to work hard to hold on to their position in the top 50. 20 brands have witnessed a drop in their ranking within the top 50. Brands which have managed to sustain their ranking over the past two years have only been able to do so by increasing their brand value by over 35 percent,"" Kantar Millward Brown South Asia Managing Director Dinesh Kapoor told reporters here.",369,-0.2000575065612793

Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) has launched an application 'Kotak Now' that would allow new customers to open an account in a more simpler and cost-effective manner.

This is for the first time that a domestic lender has come up with such facility where a customer can open a bank account using its application.

""This is an end-to-end application wherein a customer will be able to open a bank account within 10 minutes, without worrying about visiting a branch or any other merchant,"" Deepak Sharma, Chief Digital Officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank told reporters here.

He further said that after downloading the application, the customer will have to enter their mobile number and then key -in a one-time password (OTP) to establish identity. After this they need to upload an image of either their passport or the Aadhaar card.

The customer will then have to get connect through a video chat with one of the KMB executives and the account gets opened, he added.

The bank tied-up with a German start-up 'WebID' which has a patented technology to establish identities through specially built algorithms and has already implemented it in 30 banks worldwide, Sharma informed.

Implementing the process will help the bank save at least 50 per cent on ""up to Rs 3,000"" spent on a new account opening, he said, adding the expenses like deploying staff, couriering the papers and sending the welcome kit are saved, he said.

At present, the process has been implemented only for current accounts and will be soon expanded to other offerings, he said, adding the lender is targeting to open at least a fourth of the new accounts through this application in a year.

Sharma said WebID's technology has been approved by the German financial regulators and the application complies with the existing know-your-customer requirement of having a ""face to face"" interaction with the customer.

It can be noted that banks have been using the 'tab banking' method of sending a representative with a tablet to open accounts using the Aadhaar ecosystem.

Some banks like Singaporean lender DBS have tried to use mobile phone in a limited way where the customer has to visit a merchant location to complete the process.",378,0.7734386026859283

Alibaba. com, the leading B2B platform for cross-border wholesale trade of Alibaba Group, today announced that it has entered into agreements with new partners to explore the establishment of an expanded Trade Facilitation Centre (TFC) program in India.

The new partners include Kotak Mahindra Bank, IDFC Bank, Delhivery, DHL and Aditya Birla Finance, the company said.

Through these partnerships, the company hopes to encourage and support Indian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) by providing a one-stop shop for their essential trade requirements, it said in a release.

The proposed TFC program would allow SMEs avail special benefits, dedicated support and customised value-added services, besides providing dedicated facilities.

While Alibaba.com would work with Kotak Mahindra Bank and IDFC Bank to provide banking, transactional and lending solutions, Aditya Birla Finance would help improve SMEs' exports process with provision of collateral free loans and customised financing options.

DHL would present Alibaba.com members with Concept 1, a program with one solution for all exports and imports of documents, samples and small shipments, while Delhivery would provide domestic courier and logistics services with free shipments and offer Alibaba.com members special solutions, prices and customer support, it added.

""The TFC is instituted for the sole purpose of driving greater participation of Indian SMEs in the international trade and business market,"" Global Managing Director and Head of India for Alibaba Group K Guru Gowrappan said.

The company said with leading providers of such services as part of its TFC program, Alibaba.com will provide its platform users with tailor-made services.

Alibaba.com has been operating in India since 2007.

The marketplace had around 6 million registered Indian buyers and sellers as of early 2016.

Alibaba.com India SVP for Strategic Partnerships Vinay Bhartia said SMEs in India, with whom they interacted, faced multiple challenges even after receiving export orders like logistics, funding, banking services, inspection and shipment.

""So while Alibaba.com helps SMEs or exporters find overseas buyers, value-added services to be provided by our TFC partners will help our members overcome these challenges,"" the company said.",346,0.31106821695963544

The government will appoint up to three merchant bankers for the share issue, which could fetch about Rs 2,100 crore to the exchequer at the current market price.

Last month the Cabinet had cleared 15 percent stake sale of NBCC through an offer for sale (OFS).

The government is also considering allotting shares to eligible NBCC employees at a discount of 5 percent to the issue price up to a maximum of 0.75 percent of the OFS size.

The employees will be eligible to apply for shares up to Rs 2 lakh.

Shares of NBCC closed at Rs 239.65, down 0.37 percent on BSE on Friday. At the current market price, sale of 15 percent stake could fetch around Rs 2,100 crore to the exchequer.

Government currently holds 90 percent stake in NBCC.

Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has started an 'Innovation Lab' in Bengaluru to tap into the best technology that impacts its operations, and is open to investing in startups, a senior company official has said.

""We started an 'Innovation Lab' recently which is right now a dedicated space from where we are partnering with startups in the fintech space to test concepts and launch them into commercial products,"" Kotak Bank's Chief Digital Officer Deepak Sharma told PTI.

The fourth largest private sector bank has put together a seven-member core team which is working with an equal number of startups in the artificial intelligence, analytics, biometric or iris scanning and machine learning space.

A bulk of the startups are Bengaluru-based, while two are from the US and Australia, Sharma said.

Domestic lenders, especially those in the private sector, have been increasing their engagement with the fledgling fintech startup community to tap into the technologies of the future which will help them stay relevant.

The initiatives being undertaken by them include launching dedicated funds to invest in startups, starting incubation centres, organising 'hackathons' and ideation contests.

Sharma said the bank's lab located in its office on MG Road in the garden city is not an incubation centre, but added that the bank is open to investing in other startups as well.

""We are open to investments in other startups as well but do not have a dedicated fund now,"" he said.

The bank will keep evaluating possibilities on investing, partnering and incubating startups through this initiative and will also hire more people for the lab in the next three to six months, he said.

Sharma described it as an asset-light and agile model where it is working with specially chosen partners.

""It is about validating proof of concepts and the lab helps us in doing it in a dedicated way,"" he said.",321,0.9833078980445862

""We believe transmission of rates will happen gradually over the next few months as credit growth picks up pace,"" SBI Chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya, said describing the status-quo monetary policy as per market expectations.

She hailed Governor Rajan for frontloading liquidity provisions through an OMO as ""a well thought-out move as capital flows have been relatively slow this year given the global uncertainties, resulting in lower net foreign exchange acquisition"".

During the customary post-policy press meet, Rajan blamed the bankers for holding onto higher rates even after the RBI lowering the same by 150 bps.

Complaining that banks have passed benefits only in a ""modest"" measure to borrowers, Rajan said a pick-up in credit demand, which would follow the economic recovery and competition for corporate loans after the ongoing balance sheet clean-up by the state-run lenders, will ensure softer lending rates.

""Earlier, some bankers said it was lack of liquidity which that was holding the rates high. Now, I hear from some that it is the fear of FCNR redemptions that is making them reluctant to cut rates. I've a suspicion that some new concern will crop up once FCNR redemptions are behind us,"" Rajan said.

""We would be happier if there was more transmission,"" he said, adding the RBI is sensitive to ""some of the difficulties"".

He also said the central bank will soon revise the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate framework to help fasten up process of policy transmission.

Chanda Kochhar of ICICI Bank welcomed both the continued accommodative policy stance as well the measures to ensure adequate liquidity.

Bank of India's Melwyn Rego said the assurance of continuing accommodative stance and liquidity are welcome moves. That the move was welcomed by the market is clear from the fact that the fixed income market reacted immediately with the 10-year yields falling by about 5 bps, giving banks an opportunity to book profits on fixed income portfolios.

Rana Kapoor of Yes Bank expects a rate cut in the coming months saying that notwithstanding the current pause on rates, the disinflationary impact will be upheld by favourable monsoons and structural policy reforms by government which will lead to a 50-100 bps space for incremental monetary easing during the current fiscal year itself.

Kotak Mahindra Bank's Shanti Ekambaram too echoed similar views, saying while risks of inflation remain, a host of positive factors like easy global liquidity and ample domestic liquidity indicate downward trajectory of interest rates in second half of the current fiscal year.",446,-0.09699224763446385

Pharmaceuticals, financials, consumer, auto and auto ancillary companies have consistently given high equity returns to the investors while sharp out performance has been observed in shares of small and mid-size businesses, during the last 20 years, says a report.

According to financial services firm Centrum, some of the long-term outperformers have been Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank, Dr Reddy's, Hero MotoCorp, Britannia, Apollo Hospitals, Shree Cement, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, LIC Housing Finance, Supreme Industries and Eicher Motors.

""Some sectors have consistently brought good cheer to their investors over the last 20 years. Pharma, financials, consumer, auto and auto ancillary stories have mostly not disappointed the market and have managed to generate good returns, year after year,"" the report said.

""These have been most consistent performers and have neither given outsized returns in any period nor have they seen sharp under performance in any period,"" it added.

Going by data compiled by Centrum for Sensex, the 30-share index has generated a return of 7.55 percent since 2011. It had given negative returns of 1.64 percent to investors during the period 1996-2001, following which it had generated 25.37 percent and 12 percent returns in 2001-2006 and 2006-2011, respectively.

Centrum also noted that sharp out performance in the last 20 years has always comes from small, mid-sized and upcoming businesses.

Having bagged a Rs 250-crore investment from BPCL, the first by an oil marketer in a Payments Bank, Fino Paytech is looking for at least one more round of fund infusion through stake sale before it launches the bank in about 6 months.

""We will have at least one more stake sale, after which we will proceed ahead to launching the bank,"" Fino's Managing Director and CEO Rishi Gupta told PTI.

He declined however to elaborate the quantum of infusion or the stake sale in the company, valued at over Rs 1,200 crore, is looking at.

When asked about the new shareholders, Gupta hinted that it may be some new, non-financial player again, saying a payments bank is the start of differentiated banking and the stakeholders will also be from varied businesses.

It can be noted that till now, a majority of the eight Payments Bank aspirants are riding on complementarity with the telecom business and it is the first time that a OMC has come on board.

Some like Airtel's tie-up with Kotak Mahindra Bank have already received the final nods while others are on the way.

The RBI's 18 month window to those who have been given in-principle nods is on till February 2017.

Gupta said Fino is waiting for the stake sales to go through before making proceeding ahead for the final nod.

It can be noted that under the RBI norms, Fino is required to bring its foreign holding under 50 per cent which is being done through the stake sales.

Fino's shareholders include ICICI Bank, IFC, HAV3 holdings, The Blackstone Group and Intel Capital, besides BPCL.

Gupta said Fino will be targeting the ""non-digital"" population for the Payments Bank operations.

Apart from BPCL's network of retail outlets which serve a slew of individual customers and fleet operators, the payments bank will also benefit from its home gas distribution business where the subsidies are transfered directly into bank accounts, Gupta said.

Raising the issue during Zero Hour in Lok Sabha, Chintaman Malviya alleged that banks like ICICI, Kotak Mahindra, YES and Axis have become ""organised racket of profiteers"" which have nothing to do with implementing schemes like the Jan Dhan Yojana.

He said these banks work ""100 percent"" in English and do not conduct their business in the state language (Raj Bhasha).

He wanted the banks to be nationalised if they do not implement the agenda of financial inclusion.

Raising another issue, M B Rajesh (CPI-M) demanded that the government withdraw the move to merge the State Bank of Travancore with State Bank of India as it would go against the interests of the people of Kerala.

Rajesh, who was supported by members of other parties from the state, said the State Bank of Travancore has been having 850 branches in the state and was in robust financial condition.

KR Choksey's research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank



With initial concerns over integration process behind, Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) put up a decent show for 1QFY17. In fact, FY17 should witness synergy benefits in terms of cost savings, CASA enhancement and fee income traction. Strong operating metrics and healthy NII coupled with restrained operating expenses drove the PAT for the quarter. Since 1QFY16 was the first quarter reporting merged numbers, the Y-o-Y profitability stood staggering high at 291% to INR 7,420 mn; up 7% Q-o-Q. Margins expansion was the key positives for the quarter translating into healthy NII traction. While advances grew 17% Y-o-Y (tad below our estimates), the asset quality disappointed tad Q-o-Q. While the loan growth remained sedate as the bank maintains cautionary stance evaluating risk-reward profile, the balance sheet and return ratios have remained subdued. Merged entity benefits, robust capitalization and strong growth visibility prompt us to maintain a positive upward bias, and REITERATE ACCUMULATE.

Kotak Mahindra Bank’s (KMB) Q1FY17 PAT (consolidated, ex-life insurance), at INR9.96bn, surpassed our estimate following beat in banking and investment banking earnings. After a few soft quarters, revenue momentum improved following: a) better loan growth (merged entity) at 17% versus lower teens earlier; and b) improving core fee. Overall stress (GNPLs + restructured book) was broadly stable; rise in SMA-II accounts was largely technical and will correct in Q2FY17. We maintain that merger with eIVBL will provide the much-needed leap in terms of scale. However, softer revenue traction will cap near-term return ratios (RoE capped at low mid teens).

The Cabinet has approved recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, which will grant salary hike to over one crore government employees and pensioners. The government has increased pay and pension segments while allowances have been kept on hold which will be revised over next four months. Pay hike for government employees is likely to boost consumption and bolster growth with higher spending.

Though 7th pay hike is lower than in 6th Pay Commission and the arrear payouts are likely to be lower, analysts still expect a consumption boost. Citi economists expect consumption growth pick up to 8.4 percent in FY17 from 7.6 percent in FY16 (marginal downside risks from potential delays in implementation of allowances hike). It estimates combined wage stimulus could be over 1 percent of GDP over FY17-18. The firm sees positive impact in consumer related segments - auto, retail, durables, housing, retail banking. It has buy rating on autos (Maruti), consumer related (Titan, Voltas, Coffee Day, Phoenix Mills), retail focused banks (HDFC Bank, Kotak, IndusInd), housing finance (HDFC, LIC Housing Finance) and cement companies (Ultratech).

Macquarie believes that the wage revisions will help boost private consumption especially in urban areas thus support overall growth. It says that private consumption growth will likely improve to 8 percent in FY17 from 7.4 percent in FY16 on annual basis due to wage revisions and the one rank one pension (OROP) scheme, hopes of a good monsoon, contained inflationary pressures and lower cost of capital ,among others. As per Macquarie’s estimates 47 percent of central government employees are based in Tier 1/Tier 2 cities and rest in smaller cities.

Credit Suissse thinks that the pay hike mostly benefits top quarter of urban consumers. Housing (rent,and likely ownership) and transportation (mainly four-wheeler purchases and fuel) are the most likely beneficiaries LIC Housing Finance, Maruti, BPCL, IOC, Kajaria and Havell's are top plays, according to the brokerage firm.

However, it also points out that railways may see the worst impact. “Delayed implementation of allowances (no arrears on them) limits impact on this year's union budget but there could still be Rs 25000- Rs 30000 crore additional costs. Better corporate profits could create some room; the 7th Pay Commission hikes should also help taxes. Early start in states would help central tax take as well,” it says in a note.

HDFC Bank's Aditya Puri saw the maximum jump in remuneration among private bank chiefs in 2015-16, with a 31 percent growth at Rs 9.73 crore.

Axis Bank's Shikha Sharma came in second, whose compensation package jumped 28 percent to Rs 5.50 crore.

The decision to give up bonuses after RBI-mandated asset quality review (AQR) saw ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar's salary decline 22 percent to Rs 4.79 crore in the year gone by, as declared in bank annual reports.

If the Rs 1.16-crore bonus Kochhar received in 2014-15 is excluded, her remuneration grew 14.47 percent in 2015-16.

Yes Bank chief Rana Kapoor saw a 20.76 percent hike in remuneration at Rs 5.67 crore. For Kotak Mahindra Bank's Uday Kotak, the corresponding figure was over 9 percent at Rs 2.47 crore in 2015-16.

Some market watchers say much of the top management compensation package was decided in early part of the fiscal before RBI's AQR kicked in.

The Reserve Bank has initiated the AQR exercise to help banks clean up their balancesheets.

Sharma has let it be known that the asset quality improvement will be ""gradual"".

Compared to the bank's median salary, Kochhar's salary is 100 times that of an average employee while Puri's is 179 times. HDFC Bank had 311 employees earning over Rs 60 lakh per year while for Axis Bank, it stood at 163, their annual reports showed.",242,0.3772440105676651

Kotak also questioned whether nationalisation of banks served the purpose of checking disproportionate lending to big businesses, as most of the stress on their books is today due to loans to big corporates.

In his annual message to shareholders, the Kotak Mahindra Bank chief also pitched for an 'exit mechanism' for the sector, saying forced mergers, as practiced in past, may not be possible for public sector banks anymore due to their huge NPAs.

Kotak, who is known as one of the most vocal voices within Indian banking industry including about its own perils, said he sees a ""well-settled government"" in the country today, but it ""could do more to build confidence and trust among businessmen and rekindle animal spirits into the economy"".

""The last financial year saw the Indian economy stretched between two ends of the string, good macro tailwinds but a difficult micro situation,"" he said, adding that inflation, current account and fiscal deficit were all under control, but many sectors and individual businesses struggled.

""This scenario is likely to change from hereon. With Brent recovering to USD 50 levels, the benefits of lower prices will reduce, and this has the potential to increase our current account deficit and bottoming out of inflation.

""It is time for the Indian micro to gear up and get back into the game,"" he said.

On banking sector, Kotak said, ""The weak underbelly of Indian banking, something which I have been consistently pointing out through the years, has resurfaced strongly. Both public and some private sector banks have revealed stress on their balance sheets.

""The story is not over yet, and we can expect to see more bad news on this front. But it is also a fact that banks have started cleaning up their balance sheets."" Among the lessons from the problems in banking sector, Kotak said banks should understand they are not private equity investors and recovery of money should be at the heart of lending.

""Return of capital is more important than return on capital. If banks think they cannot recover money, they should not lend in the first place,"" he said, while suggesting a serious overhaul of the recovery mechanism in the country.

He also blamed the banks for ""postponing the pain"" for the last many years, saying it has had a ballooning effect on exposures.

Kotak further said, ""Banks were nationalised 47 years ago.

One of the reasons for this was that private banks were lending disproportionately to big businesses. Access to funds from banks was not easy for the common man.

""Nationalisation was supposed to change this. Today's irony is that the biggest losses booked by banks, including public sector banks (PSBs),are on account of lending to big businesses.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its policy interest rate unchanged at a five-year low of 6.50 percent on Tuesday, while signalling the prospect of another cut later this year if monsoon rains dampen upward pressure on food prices.

COMMENTARY

Rupa Rege Nitsure, Group Chief Economist, L&T Fnanace holdings

""Some factors are pointing to upside risks to inflation such as seasonal spikes in vegetable prices, added burden of tax on services inflation, and some factors are creating uncertainty like geopolitical situation on crude oil prices and monsoon. Naturally, it was not a time to take a rate action. But I think what is positive is that they would like to take thorough review of MCLR lending rate regime. Transmission has not happened much on the longer interest rate side. As long as the structural stresses continue in large corporates, provisioning needs for banks will continue on higher side. As long as that continues, there will be limited chance for interest rates to come down on longer tenure loans.""

A. Prasanna, Economist, ICICI Securities Primary Dealership

""Our view is that repo rate has bottomed out, there are no further rate cuts. RBI's commentary on inflation seems to be moving along in that direction.

""Base case is system should be able to manage FCNR redemption, and if there is pressure, RBI has indicated they will be stepping in if there's dollar shortage.

""The timeframe in which liquidity neutrality will be achieved will depend on external conditions. If balance of payments' profile is favouable then it can be in the beginning of next year, else will extend to the next financial year.""

Madhavi Arora, Chief Economist, Kotak Mahindra Bank

""Though they have raised issues with regard to inflation, overall accommodative stance continues. If and when they get a chance to revisit the rate cut stance, I think there still is a scope for one more policy rate cut, probably not immediately but definitely second half of the year.

That said, the immediate focus of the central bank would move to liquidity management. I think that is the key policy movement you would see in the next few months.""

Abheek Barua, Chief Economist, HDFC Bank

""This is the most tepid policy I've come across in many years. I don't think this policy gives us additional information from what the April policy did. One source of comfort is that there is an assurance to manage dollar and rupee liquidity if there is pressure during FCNR outflow. There's also a caveat that people should not take it for granted depending on the level of the rupee whether there will be intervention or not.

""The other thing is statement is couched in many conditions. I think to see the policy as hawkish is a bit premature. There is room for at least one rate cut until December.

""I think the policy is very neutral and tepid in every sense of these two words.""Sanjiv Bhasin, EVP-Markets & Corporate Affairs

""So market had discounted a no-change policy and jobs data from the US further extinguished hopes of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve. Also, tone of the governor is more on extension of his term rather than the monetary policy. So this was all given.""

""Inflation creeping up in the last month would have been a dampener because we know that monsoon is expected to be very good but right now with inflation rising, it was given that he (Rajan) would leave monetary policy unchanged.""

""Any chance of a rate cut will now be more in August with a 25 basis points cut and by December repo should come down to 6 percent.""

R. Sivakumar, Head of Fixed Income, Axis Assest Management

""There is recognition that there is some upward momentum on inflation given the recent data. The data as it is today suggests that inflation is hovering around 5 percent mark which limits the number of rate cuts that they can do. However, if there is a downward movement on inflation on account of monsoon they might be able to see some opportunity to change the stance.

""The current stance of monetary policy is already accommodative and the best thing they can do is to continue with improving liquidity which will allow banks to lend at lower rates.

""This year we are aiming for 20 percent growth. The credit offtake (corporate) in recent past has been slow. But as you see interest rates keep falling and you see some green shoots coming out in economy,"" Bank's Senior Executive Vice President Virat Diwanji told mediapersons.

""It is clearly a sign of some positive development in the external environment. And as a result in the second half of the year we expect the demand from the corporate India to be really on the rise,"" Diwanji added.

Last year, the bank witnessed 14-15 percent growth in the overall credit offtake.

Replying to a query, he said the corporate credit portfolio of the bank is close to Rs 1,18,000 crore which is one third of the total asset portfolio.

On the Net Interest Margin (NIM), he said it would be about 4.35 to 4.50 percent.

Last quarter, the NIM was at 4.35 percent.

Moneycontrol BureauBrokerage house Morgan Stanley feels new non-performing asset (NPA) formation will decline 40 percent in FY17, with the economy showing signs of recovery.Morgan Stanley continues to be bearish on state-owned banks while it is bullish on private sector banks like Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank.“It (new NPA formation) will still be high, but given the surge in FY16, it should decline meaningfully this year,” says the Morgan Stanley note.The brokerage, however added that most banks were reluctant to guide on a sharp decline.“We may still end up with more than 4 percent of system loans turning bad this year. Private corporate lenders were confident about the watch lists and we will likely start getting clarity on pace of provisioning in F1H17(first half of this fiscal year),” says the Morgan Stanley note.Most public sector banks had a disatrous March quarter with Bank of Baroda, Bank of India and Punjab National Bank logging record losses due to provisioning for bad loans.“On state-owned banks, the concerns were around provisioning for the NPLs announced and how it will affect profitability even when NPL formation slows,” says the note.",200,-0.9924442172050476

Geojit BNP Paribas's research report on Kotak MahindraKotak Mahindra Bank’s (KMB) Q4FY16 PAT (consolidated, excluding life insurance), at INR9.8bn, was higher than our estimate following beat at banking, AMC and investment banking segments. Integration process is on track with waning impact of integration costs (contained within guided range). However, merger challenges were reflected in slower revenue momentum given: a) loan growth (merged entity) at 11-12%%; and b) slower core fee traction. We maintain that merger will provide much-needed leap in terms of scale and synergies (presence, product repertoire etc). However, slower revenue traction will cap near-term return ratios (RoE capped in low mid teens). Maintain ‘HOLD’ as valuations of 3.6x FY18E P/ABV (standalone) factor in fair bit of upside.While green shoots of integration have started to appear in cost benefits, revenue momentum is still weak, improvement of which will be key. KMB (standalone), which generated RoA of ~1.8-1.9% earlier, post merger will see dip to ~1.4-1.5% and take some time to revert to earlier levels. Building in successful integration of merger and likely synergy benefits, the merged entity trades at 3.6x FY18E P/ABV, which factors in fair bit of synergy upsides. Hence, we maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ with SOTP of INR713.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Kotak Mahindra Prime today said it will raise Rs 400 crore by issuing non-convertible debentures (NCDs) on a private placement basis.

""The company intends to issue secured, redeemable, non-convertible debentures of the face value of Rs 10,00,000 each, amounting to Rs 400 crore, on a private placement basis,"" Kotak Mahindra Prime said in a BSE filing.

Kotak Mahindra Prime (KMPL) is a subsidiary of Kotak Mahindra Bank, primarily formed to finance passenger vehicles.

It finances by loaning for passenger cars, multi-utility vehicles and pre-owned cars. And also offers inventory funding and infrastructure funding to car dealers.

As the banking sector expands with entry of new players in different avatars, veteran banker Uday Kotak feels policymakers must think about the ways to deal with a situation when a bank goes belly-up.

The banking sector is currently awaiting entry of many differentiated-licence banks such as payments and small finance banks, while the Reserve Bank has just floated a discussion paper for on-tap licensing of full-fledged banks going forward.

""Never in our history have you seen so many banks coming in, in different avatars. Now, you have the draft banking guidelines for new banks on-tap,"" Kotak said.

""Till date, they have not let any bank fail. If you got 50 or 100 banks, I am sure they will have thought through that (a bank going belly up) as well,"" said the vice chairman and managing director of Kotak Mahindra Bank.

""I am sure the policymakers will also have to revisit that,"" he said.

The comments from Kotak, during an interaction here last week, come at a time when 20 new payments banks and small finance banks are on their way to enter the system.

Besides, RBI has also said that wholesale banks apart from custodian banks will be the next ones to be introduced in the differentiated banking licence regime.

RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan himself, however, has played down the concerns over any possible banking crisis in India and said last week in London that there was ""absolutely no chance"" of any 'Lehman moment' in the country -- referring to collapse of once-all-powerful banking giant Lehman Brothers in the US that triggered a major financial crisis in 2008.

In times of stress, policymakers in India tend to use the formula of forcing the affected bank to merge with a bigger lender. But with the number of banks increasing, it might become difficult to effect such deals.

It can be noted that for protecting the depositors, there is a deposit insurance with a cap of Rs 1 lakh per customer in place.

Kotak Mahindra Bank has itself tied up with the Bharti Airtel's payments bank, but Kotak was not willing to comment on its launch plans.

The payments bank has become among the first to get the final licence, and Kotak said it would be better for the board of the payments bank to speak on the plans.",398,-0.2977461814880371

Kotak Mahindra Bank Chief Uday Kotak, who has a net worth of about USD 7.1 billion, is the sole Indian in Forbes' list of 40 of the most powerful people in the financial world who control the flow of trillions of dollars around the global economy.

57-year-old Kotak is ranked 33rd in the Forbes list of 'Money Masters: The Most Powerful People In The Financial World' topped by Blackstone Group's CEO Stephen Schwarzman, who has a net worth of USD 10.2 billion and oversees assets worth USD 344 billion.

It said the 40 financiers on the list dominate the world of money, from banking to buyouts, trading to takeovers.

""The hedge fund managers, private equity moguls and lenders who control the flow of trillions of dollars around the global economy impact just about all of us one way or another,"" Forbes added.

With the Kotak bank overseeing USD 34.6 billion in assets, Forbes said the Indian billionaire, who has a net worth of about USD 7.1 billion, has made his fortune lending to the sprawling masses between Mumbai and Delhi and has also taken a stand on behalf of savers.

""His bank is continuing to offer 6 per cent on savings accounts, even as falling rates make it harder to do so. Kotak is gung ho on his native country and believes investing in India is like a Bollywood movie - long, but with a happy ending,"" it said.

""Even after a run-up in asset prices, the chief of the world's biggest private equity firm is finding ways to put money to work, including recent real estate deals in India, where Blackstone Group now owns 30 million square feet of office space in major cities,"" Forbes said.

Following Kotak Mahindra Bank's solid fourth quarter numbers, its chief Uday Mahindra said that integration with Bangalore-based ING Vysya Bank will be completed by June 2016. The bank posted a standalone net profit at Rs 695.8 crore in January-March quarter from Rs 635 crore in last quarter. During the quarter, its standalone net interest income was at Rs 1857.2 crore against Rs 1,766 crore in the quarter-ago period.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Kotak, the bank’s Executive Vice-Chairman and Managing Director, said he estimates loan growth for FY17 to be around 20 percent.

The bank has one of the lowest restructured loan books, he said, adding that the loan recovery process today is much tougher than before.Kotak said if a loan turns bad, one should be able to take it on the chin, and provide for it.

""Don’t mix accounting with what is right for recovery of the money.""

As regards sectors which are seeing an uptick in investment, he picked the commercial vehicle segment, business banking and the small business segment.The bank will look at the individual books of companies before making a decision to loan. It wouldn't follow the herd mentality, he said.

The bank's fundamental philosophy is to look at risks and returns and take a call based on risk-adjusted returns rather than blindspots.",225,0.18708547949790955

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) announced opening of its IFSC Banking Unit (IBU) at the Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) to meet the requirements of offshore banking operations from India.

KMB has joined a clutch of peers who have opened IBUs at the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) of GIFT City.

""This is our first international branch at GIFT City. We have set aside USD 20 million to start our international banking unit from GIFT City,"" said K V S Manian, Kotak Bank President (Corporate, Institutional and investment Banking).

""In absence of an international branch, we were not able to cater to our customers overseas, but our GIFT City branch will change things for us,"" Manian said.

Gandhinagar-based GIFT City, India's first and only IFSC, has been developed and designed to meet the growing demand of Indian corporates for financial funding and services in overseas markets.

""Until now, banks which aspired to service clients for their foreign capital requirements had to set up branches abroad. Setting up a branch in GIFT-City helps banks to meet these requirements by undertaking offshore banking operations from India,"" Manian said.

""Indian corporates are increasingly looking at financing to fund their global and domestic expansion plans. In the last few years, raising funds from overseas markets has become increasingly attractive because of liquidity. As per RBI data, India Inc raised over USD 1.52 billion from overseas markets in March 2016,"" a statement by the bank said.

""What this branch will do is it will allow us to make over balance sheet in dollars. We can borrow in dollars and we can lend in dollars. Important thing is we will be regulated by one regulator only as our international branch will operate from India,"" Manian said.

Through the IBU, the fourth largest private lender will be able to offer foreign currency loans and deposits to corporates. It will also offer external commercial borrowings, buyers' credit for imports and factoring/forfaiting of export receivable for Indian corporates in international markets.

He said KMB is looking at building a balance sheet of about half a billion dollars in a year through the IBU.

""The major tax incentives announced in the last Union Budget have made the IFSC at GIFT a globally competitive player and many BFSI players are swarming to this new global financial hub,"" GIFT Company Managing Director and Chief Executive Ajay Pandey said.",406,0.9976991415023804

DBS Bank India swung back into the black with a small profit in 2015-16 and to widen retail footprint, the Singapore-based lender will offer an interest of 7 per cent on its savings bank (SB) accounts, which is highest in the industry.

Unlike the competition, which offers 6 percent (Kotak Mahindra and Yes Bank on deposits above Rs 1 lakh and RBL 7.1 percent for above Rs 10 lakh), DBS will pay 7 percent even on Re 1 balance.

""We have returned to profit with a marginal profit in FY16 after the losses in FY15,"" DBS Bank India Chief Executive Surojit Shome told reporters here on the sidelines of an event to launch the bank's newest product offering. But he did not offer more details.

Reverses on bets taken on infra and construction sectors had led to a loss of Rs 275 crore in the previous fiscal, where it had to write-off loans and make heavy provisions.

Shome said the quantum of core capital which the Singapore parent had to infuse also went up to Rs 670 crore last year, while over the past two years, it has infused Rs 1,700 crore in tier-II capital. The bank has so far invested Rs 6,500 crore in the country.

At present, India accounts for just 5 per cent of its overall loan-book, but accounts for the highest investments outside of the capital employed to cover up for bad assets, Group Chief Executive Piyush Gupta said.

Singapore's largest lender DBS Bank today said it has unveiled India's first mobile-only bank - 'digibank'.

Gupta said the bank is able to give a higher interest of 7 per cent as against the current 5 per cent for up to 40,000 savings bank account-holders, because of the savings which will be accruing to it will be passed on to the customers.

He said this offering is possible because of investments in digital and added at the group level, it has increased its spend on digital to SGD800 million this year from SGD 700 million a year ago.

It is targeting to enroll five million accounts through the Digibank initiative and take the deposits up to Rs 50,000 crore in five years, Gupta said.",377,-1.531839370727539e-05

CLSA has initiated coverage on Kotak Mahindra Bank with an outperform rating and target price of Rs 770, citing robust asset quality and return on assets post integration of ING Vysya Bank. The stock gained more than 1 percent.

After a year spent integrating ING Vysya Bank (INGV), Kotak has reached the inflection point from which it should start to realise opportunities, the brokerage said, adding the potential to leverage synergies with the existing strong franchise could drive strong earnings growth over two years.

According to its note, a robust asset quality and return on assets (ROA) as well as leverage expansion will take return on equity to 15 percent by FY18, or 17-18 percent in an optimal scenario.Risks are primarily from integration delays, it feels.
