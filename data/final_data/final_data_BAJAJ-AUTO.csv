Bajaj Auto plans to achieve a monthly sales target of 10,000 units for Bajaj Triumphs, and envisions a production and sales surge in the third quarter of the current fiscal, aiming to reach 18,000 units, according to Rajiv Bajaj, CEO, Bajaj Auto.

Discussing Triumph further, the CEO mentioned that in addition to increasing capacity, the company must also focus on broadening its distribution network. ""We inherited about 14 or 16 dealers from Triumph. I think we might have about 75 dealers now versus let us say 1,000 for Royal Enfield or 800 for Bajaj, so we still have a long way to go before we establish the required distribution footprint,"" he said.

In an earlier interview, Bajaj had said, ""With Triumph we are offering affordable aspiration to customers. We are offering premium products, offering great value.""

Speaking about being a global manufacturer, Bajaj said, ""From being merely a producer to becoming a provider of a global brand, I think there is a growing sense of confidence, there is a growing sense of awareness.""

Bajaj also mentioned that the company enjoys a strong presence in nearly 90 countries, and holds a leading position in several of these markets.

""In Africa for example, across the continent, one out of three motorcycles is a Bajaj motorcycle,"" he said.

Early this year, Bajaj Auto and British motorcycle brand Triumph jointly unveiled the Triumph Speed 400 and Scrambler 400 X motorcycles in India on July 5, as part of a 2017 deal between the companies.

Bajaj Auto is currently working on a two-wheeler CNG and hopes to launch it in 2025, said the company's chief executive officer (CEO) Rajiv Bajaj.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18 on November 22, Bajaj said that presently there are no CNG two-wheelers available anywhere in the world.

Speaking more about the two-wheeler industry, he said this space suffers from over-regulations and taxation. ""Almost 60 percent of the three-wheeler industry has moved to CNG,"" he added.

Bajaj further noted that auto sales have not crawled back to the pre-pandemic levels yet, with the two-wheeler space taking a hit in recent times.

The CEO also said that the company intends to sell 10,000 units per month and anticipates doubling production and sales of Triumph in the third quarter of the current fiscal at 18,000 units.

In an earlier interview, Bajaj had said, ""With Triumph we are offering affordable aspiration to customers. We are offering premium product, offering great value.""

The top half of the industry is outpacing the bottom half by 2-2.5x in terms of growth, said Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto, while speaking with CNBC-TV18 on expectations for Q3 exports to be better than Q2.

Pune-based two-wheeler manufacturer Bajaj Auto Ltd, on October 18, reported a 20% year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit for the September quarter at Rs 1,836.14 crore. It was Rs 1,530 crore in the year-ago quarter.

""We are very closely hovering over the number one position,"" said Sharma, talking about Bajaj Auto's position among Indian competitors.

""The industry is doing pretty well, recording between 15% to 18% growth, and we are probably at twice the industry rate. And we are still halfway through the season,"" the ED further added.

The wholesale sales are now around this 4.5 lakh to 4.7 lakh range. ""There is an uptick which is caused by the festive, and it probably, but in terms of penetration, I don't think that there is an increase, so the 65000 may go up to 75000 - 78,000 units.""

""The export story is dependent and closely intertwined with the macroeconomics, which is constantly getting Disturbed due to various events which are occurring around the world,"" as per Sharma.

""We are yet to see the October registration numbers, which will come in in a couple of days. But I would say that we would have garnered about 1% or 1.5 percent, at an overall level."" In the 125 CC and over segment, Bajaj Auto's market share stands at 30 percent, claimed Sharma.

Sharing his outlook on outlook, Sharma said, based on the complete refurbishment of their flagship brand Pulsar, which was revamped along with new launches in the pipeline, he expects Bajaj Auto to be on top in 125 CC and over segment vehicles.

Domestic passenger vehicle (PV) sales hit a record high in October, driven by robust demand during the festive season coupled with a huge response to the Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) introduced over the last few months.

Industry analysts reckon that carmakers despatched around 3,91,472 units last month, the highest ever monthly sales in the history of the domestic PV market.

On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, sales were up 16.3 percent from 3,36,679 units sold in October 2022. The cumulative sales from April to October this fiscal were 24,65,420 units, up by 8.4 percent from 22,73,419 units a year ago.

Shashank Srivastava, Senior Executive Officer, Marketing and Sales, Maruti Suzuki, while releasing the October sales figures stated, “The industry has begun to increase production because the semiconductor shortage is fading away. Secondly, October was the month of good retails because of Navaratri, Dusshera.

Analysts may have expressed caution about Bajaj Auto’s prospects due to currency inflation and a slow recovery in exports, but one business of the company that's surprised them is the three-wheeler segment.

The three-wheeler business had a record-breaking second quarter, with sales of 132,000 units in the three months ended September. That was a growth of 34 percent quarter-on-quarter and 81 percent year-on-year, capturing 80 percent market share in September.

Buoyed by low advertising expenses, cheaper batteries for electric three-wheelers, and a gradual yet steady expansion of the 3W segment, the Pune-based company believes this is the start of something promising.

What's fuelling the growth?

""The country has very decisively promoted the usage of CNG,"" Rakesh Sharma, executive director of Bajaj Auto, said on an earnings call. CNG-powered three-wheelers deliver much better economics than diesel-powered vehicles, he said.

""CNG-powered 3W economics are much better for owners versus diesel and this migration from diesel to CNG is helping Bajaj ramp up market share,"" analysts at ICICI Securities said.

Also read: Bajaj Auto: Earnings trajectory improving; valuations reasonable

All automobile sectors are recovering from losses suffered during the pandemic. The resumption of activity enables three-wheeler drivers to earn more, helping them to finance their vehicle purchases. Bajaj Auto financed 90 percent of the vehicles sold during the quarter.

For CNG three-wheelers, Bajaj Auto’s market share stands at 90-93 percent, company figures showed. The three-wheeler segment contributed 12.5 percent to total revenue in the July-September quarter, more than doubling from the previous quarter’s 6.1 percent.

How are electric autos faring?

According to the company, e-autos were restricted in large parts of the north and east of the country and this gave rise to a semi-organised industry of e-rickshaws. However, the need for intercity and intracity mobility in the smaller towns of these areas is strong.

Now, when Bajaj enters with e-autos, they don't require permits. So there is a strong possibility of converting the e-ricks to e-autos, provided the company delivers value performance.

""So, the entire north and east is our first target and there we don't sell too many ICE (internal combustion engine) autos and we should be able to get the e-autos moving over there,"" the company said.

Bajaj Auto has already acquired leadership positions in Agra and Pune in the span of a year. In the electric three-wheeler segment, the company's strategy is to achieve a market share similar to what it garnered in the ICE segment, ranging from over 50 percent to almost 70 percent. The company is looking to target cities where autos are not permitted.

In the space, Bajaj Auto trails market leader Mahindra & Mahindra.

The company has started phase two of its calibrated expansion programme, which will take it to 40 cities in the next six months.

""We do not see any cannibalization impact of recently launched e-autos on ICE three-wheelers in the foreseeable future. E-Autos and 3W CNG may continue to grow in the foreseeable future and add meaningfully to revenue growth and profitability in the short-medium term"", Unnati Bhavekar Jadhav, lead analyst at KR Choksey told Moneycontrol.

E-autos aren't margin dilutive

When compared to electric two-wheelers, e-autos are EBITDA margin positive. This is because the overall cost is relatively lower than that of a two-wheeler.

Bajaj is setting up an EV factory in Waluj, which should be ready by the end of the year. The factory, however, will not expand fixed costs substantially, the management said. Given the company's cemented position in the market, it allows them to spend less money on advertising.

Domestic brokerage KRChoksey forecasts that Bajaj Auto should ensure an 80 percent market share in the segment and a steady expansion of e-autos in the coming quarters.

""Recent management guidance of margin neutrality of EV vs ICE can help drive EV penetration in 3W without compromising on profitability"", Pramod Amthe, Head of Institutional Equity Research at InCred Capital said.

Axis Securities is of the view that sales will grow in line with the market and the expansion of the CNG network. Given its non-dilutive business, analysts highlighted that it opens up a new segment for the company and states that is ASP accretive.

""Three-wheelers should not only drive volumes but also ASPs and thereby add meaningfully to the overall financial performance of Bajaj Auto in the foreseeable future"", Jadhav further added.",752,0.7713613510131836

BJAUT’s 2QFY24 EBITDA margin beat our estimate at 19.8% (+260bp YoY, est. 19.2%), led by favorable RM costs and a better product mix (high 3W contribution). The domestic 2W industry is likely to grow 12-15% YoY during the festive season. A sequential recovery in exports and healthy demand in 3Ws should lead to a healthy operational performance. Change in dividend policy: BJAUT is now exploring multiple routes to pay shareholders, including dividends and buybacks. The new slab for the dividend payout for over INR150b surplus funds is now >70% (v/s 90% as per old policy). We maintain our FY24/FY25 estimates.

The market has thrown up a strong signal with the Nifty50 forming a hammer candlestick pattern on the weekly timeframe. The market remained volatile through the week, but managed to stay above the low of the previous week, a favourable sign for maintaining a positive momentum.

Zooming in further to the daily timeframe, the index has demonstrated resilience by consistently trading in proximity to its 20-day simple moving average (SMA) in recent days, indicating a short-term range-bound movement.

Key support levels for the index are anchored by a solid base at 19,480, marked by multiple touch points, followed by additional support zones at 19,200 and 19,000. On the flip side, potential resistance levels may be encountered around 19,850, followed by the 20,000 mark, with notable resistance markers situated at the all-time high of 20,222.

The relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator, has consistently remained below the 50 level on the daily charts, signaling a lack of short-term momentum.

Taking these factors into consideration, our perspective maintains a bias towards a range-bound scenario for the Nifty. We anticipate strong support at 19,480, followed by the 19,200 mark, while the upper range is expected to be capped at 19,850 and the 20,000 mark.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

NBCC (India): Buy | LTP: Rs 70.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 65.4 | Target: Rs 79 | Return: 12 percent

Currently, NBCC's stock is trading at its pinnacle since September 2018, showcasing a clear bullish sentiment in its pricing.

An examination of the weekly charts highlights a breakout from a rounding pattern, indicating a persistent upward trajectory. This bullish breakout is underscored by a marked increase in trading volumes.

Furthermore, the RSI, both on daily and weekly timeframes, stands prominently above the 60 threshold, emphasizing the escalating momentum in the stock's price dynamics.

Looking forward, we expect the prices to move higher till the mark of Rs 79 where the stop-loss must be Rs 65.40 strictly on the closing basis.

Bajaj Auto: Buy | LTP: Rs 5,482.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,100 | Target: Rs 6,050 | Return: 10 percent

The stock is presently at record highs, indicating their strong market momentum. When compared against the Nifty Auto index in a ratio chart, there's a noticeable breakout from the descending trendline that held since June 2020, underscoring its superior performance.

Further emphasizing the stock's bullish trend, its prices have consistently positioned above the 12-day exponential moving average (EMA).

Moreover, the daily relative strength index remaining firmly above the 50 threshold highlights the stock's continued positive momentum.

Looking forward, we expect the prices to move higher till the mark of Rs 6,050 where the stop-loss must be Rs 5,100 strictly on the closing basis.

Hero MotoCorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,265.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,050 | Target: Rs 3,625 | Return: 11 percent

Hero has exhibited remarkable resilience by maintaining a multi-year high level subsequent to a breakout from a Double Bottom price pattern, which had materialized in the range of Rs 2,350 to Rs 2,300 on the monthly charts. This pattern signifies strong and enduring positive sentiment surrounding the stock for the medium to long term.

Upon closer examination of the weekly charts, the stock has demonstrated a Change in Polarity (CIP) formation near Rs 2,925 levels, indicating a shift in the stock's trend from neutral to positive.

In-depth analysis of the daily charts reveals that Hero has consistently held its position above critical moving averages, including the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMA). Notably, the stock has exhibited a breakout from the Saucer pattern and has seen increased trading volumes during each upswing. This consistent pattern underscores the strength of the ongoing bullish trend.

Additionally, the RSI, a pivotal momentum indicator, has consistently maintained a level above 55 across all time frames, whether it be on the daily, weekly, or monthly charts. This alignment confirms a resilient and sustained positive momentum.

Looking ahead, we anticipate the stock's price to continue its upward trajectory, with a potential target of Rs 3,625. It's important to emphasize the need for prudent risk management, and we recommend setting a stop-loss at Rs 3,050 on a closing basis.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

We marginally increase our FY24-FY26E EPS estimates by ~1% to factor in higher domestic realization and continued 3W volume strength. Bajaj Auto’s (BJAUT) 2Q revenue (Rs. 108bn) was largely in-line, while EBITDA margin (19.8%) was slightly higher than PLe (19.4%) and the street (19.5%). EBITDA margins benefitted from inventorisation and better mix QoQ, which was partially offset by lower export ASP. Export volumes recovered QoQ and BJAUT is expecting only gradual improvement, given macro challenges in those markets. BJAUT saw export realization falling ~7% QoQ given increase in mix from lower ASP markets like African regions which have low ASP and margin. Furthermore, increase in EV volumes will impact overall margins. We expect moderation in margin in 2H from current levels. Until now, BJAUT had been witnessing a sharp increase in its 3W mix, which was aiding margins; we expect this trend to start moderating sequentially.

Outlook

We expect BJAUT’s domestic premium segment volumes to grow (similar to the industry), market share gains in this and fast ramp-up of EVs could make us turn constructive on the stock. BJAUT is currently trading at 18.5x FY25, on the higher side versus history. Maintain ‘REDUCE’ with a TP of Rs 4,800 (Rs 4,750 earlier) at 16x Sep-25E EPS.

2023-10-19 09:47:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/bajaj-auto-rallies-5-after-q2-earnings-beat-street-despite-caution-from-analysts-11559321.html,"Bajaj's revenue from operations rose 5.6 percent to Rs 10,777.27 crore vis-à-vis Rs 10,203 crore in the corresponding period last year, largely aided by falling commodity costs and the price hikes the company effected.

The Bajaj Auto stock jumped nearly 5 percent on October 19, after the automobile major beat analyst estimates with a 20 percent increase in net profit for the second quarter. However, brokerage firms seem unimpressed as several concerns still linger for the automobile major such as muted exports and competition in electric vehicles space.

Bajaj's exports for the second quarter slumped 9 percent amid currency-led inflation hampering the overall affordability. Broking house Nuvama Institutional Equities, with a 'hold' rating on the stock, has said that the company would underperform peers such as TVS Motors, owing to its weak presence in scooters, not to mention its large exposure to overseas markets.

At 9:20am on October 20, the Bajaj Auto stock was trading at Rs 5,375, up 4.65 percent, from the previous close on the NSE.

Motilal Oswal states that even as Bajaj Auto has a potential sizeable position in the scooter market through electric vehicles, a large part of its India profit pool (of premium motorcycles and three-wheelers) is vulnerable to possible disruption from electrification. Analysts at the firm have maintained their 'neutral' stance on the company.

Analysts at Macquarie, with a 'neutral' call on the stock, suggest that exports have bottomed out, and recovery in the business is slated to witness a gradual recovery.

On the other hand, global firm Morgan Stanley remains bullish on the company and has assigned an 'overweight' call. Morgan Stanley attributed its rationale to a promising three-wheeler outlook and labelled it as a 'whitespace' opportunity. The EV three-wheeler margins are at par with the ICE vehicles in the same segment.

Key risks

Lower-than-expected growth in India due to slowdown in macros, a

delay in recovery in demand in Africa, Asia and Latin America regions because of weak fundamentals, failure of new products in EVs, scooters and premium motorcycles, a spike in commodity prices, and an adverse currency movement, are some of the key risks for the Pune-headquartered company.

During the quarter, the company reported a net profit of Rs 1,836.14 crore. Bajaj's revenue from operations rose 5.6 percent to Rs 10,777.27 crore vis-à-vis Rs 10,203 crore in the corresponding period last year, largely aided by falling commodity costs and the price hikes the company effected.

Bajaj Auto Limited on October 18 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 1,836.14 crore for the quarter ended September 30, which is a year-on-year (YoY) increase of 20 percent from Rs 1,530 crore. The figure was higher than analysts’ estimates.

According to the average of five brokerages, its standalone net profit was expected to rise 14 percent to Rs 1,782 crore.

In July-September, revenue from operations went up 5.6 percent to Rs 10,777.27 crore vis-à-vis Rs 10,203 crore in the corresponding period last year. The growth was aided by falling commodity costs and the price hikes the company effected.

In its statement, Bajaj Auto revealed that its revenue growth was underpinned by double-digit volume growth, with the “sustained buoyancy” on the domestic front cushioning the weak, albeit improving export performance.

Shares of Bajaj Auto were up by 0.6 percent at Rs 5,143.80 on the BSE at the end of the day’s trading.

Last quarter, Bajaj Auto’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation or EBITDA came in at Rs 2,133 crore. Its EBITDA or operating margins expanded 260 basis points to 19.8 percent from 17.2 percent a year ago. The company revealed that its quarterly EBITDA crossed Rs 2,000 crore for the first time, a growth of 21 percent YOY.

“Higher operating margins were driven by better realisation and a richer product mix, which more than covered the drag arising from investments on growing electric scooters,"" the company’s statement added.

The company’s performance improved in July-September despite sales, in volume terms, falling 8.4 percent from 11,51,012 units last year to 10,53,953 units. Its two-wheeler sales fell 13.5 percent to 8,81,583 units, while commercial vehicle (CV) sales jumped 30.6 percent YoY to 1,72,370 units in the September quarter.

“Buoyant domestic business registers a new peak, on the back of six successive quarters of double-digit YoY growth, underpinned by a broad-based performance, most notably the sustained competitive growth on 125 cc+ motorcycles and the further acceleration of three-wheeler sales that delivered its highest ever quarter,” as per the official statement by Bajaj Auto.

Bajaj Auto’s exports were, however, down by 9 percent to 4,16,397 units from 4,56,637 in Q2 FY23. The company noted that its exports stay on course to making a “gradual recovery”, amidst “volatile market conditions and its volumes are up 8 percent sequentially.

“Market share holds steady with volume uptick in Africa, LATAM and SAME allowing for a slight build back of inventory in select markets; actions continue unabated to navigate currency constraints and challenging macros in overseas markets,” Bajaj Auto’s statement further added.

The Pune-based automaker revealed that strong cash generation was sustained as over Rs 3,600 crore of free cash flow was added in the first half, 1.6 times higher than H1 FY23. It also has a robust balance sheet with surplus funds at Rs 17,326 crore as on September 30, 2023, after dividend distribution of approximately Rs 4,000 crore during the quarter.",502,0.9985949844121933

Bajaj Auto is expected to report an increase in profit in its July-September quarter despite a fall in overall sales volume.

The company is set to announce its results on October 18.

According to the average of 5 brokerages, Bajaj Auto’s standalone net profit is expected at Rs 1,782.14, crore, a 14 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase. The company’s revenue is expected to grow 7.05 percent over the previous year to Rs 10,922.12 crore during the reporting quarter. EBITDA margin is expected to come at 19.5 percent, a 222 basis-point (bps) increase from a year ago.

Bajaj Auto Q2FY24 Result Expectations

Price hikes

Brokerages attributed the likely rise in revenue to the company’s price hikes and product mixes. “We expect revenues to increase by 7 percent yoy, led by (1) an 18 percent YoY increase in ASPs (average selling prices) due to the higher mix of the 3W segment, lower mix of the domestic economy motorcycle segment, lower mix of the export 2W segment, price increases and favourable forex and (2) an 8 percent YoY decline in volumes,” Kotak Equities said in a note.

The brokerages added that the price hikes and lower commodity costs would lead to the rise in margins. “EBITDA margins to improve by estimated 90 bps quarter on quarter (QoQ) at 19.9 percent driven by favourable product mix, currency and benign commodity,” Nomura said in a note.

Motilal Oswal said in its note that Bajaj Auto’s margins are set to expand 20 bps QoQ (+200 bps YoY) largely due to savings from declining commodity cost and price hikes”.

Volume decline

Analysts expect the company’s sales volume to decline by 8.4 percent from the year-ago period to 10,53,953. However, this would be a marginal increase of 2.6 percent from the previous quarter. In its September sales data, the company reported its total sales marginally declined to 3,92,558 units from 3,94,747 from the previous year. The domestic 2-wheeler segment saw the biggest decline as it fell by 9 percent to 2,02,510 units. Kotak Equities cited the decline in 2-wheeler sales in the quarter to base effect. Motilal Oswal said the volumes plunged due to “festive season inventory stocking has shifted to 3Q from 2Q last year.”

However, the company posted its highest ever domestic commercial vehicle sales in September, which increased by 60 percent to 50,683.

From June 30, the Bajaj Auto stock has given returns of 8.28 percent, underperforming the Nifty Auto index, which rose by 9.06 percent.

After seeing a spike in monthly sales in August at 62,692 units vis-à-vis July, the electric two-wheeler (E2W) market registered a minor increase in volumes at 63,760 units in September, as per the data available on the Vahan portal.

Industry observers reckon that the 1.70 percent month-on-month (MoM) increase in sales in September was primarily due to continued interest in E2Ws among consumers. On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, E2W registrations were up 19.65 percent in August from 53,286 units last year.

It may be recalled that following the cut in subsidies on E2Ws in May, there was a massive plunge in numbers in June at 46,057, followed by an uptick in July at 54,750 units. Prior to subsidy revisions, E2W sales were at an all-time high of 1,05,527 units in the month of May.

Vahan only records the total number of sales registered and not the bookings. It also does not take into account low-speed E2W sales and excludes the data for Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana.

Some players in red, some in green

The sales growth varied from one industry player to another. While EV makers like Ola Electric and Ather Energy saw their numbers drop from August, players like TVS Motor Company, Bajaj Auto and Ampere Electric, among others, witnessed an upswing.

Despite its numbers declining by 0.42 percent from 18,718 units in August to 18,639 units in September, Ola Electric retained its numero uno position, cornering 29.22 percent market share.

Ankush Aggarwal, Chief Business Officer, Ola, said in an official release more than a month ago, “With the festive season setting in, we expect strong sales. (We) expect the EV industry to witness an inflection point owing to the high consumer demand.”

TVS Motor Co, which saw its sales increase by 0.36 percent to 15,529 units in September from 15,473 units in August retained its second spot with a 24.26 percent market share.

“The company sold 20,356 units of TVS iQube Electric in September 2023 against sales of 4,923 units in September 2022,” said TVS in an official release.

Ather Energy, which saw its numbers go down by 0.16 percent to 7,118 units in September from 7,130 units in August, held an 11.16 percent market share.

Bajaj Auto, which saw its sales grow by 7.32 percent to 7,058 units from 6,576 units, held the fourth position with an 11.06 percent market share.

""OPEC conduct is nothing different from what a central bank, or a group of central bankers, is doing."" - Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman

You could call it the revenge of the old economy. It is not just crude oil bears who are ""ouching"" (as the Saudi energy minister had warned in June this year) as oil prices race towards $100 a barrel, but also central bank heads and political leaders. A commodity said to be in decline has come back from the dead and now threatens to upset inflation targets as well as political fortunes, should the trend continue.

Energy stocks in the US are a big hit with investors and back home, shares of refiners continue to reward their believers. Also having their day in the sun are power utility companies, which continue to rally despite a section of analysts warning the valuations are getting into the expensive zone.

Bajaj Auto

The company’s boss Rajiv Bajaj says that the entry-level segment consumer is not coming back this festive season, unlike in other segments. One reason could be that they are probably looking at electric vehicle models, Bajaj told CNBC-TV18. He feels the entry-level segment needs some disruption.

Bottom of pyramid

Kumar Rajagopalan of Retailers Association shares a somewhat similar view as Bajaj. Inflation is a concern and that is hurting the bottom of the pyramid consumers the most, he told CNBC-TV18. The problem persists and a recovery is badly needed in that segment, he said.

Blue Star

The company will be raising Rs 1,000 through a qualified institutional placement. Stock has had a decent run in 2023 so far, up 33 percent, but bulk

of the gains came between January and March end. With summer sales of air conditioners disappointing, investors have been cool to the stock of late. Neck to has had a better run than Voltas, but there are signs of investors once again warming up to Voltas as valuations are looking decent after the drubbing between March and August. Till a couple of months back, Blue Star was the clear favourite in the air conditioner space. But there seems to be competition now. Investor preference in the coming months will depend on how are the companies are able to maintain/grow market share without margins getting affected.

Shocker ahead?

Investors are in denial about the impending crash in Gujarat Fluorochemicals earnings, according to broking firm Incred Equities. Analysts at Incred see quarterly profits halving over last year and at declining by 15-17 percent over the June quarter.

“Exports are collapsing, the bread-and-butter business of fluoropolymer exports are falling as well are is at risk of being banned and HFC prices (which led to extraordinary earnings in FY23) is on its way down. The fine on 3M has led to volume decline of fluoropolymers and American policy announcement of cutting HFC consumption is leading to supply chain destocking before cut comes into place from Jan-2024,” says the note.

Interestingly, considering that fluorochemicals was one pocket within the chemicals sector which investors are still bullish on. That also explains why stocks in the fluorochemicals business have not been hammered as much as some of the other chemical companies.

Personal loans

Given its penchant for seeking out dark clouds wherever possible, Short Call managed to come across this paragraph in an otherwise rosy report on the NBFC sector by broking firm IIFL.

“We also highlight runaway growth in personal loans (27 percent four-year CAGR and 36 percent on-year in FY23) as an area of concern. We find rising vintage delinquencies for unsecured loans, rising small-ticket personal delinquencies that are 2x of big-ticket PLs and the falling approval rates by lenders — as signs of stress brewing up in the segment. We expect the fintech players and lenders who rely on them for sourcing (such as Piramal and AB Finance) to be mainly impacted.”

US bond yields

The 10-year Treasury yield hit a 16-year high of 4.366 percent on Tuesday. The 2-year yield climbed to 5.109 percent, its highest since 2006. The lowest number of monthly housing starts since June 2020, coupled with hotter-than-expected inflation in Canada, has reignited fears of a possible rate hike by the Fed later this year, reports WSJ. High bond yields are one of the main reasons keeping stock prices in check, say analysts.

Iron ore

The recent rally in iron ore has turned out to be short lived. Prices fell for the second successive day Tuesday due to increasing domestic supply in China and ongoing concerns about demand, which have been exacerbated by a prolonged downturn in the property market, reported Mining.com.

Turbulence ahead

Several US airlines expect declining revenues due to unexpectedly high jet fuel prices, despite increasing passenger numbers, reports oilprice.com. That is prompting aviation companies to review their fuel hedging and ticket pricing strategies. Business travel is recovering slower than leisure travel, and with seasonal decreases in domestic travel and inflation, maintaining revenues could be challenging, the report said.

China diary

China’s local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) are staging a comeback in credit markets, with a surge in yuan bond sales as Beijing intensifies efforts to defuse risks from the debt-laden group of borrowers, reported Bloomberg. Domestic bond issuance by LGFVs, which are typically tasked to build infrastructure projects, reached nearly 620 billion yuan ($85 billion) in August, an almost 50 percent jump from July and the third-highest monthly tally on record, the report said.

Rising yuan

While the yuan is struggling in the foreign-exchange market, it continues to grow its market share in China’s cross-border transactions as the No. 1 payment currency, reported Bloomberg. That reflects progress of the yuan’s internationalization in trade, as well as growing influence of foreign capital flows to China’s financial markets

Hinting that good news was in the offing for Pulsar fans, Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto, said the company is planning to launch the ""biggest Pulsar ever"" in this financial year. Currently, the biggest Pulsar is a 250 cc machine.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Rajiv Bajaj spoke about Pulsar upgrades lined up till March 2024, Triumph bike sales, the company’s EV (electric vehicle) outlook, and more.

Commenting on domestic sales and festive demand, Bajaj said the entry level 100 cc motorcycle continues to be under pressure in the industry as a whole. ""I don't see entry level consumers returning this festive season,"" he added.

Regarding premium motorcycle sales (priced above Rs 1.7 lakh), he said the company is seeing good growth. ""The mid-market segment (125-200 cc) is growing very strongly in recent times,"" he added, and said that the Pulsar is a good product that has also been marketed well.

Brokerage firm BofA securities revised its recommendation on the stock to 'Buy' from `Neutral’, citing multiple growth levers.

The company had launched Bajaj Pulsar N150 this month, he said. ""Between now and the end of the financial year, we will introduce six significant upgrades in Pulsars, to further enhance our share in the mid-segment from 30 percent to as much as it may rise,"" he explained, adding that the company aims to be number one in this segment.

Exports

Speaking of exports, he said currently the export numbers, between Bajaj and KTM brands, is about 10,000 units a month. ""With the new Pulsar and the new Triumph, we will take exports to 15-20,000 units a month,"" he declared.

Speaking about Bajaj Triumph bookings, he said that the first 10,000 bookings were offered at a special price of Rs 2.23 lakh. ""Between July and August, about 4,000 bookings were made, half of which have been delivered to customers. The rest are undergoing final checks,"" he stated.

Bajaj further said the company hopes to do better in the next quarter in terms of exports, even though uncertainties persist in terms of forex availability.

The surge in Chetak's volumes is because of the right cost structure, Bajaj said. ""Distribution (of Bajaj Chetak) has been ramped up significantly, and it'll continue to grow every month,"" he added.

Bajaj also said that the new additions are aimed at enhancing the company's share in the mid-segment from 30 percent, adding that the company wants to become a ""market leader"".

The mid-market segment, particularly the 125-200-cc range, has been experiencing strong growth, and Bajaj Auto has been effectively leveraging this trend. The company's market share in this segment has steadily increased, reaching an impressive 30 percent.

Bajaj, however, expressed concern over the upcoming festive season and the future of the entry-level segment in the motorcycle industry, particularly 100cc motorcycles.

Bajaj also noted that entry-level consumers are progressively transitioning to electric two-wheelers, impacting both conventional fuel-powered scooters and motorcycles. He suggests that this consumer segment is unlikely to revert to the growth levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic without some form of disruptive intervention.

Analysts at the firm said that, for the company, the 'time to triumph' is right now and suggest there are multiple triggers for the growing sentiment for the two-wheeler automobile giant.

A gradual recovery in the domestic two-wheeler industry, coupled with the recovery in the three-wheeler segment bode well for the company. ""All segments well set for positive growth in FY25"", BofA said in a note on September 14. Moreover, the report also added that exports and electric vehicle verticle can drive valuation re-rating.

On exports, BofA said it has turned a corner, suggesting that the worst is over and things shall begin to improve. August's export figures are a case in point after Bajaj reported a two percent growth to 1,24,211 units.

Given such factors, the broking firm predicts that the Pune-headquartered company should see a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14-15 percent from FY23-26.

Following an uptick in July with sales of 54,504 units, the electric two-wheeler (E2W) industry saw a further spike in volumes, with registrations of 62,398 units last month, per data available on the Vahan portal.

Industry players reckon that the 14.5 percent month-on-month (MoM) increase in sales in August was primarily due to wider product offerings, better financing options, and rising awareness of E2Ws.

The surge in sales happened despite a 25 percent cut in subsidies in May, which resulted in a massive decline in volumes in June, with sales at 46,027 units. However, the August numbers were lower than the figures prior to the cut in subsidies, when we saw sales of 66,857 and 1,05,507 units in April and May, respectively.

On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, E2W registrations were up 19.47 percent in August from 52,226 units last year.

The total vehicle offtake in January, February, and March stood at 64,690, 66,087, and 86,337 units, respectively, per Vahan data.

It is to be mentioned that Vahan only records the total number of sales registered and not the bookings. It also doesn’t take into account low-speed E2W sales and excludes the data for Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana.

OEMs post healthy growth

Barring Ola Electric, most of the other OEMs such as Ather Energy, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor Company, Ampere Electric, etc., saw a revival in their monthly volumes. The top three positions by sales remain the same as last month.

Despite seeing a downturn in volumes from 19,343 units in July to 18,628 in August, Ola Electric remained the market leader. The Bhavish Aggarwal-led company claims to have garnered a 30 percent market share last month. The company claims its sales have grown 400 percent year-on-year (YoY).

Ankush Aggarwal, Chief Business Officer, Ola, said, “August has been an exciting and busy month for us as we have expanded our portfolio to five scooters, with offerings across all popular price points. With the festive season setting in, we hope to see strong sales during this period, and expect the EV industry to witness an inflection point owing to the high consumer demand.”

Additionally, Ola Electric has claimed that it has witnessed a tremendous response for its all-new and expanded S1 scooter portfolio with more than 75,000 bookings received within two weeks of its launch. It has also commenced deliveries of the S1 Air, which was launched last October, in more than 100 cities.

TVS Motor Company, which took the second spot for the third consecutive month, saw nearly a 50 percent month-on-month (MoM) growth in sales at 15,390 units, per Vahan data. The company sold 10,385 units of iQube last month. In an official release, the company claimed it sold 23,887 units in August 2023 as against 4,418 units in August 2022.

“The order book for TVS iQube electric scooter continues to be healthy,” the company said in an official statement.

Ather Energy, which came third, saw sales go up by 6 percent to 7,064 units in August from 6,671 units in July, as per Vahan. In an official release, the Bangalore-based EV startup revealed that it had sold 8,062 units (including bookings) in August 2023.

Unfazed by the recent premium motorcycles rolled out by homegrown two-wheeler makers, Royal Enfield affirmed that it is well geared to maintain its market leadership in the domestic middleweight market. Siddhartha Lal, Managing Director at Royal Enfield's parent company Eicher Motors Limited (EML) said on August 3 that the entry of new products will only expand the 250-750cc market, which currently stands at 1 million units per annum.

“We are not obsessed about competition, which in fact, our competitors do very often. We obsess about the consumer and his wants. We are obsessed about stuff that we believe is tangible reality for our consumers, (which is) to have a better ride to have a to have more enjoyment. So yeah, really, we built a fortress. It's not going to be easy for, let's say robbers, to penetrate,” Lal said at the post-earnings virtual media conference.

Lal’s comments were in response to Bajaj Auto MD Rajiv Bajaj’s comment wherein he told a TV channel, “If Royal Enfield is where the money is, then we have no choice but to rob the bank.”

When quizzed on the edge that Royal Enfield still has over rivals, Lal asserted, “Just because they're not that sexy, but the really important stuff like the resale value of a motorcycle like that of a Classic 350, which is tremendous. Even after three years, in percentage terms, it is double of that of our competitors. If the competitors are selling it at 30 percent after three years, we are doing it at 50-60 or even 70 percent. So, there's a lot that we have done to keep to create that mode.”

It may be recalled that while Hero MotoCorp had rolled out Harley Davidson X440 at a starting price of Rs. 2.29 lakh (Ex-showroom India), Bajaj Auto had introduced Triumph Speed 400 and at an introductory price tag of Rs 2,23 lakh (ex-showroom, India).

Lal maintained that Royal Enfield is no stranger to competition since it really “started succeeding” 10-15 years ago when it had a lot of growth. In his words: “We had waves and waves of competition coming in different ways. The largest guys, the biggest brands, the global guys (Harley Davidson), the Indian guys (Bajaj Auto), everyone's been coming in there's no dearth of competition for Royal Enfield. Of course, competition hasn't done very well in our in our segments.”

With the newly launched middleweight motorcycles, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp, two of India's largest motorcycle manufacturers, aim to crack the 250-500 segment of the two-wheeler market, which is largely reigned by Royal Enfield.

Lal said he is excited that the segment has got a “bit of action” and a “bit of excitement”.

“The share of midsize (motorcycle) should grow as new competition comes in, because then there is a new offering and more interest in the segment, etc. So, we really believe that the outcome of all of this will be that the size of the midsize market will grow. And I believe as leaders we will benefit tremendously from the growth in the segment, ” the executive added.

As per data shared by industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), sales of motorcycles with engine capacity ranging upwards of 250cc to 750 cc went up by 38 percent during last fiscal at 791,878 units, from 574,675 units in FY 2021-22. Last fiscal, Royal Enfield had 93 percent market share in the 250-750cc segment.

However, Lal acknowledged that the company may not be able to hold on to 90 percent market share and will be satisfied with “an 80 percent market share” of a segment, which is set to expand to 1.5 million units in the medium term.

“It depends on which timeframe we're looking at in terms of (our) market share. So, we are about 90 percent (currently) and it is not going to grow much further north. We will never cede our market share and will fight hard for every last pie. But we believe the market will grow tremendously over the next few years. Also, there is a entire trend of premiumization.”",700,0.9999058942000071

LKP Research's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto Limited (BAL) posted solid margin performance in Q1 despite driven by the challenges in the exports business. Going forward, we believe export volumes have bottomed out as demand is improving now month on month, while domestic 2W volumes should continue their strong run. We also expect a strong traction coming from new launches which would drive overall demand. >125cc segment has provided new identity to BAL. Solid performance of premium Pulsar models, KTM bikes and Triumph models this year should all provide the required fillip to both volumes and margins. On the exports front, markets like Africa is seeing recovery while Latam is stable. ASEAN markets are facing temporary lull and are expected to rise in coming quarters. Brazil is providing a new stream of volumes for BAL. With 2W Chetak expanding its coverage and fetching good response, we believe Chetak to add to the numbers substantially in H2 of FY24. The withdrawal of FAME subsidy remains a concern for the EV 2Ws, but we believe it to impact BAL little. 3W performance was robust in Q1, touching new highs, on CNG success. EV 3W launch should further aid the business. Neutral RM and currency price movement , price hikes planned and prudent cost management should assist margins in the ensuing quarters. With strong balance sheet, robust return ratios, hefty dividend yield of 3.4% and zero financial leverage, we believe the stock still looks attractive at 17.2x FY25E earnings.

Outlook

We therefore maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a target price of ₹5,548 (at 19.5x FY 25E earnings).

Motilal Oswal's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto (BJAUT) posted lower EBITDA margin (-30bp QoQ) at 19.0% (vs. est. 19.5%) due to unfavorable mix as the share of commuter segment rose during the marriage season in 1QFY24. Despite volume recovery and stable RM, we project EBITDA margin to remain rangebound over next few quarters due to weak mix-driven ramp-up in Chetak volumes and recovery in exports.

Outlook

We maintain our FY24E EPS while marginally upgrade our FY25E EPS by 2.6% to factor in higher other income. We reiterate our Neutral rating with a TP of INR5,150 (based on 16x Sep’25E Consolidated EPS).

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Bajaj Auto

BJAUT reported a slight miss on margins in Q1 (down ~30bps QoQ to 19% vs our estimate of 19.4%), owing to normalizing mix; PAT was largely in-line. On the demand front, while exports are expected to improve sequentially, the pace of uptick is seen to be gradual. We believe the recent Triumph launch, while positive, will not move the needle much for BJAUT, even as the weakening domestic ICE-2W franchise and disruptive risk to the 3W space (from EVs) remain structural concerns.

Outlook

This compels us to maintain our HOLD rating on the stock, even as we upgrade FY24E/FY25E EPS by 11.6%/9.7% to largely reflect the Q1 margin run-rate (also introduce FY26E). Our revised target price stands at Rs4,760/share (15x core FY25E EPS and Rs924 cash/investment per share).

HDFC Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s Q1 PAT at INR16.6bn (+16% QoQ and +42% YoY) was in line with our estimate, even as margins missed estimates. The margin miss was primarily due to an adverse mix of lower-end motorcycles and a lower 3W mix. Management indicated that although retail demand in key export markets is likely to have bottomed out, the lack of availability of USD for trade remains the major factor hampering export visibility. The domestic motorcycle industry continues to see weak demand and management is now guiding for 4-6% volume growth over the next few months, largely driven by the 125cc and above segments. Triumph has garnered orders for 17k units in a very short span and the ramp-up of the same would be one of the key monitorables in the coming quarters.

Outlook

However, at 18.5x FY25E, most of the positives seem priced in. Reiterate REDUCE with a revised TP of INR 4,438 (earlier INR 4,028), as we roll forward to June’25 EPS core business, valued at an unchanged 16x multiple.

Axis Securities report on Bajaj Auto

The management is focused on the 125cc+ segment which formed 70% of the overall volumes in Q1 (66% in FY23). It expects the domestic MC industry to grow at 4-6% (earlier 6-8% guidance in Q4FY23) over the next few quarters. On exports, the management informed that retails have outpaced wholesale dispatches and there is substantial headroom for growth to build back the inventory. Nevertheless, due to macroeconomic situation and geopolitical challenges gradual recovery is expected post Q2FY24. Triumph, KTM and Husqvarna to aid in product premiumisation and higher ASP. Furthermore, EV launches in the next 12 months across segments along with network expansion to aid in faster growth than the industry.

Outlook

We therefore value the stock at 17x its Jun’25E core EPS (Rs 4,348/share), add for the company’s stake in PMAG and surplus cash reserves at 1x book value to arrive at our TP of Rs 5,400/share (from Rs 4,785/share earlier), implying 11.5% upside from the CMP.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

We marginally increase our FY24/25 EPS estimates by 2-3% to factor beat in margins and management commentary. Bajaj Auto (BJAUT) 1Q revenue (Rs. 103bn) was largely in-line, while EBITDA margin (19.0%) was higher than PLe (18%) but in-line with street estimates (19%). EBITDA margins saw slight decline QoQ on de-inventorisation, inferior mix and better vehicle mix, offset by higher operating leverage. However, strong cost control of employee expenses and other operating expense, shielded from a steeper decline. Export volumes recovered QoQ and BJAUT is expecting gradual improvement, given macro challenges in those markets. The company will also face increasing pressure from inferior mix as the export portfolio from African regions begins to increase (higher mix of low margin products) plus increase in EV volumes and margins are likely to remain at current levels. 2Q volumes in domestic market could be soft due to high base.

Outlook

We expect BJAUT’s domestic premium segment volumes to grow (similar to the industry) helped by premiumisation trends besides fast ramp-up of EVs could make us turn constructive on the stock. BJAUT is currently trading at 17.4x FY25, on the higher side versus history. Maintain ‘REDUCE’ with a TP of Rs 4,575 (Rs 4,450 earlier) at 16x Mar-25E EPS.

Despite denying plans to introduce electric variants of its Pulsar and Platina models, Pune-based Bajaj Auto has affirmed that it is actively working to develop battery-run motorcycles for the global market.

In a post-earnings conference call, Dinesh Thapar, CFO of Bajaj Auto Ltd, said the company would lean on its technical expertise to develop e-motorbikes, in much the same way that it had developed Chetak electric scooters.

“We’ve got a full funnel of work currently underway through an in-house R&D team … for the (e-motorcycle) product,” said Thapar, adding, “One of the things that we are going to do is to ensure that the product IP and the IP for all the critical components is developed by and vests with Bajaj Auto.”

However, Thapar clarified that the availability of electric motorcycles is still some years away due to the absence of “form factors” (essentially the physical design/shape, size and physical specifications of the bike).

“The form factor that is conducive for an EV, given the size of the battery and the battery pack, is really a scooter. It’ll take a while for us to figure out the form factor of where to put a large battery pack (in an e-motorcycle),"" explained Thapar.

Thapar’s comments echo the views of Eicher Motors Limited’s MD and CEO Siddharth Lal, who had earlier stated that long-range e-motorbikes need to be equipped with “much bigger batteries”. That would increase the cost tremendously and make the product “super uncompetitive” compared to ICE versions, Lal had said.

No inorganic plans

Thapar claimed Bajaj Auto remains undeterred despite EV startups rolling out multiple e-motorcycles over the last few quarters. Furthermore, the company is neither looking for an alliance nor aiming to acquire a new-age homegrown startup specialising in motorcycles, he added.

“I don’t think that the form factor is widely accepted and fully sorted out to deliver on capability and performance in its current shape. So, that might still take some time,” said Thapar, without mentioning the names of any motorcycle startups.

The Bajaj Auto CFO said that even though there are opportunities for inorganic growth all the time, the company has not found any worthwhile targets in the e-motorcycle segment. “I haven’t heard of too many inorganic opportunities in the motorcycle space because there really hasn’t been any sizable player as of date. There could be one or two trying it very subscale,” he explained.

“Invariably, I think the question is, does the asset really offer a rich R&D pipeline, innovation, and capability that is sustainable, or is it really a lot of assembling of products. It’s also about who the owner of the product IP is,” said Thapar, who was previously with Reliance Retail.

The CFO, however, hinted at the possibility of Bajaj Auto tying up with KTM for product development. “We have already allied with Yulu in the micro-mobility space, wherein the platform and the vehicle are built by us for them. We would like to leverage on our partnership with KTM or with Kiska, which is part of the KTM Group and is into automotive design. The partnership with Triumph is just starting off and is currently focused on the development of (ICE) motorcycles.”",535,

Bajaj Auto delivered a healthy performance in the April-June quarter, however, that didn't seem enough for brokerages to change their stance on the automaker. Even though brokerages do expect better times for Bajaj Auto in the coming quarters, they also pointed a few headwinds that may derail the growth trajectory for the auto company.

Brokerages took notice of the signs of a recovery in exports, most anticipate it to happen gradually over the ongoing fiscal year. On the flipside, an inferior mix which resulted in a 30 basis points drop in Bajaj Auto's EBITDA margins to 19 percent from 19.3 percent in Q4FY23 also remained a common sore point for most brokerages.

Foreign brokerage Morgan Stanley, which has an 'overweight' call on Bajaj Auto along with a price target of Rs 5,063 also anticipates gradual export recovery for the company. The firm also sees a scale-up of electric vehicles (EVs) and the company's Triumph motorcycles in the domestic market as the key monitorables for Bajaj Auto. In addition, Morgan Stanley is also overweight on the two-wheeler segment where Bajaj Auto is a dominant player.

On similar grounds, domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial also expects both domestic and export volumes to recover in FY24 from the low base, which it believes will driving healthy earnings recovery for Bajaj Auto.

The firm also predicts that Bajaj Auto will benefit from market share gains over the long term, driven by the premiumization trend, opportunity in exports, and the potential sizeable position in the scooter market through EVs.

Despite that, MOFSL also highlighted that a large part of Bajaj Auto's India profit pool (comprising premium motorcycles and three-wheelers) is vulnerable to possible disruption from electrification.

Moreover, the broking firm feels Bajaj Auto's current stock valuation fairly reflects the expected recovery as well as the risk from EVs but its dividend yield of 4.5-5.0 percent should support the scrip. MOFSL has a 'neutral' stance on the Pune-based automaker, with a price target of Rs 5,150.

On the other hand, while Nuvama Institutional Equities also ascribed to expectations of a gradual recovery but it pegged it on the economic conditions and dollar availability in African and Asian markets.

Regardless of that, the brokerage firm said it expects Bajaj Auto to underperform peers such as TVS Motors, owing to its weak presence in scooters in the domestic market and its large exposure to overseas markets.

Moreover, even though the firm chose to raise its target price for the stock by 4.5 percent to Rs 5,100 to bake in an uptick in FY24E/25E EPS by 6 percent each, higher realisations, it still retained its 'hold' rating.

On the other hand, Kotak Institutional Equities is concerned over the impact of rising competition in the economy motorcycle segment for Bajaj Auto. The firm believes that a rise in competitive intensity within the segment will weigh on Bajaj Auto’s entry segment portfolio.

Moreover, KIE also believes two-wheeler segment export volumes have bottomed out, but unavailability of the US dollar and currency devaluation in Nigeria remain areas of concern. ""Though the company’s profitability has improved significantly in FY23 mainly owing to a richer product mix, we do not expect the current profitability to sustain, as we expect demand from Africa to recover from the second half of this fiscal and strong growth in electric 2W sales,"" KIE mentioned in its report.

Aligned with MOFSL's view, KIE also believes the current valuation of Bajaj Auto, especially after its over 13 percent gains in the past three months, factors in its upside potential. On that note, the firm retained its 'sell' rating for the stock, with a price target of Rs 4,350.

Amidst the dark clouds of ifs and buts around Bajaj Auto, investors also chose to remain on the sidelines. As a result, shares of the automaker did not react strongly to its earnings and at 10.08 am were trading 0.5 percent higher at Rs 4,871.94 on the NSE.

Bajaj Auto on July 25 announced a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 1,665 crore for Q1FY24, which marks a 42 percent rise from Rs 1,173 crore reported in the corresponding quarter a year ago.

The company’s first quarter profits exceeded analysts’ forecast of a 40 percent increase.

The rise in net profit comes on the back of a favourable product mix, healthy volumes and an increase in the average selling price (ASP) of its line-up.

The Pune-based automaker's revenue from operations jumped 29 percent to Rs 10,310 crore in the quarter, compared with Rs 8,005 crore in the same quarter last year.

The company claimed that the growth in revenues is underpinned by a double- digit volume growth, with the ""sustained buoyancy"" on the domestic front cushioning the weak, albeit improving ""export performance"".

""Domestic revenues registered its biggest-ever quarter, maintaining its double-digit growth trajectory yet again. Robust double-digit motorcycle growth, consistent industry-leading 3W performance and steady scale-up on Chetak EV are the main factors,"" Bajaj Auto said in its exchange filing.

Bajaj Auto's income rose to Rs 10,656 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal from Rs 8,324.3 crore in the corresponding period last year. Its EBITDA for the quarter under review was up 51 percent year on year (YoY) at Rs 1,954 crore, while margins of 19 percent were up 280 basis points. Sequentially, its margins dropped by 30 basis points from 19.3 percent in Q4FY23.

Bajaj Auto claimed that the margin improvement over the previous year was driven by dynamic price versus cost management, better foreign exchange realisation and operating leverage.

The company had earlier reported a 10 percent growth in overall volumes at 10.27 lakh units, led by a 72 percent YoY increase in the domestic 2W segment on account of a favourable base and pick-up in demand. The company also saw an increase of over 150 percent in domestic 3W segment volumes, YoY.

The domestic surge in volumes of two- and three-wheelers were partly offset by a percent decline in exports for both the segments. In its exchange filing, the company claimed that export volumes had risen sequentially by 12 percent, despite the ongoing currency and macro headwinds in foreign markets.

""While domestic retail volumes outstripped export volumes yet again, decisive interventions, taken particularly on currency availability, enabled the uptick in shipments to Africa and Latin America,"" the filing added.

After the quarterly results were declared, the shares of Bajaj Auto settled at Rs 4,843.95 apiece on the BSE at the market closing hours. This marked a decline of 0.8 percent as against the previous day's close.",440,0.6836322179207435

The earnings season in the auto sector has commenced with prominent players like Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, and Tata Motors announcing their financial results this week.

On July 24, TVS Motor reported a 46 percent growth in its standalone net profit, at Rs 468 crore for the quarter ended June 2023, compared to Rs 321 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue from operations during the reporting quarter rose 20 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 7,218 crore. The company achieved its highest-ever operating EBITDA at Rs 764 crore, marking a 27 percent growth for the first quarter.

As for Bajaj Auto and Tata Motors, their results are scheduled to be announced today, creating anticipation among investors and analysts.

Derivatives Outlook

The Nifty Auto index surpassed the important historical price thresholds of December 2017 and November 2021, and since its multi-month breakout at 12100 in July 2022, the index has been steadily heading higher. According to Sacchitanand Uttekar, Vice President-Research & Data Analysis at Tradebulls Securities, the index has consistently maintained itself above its 5 WEMA support during this recent 15-week upsurge, and its current support is located around 15400. Thus, even a pullback towards this level would preserve the bullish structure with a major base at 15000, while an upward move is expected to continue towards the 16850 zone, added Uttekar.

Tata Motors

TATA motors scrip has delivered significant return of over 56 percent in the past six months, and the company shows signs of sustained growth as the monthly ADX is likely to break out above its 25 mark. As per Sacchitanand Uttekar, the stock has been forming bullish flag formations, supporting the current bullish trend to advance with a base now at 600 and pattern targets at 670, followed by a major target at 760, which may be achieved eventually with time.

Shilpa Rout, Derivatives Lead Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd, stated that the derivative outlook looks very positive, with option chain analysis showing immediate robust support building up at 620/622 zones. Upside levels of 650/660 appear easily achievable, and if sustained she suggest 700 zones should be prepared for. Her recommended derivatives strategy is a Bull call spread for Tata motors in the August series:

- BUY TataMotors 630CE @30/31

- SELL TataMotors 650CE @23/22

Net Outflow 8/9 and Net gains scenario 11/12

Bajaj Auto

In line with the industry's performance, BAJAJ Auto has also been trending higher over the past six months, delivering a price performance of almost 37 percent. Sacchitanand Uttekar suggests that the stop loss for the trade should be kept above 4780, and a move towards 5200 might be initiated with an immediate breakout from the continuation pattern above 4960.

While according to Shilpa Rout, ""Bajaj-Auto has been consolidating around 4800 zones for quite some time now, which serves as good support for the stock. However, 5000 levels will act as resistance. A decisive fresh buying opportunity comes above 5000, with extended targets at 5200/5280 levels.""

Bajaj Auto Limited is expected to witness a 40 percent increase in its net profit for the first quarter on the back of a good product mix and an increase in the average selling price (ASP). The company reported a net profit of Rs 1,173 crore in the same quarter last year.

The two-wheeler giant will announce its first quarter results on July 25.

The company's revenue from operations is predicted to increase about 30 percent for the quarter benefitting from a favourable product mix and higher ASPs during the quarter and a possible 10 percent increase in overall volumes.

Its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins are estimated to increase by 195 basis points, according to the average of the estimates of five brokers. This is due to the reversal of inventorisation benefits (lower production than sales), lower mix

of higher-margin 3-wheelers and exports, partially offset by favourable commodity costs and positive operating leverage.

Bajaj Auto's EBITDA margin had hit a nine-quarter high in the March quarter, at 19.3 percent. This further improvement in margin is likely to be a result of price hikes and lower raw material costs.

Furthermore, analysts at HDFC Securities note that there is a possible increase in the sale of 125cc+ motorcycles, a boost for players focussed on this segment. Hence, operating leverage benefits and an improved mix are likely to drive margin expansion even on quarter-on quarter basis for players like Bajaj Auto.

""Bajaj Auto will significantly outperform the domestic motorcycle industry"", the brokerage firm said in its automobile results review.

Bajaj Auto's two-wheeler sales should see a 5 percent increase or about nine lakh units sold in the quarter. There's also an uptick in the domestic 2W sales as analysts predict an average increase of 5 percent from the corresponding quarter last year. The company's exports, however, are poised to slump by about 35 percent for the quarter due to geopolitical issues.

The company's three-wheeler sales in the country, analysts suggest, should double in the first quarter. Exports are expected to decline by 18 percent, as per average of the estimates of five brokers.

Recently, the company took over the British bike maker Triumph Motorcycles’ India sales and marketing operations. The development is part of the strategic partnership between the two companies announced in 2020 under which they planned to collaborate to create a new range of mid-sized Triumph Motorcycles. This is the third key partnership for Bajaj Auto to manufacture higher CC bikes apart from KTM & Husqvarna.

Automobile companies are expected to witness a jump in profit margins in the 1QFY24 on the back of price hikes and steady input costs. ""Sustained decline in the prices of commodities like aluminium, copper, steel and precious metals on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis will continue to benefit gross margin expansion, as seen in recent quarters,"" InCred Equities said in results preview for the sector.

Analysts tracking the sector suggest that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) will increase by about 33 percent. A shift in focus towards premiumisation will also accelerate margins in the upcoming quarters.

Let's look at the segment-wise growth estimates for the quarter.

2W to report double-digit growth

The 2-wheeler (2W) industry is forecasted to grow at 10 percent on a yearly basis in Q1 and will outperform other segments for the first time in many quarters, albeit on a low base. While domestic 2W volumes may increase 11 percent year on year (YoY), exports are expected to slump 31 percent YoY. Brokerages predict a 21 percent increase in earnings growth for the industry.

The positive outlook reflects higher sales of 125cc+ motorcycles in the first quarter, and the mix will play out better for players focused on this segment. Hence, operating leverage benefits and an improved mix are likely to drive margin expansion. ""We expect all four 2W OEMs to post very healthy earnings growth in Q1,"" HDFC Securities said in its earnings preview. The strong industry growth in motorcycles has also been aided by a good marriage season in Q1.

Subdued CV sales

On a QoQ basis, the commercial vehicle (CV) segment players may deliver weak revenue and lower EBITDA due to seasonality and pre-buying in the previous quarter. Brokerage firm ICICI Securities predicts that with discounts under control along with steady raw material prices, the EBITDA margin for CV players would fall to 8 percent as against 11 percent in Q4FY23 led by lower scale. This means that the decline in margin is likely to be influenced by a decrease in the scale of operations, which could impact revenue for these companies.

UV driving PV sales

The utility vehicle (UV) vertical is expected to grow at 17.6 percent in Q1. HDFC also forecasts that the segment will contribute about 55 percent to the total passenger vehicle (PV) sales in the quarter. The PV industry has seen a 9 percent YoY growth in volumes in Q1 with the mix continuing to shift towards UVs.

PV OEMs should continue to see an improved mix in Q1 and majors such as Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki are set to perform well in the segment.

Leaders

TVS Motors: The company's volume growth is expected at roughly 7 percent. Average selling prices, or ASPs, will also increase due to higher EV volumes. In terms of market share, its share will largely remain stable in scooters at about 25 percent (including EV) while it is expected that the company will almost see a 450 basis points (bps) improvement in motorcycle market share to 11 percent. ""Overall, we expect TVS margins to improve 50bps YoY to 10.5 percent. Also, we expect TVS to post 46 percent YoY growth in profit after tax,"" HDFC said.

Maruti Suzuki: India's leading automobile manufacturer is poised to outperform in UVs for the second consecutive quarter. Its UV mix is projected to improve 25 percent of total volumes from 20 percent in Q4 and from 17 percent in Q1FY23.

Bajaj Auto: Analysts at HDFC are of the view that the 2-wheeler major should significantly outperform the domestic motorcycle industry with 69 percent YoY growth, largely due to a weak base which was impacted by chip shortages last year. ""It is expected that the company revenues will increase 31 percent YoY, benefitting from a favourable product mix and higher ASPs during the quarter and a 10 percent increase in overall volumes,"" Nomura Holdings said in its results preview.

Tata Motors: The country's largest EV player's growth will be driven by volume recovery in its British arm Jaguar and Land Rover business. JLR has brought down its break-even production levels by 50 percent in FY23 and plans to stop vehicle assembly at the Castle Bromwich plant as Jaguar moves to a new all-electric platform. Analysts believe this decision will improve the company's utilisation levels. It has already reduced the number of platforms to seven from nine and is set to bring it to three, once the EV strategy is executed.

Revving into an untamed territory, with the launch of new Triumph 400cc motorcycles Bajaj Auto-- the world’s sixth-largest and India’s second-largest manufacturer of motorcycles--is set to compete with Royal Enfield which rules the segment with a staggering 90 percent market share.

Bajaj Auto which is the world’s largest three-wheeler manufacturer, is based in Pune with plants in Chakan, Waluj, and Pantnagar. It is also India’s largest exporter of motorcycles and 3Ws.

Bajaj Auto, in partnership with global premium motorcycle player Triumph, has launched two premium motorcycles in the Indian market -Triumph Speed 400 and Triumph Scrambler 400.

In a clash of Titans, Bajaj-Triumph and Harley-Hero have priced their beasts at Rs 2.3 lakhs and Rs 2.29 lakhs respectively, in a bid to snatch Royal Enfield's prized market share.

“We have been of the view that the >250cc market may have space for 2-3 players, as consumers will want choices, and currently Royal Enfield occupies an approximately 90 percent market share in the segment,” says Nomura.

Two-wheeler market share analysis

Besides, RE's (Royal Enfield) high gross margin, at around 43 percent (Rs 75,000 per bike), makes the segment attractive for new players, the global brokerage firm explains.

Analysts agree that Bajaj Auto’s new premium motorcycle has been attractively priced.

Citi says the Triumph’s specifications are impressive and the pricing aggressive. It believes that there will be a decent customer response to the bikes. Motilal Oswal Financial Services agrees that the starting price of Rs 2.33 lakhs for the Triumph Speed 400 is considered quite competitive, when compared to its peers.

Even Jefferies echoes a similar view and CLSA feels the Triumph launch looks positive.

“The pricing of the Speed 400 is quite attractive, with only around 15 percent premium to the Royal Enfield Classic 350 and Meteor 350; it is priced similar to the Harley X440,” Nomura says.

Triumph Speed 400 will start retail sales in mid-July 2023 and the Rs 2.33 lakh price per unit is the introductory price for first 10,000 bookings, while the Scrambler is slated for retails in October 2023. These bikes will be manufactured by Bajaj Auto at its Chakan Plant with an initial capacity of approximately 5,000 units per month.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services believes that these new products will create significant competition for Royal Enfield, which currently has a monopoly in the over 250cc segment.

The Triumph twins will rival the likes of Royal Enfield Classic 350 (with sales of 26,200 units per month), Hunter 350 (with sales of 15,900 units per month) and newly launched HD X440, according to Motilal Oswal. It adds that the range topping HD X440 is priced at a 21 percent premium to Speed 400, while Royal Enfield Classic 350 Chrome variant is priced at par.

Popular models

Even as Citi estimates a lower impact on the two-wheeler maker’s volumes, this should boost the company’s image as a premium bike player, it points out.

Stock valuation

In the bull case, Morgan Stanley expects Triumph launch to add Rs 466 per share to the stock. The brokerage firm points out that the stock remains a preferred pick in the two-wheeler segment, and is valued at FY25 Price to Earnings of 17 times as against 10-year median of 18 times.

According to Jefferies, the stock is trading at 19 times its FY24 Price to Earnings multiple and 16 times its FY25 Price to Earnings, in comparison to 17 times its long-term average, which implies the valuation is still reasonable. Additionally, the stock also offers a 4 percent dividend yield, it says.

The global brokerage firm sees Bajaj Auto’s volume and Earnings Per Share growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 15 percent and 23 percent, respectively, over FY23-25.

A little dash of salt

There are some things, though, that analysts are taking with a pinch of salt.

Goldman Sachs points out it is looking for more clarity on the progress on domestic two-wheeler market share which is range-bound, and also observing the pace of recovery in export markets, especially Nigeria and Egypt. Additionally, the timing of Bajaj Auto’s push to launch more electric two-wheelers in India is also something to look at, it feels.

For Q4 FY23, exports deteriorated sequentially due to a near standstill in Nigeria because of election-related unrest and demonetisation. Even CLSA has expressed caution over continued pressure in key export markets. It is also watchful of rising competitive intensity in the premium motorcycle segment and increasing lacklustre recovery in the entry level segment.

Despite these concerns, there is a section of the market that believes both domestic and export volumes will recover in FY24 from the low base, driving healthy recovery in earnings in future.

Brokerage recommendations for Bajaj Auto

According to Citi, Bajaj Auto’s presence in India is very limited so dealership expansion will be critical.

The company management has revealed its plans to expand the dealership network from 16 currently to 100 showrooms across 80 cities by the end of FY24.

Regardless, a large part of Bajaj Auto’s India profit pool of premium motorcycle and three-wheelers is vulnerable to a possible disruption from electrification. Yet, the current stock valuation, at 18.3 times and 16.5 times its FY24 and FY25 consolidated EPS, fairly reflects the expected recovery as well as the risk of EVs, explains Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Goldman Sachs says that new Electric Vehicle (EV) & Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) product launches in both two and three wheeler segments is a key catalyst.

Eicher Motors’ Royal Enfield (RE) has for long been the king of premium bikes in the country. Thanks to its positioning and affordability, Royal Enfield’s dominance has been so strong over the years that Harley-Davidson, which was at the higher end of the higher end, abruptly exited India in 2020. But the American bike maker has now come back and is looking to eat into RE’s market share.

On July 3, Hero Motocorp and Harley launched the Harley Davidson X440, which comes with a 440cc engine. Its peak torque and power are 35-40 percent higher than Royal Enfield’s Classic 350. The bike’s starting price, at Rs 2.29 lakh is at a 15 percent premium to the Classic 350cc and Meteor 350cc.

After all, the segment is a juicy one with high margins so everyone wants a piece of the pie. “The >250cc market may have space for 2-3 players. The high gross margins of RE at ~43 percent, Rs 75,000 per bike, make the segment attractive for new players,” wrote analysts at Nomura.

But, as consumers get spoiled for choice, it’s bad news for shareholders of Eicher Motors. RE, which commands 90 percent market share in the segment, with 735,000 units sold in India in FY23, now stands to lose some steam despite the market size growing.

“The premium bike segment is expected to grow at twice the rate of the underlying two-wheeler market growth. The two-wheeler market is expected to grow at 6-7 percent, but the premium bike market will grow 12-15 percent over the next five years,” says Jinesh Gandhi, senior vice president (equity research) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

For any player starting with zero market share, this is a lucrative opportunity. The same happened during the launch of the Jawa and Honda premium bikes. The dent wasn’t large but they did chip into RE’s market share, say analysts.

Moreover, Harley has always been an aspirational brand, with models starting above Rs 5 lakh. Now back with lower price points, it could force RE to suffer higher market share erosion.

According to Sreedhar Prasad, consumer sector expert and ex-partner, KPMG, the new Harley Davidson model targets three categories. First, the bike-lover looking for a ‘swanky’ purchase. Second, the ‘RE Bullet loyalists’ who can now upgrade to a Harley by paying a few thousand more. Third, upper middle class men and women in their forties, fascinated by the sleeker, retro look, who may not be owning a bike now

“Bullet has always had the image of being over-macho and extremely heavy,” he said.

For Royal Enfield, which contributes 90 percent to Eicher Motors’ bottom line, the threat is not only from Harley Davidson but also from Triumph’s Speed 400 and Scrambler 400X. The Speed 400, a street naked motorcycle that takes styling inspiration from the bigger Street Twin 900, has been priced at an aggressive Rs 2.33 lakh. The models are in partnership with Bajaj Auto.

Talking to CNBC-Awaaz, Rajiv Bajaj said, “Royal Enfield is the bank and we are all set to rob that bank.”

Also Read: Bajaj-Triumph collaboration makes Speed 400 an affordable aspiration for customers, says Rajiv Bajaj

Five years back, Bajaj had trolled Enfield with a series of ‘Haathi mat palo’ ads, in which Enfield was compared to an elephant. That was done to promote Bajaj’s Dominar 400 bikes, which, however, failed to make a mark as the ‘elephant’ stood strong. If the Triumph bikes are able to create a brand perception in the affordable aspiration segment, it will be a huge win for Bajaj, which has constantly tried to grow by breaking into higher-powered categories.

Royal Enfield is also staring at competition from the relaunch of Bajaj’s Pulsar and Hero’s Karizma brands, both are expected to sport around 200cc engines.

In this heated competitive environment, analysts believe the valuation premium commanded by Eicher Motors over Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto is slightly unjustified. Saji John, equity research analyst at Geojit BNP Paribas, said, “Given Royal Enfield’s brand recall, it is too early to give a verdict. But a contraction in the valuation gap is plausible.”

This has also been visible in the stock movements over the past few days.

Hero Moto has gained over 10 percent in the past five trading sessions while Bajaj Auto spiked 6 percent soon after unveiling its new launches with Triumph. Eicher Motors on the other hand has corrected over 8 percent.

In May, Motilal Oswal Financial Services had valued Eicher Motors at 24.5x one-year forward earnings per share. This has now contracted to 23.8x. Meanwhile, Hero Moto, which was valued at 15x, now commands a 16x 1-year forward P/E.

Clearly, there are exciting times ahead for two-wheeler lovers. And nervous moments for Eicher Motors shareholders. Unless it triumphs over the wannabes and has them heading for the border yet again.

Bajaj Auto, in collaboration with British motorcycle giant Triumph, on July 5 launched the Speed 400 premium bike for the Indian market at an ex-showroom price of Rs 2.33 lakh.

The introductory price will be applicable for the first 10,000 customers, Bajaj Auto-Triumph announced at the launch event.

The bike was unveiled a couple of days after Hero Motocorp, in partnership with Harley Davidson, launched the Harley Davidson X440 for the Indian market at a starting price of Rs 2.29 lakh.

The online pre-booking for Speed 400 was kicked off in India last month, with a Rs 2,000 fully refundable payment window, after its world premiere in London. Designed and manufactured in the United Kingdom's Hinckley, the motorcycle comes with a two-year unlimited mileage warranty and a 16,000 km service interval.

Last month, in an interview with CNBC-TV18, Bajaj Auto's managing director Rajiv Bajaj said that the bike's local production will begin in July, and deliveries will also start in the same month. ""We are trying our very best to hold the price closer to Rs 2.5 lakh,"" he added.

Notably, the Speed 400 will come in three distinct colours - Carnival Red with Phantom Black, Capsian Blue with Storm Grey, and Phantom Black with Storm Grey.

The motorcycle features a new TR-series engine. This engine is a fuel-injected, liquid-cooled single-cylinder unit with a cubic capacity of 398.15.

The engine has the capacity to churn out 39.5 bhp of power at 8,000 rpm, along with a peak torque output of 37.5 Npm at 6,500 rpm. It will come attached to a 6-speed gearbox with a slip-and-assist clutch.

Bajaj Auto's domestic sales of its electric scooter Chetak grew over four-fold to 36,260 units in FY23, with the easing of global semiconductor shortage, according to the company's latest annual report. In FY22, Chetak electric scooter clocked sales of 8,187 units, as per Bajaj Auto's Annual Report for 2022-23.

""The global semiconductor shortage that affected the industry, right up to the first quarter of FY2023 also affected the Chetak. Thus, despite market demand, Bajaj Auto could not produce the quantities needed right up to the end of Q1 FY2023,"" it said. Thereafter, Bajaj Auto said, ""the supply-side constraints eased, and we increased the manufacturing of the Chetak"".

The iconic brand Chetak was re-introduced in the market as an electric scooter in FY2021. In the year ended March 2021, domestic sales of Chetak EV were at 1,395 units. The Chetak is currently sold through 105 dealers present across 84 cities, the report said.

In his address to shareholders, Bajaj Auto Chairman Niraj Bajaj recollected that in FY22, the scarcity of semiconductors had impacted the production of motorcycles and top-of-the-line electric vehicles like Chetak. ""Thankfully, this terrible supply scarcity was over by the end of the first quarter of FY2023. Thereafter, your company was all set to increase substantially production and sales,"" he wrote.

Bajaj also pointed out that the company's exports, which accounted for 52.7 per cent of Bajaj Auto's net sales in FY22, dropped both in volume and in value terms in FY23. He pointed out political and economic uncertainties in several major importing countries such as Nigeria, Egypt, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh; demonetisation in Nigeria; unavailability of US dollars in the hands of importers as some of the main reasons for the drop in overseas sales.

After crossing the 1 lakh sales mark last month for the first time, electric two-wheeler (E2W) sales have plunged nearly 60 percent to 42,124 units in June, per data available on the Vahan portal. The total number of E2Ws sold were 1,05,348 units in May and 4,31,325 units during the first half of this year. This data is as of 1.45 pm on June 30.

While no original equipment manufacturers (OEM) came on record to comment on the numbers, analysts said the decline was largely because of a steep hike in e-scooter prices following a cut in subsidies under the government’s FAME 2 programme.

It may be recalled that during the last week of May, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) had notified that there would be a reduction in the maximum incentive rate for electric two-wheelers from 40 percent to 15 percent with effect from 1st June, 2023. Additionally, it has been decided to lower the demand incentive from Rs 15,000 per kWh to Rs 10,000 per Kwh, as per the same notification.

According to ICRA, E2W sales volumes had ramped up to ~1,05,000 units in May 2023 from ~66,000 units in April 2023, aided by pre-buying ahead of a likely price hike due to the cut in FAME II subsidies announced on May 21, 2023.

“Given the price rise, sales were expected to slow down over the near term; the same is reflected in the volumes in June. Sales are expected to only gradually recover going forward, with customers expected to take time to digest the price hikes,” said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, Vice President and Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA.

On a year-on-year (YoY) basis too, E2W registrations were marginally down from 44,384 units in June 2022. The total vehicle offtake in January, February, and March stood at 64,680 units, 66,073 units, and 86,313 units, respectively, as per Vahan data.

It is to be mentioned that Vahan only records the total number of vehicle sales registered, not the bookings. It also doesn’t take into account low-speed E2W sales, and excludes data for Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana.

OEMs hit

All the OEMs such as Ola Electric, Ather, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor company, Ampere, Hero Electric, etc., witnessed a decline in volumes this month vis-à-vis May '23.

Market leader Ola Electric’s sales in June slumped nearly 43 percent to 16,332 units, from 28,625 units in May, according to Vahan. The Bhavish Aggarwal-led startup had clocked sales of 21,413 units in March and 22,026 units in April 2023.

TVS Motor Company, which hit the second spot for the first time by selling 20,397 units of iQube last month, saw its sales fall to 6,844 units in June. The company sold 16,896 units in March and 8,758 units in April. Ather Energy, which sold 8,758 units in April and 15,406 in May, saw sales dwindle to 4,194 units in June, as per Vahan .

Despite seeing its numbers going down from 2,907 units in May to 2,475 units in June, Okinawa Autotech rose up to the fourth position. This is primarily because Bajaj Auto’s volumes went down from 9,966 units in May to 2,672 units in June, ranking it 5th in the pecking order.

Ampere Electric, which was at fifth place with 9,635 units last month, saw its numbers drop massively to 1,488 units in June. Hero Electric’s sales declined by nearly 50 percent, from 2,109 units to 1,076 in June.

CRISIL Ratings claims that lower purchase and running costs have been the key factors driving the increased demand for E2Ws in the earlier months.

“The price of an E2W has gone up by 15-20 percent as most manufacturers have upped prices. This has temporarily impacted sales. That said, if manufacturers decide to pass on the cost benefits resulting from lower battery costs following a steep moderation in lithium prices, then demand for E2Ws may see a strong rebound,” said Anuj Sethi, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings.",673,-0.6402792105307946

Bajaj Auto shares gained on June 27 ahead of the global launch of the first set of motorcycles under the Bajaj-Triumph partnership. At 12:30pm, the stock was trading at Rs 4,655 on the NSE, higher by 1 percent from the previous close.

While the exact details are not known yet, bike enthusiasts believe Scrambler and Roadster are the two models that will be showcased in London. They are likely to sport a 300-400cc engine, directly taking on Royal Enfield.

Bajaj and Triumph had announced a strategic partnership back in 2o2o, under which they planned to create a range of mid-sized Triumph Motorcycles. This is the third key partnership for Bajaj Auto to manufacture higher CC bikes apart from KTM and Husqvarna.

At a time when its peers have been ramping up launches in the electric space, Bajaj Auto is sticking to its core competency. Its EV foray has largely been in the three-wheeler segment. It planned to ramp up production of its electric scooter Chetak to around 10,000 units a month by June, but there has been no update on that front yet.

Analysts have not spelt out their clear verdict on the Triumph partnership. “Triumph being a premium brand with higher CC (more than 600cc) offerings and 1,000-unit sales for FY23, we await affordable offerings from the partnership adapting to the needs of the domestic market in the mid-weight category, which is dominated by Royal Enfield,” according to ICICIdirect analysts wrote in a note.

Apart from monitoring the progress on Triumph partnership, the analysts are also keenly watching the company's export numbers. In Q4 FY23, Bajaj Auto's exports deteriorated sequentially due to a near standstill in Nigeria because of election-related unrest and demonetisation.

In a recent conversation with Network 18 on the occasion of International Yoga Day, Rajiv Bajaj, the Managing Director of Bajaj Auto, shared his personal experiences and insights into the transformative power of yoga. Bajaj, a long-time practitioner of yoga, discussed how the ancient practice has helped him overcome challenging times, both in his personal life and professional career.

During the interview, Bajaj acknowledged that yoga has been an integral part of his life, imparting valuable lessons and aiding him during tough phases. Reflecting on the teachings of his mentor, BKS Iyengar, Bajaj emphasized the importance of understanding the mind-body connection in addressing various health issues.

Bajaj said that Iyengar had taught him that while physical ailments might manifest in the body, their root causes often lie within the mind. Bajaj pointed out that conditions like Zima estima, irritable bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroidism, diabetes, hypertension, and cholesterol, among others, can be traced back to the mind.

Bajaj quoted Iyengar, ""Let the breath be your teacher,"" highlighting the ability of yoga to turn the mind inward, away from external stressors.

Bajaj specifically mentioned the positive impact of yoga asanas, or physical postures, in redirecting the mind's focus and alleviating stress. By using the body to turn the mind inward, individuals can find relief from the pressures of the outside world. Quoting Iyengar’s words, Bajaj said, ""Yoga teaches us to cure what must not be endured and to endure what cannot be cured.”

When asked about his biggest life lesson from yoga over the past two decades, Bajaj shared a personal anecdote that showcased the transformative power of the practice. In 2012, Bajaj suffered a severe back injury that necessitated bed rest and potential spinal surgery. However, upon Iyengar’s recommendation, he turned to yoga for healing.

Under his guidance, Bajaj practiced yoga for two hours despite excruciating pain. Surprisingly, he experienced a significant improvement in his condition. Bajaj marveled at the fact that he felt 30% better after the yoga session, while bed rest and surgery were initially advised.

The lesson Bajaj learned from this experience was the importance of function preceding structure. While conventional medical wisdom assumes that fixing the body's structure leads to proper function, Iyengar’s teachings in yoga advocated the opposite view.

Aligning the body correctly through correct postures, such as standing, sitting, twisting, bending, and stretching, would stimulate the mind and facilitate adaptive changes in the body's structure. Bajaj drew parallels between this philosophy and the business world, asserting that focusing on functional excellence can naturally lead to the development of efficient organizational structures.

Bajaj emphasised that his father's teachings and the wisdom gained from yoga have influenced his approach to business. He believes that motorcycles, just like any other product, are a result of the right combination of technology, brand strategy, cost management, and organizational harmony.

“But at the end of the day, you must also accept that, you know, acceptance is important part of it. There are some things that will never be your we're human after all. Yoga will give us the strength to cope with that,” he added.",526,0.7195789992809296

The second largest two-wheeler manufacturer in the country, Bajaj Auto forayed into the two-wheeler market in 1972 by launching the famous Bajaj Chetak. Now, after the success of 50 years, the company is gearing up to release multiple e-2Ws by aiming at the eco-friendly market space.

Rajiv Bajaj, MD of Bajaj Auto, said that he was fortunate enough to be a part of the brand when it transitioned from scooters to motorcycles. “Our goal 30 years ago was to be the world's most versatile and complete motorcycle maker, which I think we have achieved. We became the world's most valuable motorcycle manufacturer last year,” he said, hoping to do the same with electric vehicles.

In an interview with Network18, Rajiv said that he will be heading to the British motorcycle brand Triumph’s launch in London, to unveil their joint product after announcing their collaboration for the first time in 2017.

“The production will begin in early July and deliveries will also begin in July. Obviously, more details about the product and prices will be released closer to the launch. We are trying our very best to hold the price closer to Rs 2.5 lakh and not at Rs 3 lakh,” said the MD, adding that their new plant in Chakan has the capacity to manufacture about 6,000 to 8,000 Triumph motorcycles per month.

Bajaj has consciously chosen to focus on the 125cc Plus segment with a lesser focus on the 100cc segment, as three factors influence the decision. “One, it is the customer whose sentiment was most impacted by the lockdown. Secondly, that is where petrol prices hurt the most. I think people are being beamed by EVs there, more than in any other segment. And finally, the premiumisation to 125cc is the third factor,” he added.

As far as exports are concerned, from an average of 2,00,000 vehicles a month, a few months ago, we had come down to almost half at 1,00,000-1,10,000 a month. This month, it looks more like 140,000 and hopefully next quarter is more like 1,50,000, the MD said.

Post the devaluation of the Nigerian currency Naira, Bajaj says that there is a lot of uncertainty in the market. “One day, we hear of three-wheelers being banned in Egypt, the next day, it's motorcycles being banned in Iraq. Or the next day, Argentina says it can deal only with RMB, and the next day, Nigeria devalues its currency,” he said, hoping to make a comeback by producing 75 percent of the normal demand. “In the bigger picture, price increases do get absorbed, consumers do adapt, as what we are selling them is not luxury but something they need,” Rajiv added.

The Bajaj Auto MD also commented on the discontinuation of FAME subsidies from March 24. “The earlier, the better,” he said, adding that many innovations have come into the ICE space over the last 30 years without any subsidy. He further added that the idea of subsidy does not translate to sustainability and that he hopes to move into expanding the environment of EVs.",553,0.26371442079544066

The domestic electric two-wheeler (E2W) industry saw monthly sales cross the one lakh mark for the first time in May as the announcement of a subsidy cut on such vehicle purchases sparked a last-minute buying rush.

As per the data available on the government portal Vahan, retail monthly sales of electric two-wheelers scaled a new high of 104,845 units in May 2023, which is about 57 percent higher than the 66,727 units registered in April 2023. See table below:

On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, E2W registrations were up by 147 percent percent from 42,415 units sold in May 2022.

According to industry players, the record numbers were largely due to buyers advancing purchases in the last 10 days of May as E2W manufacturers indicated that there will be a price mark-up post the subsidy cut.

Anticipating a 15-20 percent price hike in June, buyers booked vehicles at lower prices with a larger FAME-II subsidy.

In April, the numbers had declined by nearly 23 percent over issues related to delays in subsidy disbursement and supply shortage.

It is to be mentioned that Vahan only records the total number of vehicles which have been registered (post-sales) and doesn’t include booked ones. It also doesn’t take into account low-speed E2W sales and excludes data for Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana, which means the sales in May must be higher.

The subsidy cut

On May 21, the government notified that the subsidy on the FAME India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India) Scheme will be revised to Rs 10,000 per kilowatt per hour (kWh) as against Rs 15,000/ kWH starting June 1. (l) Furthermore, the cap for incentive has been brought down to 15 percent of the ex-factory price of the model as against 40 percent offered earlier.

The May 2023 numbers top the previous best of 86,269 units logged in March 2023 by 19,303 units, as per the data available on Vahan. The total numbers of E2Ws registered were 64,664 units in January and 66,057 units in February.

OEMs shatter records

The record sales were largely underpinned by the all-time high monthly volumes of the top three OEMs – Ola Electric, TVS Motor Co and Ather Energy.

Ola Electric continued to maintain the leading position as it sold 28,469 units of e-scooters in May 2023, which is nearly 30 percent higher than the 21,991 units sold a month before, as per Vahan data. In a statement, the company claimed that it has sold over 35,000 units in May, capturing a market share of over 30 percent, posting a YoY growth of 300 percent.

Bhavish Aggarwal, Founder and CEO, Ola Electric, said, “Month after month, our sales have experienced exponential growth and Ola has consistently led the EV revolution in India.”

TVS Motor Company, which crossed 20,000 units of monthly sales for the first time, was in the second spot. The company sold 20,262 units of iQube, surpassing its previous best of 17,878 units in March 2023 and recording a 131 percent MoM growth over 8,751 units sold in April 2023.

“TVS iQube has a healthy booking pipeline of over 30,000 units and we are confident of continued improvement of supplies in the coming months, the company said in a statement.

Ather Energy, which reached the third spot, also hit a new monthly high in May 2023. At 15,266 units, its sales in May were nearly 100 percent more than April’s 7,786 units. In a statement, the company claimed it grew by 357 percent on a YoY basis.

Ravneet Singh Phokela, Chief Business Officer of Ather Energy, said, ""The market gained strong momentum this month, which can be attributed to the growing underlying demand, fuelled further by the news of the impending revision of the FAME subsidy. This led to some consumers bringing forward their purchases, in order to avail the higher subsidy amount. We hope to maintain this momentum as the manufacturing industry and its ecosystem continue to grow.”

While Bajaj Auto rose to fourth place for the first time with a 168 percent month-on-month increase in sales to 9,931 units, Ampere Vehicles took fifth position with 9,632 units, up 15 percent over April’s 8,324 units.

Price hikes implemented

With reduced FAME II subsidy reduced, OEMs like Ola, Ather, TVS, etc., have already jacked up the prices of e-scooters and e-motorcycles by 10 percent to 15 percent.

Industry analysts reckon that there will be some near-term impact on sales in the next few months but the market is expected to bounce back during the onset of the festive season. Furthermore, new launches like Ola S1 Air, Ather 450S, TVS iQube ST, a new variant of Bajaj Chetak, etc., may prop up some volumes, as indicated by companies.",792,0.7172060678986942

The month of May was a mixed bag for the automotive sector. While demand for two-wheelers exceeded expectations due to the wedding season and pre-buying of electric vehicles (EVs), commercial vehicle (CV) demand fell short.

""The growth in domestic two-wheeler volumes increased approximately 10 percent year-on-year, driven by the pre-buying of electric two-wheelers ahead of the moderation of FAME II incentives starting on June 1, 2023, as well as the wedding season,"" said Kotak Institutional analysts in a report.

The two-wheeler export segment witnessed gradual recovery in volumes on a sequential basis, though overall numbers remained weak. On an aggregate basis, volumes increased 7 percent year on year (YoY) for Hero MotoCorp, 9 percent for TVS Motor and 22 percent for Royal Enfield.

Passenger vehicles

The wholesale volumes for the domestic passenger vehicle (PV) industry increased by 13-15 percent compared to the previous year. However, the retail volume growth remained minimal, only growing in low single digits year-on-year, as per KIE analysts.

Maruti Suzuki saw a 10 percent year-on-year increase in total volumes, driven by a 13 percent increase in domestic segment volumes. However, this growth was offset by a 3 percent decline in exports. Hyundai Motors reported a 15 percent year-on-year increase in volumes, while Kia Motors saw flat domestic volume growth year-on-year.

Commercial vehicles

The commercial vehicle segment's demand remained muted compared to the previous year, with volumes declining by mid to high-single digits.

This can be attributed to subdued demand trends as customers made pre-purchases of vehicles before the transition to BS-VI Phase II in March 2023, said analysts.

Tata Motors' CV volumes saw a 12 percent year-on-year decline and Ashok Leyland reported a 1 percent decline.

As per estimates, domestic tractor industry volumes also declined by low single digit on a yearly basis, with M&M reporting 5 percent YoY decline.

Shares of Bajaj Auto extended gains from the previous session and climbed to a 52-week high in early trade on June 2. This comes on the back of an upbeat sentiment for the stock after the two-wheeler company posted a rise in total sales during May.

At 10.08 am, shares of Bajaj Auto were trading at Rs 4,676.20 with gains of around 1 percent on the National Stock Exchange. The stock also hit a 52-week high of Rs 4,707 earlier today.

On June 1, Bajaj Auto reported a 23 percent jump in total sales to 3,55,148 units in May against 2,75,868 units in the same month last year. The rise in total sales was aided by a strong rebound in the domestic market.

The domestic sales were up over twofold on year to 2,28,401 units versus 1,12,308 units in the year ago period. This increase is remarkable, especially given the fact that the company has been struggling with sluggish domestic demand, primarily in rural areas in the recent quarters.

During an interview with CNBC-TV18, Rakesh Sharma, the Executive Director of Bajaj Auto, highlighted that the domestic segment exhibited robust performance, largely attributed to the exceptional performance within the 125cc segment.

Management View

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director Bajaj Auto, said performance of the domestic segment was strong, primarily driven by the outperformance in the 125cc segment. He highlighted that the growth rates are looking astronomical due to the low base of the previous year, indicating a significant improvement.

Sharma further stated that the business has improved on a sequential basis, and the 125cc plus segment has performed well. He expressed expectations of the industry growing by 3-5% in the next 2-3 months. Bajaj Auto, however, aims to grow at twice the rate of the industry, positioning itself for a stronger growth trajectory.

The company currently holds over 30% market share in the 125cc segment, indicating its strong position in the market. Additionally, Sharma mentioned that Bajaj Auto's domestic market share has now reached 18%.

Regarding the international markets, Sharma highlighted that the Nigeria business is improving consistently month by month. On-ground demand in export markets is also showing signs of improvement. Furthermore, the availability of US dollars for trading is slowly improving, which is positive for the company's export operations.

The Central Government's decision to slash FAME subsidy for electric two wheelers will definitely retard the growth of the electric vehicle industry. Speaking exclusively to CNBC-TV18, Rakesh Sharma the Executive Director of Bajaj Auto said, ""The announcement on subsidy reduction has been abrupt, and we will see a shock for over two to three months"".

Sharma said that for Bajaj Auto, the restructuring of FAME will lead to a Rs 20,000 reduction in subsidy per scooter. The company is evaluating how to address this subsidy cut in vehicle pricing.

With the 2,000 crore allocation for electric two wheelers drawing to a close, the government has decided to allocate an additional 1,500 crores for electric two wheelers for FY24. But the increased allocation has come at a price.

In order to extend the FAME scheme till March'24, the government has reduced subsidy per scooter from 40 percent of vehicle cost to 15 percent of the vehicle cost. Several electric two wheeler makers had opposed the move and are likely to announce price hikes in the coming days.

""There are enough signals from the government that the FAME scheme is on its last legs. Therefore tempering down of incentives, which lead to tempering of growth rates are steps in the right direction. Breakneck growth in EV sales, with ambiguity skews decision making regarding capital investments. Many customers coming into the consumption cycle who are not strong enough to buy the products. This lead to dissatisfaction later as subsidies are not sustainable"", said Sharma to CNBC-TV18.

The senior executive of Bajaj Auto said that the slowdown in growth will be seen for a few month after 1st June, 2023, when the new FAME structure comes into effect. After the first few months, we will see EV sales growing at a saner level, he said.

Bajaj Auto is looking to ramp up electric two wheeler production to 10,000 units per month in H1 and gradually take it to 15,000 units per month in the second half of the year. Sharma said that the electric vehicle industry will see consolidation in FY24, with some of the weaker players looking to sell a minority stake or exit the market.",388,-0.9789713422457377

Returns matter a lot, yet there are always scenarios where analysts and investors are at odds. Sometimes analysts are gung-ho over a stock despite investors dumping it; there are also occasions when investors lap up a stock that analysts seem to loathe.

With the Indian market climbing higher in the past one month, a cluster of stocks has stood out prominently where investors and analysts are at a variance.

Contrarian downgrades

Bajaj Auto, despite a rally in its share price, has stood out like a sore thumb when it comes to analyst views, with the ‘buy’ recommendations decreasing to 27 in April, from 33 in the previous month and 40 in the past one quarter.

The shares of the largest domestic three-wheeler original equipment maker have risen 17 percent over a month, 12 percent over a quarter and 16 percent in a year.

Post the recent rally, Kotak Institutional Equities believes most of the positives are already baked in the current market price of Bajaj Auto, prompting it to maintain its ‘reduce’ rating on the automobile stock with a hike in target price to Rs 4,000 from Rs 3,625 earlier.

Besides this, a cut in export volumes and market share loss faced by the second-largest motorcycle manufacturer has led to the downgrades.

“Concerns on the export volumes continue (around 50 percent of sales) with Bajaj Auto delaying the recovery timelines led by uncertainty on unavailability of USD and lower affordability. Also, lack of market share gains in the domestic motorcycles market over the last few years, and increase in competition could lead to further pricing actions,” said brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher.

Meanwhile, Jefferies slightly differed from the view. Even as the capital markets firm is concerned about Bajaj Auto's market share loss in premium bikes and exports, it sees multiple tailwinds—improving domestic demand, gradual export recovery, the launch of Triumph bikes, and the scale-up of EVs.

UltraTech Cement

Over the quarter, another stock that caught the eye was UltraTech Cement where ‘buy’ ratings dropped to 39 from 42 but the share price rose 12.5 percent during the same period.

Gains in the stock price were on the back of the cement manufacturer’s leadership position in the industry with a market share of around 26 percent in FY23, coupled with robust expansion plans without leveraging the balance sheet. Strong demand, cement prices likely remaining stable and power and fuel costs treading lower also supported the buying sentiment for the cement stock.

However, the only thing that seems to be ticking off analysts is the limited upside potential in the stock. Dolat Capital said that the current market price leaves limited upside.

At Rs 7,704 on the BSE, UltraTech Cement’s stock is about a percent away from scaling its 52-week high.

Coal India

Other stocks that analysts seem to dislike are Coal India and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.

For Coal India, 7 brokerage firms have downgraded their ratings on the state-owned mining company’s stock to 15 ‘buy’ recommendations from 22 over the past one year. This is in contrast to the coal major’s near 23 percent rally in the share price, which was largely due to attractive valuation and high dividend yield. The company’s board gave in-principle approval to divest a 25 percent stake in Bharat Coking Coal and some analysts believe a stake sale along with a potential listing could help unlock value, which also triggered the rally.

At Rs 237, the stock trades at an inexpensive valuation of 3.9 times FY24 EV/EBITDA, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Among other things that made analysts wary is a likely fall in e-auction realisations. CLSA believes e-auction realisations will fall further on a decline in global prices.

Lower-than-expected e-auction realisation of Rs 4,525 per tonne, down 10 percent QoQ, played a spoilsport during the March quarter. Sharekhan by BNP Paribas highlighted that lower realisations, especially for e-auction, could affect margins and earnings outlook.

Dr Reddy’s Labs

As for Dr Reddy’s, ‘buy’ ratings have slipped to 31 from 37 over a year. Analysts take it that the ongoing United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) plant inspections and a few companies being issued Form 483 with observations pointing at apparent regulatory concerns, may drag the performance of pharmaceutical players, prompting them to stay selective in the space.

Recently, Dr Reddy’s has been issued a Form 483 with one observation by the US FDA following an inspection of the company’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility in Bollaram, Hyderabad.

Sharekhan cautioned that increased scrutiny from the US FDA, leading to production delays, and rising guidance around research and development and promotion and marketing costs in the near term, could act as headwinds against a potentially strong operating performance for the drugmaker.

Despite the downgrades, the scrip of the pharmaceutical major has shot up 20 percent during the past one year given the superior product portfolio and strong product pipeline of Dr Reddy’s.

Dr Reddy’s has outperformed the Nifty Pharma index over the past one year. The pharma major’s scrip has climbed 26 percent higher in comparison with the 0.5 percent drop in the index.

Contrarian upgrades

On the other hand, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) was the only stock on Nifty50 where the share price declined for over a month, yet analysts upgraded their ratings on the scrip.

Volume growth for India’s largest FMCG company seemed to be a worry for investors, which triggered a small drop in the stock price over the past one month, but analysts paid heed to the upbeat management commentary. The HUL’s management believes overall volume growth will likely recover gradually as consumption comes with a lag. It also reiterated that the rural slowdown has bottomed out and the company should start seeing volume recovery provided the macro environment and raw material prices remain stable.

What analysts also like about HUL — that houses brands like Lux, Pond’s, Red Label, Bru, Dove, Fair & Lovely, Horlicks, Kissan, Pepsodent, Surf Excel, and Vaseline — is the company’s continued market share gains in a challenging consumption environment and its focus on driving premiumisation across categories.

The company’s premium portfolio continues to significantly outperform both the market and HUL’s overall growth, pointed out ICICI Securities.

Besides HUL, analysts also have a fondness for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro despite the negative stock trajectory over a quarter.

Tata Consultancy Services

Even as the stock price is down 6 percent, ‘buy’ calls on TCS shares have bumped up to 24 from 21.

The technology company reported robust deal Total Contract Value (TCV) wins with order book TCV of $10 billion as compared with $7.8 billion in Q3 FY23 and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 times recording an all-time high number of large deals, highlighted Sharekhan.

Meanwhile, PhillipCapital expects TCS to continue to command a valuation premium over its peers, on the back of its strong diversified profile, superior return profile (Return on Equity of 46 percent in FY23), management stability, strong margins and market leadership position.

Despite the strong deal pipeline, the TCS management indicated caution and uncertainty among clients in the near term, which could further impact revenues as well as slow down margin improvement.

Sharekhan has cautioned that the near-term outperformance would be restricted for TCS owing to uncertain earnings outlook, CEO transition and global macro headwinds.

Wipro

Meanwhile, Wipro has also seen an increase in upgrades over a quarter with ‘buy’ recommendations topping up to 13 from 11 despite a 3 percent drop in share price.

Besides, the pricey stock valuation, March quarter earnings had made investors cautious, yet the announcement of buying back shares worth Rs 12,000 crore looked like the saving grace.

“At 15X FY2025E EPS, the stock is not yet cheap enough to warrant a re-look. The stock may hold up in the short term courtesy of buyback,” said Kotak Institutional Equities.

Multiple analysts believe that the current stock valuation fairly captures the risk from the slowing macroeconomic environment that Wipro is facing along with lower-than-expected revenue growth. Wipro has guided for a sequential decline of 1-3 percent in revenue in 1Q FY24, essentially implying no growth in FY24.

Reliance Industries

Over a year, a contrarian upgrade that stole the show is Reliance Industries which saw brokerage firms stepping up their ‘buy’ calls to 33 from 26. Much of the optimism among analysts for RIL’s stock stems from the likelihood of Jio and retail business listings. However, the share price of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate has slumped 14 percent over a year.

CLSA explained that a lack of launches and growth areas has kept the stock subdued over the past 18 months. This, according to the foreign brokerage firm, could change in the second half of FY24 as it sees the Mukesh Ambani-led company start offering its portable 5G device (Jio Airfiber) to ramp up wireless broadband additions and launch its affordable 5G smartphone as it monetises its pan-India standalone 5G launch by end-2023. Further, recent brand launches (Independence, Campa Cola) suggest could ramp up Reliance’s FMCG foray in 2023.

Most importantly, CLSA highlighted in its research report in March that with three years having passed since the stake sale to PE investors, it sees a good chance of a Jio and/or retail IPO in the next 12 months.

Bajaj Finance

Another stock that put the others in the shade was Bajaj Finance. The financier’s stock saw ‘buy’ calls spiralling up to 24 from 19.

The management has guided for healthy loan growth going forward aided by healthy demand as well as new segments, while some fall in net interest margins will be compensated by operating efficiencies. Hence, according to Jefferies, earnings growth and ROA (Return On Asset) can stay high which will support the stock valuations.

“It is also awaiting RBI's approval to foray into credit cards, which we believe can add 5-10 percent to profit pool opportunity,” the global investment banking firm said.

Despite the liking, investors sold the stock over a year with the share price declining around 7 percent during the period. The stock had been consolidating for the last one year.

Some market participants have expressed concern that the lagged effect of rate hikes will likely temper margins. Besides, Kotak Institutional Equities believes the overall business outlook remains strong although rich valuations cap any upside in the stock.

The Pune-based automaker plans to invest Rs 500 crore in the electric vehicle (EV) segment, of which the lion’s share will be deployed in building capacity for its E3Ws, a top company official said.

Bajaj Auto is the market leader in the traditional three-wheeler market and initially planned to launch E3Ws in 2019. The plan was later postponed to the previous financial year due to Covid.

“We are putting out close to Rs 500 crore on the capex for this (financial) year. This is because the launch of the electric three-wheeler vehicle planned for the weeks ahead will lead to capex and infra creation,” chief financial officer Dinesh Thapar said during an earnings media interaction. “A large part of capex that we do on the EV business will be behind three-wheeler EVs.”

The company’s E3Ws will be introduced soon in both the passenger and cargo categories in select locations in the first phase. Bajaj Auto told Moneycontrol earlier it is “readying dealerships” and “training manpower” for its E3Ws.

Bajaj Auto’s entry in the E3W business comes as Piaggio India, Mahindra & Mahindra, Omega Seiki Mobility and Euler Motors expand in this space.

Asked whether the Level 5 E3Ws will cut into the share of its traditional three-wheelers that use fossil fuels, Thapar said the E3Ws will be introduced in a phased manner. He said the use cases for electric two- and three-wheelers are different and opportunities for E3Ws will be driven by certain geographies where there may be restrictions on traditional vehicles.

In auto industry parlance, the Level 5 (or L5) category of E3Ws is a segment above electric autorickshaws or electric carts (L3 category). While close to 25,000 units of such E3Ws were retailed last year, about 14,000 units have been registered so far in 2023, according to government data.

Bajaj Auto has outlined a total outlay of Rs 700-750 crore for FY24 compared with Rs 1,000 crore spent during FY23.

“We are expanding capacity on the supply of EV components relative to our scale. We are doing about 3,000-3,500 units (of Chetak e-scooter) per month, which is not enough to meet demand. We are ramping up to debottleneck capacity on EV components. A fair amount of that has happened and a lot of that is currently underway to reach levels upwards of 10,000,” Thapar added.

He said Bajaj Auto invested mainly in creating enablers for the Chetak business in the previous financial year, augmenting R&D capabilities, and establishing dedicated dealerships.

Bajaj Auto reaffirmed that its EV subsidiary has applied for the government’s production-linked incentive schemes",455,0.9999921321868896

After witnessing an all-time high sales mark of 85,000 units+ during March 2023, the domestic electric vehicle (EV) industry saw the total two-wheeler numbers declining by nearly 23 percent to 66,468 units in April 2023, as per data available on Vahan. The monthly degrowth in electric two-wheelers (E2Ws) is happening amidst FAME-II subsidy rollback by the government.

“Electric two-wheeler retail volumes declined to ~66,000 units in April 2023, after ramping up to levels of ~86,000 units in March 2023. The volumes were impacted to an extent by the ongoing issues related to delay in subsidy disbursement and supply shortage,” said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited.

It may be recalled that apart from 14 E2W manufacturers that are reportedly under the government’s scanner for allegedly claiming FAME-II subsidies in violation of minimum localisation norms, the likes of Ola Electric, Ather Energy, TVS Motor, and Hero MotoCorp, among others, are also facing allegations for allegedly keeping the prices of their vehicles lower by billing integral parts like charger and proprietary software separately from the vehicle. However, all the aforementioned companies have denied the allegations levelled against them.

On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, E2W registrations were up by 20 percent from 53,258 units in April 2022. As per the Vahan portal, the total number of E2Ws registered were 64,649 units in January, 66,033 units in February and 86,194 units in March this year.

It is to be mentioned that Vahan only mentions the total number of vehicles which have been registered (post sales) and doesn’t include vehicles that have been booked. It also doesn’t take into account low-speed E2W sales and excludes data for Lakshadweep, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana.

Ola soldiers on while others falter

Despite the decline in registrations, Ola Electric managed to outperform the market with 21,882 registrations in April, which was also its highest number for this year, as per Vahan data. The Bhavish Aggarwal-led EV start-up saw just 2 percent rise in vehicle registrations from 21,389 units in March.

In an official release, Ola Electric claimed that it has ‘wrested’ 40 percent of the EV scooter market, as it sold 30,000 units (registered sales + bookings). The Bangalore-based start-up also claimed that it has secured the number one position in sales for eight consecutive months.

Anshul Khandelwal, Chief Marketing Officer, Ola, said, “To accelerate this momentum even further, we will continue to expand aggressively on the product front as well as ramp up our D2C network, to cater to this demand.”

Ola Electric was recently in the news for agreeing to compensate consumers for the price of the charger that it billed separately rather than including it in the ex-factory price of its e-scooters.

Despite witnessing a 50 percent drop in month-on-month (MoM) sales from 16,863 units in March, TVS Motor Company, retained the second spot by delivering to 8,728 units of iQube electric scooters in April.

“The production for April 2023 was constrained due to AIS156 changeover and supply chain challenges. TVS Motor is confident of ramping up from the month of May 2023. The order book for TVS iQube continues to be very robust and TVS Motor will retain the growth momentum,"" the company said in a statement.

Greaves Cotton-owned Ampere has replaced Ather in the third spot with 8,318 units in April (down by 9,344 units in March), as per Vahan data. The same data claimed that Ather Energy saw a 36 percent decline in its EV registrations to 7,746 units from 12,167 units in March.

In an official release Ather Energy revealed that it has sold 8,182 units (registered sales + bookings) in April 2023, registering a 117% percent YoY growth. Ravneet Singh Phokela, Chief Business Officer, Ather Energy stated, ""There has been a dip in sales this month compared to March 2023 due to the uncertainty around FAME policy and its cascading impact. We continue to see a steady rise in demand across the country, and we are increasing our retail footprint to cater to the demand.""

The Bajaj Auto and Chetak Technologies combine, managed to get into the fifth position in April at 4,013 units (4,542 units in march). The position was previously held by Hero Electric, which moved down to the 6th spot at 3,331 units in April’23 from 6,660 units in March’23.",727,0.01050417423248291

In a month that saw the introduction of Stage 2 BS-VI emission norms, most two-wheeler makers in the country posted healthy growth figures in the domestic market. However, rural stress and weak exports continued to exert pressure on overall two-wheeler volumes in April.

Hero MotoCorp, the country's largest two-wheeler maker, did not match up to its performance a year ago. The company revealed that its total wholesales (shipments to dealers) declined by 5 percent year on year to 3,96,107 units in April, from 4,18,622 units in the year-ago period. Domestic sales also went down to 3,86,184 units from 3,98,490 units in April 2022. Exports also dipped to 9,923 units last month from 20,132 units in the year-ago period.

“The company expects the momentum to build up in the coming months on account of a combination of multiple factors, including a slew of new product launches, healthy growth in the country's GDP and positive consumer sentiments,” Hero MotoCorp said in a statement.

Bajaj Auto Ltd.'s total two-wheeler sales rose 2% to 287,985 units in April from 281,711 units in the same month last year. The company’s two-wheeler sales in the domestic market soared 95 percent to 181,828 lakh units in April from 93,233 units a year ago. However, exports of two-wheelers plummeted 44 percent to 106,157 units last month from 188,478 units a year ago.

Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) said its domestic wholesales increased 6 percent to 3,38,289 units in April. The company had dispatched 3,18,734 units in April 2022. Also, last month, its exports went down to 36,458 units from 42,295 units in April 2022.

TVS Motor Company reported a 24 percent increase in total sales across segments ((including three-wheelers) to 2,95,308 units in April. The company had posted total sales of 2,38,983 units in the same month last year. Total two-wheeler sales rose 24 percent to 2,80,022 units last month, as against sales of 2,26,193 units in April 2022. TVS’s domestic two-wheeler sales stood at 1,80,533 units last month as compared to 1,31,386 units in the year-ago month.

""The shortage in the supply of semiconductors has impacted the production and sales of premium two-wheelers. Just as we had done last year, we are working aggressively with alternate [sic] sources and taking every effort to improve supplies at the earliest,” TVS Motor said.

Suzuki Motorcycle India Pvt. Ltd. (SMIPL) registered overall sales of 88,731 units in April. The company sold 67,259 units in the domestic market and exported 21,472 units during the month. Overall, the company witnessed 23.3% year-on-year growth in April as compared to the same month last year.

“This consistent sales performance is the result of growing demand for Suzuki two-wheelers in India and in the overseas markets,” said Kenichi Umeda, the Japanese company’s Managing Director.

Credit Ratings agency ICRA reckons that wholesale dispatches of two wheelers improved in April, aided to an extent by a recovery in rural sentiment. In April 2023, domestic wholesale volumes are estimated to have been at approximately 1.35 million units, representing a growth of around 5 percent on a sequential basis and a healthy 14 percent or so on a year-on-year basis, it said.

“Despite the growth in volumes, there continue to be concerns regarding sustenance of the demand recovery on account of the material rise in cost of ownership over the past few years,” said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, Vice President & Sector Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited.",585,0.1330416202545166

Healthy growth in auto volumes in April have caused some of the auto stocks to move up nearly 1.5 percent in today’s morning trade, while weakness in the domestic market caused others to drop up to 2.5 percent.

Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki were up by 1.4 percent, 1.37 percent and 1.34 percent respectively on BSE at 11 am. They were trading at around Rs 4,495, Rs 3,346 and Rs 8,705 respectively. Growth in sales in all three companies were driven by demand in the domestic market, with weakness in export markets weighing on the total.

Tata Motors and Hero MotoCorp were down by around 1.4 percent and 2.7 percent, trading at around Rs 478 and Rs 2,490 respectively.

Company-wise break-up

Bajaj Auto reported a 7 percent YoY rise in sales in April, according to the exchange filing made on May 2. It sold 3,31,278 units this month versus 3,10,774 units a year ago. Domestic sales saw a healthy YoY growth of 109 percent but it was offset by a significant 43 percent fall in export volumes. Domestic sales stood at 2,13,172 units against 1,02,177 units a year ago; while export sales stood at 1,18,106 units versus 2,08,597 units from a year ago.

Their commercial vehicles (CV) division did far better than their two-wheeler (2W) segment. CV volumes grew by 49 percent YoY to 43,293 units from 29,063 units while its 2W volumes grew by a flattish 2 percent to 2,87,985 units from 2,81,711 units a year ago.

Eicher Motors reported an 18 percent YoY rise in sales, to 73,136 units from 62,155 units a year ago, according to an exchange filing. This was led by sales in models with upto 350cc engine capacity, which saw a 26 percent YoY rise in volumes. Sales in models with engine capacity above 350 cc fell 21 percent YoY.

Bajaj Auto Ltd is ramping up production of its electric scooter Chetak to touch around 10,000 units a month by June, having overcome supply chain constraints as it gradually expands the sales network of the brand, according to a senior company official.

The company plans to have around 150 exclusive outlets for the Chetak electric scooter by September, and is taking a calibrated expansion keeping in mind the uncertainty over the extension of FAME II scheme for promotion of electric vehicles beyond this fiscal.

”We are trying to get to 10,000 (units) by June. It is a supply chain issue,” Bajaj Auto Executive Director Rakesh Sharma said here on the sidelines of opening of an exclusive Chetak showroom. The company has reached 5,000 units at present and next month, it will try to get to 7,000 units, he said, adding after that Bajaj Auto would assess how the demand is coming to plan future production roadmap.

Sharma said the company had faced problems earlier due to over dependence on certain vendors, who could not supply some parts. ”That we sorted out by the first quarter and it is giving us some confidence…,” he said. Bajaj Auto Urbanite Business Unit President Eric Vas said the company had suffered production constraints due to the transition to the new battery norm AIS 156B, which came into effect from April 1 for enhanced safety.

The constraints have been resolved to a large extent. ”So, we think we will be back to normal production, in terms of production meeting our requirements of the number of stores we are opening possibly by middle to end of May and after that it is purely driven by what we want, we will get,” he added.

At present, the waiting period for Chetak is around 20 to 25 days, Vas said, adding, from May onwards, it would come down to three to five days. On network expansion, Vas said Chetak sales network currently spans across 88 towns through 105 dealerships.

”By September, we hope to have around 150 exclusive outlets in 120 towns,” he said, adding, the company would look at the market and calibrate again for expansion beyond these. Vas said a key factor for taking such an approach is the uncertainty over the continuation of the FAME II scheme, which was extended till March 31, 2024.

”One of the things which we should have better clarity on sometime by September is what happens to FAME II after March (2024). I think a lot of things depend on that output,” he said. When asked if FAME II scheme should be continued, he said the industry is of the opinion that cost of EVs will go up significantly if the subsidy is stopped and manufacturers could not afford to fully absorb the increased prices.

”I think prices will go up. It will stop the growth of the industry and that is why I’m saying we (Bajaj Auto) need to calibrate very carefully when we’re opening (new stores for Chetak),” Vas said.

When asked about the outlook for fiscal 2023-24, Sharma said, if the supply holds out and the demand keeps picking up, along with the network expansion, Bajaj Auto could touch a total of 1 lakh electric two-wheelers between Chetak and what it supplies to electric mobility platform Yulu.",563,-0.2930784424146016

KR Choksey's research report on Bajaj Auto

For Q4FY23, Bajaj Auto reported Operating revenue of INR 89,292 mn (+12.0% YoY/ -4.2% QoQ). The underlying volumes for Q4FY23 were lower by 12.0% YoY/ 12.6% QoQ. ASP increased by 27.3% YoY/ 9.5% QoQ. Despite the YoY drop in volumes, revenue growth was supported by favourable FX realization, judicious price hikes, and a better product mix. Consolidated EBITDA was INR 16,572 mn (+21.8% YoY/ -5.7% QoQ). EBITDA margin improved by 150 bps YoY but declined by 30 bps QoQ to 18.6%. Bajaj Auto has started reporting Share of associates only on a half-yearly basis, leading to non-comparability of Net Profit on a QoQ and YoY basis. Reported PAT for Q4FY23 was INR 17,047 mn (+11.7% YoY/ +15.8% QoQ). Adjusting for exceptional items, Adj. PAT growth was 40.8% YoY/ 15.8% QoQ, which is still influenced by the difference in reporting of share of associates. For FY23, Adj. PAT was INR 60,602 mn, which is a growth of 13.3% YoY.

Outlook

We assign a P/E multiple of 17.0x on FY25E EPS of INR 279.8 to arrive at a target price of INR 4,756/share (INR 4,564/share previously); implying an upside potential of 8.2% from the CMP. Considering the uncertainty of the timing of exports recovery, possible stagnancy of margins, and the run-up in share price, we reduce our recommendation to “ACCUMULATE” from the “BUY” rating on the shares of Bajaj Auto.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto (BJAUT) reported better-than-estimated EBITDA margin of 19.3% (nine-quarter high) driven by better product mix. However, we do not expect any material margin expansion in the coming quarters as this largely reflects the benefits of Fx and improved mix. Over the next two quarters, BJAUT has three catalysts for growth: a) Chetak EV ramp-up to 10k/month from Jun’23, b) Triumph product launch, and c) potential recovery in exports.



Outlook

We raise our FY24E/FY25E EPS by 7%/8% to factor in a sustained recovery in domestic 2W/3W volumes and better product mix. We reiterate our Neutral rating with a TP of INR4,400 (based on 16x Mar’25E Consol. EPS).

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto (BJAUT) reported better-than-expected performance, with an improved product mix leading to a significant rise in ASPs and, consequently, healthy margins. For Q4FY23, BJAUT’s revenue grew by 12% YoY (-4% QoQ) to Rs89bn (Emkay est.: Rs83.8bn; Consensus est.: Rs85.7bn), above estimates mainly due to strong beat in realizations. Volumes declined by 12% YoY (-13% QoQ) to 0.86mn units, while ASP grew by 27% YoY to Rs103,810/unit (9% QoQ). Product mix improved notably with higher 3W and >125cc motorcycle share as well as lower 2W exports (to African markets). EBITDA grew by 26% YoY to Rs17.2bn (Emkay est.: Rs16bn; Consensus est.: Rs15.7bn), above estimates, owing to better-than-expected revenue and gross margin expansion. EBITDA margin grew by 220bps YoY to 19.3%, led by gross margin expansion of 210bps to 30.2%. Other income declined by 10% to Rs2.6bn. Depreciation grew by 447% to Rs157mn. PAT grew by 17% to Rs14.3bn (Emkay est.: Rs13.8bn; Consensus est.: Rs13.5bn), above estimates due to higher operating profit. BJAUT announced Rs140/share as dividend (71% payout for FY23).

Outlook

Despite expectations of increased activity in the E2W/E-3W segment, poor execution in the domestic ICE-2W segment over the past decade limits confidence. Triumph’s launch, though positive, would not swing the needle much for BJAUT. Nevertheless, risk-reward at current valuations of 19.1x/16.4x its FY24E/FY25E PER, with a dividend yield of 4.7%/5.5%, appears balanced. We maintain our HOLD rating on BJAUT (refer to our recent update; Valuations attractive amid growth revival).

LKP Research's research report on Bajaj Auto

BAL posted solid margin performance in Q4 despite the challenges in the exports business. Going forward, we believe export volumes have bottomed out as demand is improving now month on month (however availability of USD remains an uncertain area), while domestic 2W volumes should continue their strong run. We also expect a strong traction coming from new launches which would drive overall demand. >125cc segment has provided new identity to BAL. Solid performance of premium Pulsar models, KTM bikes and expected launch of Triumph this year should all provide the required fillip to both volumes and margins. On the exports front, markets like ASEAN and Latam markets should be able to somewhat offset weaknesss in Africa. With 2W Chetak expanding its coverage and fetching good response, we believe Chetak to add to the numbers substantially in H2 of FY24. The withdrawal of FAME subsidy remains a concern for the EV 2Ws, but we believe it to impact BAL little. 3W performance was robust in Q4, touching new highs, on CNG success. EV 3W launch should further aid the business. Favorable product mix and currency movement, neutral RM prices, price hikes planned and prudent cost management should assist margins in the ensuing quarters. With strong balance sheet, robust return ratios, hefty dividend yield of 3.3% in FY23 and zero financial leverage, we believe the stock looks attractive at 15.1x FY 25E earnings.

Outlook

We therefore maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 4,696 (at 16.5x FY 25E earnings).

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Auto

We believe export volumes have reached their bottom and would pick up once dollar availability situation improves in the overseas market. The strategic partnership with Triumph would help it to garner additional market share in the premium motorcycle segment. The stock is currently trading at a P/E multiple of 16.4x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.9x its FY2025 estimates.

Outlook

We maintain Buy on Bajaj Auto Limited (BAL) with a revised PT of Rs. 4,782, factoring its continued focus on EBITDA margin and an entry into the electric three-wheeler segment.

HDFC Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s Q4 PAT at INR14.3bn came in ahead of our estimate of Rs13.2bn, led by better-than-expected margins. Margin beat was largely driven by higher spares and a better-than-expected export mix (sharp decline in African exports). Management indicated that although retail demand in key export markets is likely to have bottomed out, the lack of availability of USD for trade remains the major factor hampering export visibility. The domestic motorcycle industry continues to see demand weakness and management is now guiding for 6-8% volume growth over next few quarters for the industry. Also, we believe that once volumes revive, even the current favorable mix will normalize. This coupled with the slight under-recovery of the recent cost inflation is likely to keep margins under pressure from here on.

Outlook

At 17.6x FY25E, the stock appears expensive. Reiterate Reduce with revised TP of INR 4,028 (earlier INR 3,857); as we roll forward to FY25 earnings (from Sep 24 earlier)—core business valued at an unchanged 16x multiple.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

We marginally increase our FY24/25 EPS estimates by 1-3% to factor in higher ASPs from increase in EV volumes, partially offset by cut in volumes for exports. BJAUT reported better than expected 4Q revenue, while EBITDA margin was largely in line with our above street estimates. Margins expanded helped by significant inventorisation benefit, higher spare mix and better vehicle mix, offset by lower operating leverage. Concerns on the export volumes continue (~50% of sales) with BJAUT delaying the recovery timelines led by uncertainty on unavailability of USD and lower affordability. Also, lack of market share gains in the domestic motorcycles market over the last few years, and increase in competition could lead to further pricing actions.

Outlook

However, we expect BJAUT’s domestic premium segment volumes to grow (similar to the industry) helped by premiumisation trends and fast ramp-up of EVs could make us turn constructive on the stock. Maintain ‘HOLD’ with a target price of Rs 4,130 (Rs 4,020 earlier) at 16x Mar-25E EPS.

Bajaj Auto on April 25 reported consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 2023 at Rs 1,704.74 crore, up 11.70 percent from Rs 1,526.16 crore in the same quarter last year.

Revenue from operation came in at Rs 8,929.23 crore, registering a growth of 11.96 percent from Rs 7,974.84 crore in the year-ago quarter, the company said in a regulatory filing.

The board of directors of the company has recommended a dividend at the rate Rs 140 per share.

The company's EBITDA maintained its strong run, growing 26 percent YoY to Rs 1,718 crore, with margin accretion of 220 bps to 19.3 percent. Sequentially, across quarters, price realisation and material costs held flat with favourable mix driving the slight uptick, it said.

Bajaj Auto said domestic motorcycle sales continued to deliver well, buoyed by the strong performance of the Pulsar portfolio while three-wheeler sales crossed the 1 lakh units milestone for the first-time since the pandemic, reflecting the strong rebound to pre-Covid levels for Bajaj.

The biggest concern for Bajaj, its exports progressively worsened given the deteriorating macros across overseas markets.

Weakness in exports and an overall fall in volumes is expected to weigh on Bajaj Auto’s revenue and profit figures in the quarter ending March.

Analysts believe that revenue and profit in Q4FY23 will see an increase from a year ago, but they expect the topline and bottomline to shrink sequentially. A poll of estimates given by four brokerages show that they expect revenue and net profit to increase year-on-year (YoY) by 3.7-6 percent and 6.9-19.8 percent, respectively, while they expect the figures to reduce by 9.3-11.5 percent and 7.4-11.6 percent, respectively quarter on quarter.

“BAL (Bajaj Auto) margin to decline QoQ due to weak exports mix and 13% decline in volumes QoQ,” wrote analysts at HDFC Securities.

Analysts at Axis Securities also expect revenue to decline over the period on lower volumes and added that the operating profit and operating margins will fall QoQ on lower operating leverage and almost flat raw-material cost movement.

Revenue for the quarter ending March is expected to be between Rs 8,200 and Rs 8,400 crore and net profit may come around a little more than Rs 1,300 crore. In the year-ago quarter, the company’s revenue stood at Rs 7,975 crore and its adjusted net profit (adjusted for exception income of Rs 315 crore) at around Rs 1,154 crore. A quarter ago, the comapny's revenue was Rs 9,315 crore and its net profit was around Rs 1,492 crore.

The year-on-year improvement in revenue is likely to be driven by higher average selling price with a higher share of three-wheelers (3Ws) in the product mix, noted analysts at Axis Securities. The company’s ASP has gone up by 21 percent YoY, and the share of three-wheelers in the product mix has risen by 400 bps YoY to 16 percent.

2W demand pick up

Jefferies, which has a ‘buy’ call on the stock, believes that the company will be a key beneficiary of the 2W demand recovery in the domestic and export markets. They expect EPS to post 22 percent CAGR over FY23-25 and pointed out that the stock is trading at valuations (16x FY24E and 14x FY25E) lower than its 10-year average of 17x. The analysts also forecast that volumes will see a 15 per cent CAGR over FY23-25, even though the company has been losing market share in premium and mass segments.

Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj believes that India cannot develop a sustainable future with subsidies in any sector. In an interview with CNBC TV-18, he asserted that subsidies obscure reality and hinder innovation, and therefore, should not be considered a long-term solution for the future of electric vehicles (EVs) in this country.

Bajaj argued that the future of EVs in India must be based on a sound strategy, rather than relying on subsidies.

He believes that subsidies are not a strategy and, instead, disrupt strategic planning. His comments support the Indian government's plans to not extend the FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) subsidy scheme beyond March 2024.

He pointed out that certain segments of the population receive unfair advantages through subsidies, and such subsidies can lead to market distortions. As an example, he noted that it is not sustainable for individuals to receive a Rs 2 lakh subsidy on a Rs 20 lakh car.

A parliamentary committee on electric vehicles (EVs) has suggested the government extend benefits under the FAME India scheme by two more years. The panel claims failure to extend the scheme will slow down the pace of EV adoption, The Times of India reported.

FAME scheme was launched by the Centre in 2011 as part of the National Mission on Electric Mobility. The incentive ends in March 2024.",227,-0.9998680353164673

Shares of Bajaj Auto climbed on April 11 after the company said it has taken over the British bike maker Triumph Motorcycles’ India sales and marketing operations.

The development is part of the strategic partnership between the two companies announced in 2020 under which they planned to collaborate to create a new range of mid-sized Triumph Motorcycles. This is the third key partnership for Bajaj Auto to manufacture higher CC bikes apart from KTM & Husqvarna.

Following the announcement, the stock rose 1.32 percent to Rs 4,121 as of 10.35 am on BSE.

The lukewarm response of the market is in line with analysts’ opinions. They are in wait-and-watch mode before taking any actionable calls due to this partnership.

“Given Triumph being a premium brand with higher CC (i.e. >600 cc) offerings and ~1,000 units sales for FY23, we await more affordable offerings from the partnership adapting to the needs of the domestic market in the mid-weight category, which is currently dominated by Royal Enfield,” said analysts at ICICIdirect.

As part of the partnership, the current 15 Triumph Motorcycle dealerships will be managed by Bajaj Auto but will remain exclusive to the brand and continue to operate in line with Triumph's global standards, the statement said.

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said it has maintained an ‘overweight’ rating on the target at Rs 4,486 per share which underlined that the dealership will be expanded to 120 in two years.

Bajaj Auto Ltd and British bike maker Triumph Motorcycles on Monday said they have completed transfer of the latter's India sales and marketing operations to the Indian firm.

The two companies would also be launching a jointly developed mid-sized range of bikes later this year.

The development is part of the strategic partnership between the two companies announced in 2020 under which they planned to collaborate to create a new range of mid-sized Triumph Motorcycles.

The partnership offers Triumph an opportunity to further build their business as the portfolio expands, Bajaj Auto Executive Director Rakesh Sharma said in a statement.

""We will also leverage our formidable distribution network to rapidly expand the exclusive Triumph stores in India in preparation for the soon-to-be-launched, exciting new motorcycles,"" he added.

As part of the partnership, the current 15 Triumph Motorcycle dealerships will be managed by Bajaj Auto but will remain exclusive to the brand and continue to operate in line with Triumph's global standards, the statement said.

""This is an important partnership for Triumph which continues to progress very well...We are excited about the growth that we can now achieve through our partnership with Bajaj Auto Ltd, here in India...,"" Triumph Motorcycles Chief Commercial Officer Paul Stroud said.

The two companies said they are planning to launch new mid-sized Triumph motorcycles, which have been jointly developed and will be produced at Bajaj Auto's Chakan plant in Maharashtra.

""This new range of mid-sized Triumph motorcycles will create a new entry point into the Triumph brand around the world...,"" the statement said.

Bajaj Auto plans to open Triumph dealerships in over 120 cities in the next two years in line with Triumph's global standards, it added.

The company already operates four distinct and exclusive dealership networks for its KTM, Bajaj Motorcycles, Chetak Electric and Bajaj three-wheelers range of products.",343,0.9996679027875265

Yulu, a shared electric mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) player, is working on rolling out a low-speed e-scooter for individual users. This is part of the plan of the company, which caters in large part to daily commuters (via Yulu Miracle) and last-mile delivery executives (through Yulu Dex), to begin selling its products directly to end-users.

“A number of our customers have reached out to us expressing interest in buying our shared mobility vehicles for personal use. Though the e-scooter will be all-new, it will have a lot of things common with our existing products, as this reduces our R&D costs. We have been thinking about this for a while and will soon come out with a Yulu (product) for personal mobility. We will disclose the relevant details at the appropriate time,” Amit Gupta, Co-founder & Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Yulu, told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interaction.

Yulu’s current Generation 2 and Generation 3 electric vehicles (EVs), which are part of its MaaS fleet, are not available for sale as personal vehicles. The Bangalore-based start-up offers time-based plans for its shared mobility services. For short distances, it offers a pay-per-minute plan of Rs 2 per minute, while heavy users can use the weekly rental plans, which start at Rs 229 per day, and go on till Rs 1,200 per week.

“Even though we have made a lot of improvements in our shared mobility-specific vehicles, we will be fine-tuning them further to make them user-friendly for consumers who wants to make an outright purchase,” added Gupta.

On the business model, Gupta said, “Earlier, it was a ‘scooter-as-a-service’ offering. Now it will be a battery-as-a-service (BaaS) offering. While the consumer can buy the vehicle, for the battery he can go for the subscription model. It will be very similar to what Gogoro is doing in Taiwan.”

Gupta did not disclose details about the price of the vehicle or the rates of the service offering.

It may be recalled that Yulu has joined hands with Bajaj Auto to roll out the third generation of its e-scooters Miracle GR and DeX GR for retail and commercial users, respectively.

Yulu, which has completed more than 200 million kilometres in distance travelled, is looking to deploy around one lakh Generation 2 and Generation 3 shared EVs (both B2B and B2C consumers), largely in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru by the end of 2023.

Early this week, Yulu announced a tie-up with food delivery app Zomato for use of the Yulu DeX EV for intra-city deliveries. The e-scooter rental firm said that around 25,000-35,000 Yulu DeX EV will be given to delivery partners onboarded on Zomato’s platform for last-mile deliveries, on custom-made rental plans.

Yulu has raised $118.2 million till date. Of this, a sizeable chunk came out of the $82-million Series B funding round led by Magna International Inc. in September 2022. Yulu is now looking to raise funds via debt. It would need another $500 million in the next three years, to fund its plans to deploy one million vehicles in the next three-four years and commission over 500 battery charging and swapping stations in the next 12 months. In November last year, Yulu received confirmation for a $9-million loan from US-based Development Finance Corporation (DFC).

“Unlike a typical OEM which builds and then sells vehicles to customers, we pay to the OEM (Bajaj Auto) upfront, and then get paid by the customers over a period of one-and-a-half years to two years. Assuming that a vehicle costs, on average, $500 per piece, and the company deploys one million vehicles over the next three to four years, we will require approximately $500 million. Most of this money will be in the form of debt capital,"" revealed Gupta.

Meanwhile, Yulu posted a turnover of Rs 30 crore in financial year 2021-22 (FY22). For FY23, the company is looking to record 8X growth.",647,0.9861811399459839

The Nifty has made a double bottom formation in the downward-sloping channel formation. The market is showing signs of a bullish reversal, and 17,450–17,500 is an immediate target zone. On the downside, 17,290 will be the first support level, while 17,200 will be a strong support level.

Bank Nifty is outperforming but the trendline resistance at 41,200 is an immediate hurdle. The next hurdle beyond this will be 41,700. On the downside, this will be an immediate support level while 40,200 will be a key support level.

We have seen a short-covering move, and there is still scope for further short-covering, but the market needs fresh longs with the support of institutional investors. In the near term, RBI policy, macroeconomic data, and Q4 earnings are key events that will dictate the direction of the market from here.

Here are three buy calls for short term:

Apar Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,600 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,350 | Target: Rs 3,100 | Return: 19 percent

The counter is in a classical uptrend and made an all-time high closing on the daily chart. It has witnessed the breakout of a long consolidation of two months with strong volume. The structure of the counter still looks lucrative as a cluster of moving averages formed a base at around Rs 2,200 levels.

The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) is also positively poised, whereas MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is supporting the current strength.

On the higher side, Rs 2,690 acts as susceptible levels; above this, we can expect a long move towards Rs 3,100+ in the shorter to longer timeframe, while on the lower side, Rs 2,350 serves as an important support during any correction.

Aptech: Buy | LTP: Rs 372 | Stop-Loss: Rs 340 | Target: Rs 424 | return: 14 percent

The counter has witnessed a breakout of an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern formation on the daily chart, and the structure also looks lucrative as it trades above its all-important moving averages.

On the weekly chart, it is forming the right shoulder of an inverse H&S pattern formation. Rs 380–390 will act as a neckline and trendline resistance zone; above this, we can expect a run-up towards Rs 420 levels in the near term. On the downside, Rs 340 is an important support level.

Bajaj Auto: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,994 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,860 | Target: Rs 4,234 | return: 6 percent

The counter is in classical bullish momentum and forming higher highs and higher lows formation on the daily chart. It also witnessed a breakout of a triangle formation with huge volume. MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is supporting the current strength, whereas the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) is also positively poised. The structure of the counter is impressive, as it is trading above all important moving averages.

On the upside, if Rs 4,000 is an immediate psychological hurdle, we can expect a move towards the Rs 4,200+ levels. On the downside, Rs 3,860 will act as a strong demand zone.

Product mix, margin, and market share will be key drivers for auto stocks in FY24, said a Morgan Stanley report released after the March auto sales numbers.

Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, and Tata Motors are the analysts’ preferred picks in the original-equipment manufacturers (OEM) space. Besides these three stocks, Ashok Leyland and Mahindra and Mahindra are two other stocks that MS is overweight on.

March volumes indicate an acceleration in EV adoption and improving export numbers, going by MS’ report. Auto exports, which had been declining since early 2022 due to macro challenges, seemed to be improving. “During March, the exports run rate improved sequentially – TVS saw 41% MoM growth in exports (down 32% YoY) against the last 10 years'average of 6% MoM. MSIL (Maruti Suzuki) and Eicher also saw sharp sequential export pickups,” wrote the analysts.

Passenger vehicles saw 10 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, in line with estimates; and two-wheeler volumes rose by 13 percent YoY, with E2W retail growing at a much faster 73 percent YoY when compared to ICE 2W’s volume growth of 23 percent YoY.

Market penetration of electric vehicles, which is the total number of e-vehicles registered to the total number of vehicles registered, has gone up significantly and more so in the four-wheeler space. Market penetration of E4W (electric four wheeler) has shot up to 2.5 percent from 1 percent in January 2023, while that of E2W (electric 2W) has risen steadily to 5.9 percent from 5.2 percent in February. For FY23, E2W penetration was 4.6 percent.

The analysts maintain that E2W makers will scale up in 2023 and consolidate in 2024. They noted that the market share of legacy OEMs have improved from 6% in March 2022to 25% in March 2023(TVS at 20%, Bajaj at 5% and Hero at 0.1%).

Medium to heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) sales remained strong, with domestic retail sales growing at 29% YoY. “Growth was driven by pre-buying due to the applicability of BS VI-2 emission norms in April 2023,” wrote the analysts, adding that has already announced a price hike of 5% in its CV portfolio.

Continuing its winning streak for a third day in a row, Bajaj Auto shares gained over 2 percent in the morning trade on April 3, with the automaker reportedly set to introduce its first electric three-wheeler this month.

The product will be launched for both the cargo and passenger vehicle segments, but will be made available in a limited number of cities initially, Hindu Businessline has reported.

“It will be a limited launch as we want to take it step by step, as it is very important to give a stable product to the commercial user,” Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director of Bajaj Auto, was quoted as saying by The Hindu .

Foreign brokerage firm JPMorgan's analysts are optimistic about the company’s EV push and expect launches in this vertical to result in a re-rating of the stock.

“Bajaj Auto will be launching several 2W EV models in the coming quarters and has also indicated supply chain restructuring which has reduced costs and improved availability to 10K units/month. They will also launch their 3W EV by 1QFY24,” they wrote in a recent report.

Bajaj Auto's dwindling export numbers, which has been a key pain point for the company, is expected to bottom out soon.

JPMorgan expects a potential recovery from Q2 FY24. It has set a target price of Rs 4,400 on the stock, indicating more than 10 percent upside.

The company is yet to announce its March 2023 sales numbers.

Demand in consumption-driven auto categories seem to dull, going by March volume estimates from the brokerage Nomura.

Their dealer surveys showed that “passenger vehicle (PV) enquiries/ footfalls have slowed down sharply and waiting periods have reduced further. Except for few key models, most others have a waiting period only for select variants… suggesting slower demand outlook”. The brokerage, in its report on March volumes, estimated the month’s PV registrations to be 2,84,500 units, which would be a one per cent drop year-on-year (YoY). Last March, registrations for the segment totalled 2,86,100 units, which was a 4 per cent YoY growth.

In two-wheelers (2Ws), “demand remained steady but without any sign of improvement”. The brokerage estimated 2W registrations to touch 12,89,500 units in March 2023, which would be a zero per cent increase YoY. The registrations count was 12,86,000 units last March, which was a 7 per cent YoY growth. Nomura also noted the drop in waiting period for Royal Enfield’s (RE) models and saw this as a weakness in demand.

In commercial vehicles (CVs), light commercial vehicles (LCVs) sales “seem to be subdued with no major pick up even for pre-buying of vehicles”, the report stated. LCVs are mostly used to transport consumer goods over short distances or for last-mile connectivity.

The report noted that the demand for MHCVs was high and attributed it to a likely price hike (3-5%) and technology change after the implementation of Bharat Stage VI Phase-2 from April 1, 2023. It added, “We note that demand is strong in the infrastructure-related segments, but not equally strong in the haulage and auto carrier segments (shift to rail transport may also have impacted demand, in our view).”

Kotak Institutional Equities has maintained a reduced rating on Hero MotoCorp Ltd and lowered its target price to Rs 2,400 from Rs 2,600 earlier.

This can be attributed to the launch of Honda's competitively priced 100cc motorcycle in the entry-level segment, which may result in Hero MotoCorp experiencing a further decline in its market share.

Kotak also expresses concern over the company's failure to make headway in the scooter and premium motorcycle segments, despite releasing newer models.

The brokerage house predicts a gradual rebound in the volume of entry-level two-wheelers because of three factors: (1) a persistent rise in the cost of ownership, (2) elevated inflation levels, and (3) sluggish demand in rural areas.

Kotak predicts that Hero MotoCorp's volume of entry-level motorcycles will continue to face challenges due to two factors: (1) ongoing sluggishness in rural demand and (2) the entry of Honda Motorcycle with its Shine 100 model in the 100cc motorcycle segment, which has been priced competitively at an ex-showroom rate of Rs 64,900, 3 percent lower than Hero HF Deluxe. Additionally, Honda Shine 100 is OBD-II compliant while Hero HF Deluxe will see a price increase from April 2023 onwards to meet OBD-II norms, creating a larger price differential between the two models.

""Overall, we expect Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto to lose market share given aggressive pricing of Shine 100. We are building Hero MotoCorp’s

below-125cc domestic motorcycle segment volumes to grow by 5 percent on-year in FY2024,"" Kotak report said.

Hero MotoCorp's share in the domestic motorcycle segment has fallen from 53 percent in FY16 to 45.8 percent in nine months ended FY23, which is a cause for concern. Although the company has managed to hold its ground in the Northern region, its market share has been declining steadily, especially in South India, Maharashtra, and Bihar.

Additionally, the contribution from the top three states to Hero MotoCorp's domestic volumes has risen from 35 percent in FY2016 to 44 percent in 9MFY23, indicating a weakening brand reputation in the domestic market.

""We have cut our FY2023-25 EPS estimates by 3-7 percent on lower volume and EBITDA margin assumptions. We remain concerned on demand recovery in the over-125cc motorcycle segment given (1) persistent price increases taken by the OEMs and (2) weak rural demand. Also, increase in competitive intensity in 100cc motorcycle segment with the launch of Honda Shine 100 may result in further market share loss.

The 'reduce' tag stays with a revised FV of Rs2,400 (Rs2,600 earlier), valuing the company at 12.5X FY2025 standalone EPS adjusted for subsidiaries valuation, the Kotak report added.",440,-0.7963838994503021

In yet another large deal in Mumbai, Bajaj Auto Chairman Niraj Bajaj has bought a sea-facing triplex apartment from Macrotech Developers in posh Malabar Hill in Mumbai for Rs 252.5 crore, documents shared by IndexTap.com showed.

The agreement to sell was registered on March 13, 2023.

The total area of the three apartments is 18,008 sq ft (carpet area is 12624 sq ft) and comes with eight car parking slots, the documents showed.

The stamp duty paid for the deal is Rs 15.15 crore, the documents showed. The project is called Lodha Malabar Palaces by the Sea that comprises 31 floors.

Local brokers said that this is a redevelopment luxury project launched by Lodha recently where the minimum size of the unit is around 9,000 sq ft. Each apartment is priced above Rs 100 crore, they said.

There was no response from the builder or the buyer.

Last month, Welspun Group chairman BK Goenka has purchased a penthouse for Rs 230 crore only a few days after 28 housing units worth Rs 1,238 crore were bought by family members and associates of Radhakrishna Damani, founder of Avenue Supermarts that runs the D’Mart chain of stores, in Mumbai last week.

The price Goenka paid for purchasing the penthouse in the same project as Damani had made it probably the country’s single most expensive sale of an apartment.

While Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland are counting on electric variants of Ace and Dost Small Commercial Vehicles (SCVs), respectively, numerous Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) like Bajaj Auto, Piaggio, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M), Omega Seiki Mobility (OSM), Euler Motors, etc., are training their sights on medium -speed electric cargo or passenger vehicles.

In auto industry parlance, there are Level 5 (or simply L5) category of electric three wheelers, a segment above electric autorickshaws or electric carts (L3 category). To put it another way, it is a three wheeled motor vehicle with maximum speed exceeding 25kmph or motor power exceeding 0.25kW. Its Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) is limited to 1,500 KG (excluding the weight of traction batteries).

While close to 25,000 units of such category of E3Ws were retailed last year (as per Vahan Data), industry players are foreseeing 4X growth in 2023 due to wider availability of products across different price points, improved financing by banks for EVs and frugal running costs when compared to ICE 3-wheelers. ICE is short for Internal Combustion Engine.

As per Vahan Data, Mahindra Last Mile Mobility (EV arm of M&M) was the market leader in the L5 E3W category during FY 2022 at 3,295 units, followed by Piaggio at the second spot at 3,013 units and Omega Seiki in the third position at 815 units. During the same period, Kinetic Green Energy came in 4th at 326 units, followed by Euler Motors in the 5th position at 305 units and Altigreen Propulsion Labs in the 6th position at 161 units.

On an overall basis, the Total Industry Volumes (TIVs) of E3Ws stood at 275,000 units, which included 25,000 units for cargo applications and 250,000 units for passenger applications. However, these numbers also include vehicles sold on lease, rent or subscription.

OEMs at breakneck speed with rollouts, capex

Bajaj Auto, which is the largest three-wheeler manufacturer in the country, has confirmed that it is on course to rolling out an electric variant in the near term

“We are readying the dealerships and are training the manpower. Hopefully, we soon we will be dispatching the three-wheelers. We have very good brands and have a very good understanding of the requirements of the customer. And hopefully, will win the trust of the customer and on the basis of the superior product which we deliver,” Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director of Bajaj Auto, told Moneycontrol.

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) recently announced that it will be making an investment of Rs 1,000 crore over a period of eight years in expanding its facility at Zaheerabad, Telangana. The new production line has been earmarked for making electric three-wheelers for passenger travel and cargo, and cargo four-wheelers. At present, its three-wheelers (ICE and EV) are made in Bangalore, Zaheerabad and Haridwar.

“We have aggressive growth plans in this segment as electric three-wheelers and four-wheelers (cargo) are growing at a much faster rate than the electric passenger vehicle segment,” Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director, auto and farm sector, M&M, said at the Q3 FY23 results announcement. M&M started its electric 3-wheeler journey with the e-Alfa Mini in 2017, followed by the successful launch of the Electric Treo, Treo Yaari, Treo Zor, and e-Alfa Cargo.

Piaggio, Omega Seiki, Euler Motors

Piaggio India has widened its offerings by launching Ape E-City FX Max in the passenger segment at Rs 3.25 lakh, and Ape E-Xtra FX Max in the cargo segment starting at Rs 3.43 lakh (both ex-showroom Pune). While a fixed battery solution is available for both new models, a swappable battery solution for the new FX Max will also be available soon. Piaggio India did not want to participate in this story.

EV maker Omega Seiki Mobility (OSM), which launched Stream for rural markets last year, is also on course to rolling out Stream City for intra and inter-city applications. To be priced in the range of Rs. 2.5-4.5 lakh, the top-end variant will have a range of 400 km per charge.

“In 2022 (calendar year), we enjoyed 20 percent market share in the electric cargo vehicle space (L-5 Category). In 2023, we are expecting the L5 three-wheeler market (ICE+EV) to grow to 350,000 units out of which 50,000 will be cargo and 300,000 should be the passenger version. We are expecting to gain OSM’s overall marketshare to 25 percent for electric cargo and 3-5 percent for passenger versions. We will also be aggressively getting into electric passenger vehicle this year,” Uday Narang, Chairman of OSM, told Moneycontrol.

Faridabad-based Euler Motors, which had introduced its cargo three-wheeler, HiLoad EV in October 2021, has an orderbook of 10,000 units. The EV startup, which has delivered 2,500 units so far, is anticipating 7X growth in sales during this financial year.

“If you look at the entire pan-India penetration, the year 2025 will be the tipping point of the Electric (Light) Commercial vehicles industry where we will see roughly 40-50 percent contribution from electric variants,” said Saurav Kumar, founder and CEO of Euler Motors.

Rapid expansion

According to credit rating agency ICRA, the electric three-wheeler market in India is growing at a rapid pace, with volumes of more than 310,000 units reported during the first 10 months of FY2023. However, a key proportion of this pertains to the unorganised e-rickshaw segment, whereas electric auto sales were less than 20,000 units during this period, as per ICRA.

ICRA maintains that the market is fast expanding, with robust growth visible from the e-3W sales of 180,000 units and e-auto sales of 10,000 units reported during full year FY2022. In fact, the domestic three-wheeler market has emerged as one of the fastest adopters of electric vehicles, surpassing the domestic 2W, Passenger Vehicle and bus segments, ICRA says.

“Apart from the lower running costs, other factors supporting the adoption of E3Ws include the favorable policy push (in terms of subsidy support, exemptions on registration fees, road taxes, permit requirements etc.), improvement in public charging infrastructure etc.,” said Sruthi Thomas, Assistant Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA.

According to Moneycontrol's Analysts' Call Tracker, these companies were among 10 stocks with the maximum contrarian calls over the month. A contrarian call is when an analyst recommends buying a stock although its price is falling, or the other way round.

In January, Bajaj Auto gained about 6 percent, while Tata Motors and M&M added 16.5 percent and 10.5 percent, respectively.

The sharp gains in the first month of 2023 gave investors more room to book profits in February, when weak market sentiment resurfaced due to renewed concerns that the US Federal Reserve may keep hiking interest rates to rein in sticky inflation.

EV focus

For Bajaj Auto, another major drag in February came after the company cut production at its export-focused plants by up to 25 percent. As a result, the stock shed 6.23 percent in February.

However, analysts remain hopeful about the company, as reflected by the total of 34 ‘buy’ calls by brokerages.

“Even though the key concern for Bajaj Auto is its weak exports that are likely to recover only in the second half of FY24, an easing of supply disruptions and the company's increased focus on the electric vehicle segment is expected to support the automaker,” a research analyst covering the automobile sector said.

Sales of two-wheelers in the 125 cc and above category are also likely to grow on the back of premiumisation, which will likely offset the weak rural demand for entry-level 100 cc two-wheelers, analysts noted.

For Tata Motors, sales volumes at luxury arm Jaguar and Land Rover are expected to jump with the reopening of China, one of its key markets, and easing semiconductor supplies, according to Varun Baxi, Analyst at Antique Stock Broking.

With the recovery in volumes for JLR, Baxi is of the view that debt for Tata Motors will also go down, strengthening its financials and turning the company into one of the best bets within the automobile sector.

Additionally, analysts are of the view that a ramp-up in electric vehicle sales will help expand margins for Tata Motors. The optimism was spread across the Street as ‘buy’ calls for the stock increased to 27 from 25 over February.

Sentiment was positive for M&M as the company is expected to reap the benefits of a strong recovery in sales of sports utility vehicles.

The analyst noted that consistent month-on-month rise in SUV sales is testament to the robust recovery in the segment and M&M’s strong position.

Additionally, the company's plan to raise production capacity of its latest SUVs by 70 percent from current levels by the third quarter of FY24 on the back of resilient demand and a growing order book is a major growth driver, the analyst said.

Along with SUVs, the recovery in tractor sales is likely to continue for another year despite a high base, which is seen driving growth for M&M, Baxi said.",516,0.7266489505767822

Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL), which recently introduced the Chetak Premium 2023 Edition, is going full throttle in the e-scooter segment. The Pune-based automaker is working on another variant of the Chetak e-scooter and looking to quadruple e-scooter sales. However, the company has not yet firmed up plans to come up with electric variants of its workhorses Platina or Pulsar in the near to medium term.

Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto, told Moneycontrol, “I feel that electric transition which is happening for EV business is first happening in the scooter format because of its shorter distance commute. On the motorcycle front, we are working closely with KTM but those are a very different set of bikes from let's say ‘Platina’ or ‘Pulsar’. Though we are working in that direction and not too much on the commuter side, which we are attacking through the Chetak.” However, he maintained that the automaker is open to the idea in the long term if the market dynamics change.

Sharma’s comments come at a time when multiple EV startups are either developing or working on e-motorcycles to disrupt the ICEV market. Recently, Matter introduced the country’s first geared motorcycle market to take on buyers who opt for Bajaj Pulsar, TVS Apache, etc. It is also working on an electric bike that will be taking on commuter ICE bikes like Bajaj Platina, Hero Splendor, etc.

E-scooter sales target

In the e-scooter segment, BAL is looking to quadruple its monthly sales from 2,500 units per month last year to 10,000 units in the next few months. “From this month itself, you will see the sales going up very smartly. We would have liked it if it was 5,000 units (per month) earlier but this month onwards we are very hopeful of (getting) that number. And in another two to three months, we will be doubling the number. We have also recently expanded our Chetak range and hopefully, by next year, we will be able to expand the Chetak portfolio too.""

Already a market leader in the three-wheeler market, Bajaj Auto is also on course to roll out its maiden electric three-wheeler in the near term. “We are readying dealerships and training the manpower. Hopefully, soon we will be dispatching the three-wheelers. We have very good brands and understanding of the requirements of the customer. And hopefully, we will win the trust of the customer on the basis of the superior product which we deliver.”

Traditional market

Meanwhile, Bajaj Auto has reaffirmed that despite diversifying into electric vehicles it will not reduce its focus on the traditional two-wheeler market. The company will primarily concentrate on introducing products in the 125cc and above segments. “We will consistently launch products in the next 12 months, which will be in that upper segment (of the motorcycle market). By the next financial year, we will be presenting a new Triumph motorbike which we have co-developed with them. Putting all this together, it's a pretty rich pipeline of products under different brands, covering different segments, which would benefit us both domestically and overseas.”

On the projected outlook for this financial year, Sharma said, “Going forward, we are optimistic because the domestic market is on a growth path. I am not saying we are growing rapidly we're growing in single digits, which is welcome. And I am hoping that in another six months’ time, things will stabilise internationally. I am hoping that the topline will perform much better than last year. And much better than the industry and ahead of the last financial year.”",596,0.9999995231628418

Motilal Oswal's research report on Bajaj Auto

We met with the management of Bajaj Auto (BJAUT) to receive updates on its existing businesses, new growth drivers, and EV plans. While export volumes are bottoming out and likely to recover only from 2QFY24E, its entry in Brazil and the upcoming Triumph launch are the new growth drivers. BJAUT’s EV plans are gathering momentum with the recent launch of low-speed 2Ws under Yulu brand as well as the upcoming e-3W launches. However, the management cautioned on commodity cost inflation that is gaining in strength from the lows of 3QFY23.



Outlook

At 15.4x/14x FY24E/FY25E consolidated EPS, the stock’s valuation fairly reflects the expected recovery as well as the risk from EVs. BJAUT’s dividend yield of 5.0-5.5% should support the stock. We reiterate our Neutral rating with a TP of INR4,150 (premised on 16x Dec-24E consolidated EPS).

Vehicle manufacturer Bajaj Auto has been the top Nifty gainer, up 1.26 percent or Rs 46.95 to Rs 3,770 at 9.50 am on March 8, after financial services company JP Morgan said it is ‘overweight’ on the stock.

On the BSE, Bajaj Auto was up 1.03 percent or Rs 38.50 to Rs 3,762.35 at 9.35 am. In the previous trading session, the share closed down 0.27 percent or Rs 10.00 at Rs 3,723.85.

‘Attractive risk-reward’

JP Morgan said it is ‘overweight’ on Bajaj Auto with a target price of Rs 4,400/share. It further said that the stock could potentially re-rate in 2023 as the company becomes more aggressive on electric vehicles (EVs).

The investment bank pointed to a likely bottoming of exports dip and potential recovery in the second quarter. The auto major’s two and three-wheeler exports have slipped 27 percent year-to-date (YTD).

It added that valuations pose an “attractive risk-reward” and that the stock’s margin may see an uptick due to domestic volumes with a better mix.

Analysts’ view

Bajaj Auto's Q3FY23 performance exceeded street expectations, with its net profit increasing 23 percent YoY to Rs 1,491 crore, while its net operating income grew 3.3 percent YoY to Rs 9,319 crore. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the quarter also improved by 28.2 percent YoY to Rs 1,757 crore.

“The domestic business saw sustained double-digit revenue growth across both, two-wheelers (2W) and three-wheelers (3W). The two-wheeler performance was buoyed particularly by solid 1,25cc+ festive season sales, while three-wheeler volumes surged, leading to its record high market share,” the company said in an exchange filing.

The company gained 2 percent market share in the 1,25cc+ segment in 3QFY23. It is looking to introduce new models and expand platforms for offering a range of choices for customers in the segment.

While exports have been under pressure for a few months now and shipments fell 39 percent year-on-year in December 2022, 47 percent in January 2023 and 38 percent in February 2023. The Street, however, feels that production cuts are 'already factored in' and are 'rational'.",412,0.4550862203944813

In the list of top 10 stock upgrades in the last quarter, Bajaj Auto witnessed the highest number of ‘buy’ calls at 34, up 10 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). Despite export challenges experienced by the company over the last six-odd months, analysts have remained largely optimistic about Bajaj Auto. This is also reflected in the number of ‘hold’ calls on the stock seeing a significant reduction from 17 to 13, down 24 percent QoQ.

The company’s Q3FY23 performance exceeded street expectations, with net profit increasing 23 percent YoY to Rs 1,491 crore, and net operating income growing 3.3 percent YoY to Rs 9,319 crore. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the quarter also improved by 28.2 percent YoY to Rs 1,757 crore.

“The domestic business saw sustained double-digit revenue growth across both, two-wheelers (2W) and three-wheelers (3W). The 2W performance was buoyed particularly by solid 125cc+ festive season sales, while 3W volumes surged, leading to its record high market share,” the company said in an exchange filing.

“This is the highest-ever EBITDA for Bajaj Auto, aided by judicious pricing, better FX realisation and richer product mix. EBITDA margin improved by 366 bps YoY/ 171 bps QoQ to 18.9 percent. The all-time high EBITDA was despite the challenging situation in the export market,” said analysts at KR Choksey, who noted that double-digit revenue growth in the domestic business offset a drop in exports.

“BJAUT’s financial performance has been resilient despite the significant volume drop in the export market, bringing to light once again the benefit of its diversified business operations. BJAUT has continued to maintain its strong market position in the export market, which will benefit the company once the macro issues start subsiding after continuing to be depressed in the near term,” they added.

The company expects the international markets to remain unsettled for the next three to four months.

According to Axis Securities, exports are expected to pick up from May-June 2023. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ call for a target price (TP) of Rs 4,170 and believes Bajaj Auto has a strong presence in the growing 125cc+ segment.

The company gained 2 percent market share in the 125cc+ segment in 3QFY23. It is looking to introduce new models and expand platforms for offering a range of choices for customers in the segment.

“If I divide the market between 125cc and above ― which is now almost 50 percent of the Indian market ― and the lower half, then the upper half is outperforming the lower half by three or four times. So, that is the kind of difference and that is the reason why the 125cc+ segment, which in FY20 was about 45 percent, is now 50 percent. This is the trend we are seeing now,” said Rakesh Sharma, ED, Bajaj Auto, in an interview with ET.

He also added that in a bid to scale up their electric vehicle (EV) offerings the company recently completed restructuring of its supply chain, which gives a visibility of 10,000 units per month of the Chetak, Bajaj Auto’s electric scooter.

""We continue to remain positive on Bajaj Auto's performance going forward, led by its expected market share gains in domestic 125cc+ markets, and benefitting from ramping up the EV business,"" said Sharekhan. The brokerage has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock at a TP of Rs 4,151.

2023-03-06 10:54:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/automobile/bajaj-pulsar-p150-review-sporty-fun-to-ride-with-sharp-looks-10205161.html,"The Pulsar P150’s engine is straight off the one from the N160, just detuned to 150cc and with different tappets.

In late 2001, something very significant happened at Bajaj Auto. For decades, it had been known as a maker of affordable, reliable and frugal mass-market two-wheelers that weren’t particularly exciting to ride or look at. All that changed when the firm decided that an image makeover was necessary – and thus were born the Bajaj Pulsar twins. These two motorcycles succeeded at many things, not least making Bajaj a fun biking brand, and the Pulsar has been the mainstay in its stable since then, through all its iterations.

A brand new Pulsar platform was launched in 2021, and it is on that the P150 is based. Every Pulsar has had its share of niggles but none of those has been in the looks department. Right from the first models, this is a bike that has always looked sporty (sometimes even aggressive), and the P150 carries on that tradition.

It’s somewhat similar to the earlier N160 and even the N250 but it has a new headlight, among other things. There are a series of creases and contours on it, and the way it flows from front to back gives the impression of movement; the build quality, the level of fit and finish and the paint and switch quality are all at par for this segment. Don’t expect it to stand out a mile on the road, though – although the P150 is a very modern-looking bike, it also blends into the crowd as far as design is concerned.

The features

As far as features go, there are enough to keep it competitive. The instrument panel is part-digital, which could be a drawback for those expecting all-digital instruments like in the TVS Apache RTR 160; the Pulsar also doesn’t get Bluetooth. Nevertheless, all the relevant data is presented to you – speed, revs, distance, time, gear position and trip meters. A USB charger is also thrown in, and you get single-channel ABS. The headlight is rather good because it’s an LED projector unit; the daytime running lamps are also LEDs.

The bike has clearly been built to be easy to get on to, with its 790mm seat height, and I had no problem sitting on it comfortably with my feet absolutely flat on the road. You can get either a one-piece handlebar or clip-on units, depending on your preference; the clip-ons will mean that you have to lean forward a bit (I prefer sitting more upright). The foot pegs are set slightly back, so the riding position is largely forward-leaning but still comfortable. The seat is supportive and should be good enough for a couple of hours of non-stop riding; I certainly didn't feel any saddle-soreness.

The engine

The Pulsar P150’s engine is straight off the one from the N160, just detuned to 150cc and with different tappets. The two engines have quite different characteristics, which is a good thing though; Bajaj wouldn't have wanted N160 buyers cribbing that they’re paying more for the same thing. The P150 makes 14.3 bhp at 8500 rpm and 13.5 Nm of torque at 6000 rpm, with a claimed 95 per cent of that torque available from 3500 rpm. I’m willing to believe that claim, since the bike really does feel very tractable from low down in the rev range, with nicely spaced gear ratios to match.

In top gear, the P150 is perfectly content puttering along at low speed, without sputtering, so in slow-moving traffic, you don’t have to keep working the gearbox; the clutch is light and the shift action smooth, which helps. The engine is also refined, with no real vibes to speak of at the handlebar or the foot pegs unless you're really wringing the engine’s neck.

The performance

From as low as 25 kph in top gear, rolling on the throttle results in smooth forward progress, although it isn’t especially rapid. Post around 5000 rpm, the engine becomes more alive and performance is genuinely pleasing, with a top speed of around 117 kph within reach (the sweet spot is at around 90 kph, though, keeping the revs under 7000 rpm).

The P150 hasn’t been made to go touring but I see no reason why you can’t do a Mumbai-Goa run every now and then; the bike is capable of it. It’s a good middle ground, this machine, and Bajaj has clearly taken into account things like everyday usability and practicality. The claimed mileage is around 50 km per litre, which should give you a range of close to 600 km.

The body

The P150 has a steel cradle frame, using the engine as a stressed member. It’s close to the N160 in many ways but has its own chassis, different mounting points and riding geometry. There are 31mm telescopic forks up front and a monoshock at the back, and both units contribute to the P150 having a quality of ride that’s well balanced between softness and some sportiness. Bumps are absorbed well, without you feeling like you’re going to be ejected from your seat, and straight-line stability is confidence-inspiring.

The riding position lends itself well to attacking corners, which the bike also does well; it’s predictable and composed through the bends. The twin disc brakes (one each up front and at the back) are excellent, and the single-channel ABS operates in a non-intrusive way. Contributing to the handling (and fuel efficiency) is the fact that this bike is close to 9 kg lighter than the previous Pulsar 150.

The price

Prices begin at Rs 1.17 lakh for the variant with a single-disc brake while the twin-disc variant with clip-ons comes in at Rs 1.2 lakh (both ex-showroom). This makes a top-spec P150 a shade cheaper than the Pulsar N160 with single-channel ABS, which is a tricky proposition. Do you save that money and opt for better fuel efficiency and everyday usability, or do you part with some extra dough and get a bike that is much more fun to ride? The answer, of course, is entirely dependent on your riding style and requirements.

All told, the P150 is a significant upgrade over the older bike on every parameter, and it remains a Pulsar at heart – it’s sporty, fun to ride, looks sharp and is reasonably priced, making it a worthy addition to the Bajaj stable.",1065,0.9955502152442932

The latest iteration of the electric scooter features new colours, premium materials, and exquisite detailing, making it more appealing to the modern consumer. Bajaj Auto has also initiated bookings for the new scooter, promising to deliver it by April 2023.

Yulu has doubled its fleet in the last three months, and the significant efficiencies in the supply chain are expected to result in cost reductions and improvements in operating metrics and overall financials.

S Ravikumar, Chief Business Development Officer at Bajaj Auto Limited, said, ""Going electric is a key strategic priority at Bajaj, and Yulu is an integral part of this strategy.

Bajaj Auto’s exports have been under pressure for a few months now. Shipments fell 39 percent year-on-year in December 2022, 47 percent in January 2023 and 38 percent in February 2023.

The company’s exports for the three months were 132,931 units, 112,725 units and 126,935 units respectively. This dragged down total production volumes to around 280,000, which is nearly half the capacity Bajaj Auto has of approximately 550,000 units a month.

What is going wrong?

It has to do with the two-wheeler maker’s export geographies.

Analysts estimate that around 50 percent of the company’s exports cater to African countries and in that a large part (30 percent of the total in FY20) caters to Nigeria. These markets have been experiencing massive disruptions recently, for political, macroeconomic and monetary reasons.

“Inflation, dollar unavailability and political changes have impacted the markets in these countries,” said Varun Baxi, research analyst (institutional), Antique Stock Broking.

Inflation in Nigeria touched 21.8 percent in January, far beyond the country’s monetary policy committee’s target range of 6-9 percent.

Food inflation, worsened by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, was 24.3 percent and core inflation, which excludes food and fuel, 19.2 percent. A dollar shortage is not new to the county but, in the current circumstances, it is being felt more acutely.

Local news reports suggest that businesses were sourcing most of their forex requirements through the black market.

Political, monetary turmoil

Politically, the country seems to be in turmoil. The ruling party has come back to power under Bola Tinubu amid complaints about electoral mismanagement. Politcal opponents are threatening to challenge the verdict.

“Elections in Nigeria have just concluded. It will take time for the government to form and settle in with policies,” said Jay Kale, Senior Vice President-Equity Analyst at Elara Capital. The brokerage has an “accumulate” call on Bajaj Auto.

Amid all of this, Nigeria’s central bank is overseeing a demonetisation exercise to take out old naira notes. News reports say that this exercise has brought businesses to a standstill and even caused riots.

TVS Motor, which also earns a good part of its export revenue from the Africa market, saw its export volumes fall significantly in February by 50 percent to 53,405 units. Its total volumes decreased 2 percent YoY to 276,150 units. But analysts said that the company’s exposure to that geography is much smaller than Bajaj Auto’s. They estimate it to be around 20-25 percent of its total exports, and its exposure to the Nigeria market to be half of that of Bajaj Auto’s.

Abhishek Gaoshinde, who is the Deputy Vice President of Research at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, also pointed to two other key markets for the auto maker —Sri Lanka and Egypt.

“Sri Lanka is facing political and economic headwinds, and Egypt has banned import of three-wheelers,” he noted.

Production cut?

Some newspaper reports said the company was planning a production cut, which senior management later denied through other newspaper reports. Analysts who Moneycontrol spoke to said the production cuts should come as no surprise; in fact it may become a business imperative.

“It might have made news but frankly we had already factored it in… If (export) volumes are half of the peak volumes, it is but natural that you have to cut production to save on costs,” said Elara Capital’s Kale.

He sees the export pressure continuing until May-June, in line with company management’s guidance in its December quarter earnings call.

According to industry experts, a large part of the earnings estimates would have been cut after the Q3FY23 earnings call. Now only incremental revisions will be made. Historically, an expert said that the company’s export margins are over 20 percent.

To Sharekhan’s Gaoshinde, “a lower rate of production is not a surprising but a rational outcome of the business activity.”

He said, “The production schedule aligns with the wholesale volume growth. BAL (Bajaj Auto Limited) has been facing headwinds in the export market for last six to seven months and hence production schedule has been following the wholesales volume growth trend.”

Domestic market

Can the capacity be diverted towards the domestic market? Highly unlikely, according to another industry analyst, who did not want to be named.

“Even though the capacities are fungible (that is, domestic and export capacities can be used for either) shifting capacities from domestic to export volumes and vice versa requires investment in time and money,” he said.

“Also, a large part of Bajaj Auto’s exports are in the 100-110 cc segments (with Boxer, Platina and Bajaj CT models) and this segment of the domestic market is not doing well (therefore the domestic market cannot absorb these additional capacities, if even diverted),” he added.

Elara Capital’s Kale said: “Domestic demand for two-wheelers itself is weak. The market is growing on a low base but it is way below the FY19 volume.”

Gaoshinde believes that the premiumisation trend in the domestic two-wheeler market will help Bajaj Auto even though it is an export-focussed company. Bajaj Auto has around 17 percent of the domestic market (9MFY23).

“The (domestic) two-wheeler industry is reporting a volatile performance largely because of delay in replacement buying,” he said, adding that a strong brand equity in the premium segment was supporting BAL.",909,-0.6513553586873141

The domestic equity market took a beating in February as investors shunned risky asset classes on fears that the US Federal Reserve would lift interest rates higher than anticipated and for a longer period as it fights to rein in sticky inflation.

Relentless selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who are seen shifting funds to China, and a withering sentiment among retail investors added to the woes for domestic equities. The freefall of Adani Group stocks in the aftermath of the Hindenburg report also dragged the benchmark indices in the red during February. Both the Nifty and Sensex declined close to 2 percent over the month.

But even as the spread of caution triggered profit-booking across most frontline sectors, automobile stocks continued to find favour with analysts. Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra were among the top 10 stocks that saw some contrast between price action and analyst action over the month.

Analysts upbeat about Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto topped the list of contrarian upgrades as the scrip declined 6.23 percent in February, but ""hold"" ratings for the stock went down to 13 from 14, while ""buy"" calls remained intact at 34.

Investors exited the stock after the company announced plans to cut production at its export-focused plants by up to 25 percent. However, analysts stuck to their optimism on hopes of growth in volumes for the company's domestic premium segment amid a stabilisation in semiconductor supply.

Tata Motors hitches ride on JLR

For Tata Motors, ""buy"" calls rose to 27 from 25, whereas ""hold"" ratings came down to four from five even as profit-booking due to weak market sentiment pushed the stock down around 5 percent during the month. Nonetheless, a strong outlook for the automaker's luxury arm, Jaguar and Land Rover, made sure analysts remain positive on the stock.

""We expect JLR to consistently exceed 75,000 units quarterly run-rate hereon, which should result in the arm consistently generating free-cash-flows ahead. JLR would benefit from easing chip supplies driving scale, ramp-up of higher-margin products, and working capital reversal with rising scale,"" brokerage firm Ambit Capital wrote in its report.

Farm, SUV boost for M&M

Mahindra & Mahindra posted a price drop of 2.68 percent but the number of ""buy"" calls rose to 24 from 23. The foreign brokerage firm CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets upgraded M&M to ""buy"" and raised its target price by 2.2 percent.

According to CLSA, strong momentum across the farm and auto business, with expectations for sports utility vehicle (SUV) volumes to expand more than 20 percent in FY24 due to a strong order backlog, constituted reasons for the upgrade.

Among contrarian downgrades over February, Tech Mahindra gained around 9 percent even as investors lapped up the stock on dips after the sharp sell-off last year. This happened even as analysts chose to maintain a cautious stance with Hold ratings moving higher to 15 from 11 as Buy calls slipped to 21 from 25. Additionally, Tech Mahindra was the only stock to garner contrarian calls over a quarter.

PhillipCapital continues to foresee underperformance from Tech Mahindra, compared to its peers, on growth due to a weaker portfolio. The broking firm also remains wary of Tech Mahindra's aggressive M&A strategy.

""Decision-making is slow and spending is getting impacted due to the macro environment. On margins, the previous target of 14 percent looks difficult to achieve in the near term, given lack of revenue growth leverage, stretched workforce, subcontracting costs at multi-quarter low, and Q1 seasonality – thereby ending FY23 at margins lower than FY22,"" PhillipCapital wrote in a note.

Meanwhile, ""buy"" calls also came down to 31 from 33 for Dr Reddy's Laboratories as ""hold"" and ""sell"" calls climbed one each over February, even as the stock gained over 2 percent. Pessimism for the stock seems to be emerging on account of concerns over price erosion in the US market.

Nuvama Insitutional Equities, which has a ""hold"" rating on the stock believes its acquisition of Mayne Pharma’s US retail generics portfolio for $90 million, despite being a low-risk foray, adds limited value for the drugmaker.

Nuvama also noted that ex-Revlimid, US growth for Dr Reddy's will face execution challenges in the face of price erosion and competition in existing molecules.

Quarterly changes

The highlight among contrarian calls over the quarter were heavyweights like Reliance Industries, Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finserv, State Bank of India and Titan Co. In terms of contrarian downgrades, there was no significant divergence between price action and analyst action.

Financials suffered the wrath of FII selling through the quarter, causing a decrease in price action. However, analysts struck positivity for the sector on the back of improving credit growth, strong fundamentals and the government's push towards capital expenditure.

For HUL, a surprise increase in royalty and an uptick in ad spends turned overhangs for the stock, resulting in an 8.60 percent decline. But most brokerages argue that the management's commentary on the demand front seems to be getting more constructive over the past couple of quarters, especially in terms of rural demand that is seen improving from the lows of June-July.

Systematix Institutional Equities has a ""buy"" rating for the consumer goods bellwether, with a target price of Rs 2,950.

""Our view is based on expectations of above-industry growth, continued premiumisation and strategic initiatives by HUL. Despite the increase in royalty which could be a near-term overhang, we find HUL a better bet than multiple mid-cap FMCG peers to play the impending rural recovery and a pick-up in consumer goods consumption across categories,"" the brokerage noted.

A similar trend was seen in heavyweight Reliance Industries as upgrades for the stock rose 5.93 percent despite a 14 percent decline in price action. Weak market sentiment, selling by FIIs and a muted earnings report by the core oil-to-chemicals business were dampeners for the stock's price action.

Global research and broking firm Jefferies maintains a bullish stance on RIL and believes that the government's approval for the Green Hydrogen Mission should aid the company's green energy business.

Jefferies also valued RIL's green hydrogen business at $8 billion and believes any meaningful capital subsidy from the government would support the valuation of its green hydrogen foray.

Titan Co is the next stock in the list of contrarian upgrades over the quarter, with its price falling 9 percent, but Buy ratings edging higher to 27 from 25. The company had been posting robust results for the past few quarters, but lost sheen in the October-December period on account of higher gold prices, weaker wedding demand, and stronger competitive intensity.

JM Financial Institutional Securities, which has upgraded the stock to ""buy"", believes Titan's 16-17 percent drop from its recent peak provides a very palatable entry valuation that is lower compared to the average stock price over the past five years.

Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Why do analysts favour Titan even as investors lose interest in the stock?

The brokerage firm is also bullish on Titan's growth prospects. ""What lends confidence to us is that Titan’s growth outperformance is more a factor of its own superior on-ground execution prowess than one that is dependent on market forces alone,"" it highlighted.

Yearly changes

On a year-on-year (YoY) basis as well, Titan Co was among the list of stocks that saw significant divergence between price action and analyst action. Bajaj Finance and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone were other stocks that shared the spotlight.

In the aftermath of the Hindenburg report, shares of Adani Ports witnessed a steep correction as investors exited the scrip. However, cheaper valuations, coupled with a strong growth outlook for India's biggest port operator, fuelled optimism among analysts.

Investors also kept away from Bajaj Finance on the back of its expensive valuations. But analysts continue to maintain an optimistic stance on the company’s digital transformation and consistent financial performance. The stock shed 11.47 percent last year, but Buy calls rose to 25 from 20.

Expensive valuations also dented JSW Steel as downgrades for the stock jumped 40.63 percent over the year, while price was up 7.63 percent. The company's higher debt also made analysts on the street wary of its upside potential.

Also Read: Analyst Call Tracker: Why Dr Reddy's acquisition of Maynes Pharma failed to cheer analysts?

Topping the list though was Coal India. ""Buy"" calls for the stock fell to 15 from 22, even as the price jumped 25.80 percent. A report by brokerage firm JM Financial cited expectations of a gradual cooling off of e-auction premiums and easing of international coal prices as reasons for its Hold rating.

Global research firm CLSA has upgraded Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) to 'buy' from 'outperform' and has also raised the target price.

The global research firm has raised the target price from Rs 1,583 to Rs 1,619 per share.

At 1:59pm, Mahindra and Mahindra traded at Rs 1,281.30, up Rs 11.50, or 0.91 percent, on the BSE. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,305.50 and an intraday low of Rs 1,278.05.

The research firm has cited strong momentum across the farm and auto business, with expectations for SUV volumes to expand more than 20 percent in FY24 due to a strong order backlog as the reasons for the upgrade.

Additionally, it has mentioned that M&M plans to launch six new electric SUVs over the next five years and increase capacity to 49,000 units per month to service rising demand.

CLSA anticipates tractor volumes to rise 13.6 percent on-year, driven by strong winter crop production and prices. Overall, CLSA's analysis suggests that M&M is poised for growth across multiple business segments, leading to their bullish outlook and upgraded rating.

Vehicle ownership levels in India to speed up

CLSA says that auto sales in India are expected to rise all the way to 2031, driven by an increase in per capita income that is set to outpace vehicle prices. It predicts that lower-income states will lead the way in vehicle ownership over the next decade, and that premium and clean-energy vehicles will see stronger growth than mass-market sales.

According to CLSA's analysis of India's vehicle registration data, cars and two-wheelers should see strong growth, achieving 9-11.5 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in volume over the next decade.

Premium and cleaner-fuel vehicles to lead

CLSA's analysis suggests that upgrades to premium and electric vehicles are likely to drive higher auto sales in India. As per their report, rising income levels are expected to boost demand for premium motorcycles and SUVs, while consumer awareness, government support, and declining ownership costs will drive demand for cleaner-fuel vehicles.

In particular, CLSA expects electric vehicles to account for 25 percent of annual two-wheeler registrations by FY31, indicating significant growth potential in this segment. They also predict that cleaner-fuel passenger vehicles will jump from 18 percent of registrations to 40 percent by FY31, demonstrating the increasing popularity of environmentally friendly vehicles in India.

Auto stocks to rerate

According to CLSA, most auto companies in India are trading at or below their historical trading ranges. However, as volumes increase at a projected 9-11.5 percent CAGR over the next decade, CLSA expects valuations for these companies to rerate.

In particular, CLSA recommends buying stocks linked to premium categories such as Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors, M&M, and Tata Motors, as they expect valuations for these companies to expand at a higher rate compared to those linked to entry-level vehicles.

On the other hand, the global research firm has 'sell' calls on Maruti Suzuki and TVS Motor Company, suggesting that they may not be as well-positioned to benefit from the expected growth in the auto sector.

Automobile major Bajaj Auto plans to cut down on production in the two-wheeler and three-wheeler segments by up to 25 percent at its export-focussed plants. The decision is triggered by uncertainties in Nigeria, which is the company's biggest market, the Economic Times reported on February 27, citing multiple sources aware of the development.

As a consequence, the stock fell over 3.5 percent in early trade on February 27, marking its steepest decline in the past five months. It is also the poorest performer in the Nifty Auto index. Over the course of the last month, the stock has lost over 5.89 percent.

According to the report, Bajaj Auto is expected to manufacture approximately 250,000-270,000 units in March, which is significantly lower than its average production of 338,000 units during the initial nine months of FY23.

The situation may lead to a decline in the overall capacity utilisation rate at Bajaj Auto plants to below 50 percent. The company has an installed capacity of 550,000 units every month.

""Indeed, there is a lot of uncertainty in Nigeria — both civil and economic — on account of elections and demonetisation. So, we have cut our shipments substantively until things settle,” Rakesh Sharma, executive director of Bajaj Auto, told the daily.

Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, had decided last year to start circulating newly designed 200, 500 and 1,000 naira notes, originally giving people until January 31 to get rid of their their old currency notes, which would no longer be legal tenders after that date.

But, jokes apart, it shows the grim reality of India’s ""K-shaped"" recovery.

A K-shaped recovery occurs when different parts of the economy recover at different rates, times, or magnitudes. Though SBI’s economists dismissed the 'K-shaped recovery' critique in a report in January, the Q3 earnings trend flies in the face of that view.

Here’s how India’s consumption story is panning out:

FMCG staples

This segment is a true indicator of a country’s economic health. In India, revenue for the FMCG pack has been on an upward trajectory due to the price hikes to mitigate raw material inflation. But this has come at the cost of volumes.

Rural India constitutes about 36 percent of the sales pie for a typical consumer company and this segment has been reeling under inflationary pressure. So much so, that Nestle India reported a loss in volumes for its Maggi Chotu pack, which costs Rs 7. Except for biscuits, demand in all other FMCG segments has taken a hit.

Also Read: Price hikes hit 'chotu' packs & demand in tier 2-6 towns, rural India resilient: Nestle

While Hindustan Unilever’s Sanjiv Mehta said that he has been seeing “green shoots” in rural demand, there is still a long way to go. According to the report released by data analytics firm NielsenIQ, in October-December, the industry grew 7.6 percent in terms of value but urban volumes grew 1.6 percent year-on-year while rural volumes declined 2.8 percent. Some consumers have down traded to lower unit packs and others to unbranded regional alternatives, analysts noted.

Encouraging winter crop sowing and indications of higher farm income came as good news for the industry but now fears of a subdued monsoon due to El Nino pose a new challenge for the industry.

Consumer discretionary and QSR

“The slowdown in discretionary spends is visible” Not our words. That’s what Uday Kotak said. Be it Asian Paints, Havells or Domino’s operator Jubilant FoodWorks, most discretionary companies have taken a hit on their bottomline as inflation has burned a hole in the low-to-mid income Indian’s pocket.

In Q3, Asian Paints and Pidilite both posted volume growth that was little changed against expectations of 4-5 percent growth. Both flagged demand stress in the rural and semi-urban areas. Electrical consumer goods company Havells reported a 7.2 percent fall in quarterly profit, citing “moderating” consumer demand. Whirlpool India also flagged similar concerns in its earnings statement.

Same-store sales growth for quick-service restaurants came in below Street expectations. Analysts believe startup layoffs and the slowdown in IT hiring are impacting spending and sentiment, with the fast-food category also witnessing down trading now. Though the festive season was a good time for the entire discretionary space, the slowdown that has crept in since shows no signs of a turnaround.

Retail

Nykaa’s top boss Falguni Nayar said lower consumer spending impacted the beauty-tech platform’s margin and revenue. It reported a 94 basis points margin contraction in Q3.

Page Industries, which is the exclusive licensee of Jockey, also cautioned that demand is not as buoyant in the ongoing quarter. “We are not seeing any recovery in the market,” managing director VS Ganesh said in a recent earnings call.

Avenue Supermarts’ earnings also disappointed as the higher-margin general merchandise and apparel segments underperformed the FMCG and staples segments. “Discretionary non-FMCG sales did not do as well as expected in this quarter,” said Neville Noronha, CEO & managing director, Avenue Supermarts Limited.

Footwear retailer Relaxo’s Q3 was no different from the industry. Revenue from operations fell 8 percent on-year weighed down by subdued demand in mass segment articles. It also lost market share to unorganised players. On the flip side, luxury shoemakers such as Metro Brands have emerged stronger.

That brings us to the other end of the spectrum.

Hotels and tourism

The hotels and tourism sector is the brightest beacon in the gloomy consumption story. Ever since the pandemic ebbed, the sector has been a major beneficiary of the recovery. In November 2022, the Indian hotel industry recorded its best performance since the pandemic began, with occupancy at 68-70 percent and average rates exceeding Rs 7,000.

The third quarter, which is a seasonally strong quarter thanks to a number of festivals, was strong for hotel companies as they saw sharp jumps in revenue and margins. The management of hotel companies is bullish on the near future as well.

“The outlook is very strong, albeit it is all built mostly on domestic (tourism) because foreign inbound is still lagging behind 2019-20 numbers,” said Puneet Chhatwal, Managing Director & CEO, Indian Hotels, in the chain’s recent analyst call.

He added that there are a lot of events happening this year, “including G20 and the Cricket World Cup, which should further boost demand or provide the necessary buffer should there be any form of headwinds coming from anywhere”.

Analysts concur. In a note, HDFC Securities said that with demand outpacing supply, which the latter is unlikely to catch up with over the next 2-3 years, it expects both average room rates (ARRs) and occupancy to remain strong, leading to higher RevPar for the industry.

Automobiles

Another silver lining in the consumption bucket has been automobiles, especially electric vehicles and sports utility vehicles (SUV). The sector has seen strong growth led by a number of model launches in the mid- to high-end segments.

For some models, such as the Mahindra Scorpio N, Tata Nexon, Maruti Suzuki Brezza and Hyundai Creta, the order backlog is as high as 12 months. The demand is such that the 5-door Jimmy, which Maruti Suzuki launched in January, has already garnered about 17,000 orders, and the count is increasing.

Shares of auto companies have also performed well. BSE Auto, a benchmark index of auto and auto ancillary companies, has returned 17 percent in the last year. Mahindra & Mahindra and TVS Motor are two of the best performing stocks from the sector, with one-year returns in the 50-70 percent range.

One worry has been the poor sales of two-wheelers, which are largely bought by low- and mid-income riders. Motorcycle sales have stagnated, putting pressure on shares of Hero Moto and Bajaj Auto. Eicher Motors has been spared from the selloff as it sells motorcycles in the mid-range, demand for which remains strong.

Sin goods

The so-called sin goods — alcoholic beverages and cigarettes — have also seen strong growth despite challenges. The reason is that they are adapting to inflation, which is hitting the lower economic strata of society.

Some distilleries are banking on premiumisation of their products, targeting mid and high-income consumers, and this portfolio has seen double-digit growth. Cigarette makers, meanwhile, have introduced new sizes that are priced lower and are banking on formalisation of the market.

Hina Nagarajan, MD & CEO of United Spirits, which sells Johnnie Walker branded liquor, said the company continues to witness good growth post-COVID, particularly in the mid-upper segments of the Prestige & Above (P&A) portfolio. That is reflective of the consumption revival in the broader economic context, with the festive season adding further momentum, as mentioned earlier.

“Our premium Indian whiskeys and scotches continue to drive category expansion on the back of the sustained trend of premiumisation. Inflation and the larger global macroeconomic headwinds may act as a bit of a drag, but we believe that consumer demand will continue to be robust,” said Nagarajan.

Cigarette volumes have also been strong, with double-digit growth recorded across makers. ITC, the biggest cigarette seller, recorded 17 percent growth in revenue from this portfolio.

“Several differentiated variants continue to be launched to further strengthen the range of offerings and ensure future-readiness of the product portfolio,” ITC said in a statement.

“A robot can replace the work of 50 ordinary men but not one extraordinary man,” Rajiv Bajaj, in a conversation about the possible invasion of chatbots such as ChatGPT.

Moneycontrol has been experimenting with various formats that ChatGPT can generate and, as part of that, we asked the bot to generate a poem about the CEO of Bajaj Auto.

Here is what it wrote:

“Rajiv Bajaj, a name known far and wide

In the world of business, he's a true guide

Leading Bajaj Auto with skill and flair

He's taken the company to great heights, with care.

Inheriting a legacy from his father's past

Rajiv forged his own path, one that would last

Innovating, experimenting, taking risks

A man with a vision, not afraid of any twists.

With Pulsar and Chetak, he made his mark

Creating bikes that lit up the dark

Always looking to the future, he never rests

A true visionary, one of the very best.

Under his leadership, Bajaj Auto grew

Into a force to be reckoned with, that's true

His brilliance and foresight helped it rise

To become a brand that everyone admires.

So here's to Rajiv Bajaj, a true inspiration

A leader, a mentor, and a true sensation

May he continue to shine, with all his might

And lead Bajaj Auto to even greater heights

On sharing the bot-generated poem with him on a private chat, Bajaj was wowed but, a few minutes later, he came back with a better written one.

Bajaj had shared the bot's poem with a poet friend Komal Khilnani, who is published in Rhymes of India, and Khilnani came back with lines she had written. Her poem outdid ChatGPT's with sharper lines and a deeper understanding of his work, and she had done this in minutes.

Here is what she wrote:

“In India's land of wheels and steel,

A man named Rajiv Bajaj did feel

The call of destiny to create

A legacy that would innovate.

He looked at the two-wheeler scene

And saw a gap that had not been

Filled by any machine or brand,

And so he put his mind to plan.

With vision bold and courage strong,

He made the Chetak, a classic song

Of style, reliability, and grace,

A scooter that would win the race.

But Bajaj didn't stop there,

He knew that he could still dare

To push the limits even more,

And so he made the Pulsar roar.

A powerful machine that could fly,

A bike that could make you feel alive,

It changed the game and set the pace,

A legend that will never fade.

And so we honor Rajiv Bajaj,

For his spirit and his dream that saw

The birth of two machines so fine,

That they will live on for all time”

Along with sending her poem, Bajaj said, “Reminds me of what I once read… a robot can replace the work of 50 ordinary men but not one extraordinary man (or woman in this case)”.",518,0.5469057013591131

Bajaj Auto

Since April 2022, the stock was firmly consolidating around Rs 3,500 which remains a major support zone. With last week's strong upmove of 10 percent, the stock has recovered past three months' losses denoting fastest retracement and strong come back of bulls.

On the weekly chart, the stock has also confirmed trend reversal indicating positive bias ahead. This buying momentum was accompanied with huge volumes indicating increased participation.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

We increase our FY24/25 EPS estimates by 4% each to factor in higher ASPs and better mix. In 3QFY23, BJAUT’s EBITDA margin +180bps QoQ surprised positively driven by better USD realizations (Rs 81.7 vs Rs 75.1/79.8), superior product mix (premium segment 65% of mix vs 55% in Q2FY23) and higher mix of higher margin spares business. We remain concerned on the export side (~50% of sales) of the business given (1) currency devaluation and unavailability of USD, (2) lower affordability due to price hikes and (3) higher interest rates. Also, lack of market share gains in domestic motorcycles market over last few years, despite aggressive pricing in some segments (motorcycle market share contracted 150bps since FY19), could lead to further pricing actions and pressures on margins.



Outlook

However, we expect BJAUT’s domestic premium segment volumes to grow (similar to the industry), given stabilization in semiconductor supply. Maintain ‘HOLD’ with a target price of Rs 4,040 (Rs 3,820 earlier) at 16x Dec-24E EPS.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Bajaj Auto

Q3 EBITDA grew by 29% YoY to Rs17.8bn, clocking 10% above our estimate due to higher revenues and gross-margin beat. Revenue increased by 3% to Rs93.2bn, coming in 3% above our estimates on better realizations and spare-part sales. Going forward, we build in 8% volume CAGR over FY23-25E (which is lower than the 11- 12% CAGR for peers such as TVSL and EIM), mainly due to higher exposure to overseas markets. Exports is likely to be under pressure in the near term, owing to weak macros, adverse currency movements and USD availability issues in the Africa, South Asia and Latin America regions. In contrast, we expect domestic volumes to grow in double-digits, driven by strong urban demand, better finance availability and favorable base effect.



Outlook

We maintain HOLD on the stock, with TP of Rs4,250/share (Rs4,050 earlier), based on 17x FY25E Core EPS (Dec-24E earlier), value of investments at Rs246/share and cash reserves of Rs607/share.

Two-wheeler major Bajaj Auto on January 25 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 1,491 crore for the quarter ended December 2022, clocking a 23 percent rise over Rs 1,214 crore a year ago.

Revenue from operations came in at Rs 9,315 crore, increasing 3 percent from Rs 9,022 crore in the corresponding quarter last year, the company said in an exchange filing.

In an analyst poll, revenue estimates for the quarter were at Rs 8,998.50 crore and net profit at Rs 1,379 crore. Both profit and revenue were better than estimates.

The company said revenue growth was driven by robust double-digit growth in the domestic business, which offset the drop in exports arising from challenging market conditions. Overall, spares revenue came in at an all-time high.

At Rs 1,777 crore, EBITDA was the highest ever, surpassing the record set in the previous quarter. The strong growth of 29 percent year on year (YoY), was underpinned by margin expansion of 390 basis points YoY to 19.1 percent. Margin improvement was led by judicious pricing, better dollar realisation and richer product mix.

On domestic motorcycles, industry festive demand, particularly in the top end commuter/sports segment, was buoyant and the company said it outperformed with strong growth in the segment.

On exports, macro-economic challenges continue to subdue industry volumes across overseas geographies, said Bajaj Auto.

""While the company continues to navigate this situation through decisive actions, market share remains stable and the resilient performance in ASEAN is alleviating in part, the drop in volumes across other regions,"" it said.

Commercial vehicles maintained their path of recovery to pre-covid levels -- now at -75 percent - as the quarter saw strong growth with stepped up volumes and market share hitting an all-time high across segments, Bajaj Auto said.",347,0.4759498021819375

Auto stocks outperformed the benchmark index in 2022 and analysts expect it to continue to deliver strong numbers in 2023, as well, on good volume growth and margin expansion.

The Street does not seem to be expecting Budget 2023 to be momentous for the sector, especially for fuel vehicles, but it will be closely tracking announcements aimed at driving electric-vehicle adoption. It will also be on the lookout for announcements that leave more money in the hands of the consumer, especially the rural consumer, to boost demand across auto categories.

Optimism around the sector seems to be driven by the demand outlook. The Street expects strong demand growth across categories, thanks to the low-base effect, product launches and an improving economy.

“Demand is recovering from its worst slowdown in decades, and we expect 12-18% volume CAGR for PVs, 2Ws and trucks over FY23-25E,” wrote analysts at Jefferies. This rise in volumes and margins will translate into double-digit growth in earnings over the next two to three years, according to the analysts.

Jefferies' analysts expect a 2-6 ppt EBITDA margin expansion over FY22-25. Yes, metal prices are likely to have bottomed out, with China going easy on their Covid policy and with their support for the ailing property sector. But, the analysts don't see their prices go up as much as they did between 2020-22.

Added to this, most of the stocks in the brokerage’s coverage are valued attractively. The P/E on the analysts’ FY24 earnings estimates is below the stocks’ 10-year average multiple. So, they see a lot of upside in many of the auto majors.

Sharekhan expects EPS growth for FY24-25 to be in the range of 15-20%, again because of strong demand and margin expansion. “We remain positive on the automobile sector despite near-term challenges, rising inflation, and the semiconductor chip shortage,” said Piyush Parag, DVP, Fundamental Research at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

According to Parag, the passenger segment (2-wheelers and four-wheelers) will benefit from launches and increasing electrification, while the recovery in commercial vehicles (CVs) will continue over the next few years with improved economic activity, an affordable interest rate regime, and better financing availability.

Budget effect

Over the last year, the auto sector has dealt with chip-supply shortages, delays in delivery, disruptive trends such as electrification and premiumisation, and price hikes. Budget 2022 had provided some support by setting aside 25% of the defence R&D budget for private-sector-led projects and solutions, and making higher allocations for infrastructure building and minimum support price (MSP) payments, which indirectly help boost demand for CVs and 2Ws.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had also shared plans for a national battery-swapping policy, which had been welcomed by the industry, though the final version will be out only by 2025.

This year, the sector is likely to face challenges from chip-supply constraints and rising financing costs. The Budget isn’t expected to address any of these through a direct intervention.

Analyst expectations

In an interview with Moneycontrol, MOFSL’S Deputy Head of Research and Auto Analyst Jinesh Gandhi said that the brokerage does not see any major announcements directly impacting the auto sector.

“There may be initiatives on the EV side, predominantly incentives (to encourage electrification)… like extension of the FAME II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) subsidy or increase in allocation towards electrification of buses under JNNURM (Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission) or for last-mile connectivity,” he said, adding that indirect initiatives for the whole sector, which can boost demand, would be important.

Among indirect initiatives Gandhi listed income-tax related changes, which could affect the sector positively or negatively; any increase in the Budget (allocation) for rural markets, where there has been stress for some time; and any increase in the allocation for infrastructure spending, which could have a positive impact on the commercial-vehicle (CV) category.

Parag aired a similar view. “No major direct benefit is expected for the internal combustion (engine) segment, while the incentives for promotion of clean fuel (CNG, hybrid, hydrogen, EVs, FAME policy etc) are key things to watch out for in the upcoming Budget. Broader provisions for investment in infrastructure and allocations on rural schemes and so on would be noted down for macro readings,” he said, adding that major beneficiaries would include Tata Motors and M&M.",763,0.609796384970347

The head of Swiss sports bike maker KTM, which claims to be the world's No 1 premium motorbike brand and also sells tens of hundreds of e-bikes in Europe, is not confident of the capability of electric vehicles beyond a point and feels that optimism on this front is ""highly overrated"".

KTM, which is primarily into high-end racing bikes, has a 50.1:49.9 manufacturing JV with Bajaj Auto. It will also be selling the electric model of the resurrected iconic Chetak scooters from the Bajaj stable in Europe from the first quarter of 2024.

""The whole scope and capability of the concept of electric vehicle mobility is highly overrated. It's the result of mixing the laws of physics incorrectly and also by mis-reading the laws of energy,"" Stefan Pierer, the chief executive of Pierer Mobility that owns the KTM brand, told a select group of journalists at a media roundtable here.

""I know it isn't easy to tell and convince the politicians about the sheer impracticality of attempting to make high-end EV bikes,"" he said, adding it needs 10x more storage space in the EV segment to generate energy that one litre of gasoline can produce.

For a bike, which is a highly space crunched product, how can one expect it to carry 600-700 kg of batteries, he wondered.

For the same reason, he said, it is not possible for sports or high-end bikes to run on electricity.

It is not feasible for high-powered bikes to run on electric engines. This is because the weight of the battery required to generate equivalent power of a gasoline engine would be too high, he pointed out.

Another factor capping the scope of EVs is the exorbitantly high cost of battery components. Prices of lithium-ion battery components have soared five-six times in the recent past as a result of the higher demand and government push to switch to electric mobility. But it is not easy to drive these points to politicians, he remarked.

However, Pierer was quick to admit that EVs as a tool for urban/city mobility is easily doable and will continue to grow and that is the reason why the company also makes low-end bikes for the segment.

On launch of the e-Chetak from Bajaj Auto in Europe from 2024, he said the scooter is a great product, especially its second version, and such vehicles which are purely for city commute stand to gain from the EV push.

The e-Chetak, especially the second generation, is a great commuter product for a market like Europe. If everything goes as planned we should be selling this e-scooter in Europe from early 2024, he added.

Pierer was speaking to reporters here last Friday when the JV plant rolled out the 1 millionth KTM bike from the Chakan plant.

The Bajaj KTM tie-up began in October 2007 and the first bike was rolled out in 2011. The company makes lower-capacity KTMs and the sub-400 cc Husqvarna models at the Chakan unit. The KTM-Bajaj partnership may explore bringing in more mid-range models in the 600-690 cc range, Pierer said.

The Chetak, named after the legendary horse of the great warrior Maharana Pratap, was produced from 1972 onwards. It had a waiting period of up to 10 years in 1980s. Bajaj sold over 5,00,000 units by 1983, and around 100 million units by 1995. But by 2004, the company under the present management led by Rajiv Bajaj discontinued the Chetak. The iconic scooter, that was a household name, made a comeback in October 2019 in the EV form and since then has sold around 25,000 units at price tag of Rs 1.4 lakh.

Bajaj Auto's wholly-owned subsidiary, Chetak Technology, has set up an electric vehicle plant in Akurdi, near Pune.

Bajaj had acquired a 14.5 per cent stake in the Austrian bike maker in 2007. Over the years, Bajaj's stake has grown to 49.9 per cent in KTM's parent company Pierer AG.",657,0.11752977541514806

The market started off the first week of New Year 2023 on a disappointing note with the Nifty50 down 1.4 percent and decisively broke the psychological 18,000 mark in the week ended January 6 after Fed officials signalled an aggressive stance to control inflation.

The index closed at 17,859 after trading within the range of previous two weeks and formed a bearish candle on the weekly time frame, but has taken support at 17,750, which is expected to be a crucial support point for the current week beginning January 9, with the initial hurdle at 18,000, followed by 18,200 levels, experts said.

""As of now, we are still a bit hopeful of recovery; but in case the Nifty slides and sustains below 17,750, we must prepare for an extension of this corrective move towards 17,600 – 17,450 in the coming week,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

On the flipside, he feels that in order to regain the strength, the Nifty must reclaim 18,000 first on a closing basis. The major trend-deciding level remains at 18,300, which would turn the tide once again in favour of bulls, he said.

The market expert advised traders to keep a close tab on all these scenarios. The only positive takeaway at the end of the week would be the resilience of the broader market, he feels.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the January 6 closing prices:

Expert: Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative and Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities

Religare Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 176.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 164 | Target: Rs 190-199 | Return: 13 percent

After breaking out from the downward sloping trendline on the daily chart, stock price is consolidating during last few days, indicating relative strength in the stock. Short and medium term trend remains positive as stock price is trading above all important moving averages.

Momentum Oscillators - RSI (relative strength index - 11) and MFI (money flow index - 10) are sloping upwards and placed above 50 on the weekly chart, indicating strength in the stock. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 176.35-170.

Sundram Fasteners: Buy | LTP: Rs 991 | Stop-Loss: Rs 920 | Target: Rs 1,070-1,100 | Return: 11 percent

The stock price has broken out on the weekly chart from the multiple top resistance of Rs 980-985 levels. Short term trend of the stock is positive as stock price is trading above its 5 and 20-day EMA (exponential moving average).

Momentum Oscillators - RSI (11) and MFI (10) is placed above 50 on the weekly chart, indicating relative strength in the stock. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 991-950.

Minda Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 213.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 200 | Target: Rs 229-235 | Return: 10 percent

The stock price is on the verge of breaking out from the downward sloping trendline on the weekly chart. Stock price has been taking support at 200-day EMA. Intermediate trend of stock remains positive as it is trading above its 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages.

Auto ancillaries' stocks are looking good on the medium-term charts. One can buy the stock in the range of Rs 213.75-208.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research ( Retail) at Kotak Securities

Cummins India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,431.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,390 | Target: Rs 1,500-1,550 | Return: 8 percent

The stock has formed a higher bottom at Rs 1,351 and closed in positive territory on a weekly basis. The stock is following a bullish formation, which crossed Rs 1,270 level in October 2022.

Based on the short-term formation of the stock, technically, it is moving towards Rs 1,500-1,550 levels. Buy at the current level and place a stop-loss at Rs 1,390.

Hindalco Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 462.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 450 | Target: Rs 491 | Return: 6 percent

After making several bottoms between 425 and 430, the stock quickly reversed to Rs 491 levels. A sector-specific move supported the rally in the stock on strong gains in Asian markets.

Last week, the stock fell to Rs 460 level due to continued weakness in the US market. At current levels, the stock is attractive to buy from a trading point of view. However, a stop-loss at Rs 450 is required.

Tata Consultancy Services: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,211.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,300 | Target: Rs 3,175-3,100 | Return: 3.5 percent

The stock has formed a series of falling tops and falling bottoms, which is a bearish formation. The levels of Rs 3,300 and Rs 3,400 are acting as major resistance zone for the stock.

On Friday, the stock closed below the level of Rs 3250, which would pull the stock to Rs 3,175 or Rs 3,100 in the near term. It is advisable to sell at Rs 3,215 and at Rs 3,250. However, keep a stop loss at Rs 3,300 to protect a short sell position.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Tata Consumer Products: Sell | LTP: Rs 761.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 795 | Target: Rs 702 | Return: 8 percent

In late-December 2022, the stock witnessed a trendline breakdown and extended loss subsequently. Continuing its prior weekly falling trend, the stock slipped to 11-week low during the last week.

Its weekly RSI slipped below 50-mark post negative cross-over. This could drag the stock towards its psychological level of Rs 700, where its lowest level of May 2022 and June 2022 are also placed.

In case of any pullback, the stock may face hurdle around its extending trendline.

DLF: Sell | LTP: Rs 370 | Stop-Loss: Rs 387 | Target: Rs 346 | Return: 6.5 percent

The stock resumed its down move post a pullback. On the higher side, the stock faced hurdle around the junction of key moving averages on the daily timeframe chart.

Its daily RSI reversed before testing 50-mark. We believe undergoing negative momentum may continue, which could drag the stock towards its lowest level of September 2022.

On the higher side, its key moving averages will cap the up-move.

Tata Power: Sell | LTP: Rs 205.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 213 | Target: Rs 190 | Return: 7.5 percent

The stock reversed after testing its prior point of polarity and moved down. Its major moving averages are sloping downwards and the key technical indicators are negatively poised.

This could drag the stock towards its lowest level of June 2021.

In case of any rebound, the stock will continue to face hurdle around its prior point of polarity.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa

Petronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 218 | Stop-Loss: Rs 206 | Target: Rs 235-240 | Return: 10 percent

The stock has seen a long consolidation phase and has traded within a broad range since last three years and has now given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance. Off late, the stock has witnessed positive momentum as the ‘89 DEMA’ has acted as a support during the recent decline.

The volumes during price corrections are low while they are rising gradually along with price upmoves indicating buying interest by market participants. The RSI Smoothed oscillator has given a positive crossover on the daily chart and is in ‘Buy Mode’ on the weekly charts too.

Considering the technical structure, we expect the stock to rally higher in the near term and hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities around current price of Rs 218. The possible near term targets for the stock are expected around Rs 235-240, while the stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 206.

Bajaj Auto: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,642 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,540 | Target: Rs 3,740-3,800 | Return: 4 percent

The stock has been consolidating within a range since last few weeks and prices have seen some pullback move from the support end of a ‘Symmetrical Triangle’ pattern. The stock has relatively shown strength as compared to broader markets since last few days and the RSI oscillator has given a positive crossover indicating a positive momentum.

Traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 3,640-3,620 for potential targets around Rs 3,740 and Rs 3,800. The stop-loss for short positions should be placed above Rs 3,540.

The passenger vehicles market saw phenomenal growth in October but sales of two-wheelers remained subdued during the month due to, among other things, a hike in prices amid the transition to the Bharat Stage VI emission norms, reduced disposable income of the lower-income group and stress in the rural economy. Sales were also hit because of rising commodity and fuel costs caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Data shared by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) showed entry-level bikes (up to 110cc) saw a 35 percent drop from 2,305,000 units in Q2FY2019 to 1,497,000 in the second quarter of this financial year.

It is to be mentioned that the total sales for Bajaj and TVS include three-wheelers.

Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), which was the market leader in September (as per registrations data on government site Vahan) reported a nearly 4 percent increase in total sales at 449,391 units in October 2022 versus 432,229 units in October last year.

In June, the Chennai-headquartered company was reported to have started the process to raise $300-350 million for its EV vertical. Six months earlier, the auto major had set up TVS Electric Mobility as a subsidiary for the EV business.

It was after reports of the fund-raising started to increase in number that the stock began its upward trajectory. While Hero MotoCorp entered the two-wheeler electric vehicle space by tying up with Ather as its strategic partner in 2016 and Bajaj Auto launched Chetak in 2020, TVS Motors began to look like the most aggressive player in the market.

In its latest report, investment banking firm UBS said that the auto major will emerge as the market leader in the EV segment in the medium to long term. In fact, it has revised its target price upwards to Rs 1,385. The report said to expect five EV launches over the next 12-15 months.

Early this year, a UBS report had explained why the auto major is likely to benefit the most from the EV disruption. It pointed to the resources the company was investing in to develop software and telematics capabilities in-house.

“The software for the ride modes on TVS Apache series motorcycle was developed in-house, as were the telematics for its debut EV model iQube,” wrote the analysts.

Even Sharekhan, in a September 21 report, noted the company’s ramping up of “investments in EVs and connected technologies through multiple routes – investments in R&D and auto technology start-ups”. The company management expected the EV capacity to double to 10,000 units per month in January 2023 from 5,000 units per month currently, it said.

After TVS Motors relaunched iQube this May, its share in the EV2W market has climbed steadily from 1.13 percent to 12.56 percent in September 2022.

Aniket Mhatre, Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, in an interview with Moneycontrol, said that the company has got the pricing of its iQube right. The e-scooter has three variants priced between Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.15 lakh. “With that, they are able to get a larger set of customers,” he said. Competitors’ models are priced higher, by Rs 40,000-Rs 50,000, which can deter first-time buyers.

The UBS analysts have also noted that while TVS has a high share of internal-combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, it may be able to protect itself from the EV disruption because of its investment in newer and premium models.

Mhatre said that the company has been innovating consistently for the past few years. “It has been the only player who has launched a new product and gained market share almost consistently for six to seven years,” he said. On the other hand, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp have two to three key brands and they keep launching within these, he added.

Over time, it has increased revenue share of its premium products and diversified its offerings by expanding into exports.

Flying high

“Hero is a major player in the entry level and Bajaj Auto has diluted its Pulsar proposition, they started with 180cc and then came down to 125cc. Today, if you want to play anything in excess of 180cc or 200cc, then that would be TVS Apache. That has played out well in TVS’ favour,” said Mayur Milak, Senior VP – Auto and Aviation, Asian Markets Securities, and added that their export strategy has also worked out well.

Mhatre gives a rough breakdown of revenue shares of different categories: Apache makes for 50 percent of its overall volumes, and it was less than 40 percent a few years back; and exports is now almost 30 percent of its volumes which was below 20 percent a few years back.

“Both these categories are growing and last year they launched TVS Raider that is selling another 10,000-15,000 units per month and this year they launched TVS Ronin. That will further improve the mix in terms of premiumisation,” he said.

“Its exports push is largely like the Bajaj Auto model where Africa is the largest market, followed by the LatAm and ASEAN markets,” Milak added.

The third factor, according to Milak, is the company’s ability to improve its operating margins. Peers have seen their EBITDA margins shrink—Bajaj Auto used to post 20 percent EBITDA margin, it has come down to 15-16 percent; and Hero MotoCorp’s 14-15 percent has come down to 11-12 percent. “TVS Motors on the other hand used to do 6-7 percent of EBITDA margins, it was an underperformer (in that). But they have moved up to 10 percent,” he added.

In an October 11 report, Sharekhan’s analysts have forecasted that the company’s EBITDA margins will improve further to 11.5 percent, which is a QoQ increase of 150 bps and YoY increase of 148 bps. They stated that the margin increase will be led by “improved product mix, softening raw material prices and operating leverage benefit”.

According to Mhatre, the margin improvement comes from company’s reduced dependence on imports and localisation of component-sourcing. A Business Responsibility Report released by the company on for FY22 states that 94 percent of the input material and services (by value) were produced from local vendors.

In all, while the auto major’s EV announcements seem to be driving the market sentiment, its turnaround has been in the making for a while with the premiumisation of its product portfolio, diversification its revenue mix with exports and improvement of operating margins. Whether the market is rewarding TVS Motors disproportionately for its EV strategy, we will have to wait and see.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Bajaj Auto

Q2FY23 EBITDA for Bajaj Auto grew 26% YoY to Rs17.6bn, clocking 6% above our estimate due to the revenue beat and lower-than-expected employee expenses. Revenue increased by 16% to Rs102bn, coming in 4% above our estimates on better geographical-mix in exports and higher incentives (both, production & export incentives). Going forward, we expect a 5% volume CAGR over FY22-25 (which is lower than the 8-11% CAGR for peers such as TVSL and HMCL), mainly due to higher exposure to overseas markets. Exports is likely to be under pressure in the near term, with decline of 15% in FY23, owing to adverse currency movements, high inflation and unfavorable government policies in the Africa/Middle East regions. In contrast, we expect domestic volumes to grow at 13% in FY23, driven by strong urban demand, better finance availability and favorable base effect. We increase FY22-25 EPS estimates by 2-4%, factoring-in an improvement in realizations.

Outlook

We maintain HOLD on the stock, with TP of Rs4,100/sh (Rs4,000 earlier), based on 17x Dec-24E Core EPS (Sep-24E earlier), value of investments at Rs155/sh and cash reserves of Rs614/sh.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s 2QFY23 performance came ahead of our estimates, led by better-than-expected realization (at Rs 88.6k, +16/3% YoY/QoQ); which in turn led to better margins at 17.2% (+100bps QoQ, Ple:16.5%). This was driven by improved mix in exports and favorable currency realization. Domestic volumes doubled QoQ owing to festive season demand and restoration of supply chain. Management expects single-digit growth from this festive season. In export markets, company took inventory correction measures, which led to lower exports (~40% of volumes vs 62% sequentially). There remains concerns on the export side of the business given (1) currency devaluation against USD in developing markets (eg: USD/Naira; 50%+ exports volumes from Africa), (2) poor availability of USD for trade, (3) retail price increase and (4) higher interest rates. Also, overall 3W demand still remains weak along with ban in Egypt. Sustainability of domestic 2W demand recovery in questionable with entry-level demand being still under pressure and Bajaj’s market share loss (~300bps since FY20).

Outlook

We increase our FY23/24 estimates marginally to factor in better-than-expected 2Q performance. Maintain HOLD with a target price of Rs 3,865 (at 16x Sep-24E EPS).

Here's what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post June quarter earnings

Motilal Oswal

While the India 2W (two wheeler) business is showing signs of recovery, exports have bottomed out. Bajaj Auto market share would benefit over the long term from: a) the premiumization trend, b) the opportunity in exports, and c) the potential sizeable position in the Scooter market via EVs. However, a large part of its India profit pool (of premium motorcycle and 3Ws) is vulnerable to a possible disruption from electrification.

We reiterate our Neutral rating with a Target Price of Rs 4,000/share (16x Sep-24E consolidated EPS).

LKP Reaserch

With strong balance sheet, robust return ratios, hefty dividend yield of 3.9% in FY22 and zero financial leverage, we believe the stock looks attractive at 16.25x FY 24E earnings. We therefore maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a slightly pruned down target price (on exports concerns) of Rs 4,174 (at 19x FY 24E earnings).

Nirmal Bang

We remain constructive on Bajaj Auto amid the cyclical recovery in the 2W segment and emerging margin tailwinds. We tweak our FY24E/25E EPS downward by ~3%/2% and upgrade the stock to BUY with Sept’24E target price (TP) of Rs 4,102 vs Rs 4,354.

We value Bajaj Auto on SoTP basis, with the core business valued at Rs 3,105 (16x Sept’24E core EPS vs 17x earlier), cash of Rs 692/share and investment in KTM at Rs305/share. We downgrade the multiple to factor in the weakness in the export markets

Prabhudas Lilladher

Bajaj Auto’s 2QFY23 performance came ahead of our estimates, led by better-than-expected realization (at Rs 88.6k, +16/3% YoY/QoQ); which in turn led to better margins at 17.2% (+100bps QoQ, Ple:16.5%). This was driven by improved mix in exports and favorable currency realization. Domestic volumes doubled QoQ owing to festive season demand and restoration of supply chain.

Management expects single-digit growth from this festive season. In export markets, company took inventory correction measures, which led to lower exports (~40% of volumes vs 62% sequentially).

Maintain Hold with a target price of Rs 3,865 (at 16x Sep-24E EPS).

CLSA

We kept outperform rating on the stock and cut target price to Rs 4,100 per share.

The export outlook improving, and should pick up in H2, while domestic volume recovers on improved chip supply.

The model launches & distribution expansion should aid volume improvement.

CLSA has cut earnings assumptions by 2-6% for FY23-24 on lower volume & margin, reported CNBC-TV18.

Citi

We maintained sell rating on the stock and cut target price to Rs 3,300 from Rs 3,450 per share as Q2 was below estimate on weaker mix offsetting currency benefits.

The focus is on regaining domestic motorcycle market share. The easing commodity cost pressures & currency tailwinds could support margin.

The uncertainty in exports momentum is a concern and expect some pricing pressure as company endeavours to regain market share, reported CNBC-TV18.

UBS

We maintained neutral rating on the stock with a target at Rs 4,000 per share.

The Q2 EBITDA beat consensus by 9%/6% driven by superior mix in exports & one-offs. The weakness in exports will continue, while company expects some improvement sequentially.

In domestic 2-wheeler business, company expects low single-digit YoY growth during festive, reported CNBC-TV18.

Goldman Sachs

We kept buy rating on the stock with a target at Rs 4,500 per share.

The Q2 was a beat, as improving chip supply aiding market share build back. The news around export bans in Nigeria are less concerning than initially. Only 10% of Nigeria (Lagos city) has been covered in the ban.

However, raw material cost normalisation & inflection in 3-wheeler volumes will aid margin, reported CNBC-TV18.

At 09:45 hrs Bajaj Auto was quoting at Rs 3,660.70, up Rs 91.70, or 2.57 percent on the BSE.

It may be recalled that during the Q1 results announcement, Bajaj Auto had stated that sales in the quarter were significantly constrained by the inadequate availability of semiconductors even though the situation improved in the latter part as new supply sources were developed.

Analysts, while expecting Bajaj Auto to witness positive growth in numbers in the domestic market, also foresaw sales volume could prove a drag on September quarter numbers.

The numbers were better than the estimates by brokerage firms. Kotak Institutional Investors (KIE) expected the auto major’s revenue to grow around 20 percent QoQ and around 10 percent YoY, while operating profit was projected to rise 20-21 percent QoQ and 11-12.5 percent YoY.

IIFL had predicted that Bajaj Auto’s volumes will improve by 23 percent QoQ (low base due to chip shortage), but would be flat on a YoY basis.

While the auto sector did well, with wholesale volumes picking up and semiconductor shortage easing, the two-wheeler (2W) segment has been facing headwinds. Patchy monsoon is affecting rural demand and this is affecting the 2W segment, particularly in the entry-level bike (upto 110cc) segment.

""In a market that is still significantly lower than pre-COVID, although recovering, Bajaj three wheelers delivered an industry leading performance, while retaining its strong position across segments; CNG does particularly well and is growing penetration,"" said BAL.",510,0.3668090005715688

Bajaj Auto is expected see good growth in domestic sales volume, but export sales volume could prove a drag on September quarter numbers.

Brokerages expect the auto major’s revenue to grow around 20 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) and around 10 percent year-on-year (YoY), and operating profit to rise 20-21 percent QoQ and 11-12.5 percent YoY.

While the auto sector did well, with wholesale volumes picking and semiconductor shortage easing, the two-wheeler (2W) segment has been facing headwinds. Patchy monsoon is affecting rural demand and this is affecting the 2W segment, particularly in the non-premium categories.

But domestic 2W sales volumes (in units) is expected to see a significant rise of 98 percent QoQ for Bajaj Auto, because chip-shortage has eased and inventory build-up has been good for the festive season, according to Kotak Institutional Equities report released on October 6. The brokerage has a reduce call on the stock. This--along with a 35-71 percent QoQ rise in domestic and export volumes in three wheelers (3Ws)--has led to overall volumes going up by 23 percent QoQ, added the analysts. But the overall volume growth was offset by a decline in export volumes of 2W, and the decline in these export numbers were because of a slowdown in demand in the African market, added the analysts.

Devaluation of local currency in Nigeria and talk of a ban in the country were expected to hit Bajaj Auto hard.

Analysts at KIE expect revenue to grow 20.3 percent QoQ to Rs 9,632 crore from Rs 8,005 crore last quarter and 9.9 percent YoY from Rs 8,762 crore a year ago.

Analysts at Axis Securities too estimate revenue growth to be around that range, with 21.2 percent QoQ growth to Rs 9,702 crore and 10.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth. In an October 11 report, the analyst wrote, “We expect revenues to increase 21 percent QoQ led by higher sales volume (up 23 percent QoQ) led by higher domestic sales on the back of higher dispatches for festive demand (up 98 percent QoQ) partially offset QoQ. Revenue growth is partially offset by our lower assumption for ASP (down 1 percent QoQ) led by lower export realizations”.

They expect EBITDA to grow 21.5 percent QoQ to Rs 1,576 crore from Rs 1,297 crore a quarter ago, and 12.5 percent YoY from Rs 1,401 a year ago. But they estimate that the operating margin will remain unchanged quarter on quarter at 16.2 percent, because of lower exports and domestic sales dominated by lower-end products. They expect these two factors to weigh on higher operating leverage.

KIE analysts expect EBITDA to grow 20.4 percent QoQ to Rs 1,561 crore, and 11.4 percent YoY.

Tough road in Africa

In the first quarter earnings call, the management had spoken about the challenges they were facing in the Nigeria market with devaluation of the local currency Naira, which caused retail prices to shoot up 2-3x over 16 quarters. But the management expected the demand to return because, as the company’s Executive Director Rakesh Sharma said, the “the industry is so big and so deep and so fundamental to Nigeria and… to other countries in Africa”.

“Now over the last 15 years, which we have been in operation, we have seen that when this happens, there are 2, 3 months when things go topsy-turvy. And after that, the equilibrium returns. Even if it settles down at a higher level than it did, it gets digested and demand sort of comes back,

he added.

The other challenge of faced in the country the ban on two-wheelers, after there were reports that they were being used by terrorists. This was expected to hit Bajaj Auto because it has a large market in motorcycle taxis that ply in the country. But, in the last earnings call, Sharma talked about it as a temporary hitch. He said that an outright ban would be a challenge to whoever tries to enforce it because there are millions dependent on the motorcycle taxis for their living and for transport. Even if there are restrictions, he added, they will be largely for the government to make a point and once that is made the company expected normalcy to return.

Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities downgraded Endurance Technologies Ltd to 'sell' from 'add' and reduced its target price to Rs 1,325 a share from the current market price.

At 9.20am, the scrip was trading at Rs 1,424 on the BSE, down 0.07 percent from its previous close. It declined 16 percent so far this year. The stock was down for four consecutive sessions and lost around 7 percent in this period.

Kotak expects Endurance earnings likely to be reduced as its key customer Bajaj Auto's performance to get impacted amid slowdown in two-wheeler export geographies, especially Africa and South Asia. Kotak expects Bajaj Auto's two-wheeler export volumes to decline by 8 percent year-on-year in FY23 estimates given inflationary pressures coupled with depressed incomes in Africa.

Endurance Tech derives 80 percent of standalone revenue from the two-wheeler segment while Bajaj Auto contributes over 45 percent of its revenues.

""Given severe rainfall deficit in key markets of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (25-30 percent of domestic two-wheeler industry volumes), we expect retail sales in the upcoming festive season to remain muted. Ramp-up of order wins across ABS and alloy wheel segments as well as foray into new products (driveline shaft, BMS and non-auto casting) will drive growth for the company; however, weak two-wheeler demand trends, especially in rural India and export geographies, will considerably impact the standalone performance,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in its recent note.

Kotak said it has cut the FY2023-25 consolidated EPS estimates by 4-5 percent due to 3 percent cut in standalone revenue assumptions.

For August 2022, Bajaj Auto’s total sales surged 8 percent year-on-year, while exports fell 28 percent to 1,44,840 from 2,00,675 in the year-ago period.

In the two-wheeler segment, the company recorded highest ever sales of Platina, while exports declined 32 percent year-on-year to 1,21,787.

Amsec, formerly Asian Markets Securities, is also concerned about the export business.

In its latest report, the firm said, “Exports from Bajaj Auto could come under significant pressure due to adverse macro factors at the importing countries (currency depreciation in LATAM, lower forex reserves may compel temporary import restrictions), Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Egypt crisis. August exports seem to reflect these concerns.”

On the back of export pain, The company’s Q1FY23 performance didn’t impress analysts. The auto major reported a good set of numbers with a 10.6 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 1,173 crore. Total income stood at Rs 8,005 cr, up 8.4 percent against Rs 7,386 crore in the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal.

While “hold” calls on the stock have risen to 15 in August from 10 three months ago, “sell” calls have gone up to seven from four over the same time period.

In 2022, so far, Bajaj Auto stock has given nearly 17 percent returns, while it has seen a sharp decline of 5 percent in the last month.

But it is not all gloom and doom.

According to Sharekhan, automobile original equipment makers (OEMs) are beginning to see improvement in dispatches, bookings, inquiries and customer footfalls, with the festive season kicking in.

""We expect two-wheeler volumes to recover, especially in the entry and executive motorcycle segment, which has been sluggish lately,” the brokerage firm said in its latest note. It recommended a “buy” rating on Bajaj Auto with a target price of Rs 4,800.

As central banks across the world take liquidity out of the markets to combat inflation and the Russia-Ukraine war rages on, concerns of a slowdown in economic growth have increased. Analysts have started cutting corporate earnings estimates.

Even so, a few sectors have bucked the trend with their earnings estimates upgraded for FY23 and FY24. The most prominent among them is automobiles, which is benefiting as headwinds confronting the sector, particularly semiconductor shortages and high raw material prices recede.

Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICI Securities, now sees FY23 Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the auto sector at Rs 46 and for FY24 at Rs 56. This is on average 11.5 percent higher than earlier estimates.

In FY22, the sector’s EPS was Rs 29. That means, by FY24, earnings are likely to almost double for auto companies.

This compares with an up to 9 percent cut in earnings estimates for other sectors led by telecom and oil and gas. Overall, ICICI Securities expects and 1.8 percent reduction in earnings for FY23 and FY24 (for which sectors).

The positive outlook for the auto sector is also evident from increased analyst coverage.

A Motilal Oswal analysis said sentiment on the sector has been positive with analyst coverage of auto companies improving 8 percent year on year in August.

Not just that, it found that among the Nifty constituents, Maruti Suzuki and Bajaj Auto were the most widely covered stocks on the Street (54 analysts covering each stock).

Changing fundamentals

Semiconductor supplies have returned to normal and prices of key raw materials like metals are off 30-40 percent from their recent highs, relieving margin pressure on auto companies.

“Commentary from leading chipmakers suggests weakening demand in consumer-focussed areas; most are still seeing strong orders for autos. Easing chip supplies would be positive for most Indian auto OEMs (original equipment manufacturers),” according to analysts at Jefferies.

Demand momentum has been strong for leading automakers, especially those having a broad range of sports utility vehicles (SUVs).

Such models from the likes of Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have waiting periods stretching into months. For instance, after the launch of the Scorpio N, Mahindra received 100,000 bookings within 30 minutes.

“Clearly, the auto space seems to be in a sweet space now,” said Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO, Envision Capital. “Unless, of course, some of the key input prices like steel head even higher than what we saw earlier this year.”

Yes Securities, in an analysis of the sector, said the demand outlook for passenger vehicles (PVs) and commercial vehicles (CVs) remains positive.

“We estimate domestic PV volumes are expected to grow at 11 percent CAGR over FY22-25 (v/s -5 percent CAGR over FY19-22), led by new launches and healthy replacement demand,” the analysis said. “MHCV demand too to see healthy cyclical recovery and grow at ~18.2 percent CAGR over FY22-25 (v/s -38.4 percent CAGR over FY19-22).” MHCV is short for medium and heavy commercial vehicle.

Not surprisingly, the Nifty Auto index is up 32 percent in the last one year while BSE Auto is up 35 percent. The likes of Tata Motors and TVS Motors have zoomed by up to 88 percent in this period.

The valuation of auto stocks has become richer. The BSE Auto Index one-year forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is at a 48 percent premium to the Nifty, close to the highest level in 10 years, noted Elara Capital, adding that investors should be cautious.

What to buy?

Most analysts prefer four wheeler (4Ws) makers and CV makers in the auto space over those manufacturing two wheelers (2Ws) and tractors. Some also see brighter days ahead for auto ancillary companies.

“We prefer 4Ws over 2Ws on strong demand and a stable competitive environment. We expect the CV cycle to gather further momentum in FY23. Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland are our top picks among OEMs while we like Bharat Forge, Samvardhana Motherson International, and Endurance Technologies among ancillaries,” said Deep Shah, Lead Analyst at YES Securities.

Elara Capital’s top picks in ancillary space are Apollo Tyres, Uno Minda, SAMIL, Bharat Forge and Minda Corp. Angel One has a buy rating on Ashok Leyland and Sona BLW with targets at Rs 175 and Rs 843, respectively.

With the abatement of the pandemic and ‘travel to office’ becoming the new normal, several automakers are now working on strategies to introduce quadricycles in the next couple of years. While Bajaj Auto is working on reintroducing its Qute quadricycle in a greener avatar, others like Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Hero MotoCorp are also working on a timeline for foraying into this segment.

A step up from a traditional autorickshaw, quadricycles are positioned by OEMs as a safer, cleaner and more comfortable alternative to a three-wheeler. Even though they are called quadricycles, they are motorized vehicles with four wheels and are slightly bigger than a three-wheeler and smaller than a typical car.

As per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) data, passenger three-wheeler sales in the domestic market rose from 135,414 units in FY21 to 183,607 units in FY22. The number of quadricycles also went up from 12 units in FY21 to 124 units in FY22.

Bajaj, hitherto the only player in the market and which was selling the Bharat Stage (BS)-IV compliant Qute quadricycle in select cities in the domestic market until March 2020, has officially confirmed that it will be coming up with a version complying with the BS-VI emission norms in the medium term.

Bajaj Auto executive director Rakesh Sharma confirmed that the quadricycle, which is currently in the ‘business development’ phase, will see a commercial rollout once it is homologated by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) next year. He also confirmed that there will be an electrical Qute as well. “That will be available in the medium to long term,” he said.

Bajaj had introduced the Qute, initially named RE60, a rear-engine, rear-wheel drive, four-seater quadricycle, aimed primarily at the domestic market as a replacement for the ubiquitous autorickshaw.

M&M is gearing up to roll out a fully-electric quadricycle Atom by 2023. The product has been designed to meet last-mile connectivity needs and was scheduled for a rollout towards the end of 2020. However, its commercial rollout was delayed by the pandemic.

Even though M&M is yet to reveal the pricing and availability details of the Atom EV quadricycle, it is expected to be available at a starting price of around Rs 3 lakh (ex-showroom) and will be taking on the Bajaj Qute, which costs around Rs 2.5 lakh.

When contacted, an M&M spokesperson said, “We cannot give any guidance on the Atom’s availability at the moment. We will share the details closer to the launch.”

Hero MotoCorp is also believed to be exploring this segment. A company spokesperson, though, denied any such plans. A senior official, on condition of anonymity, had earlier told Moneycontrol.com that the company is working on a class-changing vehicle, which can be used interchangeably as a two-wheeler or a three-wheeler.

Piaggio India and Tata Motors, which were at one time reported to be working on their own quadricycles, had shelved their plans. It could not be ascertained if either of them has revived its plans to launch quadricycles.

The four-wheeled vehicle has had a rough run in India. “As a concept, a quadricycle is the perfect transition from a two-wheeler to a four-wheeler. It has been a popular mode of transport in Europe, especially in countries like France, with many automakers in this segment. It’s the perfect intracity low-speed runabout providing the ideal benefit mix of compact size, low taxes, low price and economical operation. In India, the quadricycle as an approved vehicle category had been stonewalled for a long time by small car makers citing safety concerns. If three-wheelers could be allowed to ply on the roads, so can the quadricycle,” said Avik Chattopadhyay, an auto industry consultant and cofounder of Expereal, a branding and marketing consultancy.",630,0.9694346984227499

The wholesale numbers of automobile original equipment manufacturers for July 2022 are a mixed bag with passenger vehicles (PV) and two-wheelers (2W) outperforming other segments on a sequential basis. The easing of supply-side constraints is also discernible in the sequential growth of their monthly numbers. The numbers for electric vehicles (EVs) continued to move north, albeit on a small base. In this respect, Tata Motors (TaMo) provides the best clue. The company sold 4,022 units in July 2022, up 14.6...",182,0.9973702907562256

Led by Mahindra & Mahindra, auto stocks rose again on August 1, buoyed by strong monthly sales data. The largest Indian maker of utility vehicles gained after recording 100,000 orders for the all-new Scorpio-N within 30 minutes of the commencement of bookings.

The Nifty auto index rallied 410 points, or 3.3 percent, to end at record closing high of 12,953.65.

The index has been making higher highs and higher lows since mid-May despite volatility in benchmark indices, rising more than 35 percent since March lows.

Mahindra & Mahindra was the biggest gainer with a 6.2 percent rise, hitting a record high after receiving stellar demand for the Scorpio-N, bookings for which opened on Saturday.

Even its automobile sales increased by 30.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) to 56,148 units, though tractor sales fell 14 percent to 23,307 units in July.

Prabhudas Lilladher raised its domestic passenger vehicle (PV) volume estimates for M&M by around 3 percent and 2 percent, and earnings per share by 1 percent each for FY23 and FY24 respectively, and the June 2024 target price to Rs 1,400 (versus Rs 1,380 earlier), considering the extraordinary response to Scorpio-N and improving chip supplies.

""We are positively surprised with M&M's Scorpio-N clocking over 1 lakh bookings within 30 minutes of its commencement. Scorpio-N’s deliveries will begin from September 26, 2022 and M&M aims at delivering 20,000 units by December 2022 (i.e. average monthly run-rate of around 6.6k units) and this is despite its existing order book of 143,000 units,"" said the brokerage.

Also read - Nifty rallies 14% in 1.5 months to hit 17,300 points. Is it time to book profits?

M&M is one of Prabhudas Lilladher's preferred picks in the auto space given (1) a healthy turnaround in its auto segment through back-to-back successful launches in the highly competitive SUV space (2) its proactive leveraging of the electric vehicle trend that can lead to value unlocking (3) its leadership position in the tractor industry and (4) its well-played out capital allocation strategy.

Tata Motors was the second biggest gainer, rising 6.6 percent after the company reported a 51 percent year-on-year increase in July sales at 81,790 units, though on a low base as the year-ago month sales were affected by the second Covid wave.

Auto ancillary stocks Sona Comstar, Balkrishna Industries, Bosch, MRF, and Bharat Forge gained between 2 percent and 4 percent.

Commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland rose 3.5 percent as the company sold 13,625 units in the month gone by, up 58 percent compared to 8,650 units sold in same month last year.

Maruti Suzuki climbed 2.6 percent as the country's largest car maker sold 175,000 units in July, registering 8.3 percent growth YoY with domestic sales growing 10.2 percent YoY.

TVS Motor Company gained 2 percent, while Bajaj Auto rose 1.5 percent despite a 15 percent YoY decline in exports, as domestic sales grew by 9 percent YoY to 183,000 units, which resulted into a 4 percent decline in total sales for the month at 354,000.

Technically the Nifty Auto index has seen the formation of a large bullish candle on the daily charts.

YES Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

BJAUT’s 1QFY23 results were in line across parameters as revenues/EBITDA/Adj. PAT grew 8.4%/16%/11% YoY. ASPs continue to grow for second consecutive quarter by healthy 5.4% QoQ at Rs85.7k/unit led by better mix, + fx and price hikes. Gross RM inflation impact was ~3% in 1QFY23 (net impact of ~1% as price hike was ~2%) which is expected to be ~1.5% in 2QFY23. Overall demand outlook remained mix as 1) domestic 2W volumes expected to improve QoQ led by restocking ahead of festive on improved ECU supply, 2) exports near-term volume to be weak led by currency headwinds in key African markets, 3) 3W volumes expected to recover in near term but to normalize post restocking. However, healthy product mix, higher spare sales, INR depreciation and price hikes to help partially offset margin headwinds such as lower exports and 3W sales. Bajaj Auto is upping the game in domestic EV 2W space and expect to double Chetak’s run-rate in 2Q (v/s 6.2k units in 1Q) led by 1) increased distribution for Chetak and 2) new product launches in B2B segments (by leveraging Yulu). To factor in for INR depreciation, higher ASPs and easing of RM inflation, we raise FY23/24 EPS estimate by 6.4%/2.5% and build in revenue/EBITDA/Adj. PAT CAGR of 13%/19%/16% over FY22-24E.



Outlook

We maintain BUY with revised TP of Rs4,546 (18x Mar’24 EPS). Significant ramp-up in EV 2Ws/3Ws remain key re-rating triggers ahead. We like TVSL/EIM over BJAUT/HMCL among 2Ws space.

Bajaj Auto (BAL) is the 2nd largest motorcycle manufacturer and largest 3-W OEM domestically (FY22 market share at 18.2%, 61.5% respectively).

Outlook

We maintain HOLD rating on BAL primarily tracking lower than anticipated recovery in domestic 3-W sales volume and delay in electric 3-W launch. Upgrading our estimates, we now value BAL at Rs 4,180 on SOTP basis (16x PE on FY24E Core EPS, stake in PMAG; previous target: ₹3,950).

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Bajaj Auto

BJAUT’s Q1 EBITDA fell 5% qoq (3-yr CAGR: 3%) to Rs13bn but was 4% above our estimate due to the revenue beat. Though revenue was flat (3-yr CAGR: 1%) at Rs80bn, it also came in 4% above estimates on higher revenues from spares and better model mix. We expect a 7% volume CAGR in FY22-24, which is lower than the 12-13% CAGR for peers such as TVSL and HMCL, mainly due to subdued exports. We expect exports to decline by 2% in FY23, owing to adverse currency movements, high inflation and unfavorable government policies in Africa and the Middle East. We expect domestic volumes to see an FY22-24 CAGR of 13%, driven by the reopening of offices/educational institutions, better finance availability and favorable base effect. EV sales should improve in subsequent quarters on new products (3Ws, swappable battery vehicles, etc.), improving product availability in more cities and production ramp-up.

Outlook

We increase FY22-25 EPS estimates by 2%, factoring a decline in share capital by ~2% (assuming buy-back at ~Rs3,900/share). Maintain Buy with a TP of Rs4,200 (Rs4,100 earlier), based on 17x Sep’24E Core EPS (Jun’24E earlier), value of investments at Rs178/share and cash reserves of Rs639/share.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s 1QFY23 EBITDA margin surprised positively at 16.2% (-90bps QoQ, PLe: 15.9%) and came slightly above industry expectations. This was driven by increase in average realizations by 5% QoQ to Rs 85.7k/units on the back of higher share of exports in the mix (62% of overall volumes vs 58% in FY22), multiple pricing actions across geographies and higher USD realizations (Rs 77.4 vs Rs 75.5). Company highlighted that the quarter was impacted by semiconductor shortage; however, this situation has improved and new sources are developed. We downgrade Bajaj Auto to ‘HOLD’ as there remains some concern on the export side of the business which could lead to near-term volume pressure. As the company, currently has higher exposure to export markets, there are challenges in terms of rising inflation, global recession, currency devaluation and higher interest rates. Also, 3W demand still remains weak. However, domestic 2W segment has witnessed some recovery on the back of marriage season, opening up of colleges and offices.

Outlook

We expect this trend to continue. As the semiconductor issue is now easing out, Bajaj will be working on filling the channel inventories ahead of the festive season to meet demand. We now factor in lower volume growth of 7/11% for FY23/24E (vs 11/9% earlier). HOLD with a target price of Rs 4,120 (at 17x FY24E EPS). We see limited upside for the stock.

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company after its June quarter earnings

CLSA

Broking house maintained buy rating on the stock, while cut target price to Rs 4,677 from Rs 4,774 per share on the back of steady results with volume outlook improving.

The chip shortage easing and domestic volumes are going to pick up. CLSA cut two-wheeler export volume assumptions on concerns around Africa, reported CNBC-TV18.

Jefferies

Brokerage house Jefferies has kept buy rating on the stock with a target at Rs 4,500 per share.

The gross profit per vehicle rose 4 percent QoQ to a new high. Indian 2-wheelers are ripe for a big cyclical revival from an abnormal trough.

The export outlook, however, has worsened amid weaker currencies, reported CNBC-TV18.

Morgan Stanley

Brokerage firm has maintained equal-weight rating on the stock with a target at Rs 4,182 per share.

The exports have risen at 5 percent CAGR over FY12-22, but in FY22, it’s up 22 percent YoY.

Morgan Stanley expects exports to slow down, & this should cap margin expansion. The valuation is in-line with last five-year median. However, success in EVs is key upside risk, reported CNBC-TV18.

Motilal Oswal

While near-term export outlook is negative, improving supplies will boost BJAUT’s market share in the domestic market. The market share would further benefit over the long term from: a) the premiumization trend, b) the opportunity in exports, and c) the potential sizeable position in the Scooter market via EVs. While the domestic 3W market appears to be on the recovery path, it is still vulnerable to a possible disruption from electrification.

""We maintain our neutral rating, with Target Price of Rs 4,200/share,"" it said.

At 9:18am, Bajaj Auto was quoting at Rs 3,889.00, up Rs 10.80, or 0.28 percent on the BSE.

Highlights

- Volume continues to be under pressure due to chip shortage and challenging macros in various geographies

- Operating profit throws up a surprise

- Favourable currency exchange rate, better realisation, and product mix helped margin

- Business outlook positive for medium to long term

- Stock trading at reasonable valuation; buy with long-term perspective

---------------------------------------------------------

Bajaj Auto’s (CMP: Rs 3,888; M Cap: Rs 1,13,000 crore) Q1 FY23 results were better than expected.

Despite tepid demand, higher raw material prices, and supply-side constraints, the company reported an improvement in its operating margin on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. This was driven by price hikes, a rich product mix, and a favourable currency exchange rate.

We remain bullish on the business as the company plans to roll out new products and increase its market share. We also see a significant growth potential in the export markets. Moreover, the valuation of Bajaj Auto — 18.5 times FY24 projected earnings -- looks reasonable.

The June quarter

Weak demand scenario and supply-side constraintsMuted domestic demand coupled with a shortage of semiconductor chips in the two-wheeler (2W) segment led to an 8.21 percent decline in the company’s 2W volume on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.

In contrast, the company recorded a YoY growth of 163.41 percent in the three-wheeler (3W) segment. Growth was driven by the normalisation of the economy, post the pandemic.

In the export market, the company faced demand constraints due to the challenging macroeconomic situation in a few markets. It saw a decline of 4.31 percent in the 2W segment and a 47.82 percent in the 3W segment.

Despite an overall YoY decline of 7.19 percent in volumes, Bajaj Auto’s net revenue outperformed and posted a growth of 8.28 percent. What supported the top line was the 16.8 percent YoY growth in realisation, which came on the back of a price hike, undertaken to pass on the raw material price inflation, and a rich product mix.

Despite the negative operating leverage and the significant rise in raw material prices, the EBITDA margin, expanded by 101.2 basis points (bps) on a YoY basis. The expansion was driven by a rich product mix, price hikes, and better currency realisation.

Outlook

Domestic industry expected to pick upThe two-wheeler industry continues to face multiple headwinds by way of a subdued demand environment, and supply-chain disruptions due to the shortage of semiconductor chips. However, the management has indicated that the supply-side constraints seem to be easing as new sources have been developed.

It also indicated that economic hardship, post the pandemic, and the significant price rise, due to the safety norms and the pass-through of raw material cost, have dampened demand sentiments.

However, it is optimistic about a pick-up in the long-term demand on the back of the government’s focus on rural areas. A normal monsoon and robust crop production are expected to aid demand. Moreover, the opening up of schools/colleges and offices is expected to boost demand.

The management expects the 3W segment to do well, with the opening up of the broader economy and free movement of people across the country. It also highlighted that the order book continues to be very strong.

Export markets remain steadyThe momentum in international markets continues though production is being impacted by the chip shortage.

The company has also highlighted that market share in all the geographies remained steady despite taking price hikes. Further, the company has a higher proportion of premium bike sales in the export market. This should augur well for its financials.

KTM and Dominar exports continue to remain strong. The company has also achieved record sales in Latin America and became one of the leaders in the segment.

However, some countries are facing macroeconomic challenges, which may have a short-term impact on volumes.

New products to be key growth driversBajaj Auto feels the next leg of growth will come from the new variants of existing products or fresh offerings. The company plans to roll out many new models or upgrades in FY23. Bajaj Auto introduced the Pulsar N160, which is expected to become the benchmark for performance and control in the entry-sport segment.

Further, refreshed versions of Dominar 400 are expected to be launched in Q2. The roll-out of the new versions will help the company to expand its market share.

In the electric vehicle (EV) segment, the company has commissioned a new state-of-the-art plant this June, which will help the company to capitalise on the opportunities that EVs offer. Product trials have started and soon commercial EV production will start.

Supply-side constraints and cost inflation are easingLike any other automobile company, Bajaj Auto is facing production issues because of the shortage of semiconductor chips. However, unlike in the car-manufacturing industry, where the chip shortage impacts all products, only premium products are hit in the 2W space. Hence, only 20 percent of Bajaj Auto’s portfolio is hit by the shortage. The management says the constraints are easing as new supply sources have been developed. It is confident to bring inventories back to the normal level in Q2 FY23.

Another challenge is the significant rise in raw material prices, though the management indicated that it had passed on all cost inflation through price hikes. It, however, observed that prices have started correcting, especially of the metal pack, which will help the company to expand its margin.

Reasonable valuationBajaj Auto is trading at a reasonable valuation of 18.5 times its FY24 projected earnings. We advise investors to buy this stock with a long-term perspective.

RisksAny weakness in demand and a longer recovery period could hurt financials. Moreover, adverse commodity price movements would increase raw material costs and hurt operating profitability.

Two and three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto on July 26 clocked a 10.6 percent year-on-year growth in standalone profit at Rs 1,173.3 crore for the quarter ended June 2022, supported by strong operating profit and price hikes. Profit for the June 2021 quarter was at Rs 1,061.2 crore.

Standalone revenue for the quarter Rs 8,005 crore, up 8.4 percent from the year-ago quarter led by pricing and mix, the Pune-based auto company said in its BSE filing. However, the sales volume declined 7.2 percent.

Bajaj Auto has sold more than 9.33 lakh units during April-June period of this year, against 10.06 lakh units sold in same period last year, with two-wheeler volumes falling 6 percent and commercial vehicle segment volumes down 19 percent YoY.

""Sales in the quarter was significantly constrained by the inadequate availability of semi-conductors, although the situation improved in the latter part as new supply sources were developed,"" the company said.

Quarterly earnings beat analysts' expectations on all parameters. Profit was estimated at Rs 1,049 crore on revenue of Rs 7,560 crore for the quarter as per the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

The operating performance was strong following price hikes taken by the company and better foreign exchange realisation. EBITDA grew by 15.82 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,297 crore for the quarter ended June 2022 and margin for the quarter expanded by 104 bps YoY to 16.2 percent, which came in ahead of CNBC-TV18 poll estimates which was pegged at Rs 1,195 crore and 15.6 percent respectively.

EBITDA is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.

EBITDA growth and margin expansion was despite supply constraints, cost headwinds, and a weak macro-economic context, said Bajaj Auto, adding judicious price increases, better foreign exchange realisation and favourable mix offset the material cost inflation and enabled margin improvement.

However, gross margin fell by 200 bps YoY to 34.7 percent for the quarter ended June on account of higher input cost.

Bajaj Auto said it has sustained strong track record of cash generation, with surplus cash at Rs 20,509 crore as of June 2022, against Rs 19,090 crore as of March 2022.

The auto stocks have been investors' favourites as the index hit a nearly eight-month high on July 6, ahead of the June quarter earnings season.

The Nifty Auto index surged 2.6 percent or Rs 302 to 11,952.2, the highest closing level since November 18, 2021.

After a recent low touched on June 20, the index has rallied nearly 11 percent and from March lows, it has risen more than 29 percent, which has been the highest among sectors. The rally has been on the back of a decline in metal prices, the key raw material used by the sector. The Nifty Metal index, on the other hand, has corrected more than 31 percent from its all-time high hit in April this year.

On Wednesday, most stocks participated in the rally with Tube Investment of India being the biggest gainer - up 8.5 percent. Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki India, Hero MotoCorp and Bosch gained more than 3 percent each, while MRF, Bajaj Auto, and Mahindra & Mahindra climbed over 2 percent each.

June Sales Performance

In the recently ended month, passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle segments reported strong performance on a year-on-year as well as a sequential basis, though there was a decline in tractors sales on a high base of last year.

""Commercial vehicle (CV) sector continued to shine as its underlying drivers are very much in place. Passenger vehicles (PV) have a strong order book but supply concern still prevails,"" LKP Securities said.

Interestingly, the chip shortage is resolving at a good pace now and is expected to get resolved by the festive season. New launches coupled with existing demand are expected to act positively on the PV sector, the brokerage added.

On the two-wheeler segment, LKP said the marriage season in rural parts of North India yielded some positivity in 2-wheeler sales. ""Sentimentally, too, we see 2-wheeler demand moving up. The low base of last year is also helping.""

The brokerage remains positive on the entire automobile sector and its top picks are Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki India, Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, and Tata Motors.

Every dip in these stocks in the short term (driven by higher input costs, supply chain issues etc), shall provide good opportunities for investors to enter into them from a medium to long-term perspective, LKP advised.

The automobile retail registration data reported by FADA indicates total vehicle retail for June 22 increased by 27 percent YoY with growth across categories i.e. 2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, PV, tractors and CV. However, compared with the pre-COVID level of June 2019, total vehicle retail was down by 9 percent with a sharper decline in 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler.

""Though few categories are consistently showing recovery, full recovery is yet to be witnessed when compared to pre-covid times. Increased wholesale reflects ease in semi-conductor availability thus reducing supply side constraints going ahead,"" said Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities.

He expects a strong bounce back in 2HFY23 with rural recovery post favourable monsoon and further ease on semiconductor availability. He further expects YoY volume growth across categories in FY23E with M&HCVs and 3Ws expected to record more than 30 percent growth.

All eyes on earnings season

The auto companies' earnings are expected to be robust on a year-on-year basis as the base was impacted by the second COVID wave, while the sequential performance may be moderately lower due to chip shortage issue in the PV segment, and seasonality-led decline in CV, which is on expected lines, but given the easing raw material prices, the margin may bottom out in June quarter, experts said.

""Near normal economic activity, healthy retail sales (Q1FY23 averaging at around 92 percent of pre-Covid levels), robust demand in PV segment amid new launches in the SUV domain, cut in excise duty on fuels (Rs 8 per litre on petrol, Rs 6 per litre on diesel) in May 2022 and plummeting key raw material prices (mainly metals) towards the fag end of the quarter post their peak in April-May 2022 were the key highlights for Q1FY23,"" ICICI Direct said.

The brokerage expects total industry volumes in Q1FY23 to jump up around 10 percent QoQ led by the robust performance of the industry leader in the 2-wheeler space with the rest of the categories (PV, 3-wheeler, CV) witnessing de-growth QoQ.

Kotak Institutional Equities forecasts revenues for the auto stocks under its coverage to decline by 1 percent QoQ in Q1FY23 led by chip shortage impacting PV production volumes and a decline in CV segment volumes due to seasonality, which will be offset by a recovery in the 2-wheeler segment volumes and higher average selling prices.

The research house expects EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to decline by 6 percent QoQ due to raw material headwinds.

After excluding Tata Motors, ICICI Direct expects the segment to report 1.5 percent QoQ topline growth & around 10 bps QoQ margin improvement with PAT expected to decline 9.7 percent QoQ primarily tracking exceptional gains in Q4FY22 (Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto).

However, on a YoY basis, operational performance is likely to be robust at high double-digit growth due to COVID impacted lower sales in the base year, the brokerage said.

Technical View

Technically, the Nifty Auto index has seen a robust bullish candlestick pattern formation, which resembles a Bullish Engulfing kind of pattern. On the monthly as well as weekly scale, too, there was a bullish candlestick formation.

MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicated that the trend is positive while RSI and Stochastic also showed positive sentiments on the daily, weekly as well as monthly scales.

The Pune-based firm had brought back its iconic Chetak scooter in electric avatar in October 2019.

""Seeing the enthusiastic demand for this iconic model, the company has increased the touchpoints to 20 locations in FY 2022. This is expected to grow to 75 in FY 2023,"" the company said in its Annual Report for 2021-22. Initially, Chetak was sold from only two locations, Pune and Bengaluru. The company noted that when bookings for the model were first rolled out in early 2020, it had to be stopped on account of COVID.

""When we restarted online bookings on April 13, 2021, we had to stop 48 hours later, owing to overwhelming demand,"" it noted. During the last fiscal, the company said it has sold 8,187 units of the e-scooter.

""We are committed to the development of Electric Vehicles (EVs). Chetak is the first example. The setting up of Chetak Technology Ltd as a fully owned subsidiary of Bajaj Auto will aid in the research, development, production and sale of EVs,"" the company stated. These are the vehicles of tomorrow and we want to be an active player in this space, Bajaj Auto informed shareholders.

Elaborating on the chip shortage issue, Bajaj Auto Chairman Niraj Bajaj said the issue is expected to impact the company's production volume. ""There is no doubt in my mind nor should it be in yours that Bajaj Auto has a complete suite of profitable two-and three-wheelers that can significantly increase the domestic and international market share and earn higher sales, revenues and profits.

""However, in all my years as a fiduciary of your company, I have never seen it face such a global supply constraint that it has in terms of the sheer scarcity of semiconductors,"" he said. No modern automobile can exist without a slew of semiconductor chips. Motorcycles and top-of-the-line EVs like the Chetak are no exceptions, Bajaj said.

""It is difficult to predict when this supply scarcity will end. But till then, this will constrain your company's production volumes, as it will for all other automobile manufacturers,"" Bajaj stated. All advanced technology components like the ABS system, FI systems, advanced displays like Thin Film Transistors (TFT), telematics and critical sensors have been affected due to the chip shortage, the company said.

R&D is working hard to create alternate configurations and homologating these as soon as possible, it added. Bajaj Auto also informed shareholders that domestic motorcycle sales came down after two years of impressive growth in FY18 and FY19.

""Between FY 2019 and FY 2022, domestic motorcycle sales for the industry as a whole has fallen by almost 34 per cent in terms of volume. In this environment, Bajaj Auto has been able to arrest its decline in sales and raise market share from 18 per cent in FY 2021 to 18.2 per cent in FY 2022,"" it noted.",506,0.4237441761153085

Bajaj Auto on Monday said it has commenced its Rs 2,500 share buyback programme. In a regulatory filing, the Pune-based company said the buyback initiative has begun with effect from July 4.

After a day’s break, auto stocks were back in the limelight with the sectoral index gaining more than 1 percent on June 28 and recouping the previous day's losses. The consistent buying came ahead of monthly sales data which will be released from July 1.

Among auto and auto ancillary stocks, Tube Investments of India jumped more than 7 percent, followed by Mahindra &Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, TVS Motor Company, Bharat Forge, and MRF that gained 1.5-3 percent.

Exide Industries, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Bosch, Hero MotoCorp, Balkrishna Industries, and Amara Raja Batteries also ended in the green.

The Nifty auto index closed 1.25 percent higher at 11,832, taking the total gain to more than 10 percent since it hit a recent low on June 20. The major reason behind the outperformance is the stability in metal prices, which is a key material for vehicle makers.

June sales expectations

June sales figures are expected to show that all automobile segments barring tractors and two-wheelers posted strong growth year-on-year largely on a low base in 2021 when India was battling the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Emkay Global Financial Services conducted a channel check to gauge the sales volumes in June. ""The channel checks indicate commercial vehicles (CVs) maintaining positive growth momentum on a sequential basis in June 2022. Tractor volumes are also likely to trend higher in a seasonally strong month,"" the securities firm said.

Further, ""2-wheelers volumes would be better for most original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) thanks to a ramp-up in production. In comparison, passenger vehicle (PV) volumes should be a mixed bag for listed OEMs,"" it added.

In the commercial vehicles segment, on a sequential basis, Emkay expects positive sales growth for Ashok Leyland at 9 percent, Tata Motors at 8 percent and Eicher Motor-VECV at 1 percent, and a slight decline for M&M at 5 percent.

Among makers of passenger vehicles, domestic sales by volume should grow 2 percent month-on-month at Tata Motors, Emkay said. It predicted a decline of 1 percent for Maruti Suzuki and 3 percent for M&M.

For the industry, Emkay expects a sequential improvement due to better production and higher dispatches to dealerships. ""Vehicle discounts have decreased month-on-month and remain significantly lower than the elevated levels seen in the past,"" it said.

Tractor sales by volume are likely to improve month-on-month, with a growth of 11 percent for Escorts and 10 percent for M&M in the domestic market. Sales growth has been restricted in the countryside because farmers have been hit by lower crop realizations in recent months, the research house said.

In the two-wheeler space in the domestic market, on a sequential basis, Bajaj Auto may report 4 percent growth in sales, Royal Enfield 3 percent, and TVS Motor 2 percent after a ramp-up in production and higher demand from salaried individuals and students, it said.

Emkay expects an 8 percent decline for Hero MotoCorp in domestic sales. Last month was better for Hero MotoCorp because of the strong demand in the marriage season.

Emkay Global has retained a positive view on the auto sector. ""Among OEMs, we are positive on Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Escorts, while in the ancillaries segment, we prefer Motherson Sumi and Minda Industries,"" it said.

Technical setup

Technically, the auto index is looking strong as it has formed a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily charts, indicating the uptrend may stay intact. Since the March lows, the index has been making higher highs and higher lows, which is a positive indication.

Even moving average convergence and divergence (MACD), the trend indicator, has retained its uptrend. The relative strength index has moved to the 66 levels. On a weekly basis, too, these indicators posted a positive trend.

Most analysts maintained their neutral stance on Bajaj Auto after the company announced buyback of shares at a 20 percent premium to the prevailing prices. Assuming the buyback happens at a maximum price of Rs 4,600, it will buy back about 54 lakh shares.

The analysts are concerned about the stock’s valuation at the current prices which, some believe, does not leave much room for an upside. There are other risks of a slowdown in exports as well amid rising inflation and recession worries.

Morgan Stanley maintained its equal weight (EW) stance on the stock, citing in-line valuations and risk of high-margin export slowdown. At the end of the March quarter, the company had said its export volume for January-March period fell by 8 percent.

The company has said its international business recorded its highest ever sales of over 2.5 million vehicles for FY22. With sales of over $2 billion, exports now contribute over 52 per cent of its net sales. So, any slowdown at this front will hurt the company.

One relief is that the company will continue to hold a sizable cash balance after the buyback. As on March 2022, surplus cash and cash equivalents with Bajaj Auto stood at Rs 19,090 crore, following a dividend payout of Rs 4,051 crore.

Morgan Stanley has a target of Rs 4182, meaning a potential upside of about 10 per cent from current prices.

UBS also maintained its neutral stance, keeping the target price at Rs 3,800, which is close to the current prices. The broker said reduction in paid-up share cap will be 2.2 percent, assuming maximum buyback. It prefers TVS Motor and Eicher Motors in the two-wheeler space.

Some analysts and market participants believe given the cash at hand, buyback size of Rs 2,500 crore is “underwhelming”. The impact is also visible on the share price that fell another 1.5 percent on Tuesday.

Citi also maintained sell with a target price of Rs 3,400, citing low capex in recent years, headwinds in demand in expert markets and losing market share to its competitors.

Though some domestic analysts believe these concerns are a bit overblown.

Ashwin Patil, Senior Research Analyst at LKP Securities, believes that the stock definitely holds a good value through its intrinsic performance and can reach levels of Rs 4,400, and deserves a buy rating. He warned that investors should not hope that the buyback will drive the prices though.

""It's an open market buyback and not through a tender offer. This means that the stock may not reach those levels by the time the buyback offer closes. Therefore for retail investors, there may not be any significant upside because of this buyback,” he said.",450,-0.32547341452704537

Auto stocks extended gains for yet another session on June 24, with the Nifty Auto index rising 2 percent as most shares witnessed a long build-up given the stability in metal prices that had raised concerns over margins.

The Auto index has done well in the charts, seeing the formation of higher highs and higher lows, particularly since the troughs witnessed in March, which appear to be its bottom this year.

The Nifty Auto index had gained 2 percent. TVS Motor Company and M&M gained 3.5 percent and 4.3 percent respectively, while Hero MotoCorp climbed over 3 percent on reports that the two-wheeler maker has decided to hike its motorcycles and scooters prices from July 1.Eicher Motors, and Maruti Suzuki jumped 2 percent and 1 percent respectively. Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, and Bajaj Auto gained 0.2-0.8 percent, while auto ancillary companies such as Sona Comstar, MRF, and Bosch rose between 1-4 percent.

Tube Investments of India, the flagship company of the Murugappa group, was the biggest gainer, rising 4.9 percent as Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,900, implying 25 percent potential upside from Thursday's closing price.

“Tube Investments offers diversified revenue streams, with strong growth in the core business (around 25 percent CAGR), ramp-up in CG Power and optionality of new businesses incubated under TI-2 strategy. At the consolidated level, we estimate revenue, EBITDA, and PAT CAGR of around 15 percent, 20 percent, and 20 percent over FY22-25, respectively,” said the brokerage.

CAGR is compound annual growth rate. CG Power (formerly Crompton Greaves) was acquired in 2020. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. PAT is profit after tax.

The Nifty Auto index has gained 20 percent since its March lows, turning out to be the biggest gainer among all sectors, pricing in expected benefits of falling commodity prices, especially steel and aluminium, the key material for making vehicles, resulting in easing cost pressure.

“The automobile sector will also see benefits of cooling commodity prices like steel and aluminium. New steel contracts could get negotiated at a lower price which will help improve the margins. The chip shortage will also start to abate significantly in the forthcoming quarters, helping top OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) raise production,” said Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer at Axis Securities.

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said volume outlook across segments is constructive and companies have taken price hikes but cost pressures are easing.

The global research house is overweight on Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, M&M and Eicher Motors. “We are equal-weight on Bajaj Auto & Samvardhana Motherson, whereas we are underweight on Amara Raja Batteries, TVS Motor Company and Hero MotoCorp,” it said in a report.

The board of Bajaj Auto, which held a meeting on June 14, decided to defer the share buyback plan which was brought before it for consideration.

The company, in a regulatory filing, said it will not move ahead with the proposed plan as of now as it requires ""further deliberations"".

""We wish to inform that the Board of Directors of the company at its meeting held today i.e. 14 June 2022, has decided that further deliberations are required in order to take a decision on the proposal of buyback, and accordingly deferred the matter,"" it said.

Bajaj Auto's stock dropped to Rs 3,641.05 per share at the BSE, the lowest in 19 months, as investors pared bets after the company deferred the buyback

If the board would have approved the proposal, this would have been the first share buyback to be made by the two-wheeler major in the last 22 years.

The last instance, when the company's board had cleared such a proposal, dates back to the year 2000, when 1.8 crore equity shares were bought back at Rs 400 a piece.

Bajaj Auto, notably, reported lower-than-expected sales data for May. It clocked a total sales of 2.75 lakh units during the month, which was below Nomura India Securities’ estimate of 3.12 lakh.

Sales volumes in May grew merely 1 percent on a year-on-year basis and were down by more than 34 percent from the pre-pandemic levels - as recorded in May 2019.

The muted sales performance was led by a weak month for exports for the company. Two-wheeler exports slumped 15 percent on-year to 1.53 lakh units, while three-wheeler exports fell 67 percent to 10,163 on-year in May.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s 4QFY22 EBITDA margin surprised positively at 17.1% (+190bps QoQ, PLe: 14.9%) driven by 1) deferral of raw material cost (RM cost at 71.9% of sales vs 74.7% QoQ), 2) positive impact of price increase, 3) improved USD realization in exports and 4) favorable sales mix. Deferred RM cost will cause an impact of 3.5-4% in 1QFY23, against which ~1.5% price hike taken in Apr22. We remain positive on BJAUT’s growth prospects as (1) domestic 2W volumes are expected to grow in near-term led by marriage season, opening up of colleges and offices (however genuine demand needs to be monitored post Jun-22), (2) exports demand will likely remain steady and (3) 3W volumes (+28% in FY22) to pick-up momentum post opening up of the economy and increasing CNG demand. Considering near-term risks like commodity cost inflation and chip shortage, we trim our margin estimates by 90/60bps for FY23/24.

Outlook

Maintain ‘ACCUMULATE’, with a revised TP of Rs 4,120 at 17x FY24E EPS (earlier 16x) on improving domestic outlook for 2Ws and 3Ws, along with increasing volumes of EVs.

LKP Research's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto Limited (BAL) reported impressive and better then expected results in Q4 FY22 led by 3Ws and exports. Topline fall at 8% yoy and 12% qoq was lower than expected despite volumes dipping by about 17% yoy in the quarter offset by ASP growth at 10% on price hikes taken and better product & geography mix. This was a sequential fall of 12%. Sequentially the volume fall was 17% as well. During the quarter, domestic motorcycles de-grew by 30% yoy, while 3Ws were up by 8% yoy. Exports motorcycles de-grew by 7% yoy, while 3Ws fell by 11%. EBITDA dropped by 10% yoy to ₹13.7 bn, while margins moved upto 17.7%, a growth of 210 bps qoq, while remaining flat yoy. Margins moved up sequentially as RM costs to sales eased a bit (74.2% as % of sales) and some arresting of employee costs was also seen. All other cost items below operating levels remaining more or less range bound, bottomline came in 13% down yoy and 5% down qoq at ₹11.53 bn as tax rate was up at 27%. During FY22, revenues grew by 18.4%, led by 8% volume growth and 10% ASP hike. EBITDA margins were down at 15.9% on severe cost pressure stemming from RM costs. Adjusted Bottomline was at ₹47 bn, up by 3.3%.



Outlook

Improving product and geographic mix, favorable currency movement and price hikes should assist margins in the ensuing years. With strong balance sheet, robust return ratios, strong dividend payout (₹140/ share announced yesterday), hefty dividend yield of 3.6% in FY22 and zero financial leverage, we believe the stock looks attractive at 15x FY 24E earnings. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a higher target price of ₹4,395 (at 17x FY 24E earnings) on improving volume and margins expectations.

Bajaj Auto forecast a 15-20% slide in motorcycle volumes in June quarter from shortage of semiconductor chips.

Rakesh Sharma, executive director, also warned that increasing cell prices may delay the pace of transition to electric vehicles. He said this will impact mostly the domestic business unit and to a smaller extent sports brands in international markets.

April was the worst month in terms of semiconductor availability.

Bajaj Auto continues to face severe supply chain challenges, impacting the sale of motorcycles and commercial vehicles, the company said. The firm said a severe shortage of semiconductors led to a steep decline in the domestic motorcycle business.

Bajaj Auto reported an 18% decline in total two wheeler volumes in the March quarter while commercial vehicles volume fell 4% from a year ago. Domestic two wheeler volumes slipped 30% while commercial vehicles volumes dropped 8%.

""Overall performance in Q4 was a reasonably strong one given the backdrop of weakened domestic demand, rising costs and supply chain dislocation -- amidst this we reported our second highest quarterly as well as annual profit,"" said Sharma.

On the cost side, the firm said it definitely sees some headwinds, and believes it may see about a 3.5% increase in cost.

Bajaj Auto's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 10% to Rs 1396 crore while margins shrank to 17.5% in March quarter because of high raw material prices and lower domestic sales.

International business for FY22 recorded the highest ever sales of over 2.5 million units. With sales of over $2 billion, exports now make up over 52 per cent of net sales in value terms, the firm added.",282,-0.38228663471009994

Profit was aided by an exceptional income of Rs 315 crore from incentive receivable from Maharashtra for the April 2015 to March 2021 period and Rs 31 crore receivable for the April 2021 to March 2022 period.

The revenues for the Pune-based automaker came in at Rs 7,975 crore, declining 7.2 percent from Rs 8,596 crore reported in the corresponding period last year.

Bajaj Auto has reported a huge decline in domestic sales for March 2022. The company reported a 20% decline in total vehicle sales at 2,97,188 units in March compared to the year-ago period. Two-wheeler sales stood at 2,56,324 units, down 22% over 3,30,133 units sold in March 2021.

The semiconductor shortage continued to drag the auto industry, said Rakesh Sharma, the Executive Director at Bajaj Auto.

""Declines in March are due to shortfalls on the semiconductor front. This has hit us by about 30-40 percent. The supply crisis became quite acute in March. Otherwise, the result would have been better. The decline was largely in motorcycles,"" Rakesh Sharma said speaking with CNBC-TV18, stressing semiconductor shortage has affected them.

On potential price hikes that will be passed on, he said, ""In Q4, there were marginal increases in input costs - 0.5%. We have to see how this will settle down going forward.""

Reacting to the unprecedented surge in input costs and speaking about outlook with respect to margins going ahead, he said, as an increase in input cost can put pressure on them, it would be passed on to end-users.

When asked to comment on the effective price increase the company is looking at, he said, ""We are looking at some price increase in April but for that numbers should firm up.""

""Pressure is building due to material cost prices rising on account of supply chain crisis. And, we are looking to pass this on to pricing. We will have to be careful because there is a decline in demand in retail in India,"" Sharma said.

Speaking on the segment which gave them profits, the executive added, ""We have 70 percent of exports in the three-wheelers and non-semiconductor used vehicles category. And, we have performed very well on this front. We had an outstanding year on exports - 2.5 million. The three-wheeler business was robust in March with traffic coming back to the road. Market share in three-wheelers climbed to 70 percent. It was our profitability segment.""

As the chip delivery wait time grows on account of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Sharma said they expect problems over semiconductor availability would get solved by early July, and production impairment would also get resolved by then.

On being asked whether demand is improving on domestic sales, he said that though the retail story is strong and progressing well as of now, the overall scenario in motorcycles is still soft. He said, ""The overall demand at the retail level in motorcycles in India is soft due to double-digit decline of 30% as per the Vaahan data. For the moment there are stocks on the ground and they will thin out as we go into April and May. Retails are also higher than what the industry is expecting.""

Reacting to the spike in crude oil prices, he explained that it boded well for its exports since they have over 50% exports to oil-producing countries like Africa.

He said, ""Rise in crude oil prices helpful to an extent. Over 50% of exports aimed for Africa which are oil-producing nations. High crude prices helped in demand in Africa and other oil-producing nations.""",536,-0.4085049466653304

ICICI Securities research report on Bajaj Auto

Since its Q3FY22 result, Bajaj Auto (BJAUT) has outperformed NIFTY50 by ~15% amid worsening outlook on profitability, rising fuel prices and flattish demand outlook in key export markets. Though we keep our FY23E revenue estimates largely unchanged, we trim FY23E EBITDA margin by ~300bps to ~14.5% due to surge in RM costs, resulting in 2% cut in FY24E earnings. Though recent cost inflation would get partially reflected in Q4FY22, bulk of it would come Q1FY23E onward. We continue to build-in 12% domestic motorcycle volume CAGR in FY22E-FY24E with market share at 18.5%. With key 2W overseas markets either showing static demand or a declining bias, we expect BJAUT’s 2W export volumes to grow at 8% CAGR in FY22-FY24E. Cost of key input commodities like steel, aluminum and plastic/polymer has increased by 15-40% QoQ and blended RM/unit in Q3FY22 was at ~Rs57k. A ~15% increase in RM basket cost would require a price hike of ~Rs9k/unit, to keep gross profit/unit neutral.

Outlook

We downgrade the stock to HOLD from Add, with an unchanged DCF based target price of Rs3,575, implying 15.5x FY24E core earnings, Rs785/share cash and Rs130/share value of stake in KTM entity.

Over the past few months, incidents of electric vehicles (EV) catching fire have been reported from several parts of the country. In light of such occurrences, experts from the automobile industry are looking at better validation at the manufacturing stage and the causal side of these issues.

Rashmi Urdhwareshe, former director, Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), is of the view that there should be a rigorous validation at the EV design stage before the products are introduced in the market.

''Unless a complete validation has been done at the laboratories and at the manufacturer's side, the consumer should not be subjected to high initial risks that come with any new product,'' Urdhwareshe said in an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18.

Additionally, Abraham Joseph, Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of Bajaj Auto, stresses the causal part of recent incidents.

''We need to work upon preventing these problems from happening. That will happen by solid validation, multiple layers of safety, strategy, and quick action,'' Joseph said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

Joseph also talked about a customer should make their choice and what are some of the key things to keep in mind while purchasing an electric vehicle.

''Customers should buy an electric vehicle from a company of repute and check independent reviews, track record of the firm. All control units and devices should be checked for having zero faults,'' suggests Joseph.

According to experts, customers should study the thermal safety systems of the battery pack before buying an electric vehicle. Among safety precautions, customers should avoid parking EV in high temperatures for prolonged periods.

The charging should be done in sheltered area and there should be no inflammable material. Customers should also get report on the battery health every three months

In case an EV catches fire, the best way to handle the situation is to douse the fire with lots of fire to bring down the temperature of the vehicle system, according to Joseph.

Also Read: What separates a reliable EV from a potential fire hazard?

The vehicle should be kept in an open space and a CO2 extinguisher can be used as an interim measure to douse the fire before the fire department arrives at the scene.

On March 28, the government decided to depute a team of independent experts to investigate two incidents of electric two-wheelers catching fire, CNBC-TV18 reported, quoting government sources. An Ola electric scooter and an Okinawa electric bike recently caught fire, leaving many customers concerned.

The experts will travel to Vellore and Pune to probe whether structural or external factors have caused the fire in the Ola electric scooter and the Okinawa electric bike.",455,-0.09797964990139008

After a stellar run in the previous two weeks, India’s stock market entered a consolidation phase and there was some profit booking as the key indices declined in four of the five sessions in the week ended March 25. Mounting inflation concerns amid elevated commodity prices including crude oil that climbed above $120 a barrel again and the continuing war between Ukraine and Russia weighed on market sentiment.

The Nifty 50 lost 0.8 percent during the week to close a tad above 17,150 after a 6.4 percent rally in two straight sessions previously. The important point to note is that the index consistently stayed above the crucial 17,000 mark as well as the 200-day moving average (at about 17,030) in the past six straight sessions. There was rangebound trade and mild profit taking, indicating that the level could act as a crucial support, while the upside resistance was at 17,450, above which the index could rise to 17,800-17,900, experts said.

“Let's see how things unfold and if there is no aberration globally, we are most likely to hold the sacrosanct support zone of 17,000-16,900,” said Sameet Chavan, chief analyst-technical and derivatives, at Angel One.

He said the first half of the forthcoming week would certainly give us a fair idea of the short-term direction. Till then, 17,350-17,450 are to be considered as the immediate hurdles.

Apart from that, the broader market did extremely well last week, with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising 1 percent and 0.25 percent, respectively.

“We expect it to continue in the current week as well. Hence traders can look to identify such potential themes to fetch higher returns,” Chavan said.

Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on March 25 closing prices:

Expert: Nandish Shah, Senior Derivative & Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities

EIH: Buy | LTP: Rs 149 | Stop-Loss: Rs 142 | Target: Rs 165 | Return: 11 percent

The EIH stock price has broken out from a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart with higher volumes. The stock price has also broken out on the weekly line chart where it closed at the highest level since December 2019.

The stock price has been taking support at the 200-day EMA (exponential moving average). Oscillators like relative strength index (RSI) and money flow index (MFI) are placed above 60 and rising, indicating strength in the stock’s current uptrend.

Hotel stocks are looking good on the charts for the short to medium term.

VIP Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 689 | Stop-Loss: Rs 650 | Target: Rs 760 | Return: 10 percent

VIP has broken out on the daily chart with higher volumes where it closed at an all-time high. The stock price has broken out from the symmetrical triangle on the daily chart.

The RSI and MFI are placed above 60 and rising, indicating strength in the current uptrend. The directional indicator (DI) is trading above minus DI, while the average directional index (ADX) line is placed above 25, indicating momentum in the current uptrend.

Mahindra Holidays and Resorts India: Buy | LTp; Rs 234 | Stop-Loss: Rs 220 | Target: Rs 262 | Return: 12 percent

The stock price has broken out from a symmetrical triangle on the weekly chart with higher volumes where it closed at the highest since November 18, 2021. The stock has been taking support at the 200-day EMA over the past couple of months.

The RSI and MFI have witnessed a trendline breakout, indicating a higher possibility of a sharp rise in the price in the coming days. Hotel stocks are looking good for the short to medium term.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

ICICI Bank: Buy | LTP: 699 | Stop-Loss: Rs 675 | Target: Rs 735 | Return: 5 percent

After a short-term correction, the stock has formed a higher bottom pattern. The stock has recovered over 10 percent from the monthly lowest level. A promising pullback rally along with a higher bottom formation indicate a further uptrend from current levels.

Currently, the stock is trading above the 20-day SMA (simple moving average). Looking at the overall pattern, it offers a buying opportunity for positional traders with a decent risk-reward ratio. The trend reversal move is likely to continue up to Rs 735.

SBI Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,093 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,054 | Target: Rs 1,165 | Return: 6.6 percent

After a medium-term correction, the stock took support near Rs 1,000 and reversed. Post-reversal, SBI Life is holding a higher low formation, which is broadly positive. Currently, the stock is consolidating in the Rs 1,070 to Rs 1,140 range.

The stock completed one leg of correction and promising reversal formation, indicating a strong possibility of a quick pullback rally from current levels.

Unless it trades below Rs 1,054, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 1,165. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any, between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,080 with a stop-loss below Rs 1,054.

Bajaj Auto: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,654 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,529 | Target: Rs 3,900 | Return: 6.7 percent

From the monthly lowest level, the stock rallied over 15 percent. On the daily and intraday charts, the stock consistently formed a higher bottom formation, which is broadly positive.

In addition, after a long time, it closed above Rs 3,650 on the weekly charts. As long as the stock trades above Rs 3,529, the chances of hitting Rs 3,900 turn bright. We expect the uptrend formation to continue unless it slips below Rs 3,529.

Expert: Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities

Mindtree: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,281 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,780 | Target: Rs 4,580-4,890 | Return: 7-14 percent

The stock has broken out at about Rs 4,280 after consolidating at the 50 EMA level. The stock has formed a major support level at Rs 3,540.

Volumes are expanding, with the weekly 14 period RSI showing a positive indication, which suggests further strength in the stock price.

The stock can move upwards from here. We recommend a buy with a stop-loss of Rs 3,780 and possible price targets are Rs 4,580-4,890.

Hindalco Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 623 | Stop-Loss: Rs 569 | Target: Rs 690 | Return: 11 percent

On the weekly charts, the stock is trading above all major moving averages. After reaching a high of Rs 551 in October 2021, the stock has gained support at Rs 407 and has moved upwards since.

However, the stock recently broke its previous high and went up to Rs 630. Also, on the daily charts, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) crossed its signal line, which qualifies as a bullish trend in the stock.

We recommend a buy with a stop-loss of Rs 569 and a possible price target of Rs 690.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Larsen & Toubro Infotech: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,183 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,960 | Target: Rs 6,565 | Return: 6 percent

The IT space is witnessing a gradual recovery post the recent short-term corrective phase. After a pricewise correction, the stock managed to form a support around its ‘200 DEMA’ and has seen some consolidation.

The stock is on the cusp of a breakout from a consolidation on the lower time frame charts and this should lead to a resumption of its uptrend in the short term.

The risk-reward ratio is favourable at current levels to initiate fresh longs and hence, short-term traders should look for buying opportunities in this stock.

Traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 6,180-6,170 with a stop-loss placed below Rs 5,960 and a potential target of Rs 6,565.

The stock managed to consolidate in a range when the broader markets were correcting and hence, has seen a relative outperformance. The longer-term trend for the stock is still positive and the recent consolidation just seems to be a timewise correction within an uptrend.

In the past couple of sessions, volumes have picked up along with the price rise and the short-term moving average (5 DEMA) has given a positive crossover over the medium term (20 DEMA).

The RSI-smoothed oscillator is also indicating a positive momentum. This indicates the probability of a resumption of the broader uptrend and hence, traders should look to buy this stock for the short term.

Traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy the stock in the range of Rs 240-238 for a potential target of Rs 252 in the near term. One should place a stop-loss below Rs 233 on long positions.

The electric vehicle market in India is picking up steam more than ever before and while four-wheelers seem to be coming out from the major auto manufacturers, two-wheelers aren’t seeing as much steam. Two-wheeler EVs are currently limited to a select few scooters from bigger brands like the Chetak from Bajaj Auto and the iQube from TVS and then there is Ather and Ola.

But this hasn’t stopped indigenous companies from launching their own products. The latest addition to the electric motorcycle market is an e-bike called Rorr launched by Bengaluru based startup, Oben EV. Launched at Rs 99,999, the Oben Rorr is fairly game changing, both in terms of design and features. But what makes this bike special? Here are five highlights of the Oben Rorr e-bike

Unique street fighter design

At first glance, it seems like Oben has taken inspiration for the Rorr from KTM 200 Duke. It gets similar sharp lines and tank style. But that’s where the similarities end. The headlamp is a round LED unit with circular LED DRLs. Above this sits a 6.5-inch fully digital instrument cluster which can be paired to your phone via a dedicated app. this will be capable of giving you bike stats as well as allow you to connect to roadside assistance and doorstep service.

Moving over to the rear, the split seat units ends at the rear flanked by a split tail-grab giving the Rorr a fairly sporty look. The tail lamp, too, is an LED unit as are the indicators. The bikes runs on 17-inch five-spoke alloy rims and the sprocket for the belt has also been uniquely designed.

What you notice about the Rorr is the fact that the bike is fairly tidy. Most of the wiring and batteries and circuits have been safely and stylishly tucked away into the big silver box that sits where an IC engine would have normally been. Because of this, the bike also gets a three-tone paint scheme with Red/Black/Silver and Yellow/Black/Silver.

Powertrain and other specs

The Oben Rorr is powered by a 4.4 kWh lithium-ion-phospate battery pack which is a slightly more advanced battery tech compared to conventional lithium-ion batteries.. This is then couple with a 10 kW electric motor which produces 62 Nm of continuous torque. This is transmitted to the rear wheel via a belt drive with single stage reduction. Top-speed has been claimed at 100 km/h and a 0-40 km/h speed of three seconds. There’s no gearbox or transmission seeing as how this is an electric motor.

As for the other components, suspension comes via a conventional telescopic fork up front and a monoshock at the rear. Aside from the better stability and handling that a monoshock provides, this also gives the bike a sporty look. braking is handled by petal discs at both ends clamped down on by gold painted calipers, another feature that gives the bike a premium look.

Range and charging

Unlike its rivals, the Tork Kratos and the Revolt RV400, Oben EV is boasting a range of close to 200 km on a single charge. This of course, is under ideal conditions, but it is something that most electric two-wheelers still cannot accomplish entirely. The Kratos’ range measures in at 180 km while the RV400 completes 150 km on a single charge. Even in the scooters segment, the Ola S1 pro currently boasts an ARAI certified range of 180 km.

The Rorr also gets riding modes that changes the output of the battery and consequently the output of the motor. Eco mode allows for a true range of 150 km but top speed is capped at 50 km/h. City mode offers a true range of 120 km with the top speed limited to70 km/h. And finally, you have Havoc mode which alongside increasing the electric motor’s output to maximum also reduces the bike’s range to 100 km. Even with all of this, the Oben Rorr has the highest range in the segment.

Charging for the battery can be done via a normal 5 amp socket but a 15 amp charger from Oben will allow for a speed of 1 percent per minute which means a claimed charging time of just about two hours. The company says that the 15 amp socket will be installed at the customer’s residence at no extra cost.

Waterpoofing

While the weather conditions in our country is beautiful, flooding is something that a lot of EV buyers will definitely be worried about. Obviously, manufacturers do make the battery compartments and motors waterproof and so does Oben EV. The Rorr’s battery compartment has a IP67 dust and waterproof rating. The electric motor on the other hand has an IP65 rating which may not stand up to a complete submerge but at least it wont be damaged by normal rainfall and water puddles.

Prices and deliveries

Ex-showroom, the Oben Rorr costs 1,24,999. This is whithout the state subsidies and the prices go down even further. For example, in in Rajasthan, the price stands at Rs 1,14,999 while in Gujarat this falls further to 1,04,999. Maharashtra and Delhi see a sub-Rs 1 lakh price at Rs 99,999 and Rs 94,999 respectively. Bookings for the Rorr have already started for a token amount of Rs 999. Test rides of the e-bike are scheduled to begin sometime in May and the company has said that deliveries should begin by July. Oben Rorr is also offering a three year warranty on the motor while the battery gets a three year warranted but capped at 60,000 km. The company is also claiming to set up close to 1,000 charging stations across the country.",956,0.3383341034253438

Bajaj Auto, the country's leading two and three-wheeler automobile maker, is currently not viewing electric vehicles as a mass market, Rajiv Bajaj said on March 22.

""We are not looking at EVs as mass market right now,"" the Bajaj Auto managing director said, while speaking to CNBC TV18. He added that the company is also focusing on further developing its own technology to succeed in the EV segment.

On the performance-linked incentive (PLI) scheme introduced by the government to boost the EV sector, Rajiv Bajaj said it would help to assuage the concerns of the market players. However, Bajaj Auto is not relying on it to expand its foray into the electric segment.

""PLI scheme is helpful, but not the cement which we are using to make our building,"" he said.

Bajaj also noted that another Chetak e-scooter, which is the one wish-list of several among the classic Chetak users, will be ""added in FY23"".

The overall domestic sales ""have been under a precipitous fall"", he said. Despite the challenging situation, the company, he added, has gained in its market share in the three-wheeler segment.

In the current fiscal, Bajaj Auto aims to end with a total sale of 4.3 million vehicles, he said, while noting that it would be ""wrong to compare sale in current fiscal with the previous"".

The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation or EBIDTA for the company ""has come down to 16-17 percent from 20 percent"", Bajaj added.",255,0.18330405155817667

The significant fall in share prices over the past one-and-a-half-months when most sectors declined in double digits offers investors an opportunity to buy stocks of quality companies.

Margin pressures reflected in corporate earnings for the December quarter due to rising commodity prices, expectations of faster policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve, relentless selling by foreign investors, and the geopolitical tensions with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine weighed on market sentiment.

The benchmark BSE Sensex fell 11 percent during January 17-February 24 before a minor recovery, while the BSE Midcap index dropped 15 percent and the Smallcap index plunged 18.5 percent.

Among sectors, auto, capital goods, energy, healthcare, IT, consumer durables, oil & gas, and realty declined 10-20 percent, while banking, FMCG and power fell 7-9 percent.

Volatility hit the highest level since May 2020, with the India VIX going up to about 30, indicating instability in the market unless the geopolitical risk eases.

The Russia-Ukraine crisis, which continues for the time being despite sanctions imposed by western countries, poses a threat to earnings and economic growth, given the rise in commodity prices, experts said.

Brent crude oil futures, the international benchmark, hit $120 a barrel on March 3, the highest level since 2012 and a rise of 69 percent in more than two months.

Inflation, growth risks

“This would be a negative factor for global trade, posing a downside risk to the global economic growth,” Axis Securities said. “A scenario of oil sustaining above $100 a barrel for some more time will create notable challenges to the oil-importing countries, especially India, which may find it difficult to maintain the trade deficit and the foreign exchange reserves.”

The brokerage said the rise in crude oil prices could delay the cool-off in inflation in the domestic market, which was expected to moderate in the second half of 2022.

However, in the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, commodities would be the biggest gainers and as long as the geopolitical heat continues, it will be the dominating theme in the market, Axis Securities said.

Apart from the current geopolitical issue, upcoming events in March include the Federal Reserve meeting and assembly elections results from five states.

“The direction of the oil prices, bond yields, and dollar index along with the development of the current geopolitical events will further drive the market fundamentals,” the brokerage said, adding that once the dust over the Russia- Ukraine conflict settles, the market is expected to refocus on key events such as inflation and the number of rate hikes in the current calendar year.

Despite the current volatility, the brokerage maintained its Nifty target of 20,200 with a positive long-term view on the market supported by the emerging favourable structure as increasing capital expenditure enables banks to improve credit growth.

The Nifty closed at about 16,500 on March 3. To achieve the target of 20,200, it needs to add 3,700 points, or 22.4 percent, by March 2023. The index touched a record high of 18,604 in October 2021.

The brokerage said the overall boost in the Union Budget 2022-23 expenditure will help deliver broad-based growth in FY23.

Though the earnings momentum has been strong in the past few quarters and largely in line with expectations for the current quarter, they remain the critical factor for the market, said Axis Securities, which foresees FY22, FY23 and FY24 Nifty EPS at Rs 728, Rs 844 and Rs 918, respectively, with a 20 percent CAGR growth over FY21-24.

Based on these themes, the brokerage has recommended the following 16 stocks with a 10-50 percent potential upside.

In an exclusive interview with CNBC-TV18, Sharma talked about the sales picture, semiconductor shortage and impact on business due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

Bajaj Auto is the top Nifty loser today as the company posted very weak sales for February. The company reported a 16 percent drop in its total sales to 3,16,020 units in February.

When asked about motorcycles sales which were down 17 percent, Sharma said, ""The retail weakness is certainly continuing and while the numbers for the industry are just rolling in, we are estimating that the industry is again in for a decline of about 13-15 percent over last February (2021).""

""Our particular issue is explained by an aggravation of shortage on the semiconductor side where we were facing a shortage in January, but there has been a greater disruption for us as one of our key suppliers faced huge shortfalls which got passed on to us and consequently we were like about 30 percent requirement levels atleast in the domestic side of things,"" he noted.

Sharma also said the direct impact of the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia is absolutely minimal. ""We do have distribution arrangement in Ukraine and we have been getting news from our distribution partner that we are well but in a very difficult shape. The direct impact in decimal points but we have to wait and see how it impacts the other microeconomic factors, currency, etc,"" he pointed out.

Speaking about the recovery of domestic markets and rural distress, he said, ""The semiconductor issue is affecting our entire portfolio, it's not just the premium end but also the 3 wheelers (segment) is affected by semiconductor shortage.""

""The Quarter 3 January and February are very similar, they are in double-digit decline at an industry level and I'm basing these numbers on one registration, which I would say is the most accurate reflection of what's happening in the industry.""

He further added that the entry level is declining a little bit more because that is the most economically weakened customer. At the top end also there is a decline because the prices have risen disproportionately thanks to precious metals pressure as well as the regulatory requirement. The middle is performing better as it is declining less than the top and the bottom.

When asked about the declining trends in exports and what particular markets are getting hit, Sharma said that it is a seasonal trend.

""This is a very seasonal trend. Most of the export markets peak around Christmas time and then picks up by the middle of the calendar year. So this is a very natural movement. The overseas markets are doing very well and the numbers are just the seasonal thing.""",487,-0.6313386288556185

Shares of two wheeler companies including Bajaj Auto Ltd, Eicher Motors Ltd, and TVS Motors Co Ltd slipped on Wednesday after the firms reported lower than expected February wholesale volumes.

Shares of Bajaj Auto lost 5.3%, Eicher Motors fell 1.2%, and TVS Motors Ltd dropped 2.5%.

Analysts said that two wheeler sales were hit by expectations of rising petrol prices and prolonged rural distress.

Market leader Hero MotoCorp on Tuesday reported a 29% year on year decline in total wholesales at 3.58 lakh units in February. Domestic sales were also down 31.57% at 3.31 lakh units last month compared to 4.84 lakh units a year ago.

Royal Enfield's sales declined 15% in February, slightly below estimates. Exports dropped to 7,000 from 9,000 units in January. According to the firm, supply chain constraints due to shortage of semiconductor chips continued to persist during the month in review.

TVS Motors reported a 5% year on year decline in total sales in February at 2.82 lakh units. Total two-wheelers sales were lower at 2.68 lakh units last month, as against 2.85 lakh units a year ago.

Automobile companies are expected to report positive sales figures in the passenger vehicle segment in February following improved chip supplies and healthy order books, analysts said.

Commercial vehicle numbers should be strong too as freight rates improve and infrastructure activity starts building up. However, muted demand and a high base in the year-ago period could hit two-wheeler sales in February.

The Nifty Auto index has been consolidating since the beginning of the current year and fell sharply in the past week following the market correction after Russia invaded Ukraine. The index fell about 7 percent in February, underperforming the frontline Nifty 50, which declined 4 percent.

“Channel checks indicate that commercial vehicles should maintain upward momentum in February,” Emkay Global said. “Passenger vehicle volume growth should also be positive thanks to improving chip supplies. Two-wheeler and tractors are likely to decline due to subdued customer sentiment and the high base effect.”

Motilal Oswal expects passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles to have sustained momentum in February.

“Lacklustre demand for two-wheelers remains a cause for concern, though reopening of school and colleges is creating some demand, but it is not sufficient to boost the segment,” Motilal Oswal said.

Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland shares fell the most in February, down 11 percent. It was followed by Mahindra & Mahindra (down 8.8 percent), Hero Motocorp (down 6 percent), Maruti Suzuki (down 3 percent), Bajaj Auto (down 2 percent) and Eicher Motors (down 0.5 percent). TVS Motor Company gained 4 percent.

Passenger vehicles

Passenger vehicle volumes should improve due to better chip supplies and healthy orders, said Emkay Global, which estimates domestic volumes to grow by 51 percent YoY for Tata Motors and 23 percent for M&M, while dropping 9 percent for Maruti Suzuki, the market leader.

Given the robust order book, discounts remained low during the month compared with the previous year, the brokerage added.

Nomura expects Maruti Suzuki’s domestic passenger vehicle volumes (ex-Toyota and LCVs) to be about 7 percent lower from a year earlier. Overall volumes are likely to be little changed YoY on higher exports, as per the Japanese brokerage firm. Maruti recently launched a new model of the Baleno, which has received about 25,000 bookings to date.

According to the global brokerage, M&M’s utility vehicle volumes will likely increase about 30 percent YoY in February on improving supply constraints and a strong order book.

Commercial vehicles

Motilal Oswal expects Ashok Leyland’s commercial vehicle wholesales to grow by 9 percent YoY – with the medium and heavy segment growing 20 percent YoY but light commercial vehicles declining 6 percent.

“We expect Tata Motors’ commercial vehicle wholesales to grow by 13 percent YoY (up 10 percent and 15 percent YoY for M&HCVs and LCVs, respectively). The same for VECV (Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicle) is expected to grow by 6 percent YoY,” it said.

Nomura said industry wholesale volumes in the commercial vehicle segment are likely to be up 6 percent YoY and industry retail sales could be up 20 percent YoY in February.

“We expect Tata Motors to report 4 percent YoY growth, while Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors sales are likely up 12 percent and 6 percent YoY,” it said.

Improving freight rates continued to benefit fleet operators, but rising oil prices could impact commercial vehicle sales and hurt their profitability. Fuel prices have not increased significantly in the past few weeks even though international oil prices have risen due to Ukraine-Russia tensions.

Analysts largely expect fuel prices to rise after the assembly elections, given that Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, crossed $100 a barrel. This could delay commercial vehicles purchases in the coming period.

Hence, there could be some impact on commercial vehicle sales, though finance for purchases is easily available.

“Fleet utilisation levels are estimated to have reached around 80 percent. However, transporters are cautiously adding to their fleet due to the ongoing uncertainty. Financing is not a constraint, but underwriting continues to remain stringent,” said Motilal Oswal.

“The loan-to-value (LTV) continues to remain range-bound at 85-90 percent for large fleet operators, but lower for smaller operators. The latter is cautious while buying trucks as their own equity contribution will rise due to the lower LTV.”

Two-wheelers

According to Nomura, two-wheeler retail sales could decline about 5 percent YoY in February. It estimates 27 percent and 14 percent volume declines for Hero Motocorp and Eicher Motors, respectively, while there could be 9 percent and 12 percent fall in volumes for TVS and Bajaj Auto, respectively.

Given the subdued demand, the Japanese brokerage sees downside risks to its industry volume growth estimates for FY22 and FY23.

Motilal Oswal said the market expects some recovery in the upcoming marriage season and as educational institutes open.

“Inventory in the system is 60-75 days (based on current retails). Royal Enfield supplies continue to be plagued by supply-side issues, leading to a waiting period on the Classic 350 and Meteor,” it said.

Tractors

Tractor sales volumes could decline in double digits given the subdued agriculture demand currently and flat commercial demand.

“Elections are currently under way in many agrarian states in north India, leading to slower demand. Inventory in the system is 25-30 days,” said Motilal Oswal, which expects tractor volumes to decline by 20 percent and 36 percent YoY for M&M and Escorts, respectively.

The high base effect is also expected to impact volumes for tractors.

Rajiv Bajaj may have created a public perception of being at odds with father Rahul Bajaj, but in an interview given to this author in Outlook Business in August 2021, he dispelled that myth among others.

In the interview, he revealed a deeply caring father, who showed up to soothe every anguish of his family. Rajiv spoke of a man who could be tough as a businessman and tenderhearted as a father.

Rajiv, who is known to speak his mind like his father and not excuse bad behaviour even if it is from a parent, said that he could make transformative changes at Bajaj Auto only because of his father (and not despite his father).

He spoke of a father who lived by his principles, even if it made life harder. “Both my parents were from Mumbai and grew up there. But he decided to live in Akurdi (Pune) because he did not want to be an absentee landlord,” he said, adding, “It wasn’t easy.”

As a child, Rajiv saw his father leading a hectic life, running a company at a time when the Indian business scene was fraught with labour problems. But Rajiv also saw that Rahul was there for his family when it mattered.

“Dad wasn’t there often but he was there when he had to be there,” said Rajiv, “like when our first dog Bunty, a Golden Retriever fell sick and was passing blood.”

Rahul’s wife Rupa had called and asked him to take Bunty to the vet. “Dad was under tremendous pressure because of the labour issue those days, but he came immediately. We had to stand and wait in the little clinic for two hours and dad as there. He waited the whole time along with the rest of us,” he said.

When the younger son Sanjiv had a minor bike accident, Rahul didn’t waste a minute to be by his side. “Sanjiv fell off an M50 and began throwing up,” Rajiv remembered. “We had been chasing each other around in the colony on the bike when Sanjiv fell off and had a concussion. Mom called up dad and he was there in a minute.”

“We were closer to mom, but dad was very much there,” said Rajiv.

The relationship between Rahul and Rajiv became more strained when they began working together. The younger Bajaj was insistent that things be done differently from what they had been until then.

“The dissonance is easy for the child and I understand that now with the shoe on the other foot,” said Rajiv. Rajiv now has a son Rishabh.

At Rahul and Rupa’s 50th wedding anniversary, Rupa called Rajiv to the stage and asked him to say a few words. Rajiv said something in jest that had everyone rolling on the floor. “I said that if I said something about her I will choke and if I said anything about my dad he would choke me!,” Rajiv recalled in the interview, laughingly.

Despite the differences in their working styles, Rajiv had several experiences that left him in awe of his father. One was when there was a labour strike in the early 2000s that nearly brought down the shutters on the company.

Rahul and Rajiv had to visit the founder of Shiv Sena, the late Bal Thackeray, for a mediation. Thackeray, Rajiv said, had great regard for the Bajaj family because when the politician was starting out in Maximum City as a “nobody”, he had the patronage of Ramkrishna Bajaj who liked Thackeray’s cartoons.

“It was very clear that he (Thackeray) was not going to be rough with us (about the labour dispute). At the same time, it was his union and he was obviously the big boss in the room that day, not dad. It was his call to take. It was good training for me, to see the dynamics playing out, because I had asked myself what I would have done in such a situation,” said Rajiv.

Rajiv was adamant about a few things. “My people and my supervisors had been beaten up and there had been violence. So, people had to lose their jobs. There was one particularly troublesome character and, at the time, my attitude, as my younger self, was that he should be sacked. He should be punished. I insisted that we should not go back on that,” he recalled.

Rahul was caught between a son who would not relent on the sacking and union leaders who would not allow that. The younger Bajaj was watching closely how the situation would be handled.

“Dad was clever. He briefed Thackeray about what had happened and then handed over a set of keys to him, saying, ‘These are the keys to the gate, and I am giving it to you. You manage the company now because I can’t do it. I am caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. My son won’t relent and your fellows won’t listen. So, chaavi aap rak lo,” remembered Rajiv, adding that his father had played it astutely.

“Thackeray changed the subject by saying, ‘Aap stress mat lo, beer lenge kya?’ I was quite surprised since it was the middle of the day! Dad generally doesn’t drink at all, certainly not during the day. He said no. To that, Thackeray said, ‘Aap beer nahi peete? Isliye aapko life mein itna tension hain, phir health problem bhi hoga baad mein. Beer peena jaruri hai, sab problems solve ho jaate hain.’ He lightened the mood.”

Thackeray then asked the labour leaders who were present in the room, some of whom went on to become ministers, if the worker had really done what Rajiv had accused him of. If the worker had really beaten up another man and was a repeat offender. The leaders replied in the affirmative and Thackeray was quick with his verdict.

“He said, ‘Kadun taaka tyala’. Off with his head. They were all shocked. This decisiveness, I liked. It suited me, of course. But, even otherwise. Today’s politicians are not decisive and that is why we have ended up with some of the people that we have,” said Rajiv.

Thackeray asked the Bajajs to give the sacked man an autorickshaw free of cost. This was done so that the man could start earning from the very next day and so that his family would not suffer.

Rajiv said that the experience was a big learning for him. The way it was handled was so “counterintuitive, so unusual”.

“The way dad made his case clear with absolute respect, in front of a fellow who everybody feared… It was remarkable… When we came out of the house, people were garlanding dad’s car, offering ladoos and bursting crackers. The great Indian tamasha!,” he said.

Like there were moments when Rahul surprised Rajiv with his strength, there were moments when he surprised his son with his vulnerability.

Rajiv recalled the time his mother underwent a bypass surgery in Cleveland. “She was strong and went into it as if she was going to get her nails clipped but we were all scared,” recalled Rajiv.

“Dad is one of those people who are tough on the outside but soft inside. So, while he kept his composure, he was shattered. She recovered well but dad had been internalising an enormous amount of stress over the seven months that led up to the procedure.”

After Rupa was moved out of the postoperative ICU and into a regular room, Rajiv was readying to leave. He hugged her goodbye and saw his father standing away. This was in 2004, as Rajiv recalled, “the business-related father-son war was at its peak”.

“I felt I should say goodbye to him as well and not just walk away because it was not like we were not talking to each other at all. I turned around to tell him goodbye, and he came and hugged me. He kept his head on my shoulder and cried and cried. He is a little shorter than I am, so his head was on my shoulder the whole time. Sometimes, they say you see the parent as a child. That’s when I experienced it,” he said.",1366,-0.5479900108443366

Rahul Bajaj had stepped down as the Chairman of Bajaj Auto last year, ending a 49-year stint as the head of the two-wheeler manufacturer known for iconic taglines like “Hamara Bajaj” and ""you just can't beat a Bajaj"".

Here’s a brief look at the business tycoon’s big milestones in his life and career.

Rahul Bajaj was born on June 10, 1938 in then Calcutta (Kolkata). He graduated from St Stephen's College, Delhi University with an Honours Degree in Economics in 1958. He also has a Law degree from Mumbai University and an MBA from Harvard Business School.

The Bajaj group of companies was founded by Rahul Bajaj's grandfather Jamnalal Bajaj in 1926. Rahul Bajaj took over as the Chief Executive Officer of Bajaj Auto in 1968. In 1972, he was appointed as Managing Director of Bajaj Auto.

Credited with making Bajaj a household name in the 1970s, he successfully steered the company through The Emergency, License Raj and Economic Liberalisation that began in the 1990s.

Bajaj launched the Chetak, one of the company’s earliest independent two-wheeler models, which became a massive hit especially in Indian middle class households.

Without letting the scooter go, Rahul Bajaj then steered into motorcycles, becoming one of the first to launch a locally made motorcycle in India through a tie-up with Japan’s Kawasaki.

In 2001, Rahul Bajaj received the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in the country. From 2006 to 2010, he was a member of the Rajya Sabha.

In 2005, when the Chetak saw its last rollout, Rahul Bajaj stepped down as Managing Director. His son Rajiv took over the reins from his father.

Bajaj, at different points in life, also served twice as the President of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), once at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) and also as the Chairman of the erstwhile Indian Airlines.

In 2008, he split Bajaj Auto into three units - Bajaj Auto, finance company Bajaj Finserv and a holding company.

In April last year, Rahul Bajaj stepped down as the Chairman of Bajaj Auto. Niraj Bajaj, a director on the company's board, took over after him from May 1, 2021. He was the company's Chairman Emeritus for five years.

Bajaj’s connection with the Chetak scooter was resurrected in 2020 when the company launched a fully electric version of the model, marking its entry in the electric vehicle space. Sometime later, he announced he was stepping down as MD.

Rahul Bajaj's sons Rajiv and Sanjiv are the Managing Directors of Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finserv, respectively.",471,0.32622408866882324

Motilal Oswal's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto (BJAUT)’s 3QFY22 beat was driven by lower RM cost pressures and favorable Fx. While exports remained robust and domestic 3W continued to recover, domestic 2Ws are yet to see recovery. In EVs, BJAUT is focusing on aggressively rolling out Chetak after ironing out supply chain issues. The e-3W launch is planned for FY23E. While we maintain our EPS estimates, we cut our P/E multiple to 16x (v/s 18x earlier) to account for hyper-competition in e-2Ws and the EV threat to the dominance of domestic 3Ws.

Outlook

We maintain a Neutral rating, with TP of INR3,500.

Tarun Khanna is the Jorge Paulo Lemann Professor at the Harvard Business School (HBS), and Geoffrey Jones is the Isidor Straus Professor of Business History at HBS. Their new book, Leadership to Last: How Great Leaders Leave Legacies Behind, draws on interviews conducted by Harvard faculty as part of the Creating Emerging Markets project. Further, the interviews are grouped by subjects like managing families and innovating for impact. Excerpted here is an interview with Rahul Bajaj on family managers versus professional managers.

Rahul Bajaj is the grandson of Jamnalal Bajaj, an industrialist and prominent supporter of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi during India’s independence struggle. Rahul Bajaj took over in 1965 and is the chairperson emeritus of the Bajaj Group—one of India’s largest multinational conglomerates, which grew to include more than thirty businesses spanning consumer care, energy and sugar. In 2001, Rahul Bajaj received the Padma Bhushan. From 2006 to 2010, he was a member of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament. Interviewed by Srikant M. Datar in Pune on 8 July 2014.

Interviewer: How do you balance the inevitable tensions between family members and professional managers?

Rahul Bajaj (RB): It is a very important subject and there is no one answer as far as I am concerned. Each case is different and has to be treated differently: what kind of family, when did you start, how many people, their temperament, their competence, their capabilities, their educational background, etc. Starting with what is family management versus professional management: what is a professional manager where he is not an owner? Then, why do you give him stock options? He becomes an owner. Well, he is a minor one, but why did you give the stock options to him? To provide an incentive, to recruit him and retain him. To provide continuity, that is what an owner does. He is born with that incentive, meaning he’s got equity, and he won’t normally leave his company for a higher salary. A professional manager, not for 20 per cent maybe, but for a 100 per cent increase in salary or for a much bigger company, may leave you. It happens every day. The owners have their wealth invested in the company. If you have the incentive of ownership—your wealth and reputation—you get the motivation, you maintain continuity. Because of your ownership, you have long-term thinking; you are not concerned with quarterly results, you’re not going to buy shares, you are not going to sell shares, and you don’t have stock options. I don’t either. None of our Bajajs in the group have ever had stock options. We have large numbers of shares, probably 50 per cent or more, in each of our companies.

So, what is a family company; what is a professional company? Take Bajaj Auto. We employ about 9,000 people top to bottom, and we have a sixteen-member board. Below the sixteen-member board, there is no Bajaj. Among the 9000 people, there is no Bajaj, there is no relative of a Bajaj. On the board, the family is represented, but who are the full-time directors? At Bajaj Auto, non-executive directors are not in management. There are only three full-time directors: the chairman, me; the vice-chairman, my cousin—not brother— Madhur Bajaj; and my elder son [Rajiv]; not even my younger son. Sanjiv [Rahul Bajaj’s younger son] is in the financial services companies and the same story repeats there; in their board level, only one full-time director is a Bajaj. I’m not . . . I am the non-executive chairman. At Bajaj Auto, I am non- executive chairman, and my elder son Rajiv is the managing director. No other relative is a full-time director or a manager in the company. Is this a family-managed company or not?

Interviewer: How do you assess the capability of family members who wish to enter management? How do you avoid bias in the selection process?

RB: If one is not qualified, is not capable, then such a professional manager will be sacked. The family guy—an example is Rajiv Bajaj, and I have said this on TV at the cost of being challenged, not once, but two or three times. I would like to know the names of three people in this country of 1.2 billion people, three people who can be better CEOs—managing directors or CEOs—of Bajaj Auto than Rajiv Bajaj. I know many managers in India. They could be as good, but my point is, who could be better than him? I don’t know of any. He has lived his life in Akurdi [in Maharashtra], he now lives in Pune, he graduated in first class with distinction in BE in mechanical engineering and got a first class with distinction in his master’s at Warwick University in the UK. You can see how he writes about marketing, brand-building as well as engineering. He happens to be a Bajaj—is he a family manager or is he a professional manager? The ideal is a family manager who is qualified. By qualified, I don’t mean only having a degree, but qualified for that post; he may have a degree or he may be like a Dhirubhai Ambani [founder of Reliance Industries] with no degree.

Problems happen in family management when there are three or four brothers. We say in India, the five fingers of a hand are not equal in size. All brothers may not be of equal capability and commitment. If somebody doesn’t want to work in the company, they should simply go. You should hold the post for which you are not just okay, but among the best. Then the fact that you happen to be an owner is an advantage. It provides you with an automatic incentive and continuity. Problems happen when the person is not very qualified and he says, ‘but I want this post—why does my brother have it, who says he is more qualified?’

Each case is different. Who is the head of the family? Do they listen to him? In my case, I happen to be the head, and they listen to me, so what I say goes, it is accepted. This puts a lot of responsibility on my shoulders. Now, if they don’t accept, that is where the family breaks. One alternative is a brother who wants a break. ‘I want to do my business my way. You say that “I’m no good”—we will find out after ten years. I want to separate; maybe I will become better than you.’ It is fine; that is a good solution. The best man should manage the business at whatever level, including at the CEO level. If they are equal in competence, according to me, the family or the owner-manager has an advantage. The problem that people are referring to is when the family members start fighting. And at that time, whoever is the leader should ensure the fighting stops and does not affect the company. That’s what I have done with the Bajaj Group. One needs a great deal of communication among family members, a lot of give and take, and maybe, sometimes, outside help.

Interviewer: If everything else is equal, then an owner-manager has the advantage for economic reasons, they get a lot of incentives, they have continuity, long-term thinking.

RB: Yes. The trouble in family management, as I said, is when members start fighting. It happened in my group. We are five brothers, including cousins. The son of one, he is very ambitious, he wanted to do business in another manner and so we decided to separate. It is a good example. The Bajaj Group didn’t suffer at all; now he is managing his companies, and we are managing our companies.

But some other groups where family members separated suffered. We had very good groups, and where are they now? They say that’s why the third and fourth generations often disappear. It’s not necessarily that the guy is not competent.

Interviewer: Before your wife’s passing in 2013, I know Rupa Bhabhi’s role with each of these brothers was critical.

RB: They respected and loved her tremendously. I don’t think they respect me like that, but they respected her always. She was on the phone frequently with my brothers and their wives; her health was bad towards the end, she couldn’t move, but she was on the phone every day with each of them. Nobody would oppose her.

Learnings from Rahul Bajaj: Not all family members are well-suited to run a business. There are major difficulties when the rules by which the family governs its involvement in the business don’t keep pace with changing aspirations.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s 3QFY22 performance came in-line with our estimates, with realization growing 12% YoY on the back of price hikes and higher exports (56% of the total volumes vs 53/54% YoY/QoQ). We remain positive on Bajaj’s growth story as (1) exports are expected to drive the show in near-term, with management targeting 2.5mn units in FY22 vs a peak of 2.1mn in FY20 (2) despite 2W sales being sluggish in 3QFY22, decline for Bajaj (-20%) has been lower than the industry (-25%); which has led to market share gains (100bps from FY21) largely driven by strong reception of Pulsar 125 NS (3) 3W volumes are showing signs of improvement (+16% QoQ) driven by opening up of the economy, increasing CNG network & availability of retail financing and (4) stabilizing commodity prices and cost pass-ons will aid in margin expansion.

Outlook

We trim our estimates by 2/4% for FY23/24 and maintain ‘BUY’ with a target price of Rs 3,911 at 16x Dec-23E EPS.

KR Choksey's research report on Bajaj Auto

For Q3FY22, Bajaj Auto reported total revenue from operations of INR 90,217 Mn, a growth of 1.3% YoY (+3% QoQ). Domestic 2-w volume declined by 19.5% YoY; however, 2-w exports and CVs outperformed with double digit volume growth YoY. EBITDA declined by 20.7% YoY/2.1% QoQ to INR 13,709 mn. The decline was mainly due to inflationary trends in raw materials. For the quarter, Net Profit stood at INR 14,294 Mn (-16.7% YoY), with NPM at 15.8% (-341 bps YoY) .

Outlook

We have revised our estimates upwards however reduced our target P/E multiple, and now assign a P/E multiple of 16x on FY24E EPS of INR 260 (earlier 23x on FY24E EPS of INR 205); to arrive at a revised target price of INR 4,168/share (earlier INR 4,710/share); implying an upside potential of 23.2% from the CMP. Accordingly, we reiterate our “BUY” recommendation on the shares of Bajaj Auto.

However, commercial vehicles may report good numbers as infrastructure activities increase. On a sequential basis, a recovery is expected, with companies reporting strong numbers.

Additionally, rising costs of inputs such as metals and oil are expected to have hit the operating performance of these companies. Generally, the impact of rising input costs takes place with some lag, but investors started pricing them in earlier.

The Nifty Auto index, which started declining in mid-November, later recovered on hopes that earlier concerns would ease and economic activities would improve.

Elara Capital expects its “auto universe” 3Q revenue (ex-Tata Motors) to remain little changed (up 7.3 percent QoQ), with gradual demand normalisation.

“Q3 production was hit by semiconductor shortage and weak consumer sentiment, particularly in rural regions,” said Elara Capital.

The brokerage expects EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) for the Elara auto universe (ex-Tata Motors) to decelerate 25.9 percent YoY (up 8.4 percent QoQ).

Kotak Institutional Equities expects auto original equipment manufacturers’ revenue to decline by 5 percent YoY due to the continued chip shortage impacting passenger vehicles, light commercial vehicles and premium motorcycle segments, and weak festive two-wheeler demand.

The brokerage said EBITDA may decline 43 percent YoY due to raw material headwinds.

“We expect gross margins to remain under pressure for almost all OEMs on a YoY basis due to a steep increase in the raw material basket, partly offset by price hikes taken during the quarter,” it said.

To offset the impact of rising input costs, Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors and Ashok Leyland increased prices during the quarter and this may support sequential numbers, experts said.

“Increase in commodity costs on a QoQ basis may largely be offset by price hikes and thus, EBITDA margin will depend on operating leverage and volumes in Q3FY22,” said Elara Capital.

Key input commodity costs have risen – aluminium (up 5.1 percent QoQ), copper (up 3.3 percent QoQ), natural rubber (up 2.6 percent QoQ) and lead (up 1 percent QoQ) – while steel costs declined 8.2 percent QoQ.

“This has compelled the ancillaries to pass on the raw material cost inflation to the OEMs with a quarter lag, as per their agreement. The OEMs have hiked prices within around 1.5-3 percent range across-the-board, to partially cushion the impact on margins,” said Elara.

According to Prabhudas Lilladher, gross margins are expected to contract by 275 basis points YoY to 25.6 percent for OEMs (ex-Jaguar Land Rover). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.

“EBITDA margins may contract by around 300 bps YoY. Aggregate fixed cost to largely remain flat YoY led by cost rationalisation and operating leverage,” it said.

On volumes, growth in domestic commercial vehicles was about 3 percent, but passenger vehicles, two-wheelers, and tractors registered a decline of about 16 percent, 24 percent and 15 percent YoY, respectively.

Sector-wise expected performance

Commercial Vehicles

Emkay Global expects revenue growth of 20-35 percent for Tata Motors, Eicher Motors and Ashok Leyland.

“We expect robust double-digit revenue growth in CVs for the next two years, supported by improving macros, government thrust on infra spending and recovery in replacement demand,” it said. “The CV segment has outperformed, led by a sequential recovery in fleet movement and improved demand from construction and mining activities.”

Passenger Vehicles

“Enquiries and bookings have been encouraging, however, semiconductor shortage has led to high waiting periods. With Malaysian chip supply now normalising, PV OEMs are realigning their production schedules to meet demand,” said Prabhudas Lilladher.

Domestic passenger vehicle volumes declined by about 16 percent YoY owing to chip shortages despite a large order book.

“We expect revenue growth of 1 percent for Maruti Suzuki, 21 percent for M&M auto division (total revenue growth of 12 percent for M&M) and 67 percent for Tata Motors-PV. Led by the pending order book and improving chip supplies, we expect revenues to grow strongly over the next two years,” said Emkay Global.

Two-Wheelers

Domestic two-wheeler volumes declined by about 24 percent YoY owing to moderation in sentiment and a high base last year. In comparison, exports grew about 1 percent YoY despite the high base, driven by stable demand and steady forex rates in key markets.

“We expect 11 percent revenue growth for Eicher Motors-RE, 2 percent for Bajaj Auto and 1 percent for TVS Motor, while we see a 21 percent fall for Hero MotoCorp. The momentum in exports is expected to be sustained. In comparison, domestic demand may be impacted in the near term by the increase in Covid cases. We expect volume growth to turn positive from Q1FY23,” said Emkay Global.

Prabhudas Lilladher said two-wheeler retail sales may improve as rural incomes recover after the rabi (winter) crop harvest.

Tractors

Domestic tractor volumes fell 15 percent YoY. In terms of revenue, “we expect a 7 percent drop for Escorts and 2 percent for M&M farm division. Led by a high base and lower government subsidy support, we expect volumes to remain under pressure in the near term,” said Emkay Global.

Shares of Auto companies traded higher on January 3 on the back of better than expected sales numbers recorded in December. At 9:53am, the BSE Auto index climbed 1.11 percent, while the benchmark Sensex was up 0.83 percent or 474.38 points at 58,728.20.

In early trade, Eicher Motors Ltd gained 4%, Tata Motors added 2.2%, Ashok Leyland rose 1.6%, Hero MotoCorp advanced 1.2%, while Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, Maruti Suzuki India were up 1% each.

“While easing semiconductor supplies support PV wholesalers, the 2W segment is yet to recover amid a high cost of ownership. We prefer 4Ws over 2Ws on the back of strong demand and offer a stable competitive environment. We expect the momentum in the CV cycle to continue. We prefer companies with: a higher visibility in terms of a demand recovery, a strong competitive positioning, margin drivers, and d) balance sheet strength”, Motilal Oswal said in a note to investors.

Royal Enfield sold 74,000 units in December, up 43% from the previous month despite new product launches being impacted by semi-conductor shortage. Motorcycle sales in the 350cc segment surged 44 percent month-on-month to 62.5 thousand units. Exports jumped 25 percent.

Tata Motors pipped Hyundai Motors India to become the second largest seller of passenger vehicles in the Domestic market for the first time in close to a decade in December 2021. Tata witnessed 44 percent year-on-year growth with electric vehicles.

Analysts expect the new launch of Tigor EV (approved for FAME-II subsidy) is likely to improve EV sales while the recently launched SUV Punch (>8k unit sales in Oct’21) could further aid ICE (internal combustion engine) market share.

Maruti Suzuki' dispatches rose 10% month-on-month as production ramped up despite constrained production on chip shortages. Hero MotoCorp reported 13% rise in December sales ,while TVS Motors withessed 8% drop. Company's domestic sales declined 17%, while exports grew 8%.

“PV OEMs’ attempt to catch up to the demand for popular models was impacted by production cuts, while 2W OEMs have likely been able to pare down high channel inventories post festive season (~8-10 weeks). Entry-level demand trends across 2Ws and PVs have remained weak. OEMs are hoping to stoke consumer sentiment with new launches (e.g. M&M XUV700, Tata Punch, MG Astor, TVS Raider) even as availability of popular models remain elusive”, said ICICI Securities in a note to its investors

“However, increasing price hikes (~8-10% across segments since Jan’21) and rising fuel costs could limit consumer wallet spends at the entry level even as covid cases surge throughout the country. Faster vaccination leading to opening up of workplaces and educational institutes could aid revival of transportation segments (e.g. 3Ws/buses/scooters) in CY22”, the report added.",456,0.7748472425672743

Bajaj Auto Ltd on Wednesday said it will set up an electric vehicle manufacturing facility at Akurdi in Pune with an investment of Rs 300 crore.

The facility, for which the work has already commenced, will have the capacity to produce 5,00,000 Electric Vehicles (EVs) per annum and cater to both domestic and exports markets, the company said in a release.

The first vehicle from the new unit, spread over half-a-million square feet space, is expected to be rolled out by June 2022. The unit will employ around 800 personnel. Akurdi is the site of the original Chetak scooter factory.

""In 2001, Bajaj 2.0 took off on the roaring Pulsar, in 2021, Bajaj 3.0 arrived on the charming Chetak. Going forward, for the Bajaj portfolio, except for implementing one state-of-the-art ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) platform that is currently under development, all our R&D drive train resources are now laser focused on creating EV solutions for the future.

""This alignment reflects our belief that light electric vehicles for sustainable urban mobility is an idea whose time may finally have come,"" Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Auto, said.

He also said the investment at the Akurdi facility will complete the virtuous cycle of hi-tech R&D competencies, high-efficiency engineering capabilities, world class supply chain synergies, and global distribution network which should leapfrog the company into a market leading position in EVs in India and overseas.

The investments made by Bajaj Auto will be supplemented by a number of vendors, who will invest a further Rs 250 crore (USD 33 million), the company said.

The new unit will have cutting-edge robotic and automated manufacturing systems for everything, including logistics and material handling, fabrication and painting, assembly and quality assurance.

These systems have been designed for flexible product mix while keeping in mind the best worker ergonomics and maximum process efficiency, it said.

The unit at Akurdi is co-located with Bajaj Auto’s state-of-the-art R&D centre to foster greater collaboration, leading to faster time-to-market and should transform the facility into a hub for design, development and manufacturing of a complete range of electric vehicles, according to the statement.",366,0.9856479167938232

The top court said even though CNG auto rickshaws are BS-VI compliant, there is still some carbon emission.

A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao said the advertisement issued by the Delhi government inviting applications for e-autorickshaws cannot be said to be arbitrary as it is in conformity with FAME-II scheme and the Electric Vehicle policy 2020.

""Residents of Delhi are badly affected by the air pollution, undoubtedly a part of which is contributed by vehicles. Even though CNG autos are BS-VI compliant, there is still some carbon emission.""

""We also do not agree that the fundamental right of the applicant (Bajaj Auto) is violated. Amendment to Motor Vehicles Act cannot be read to mean that addition of e-autos on the road can be done over and above one lakh autos,” the bench also comprising Justices B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna said.

The Delhi government opposed the plea filed by Bajaj Auto on the ground that CNG auto rickshaws cannot be compared to e-autos.

It said there is a proposal to switch to electric vehicles with a view to decarbonise the transport sector.

The AAP government also referred to the FAME-II scheme of the Centre and electric vehicle policy 2020.

92,000 CNG auto rickshaws have already been registered in Delhi and there is a continuous process of replacement of old CNG auto rickshaws, Delhi government said.

Advocate ADN Rao, who is amicus curiae in the case, submitted that the application deserves to be dismissed as amendment made to motor vehicles act and central motor vehicle rules only relates to payment of registration fees.

The Transport department of Delhi government had invited online applications for registration of 4,261 new permits for e-autorickshaws.

Bajaj Auto had moved the apex court with the claim that the advertisement was arbitrary and discriminatory to manufacturers of existing CNG three-seater auto rickshaws (TSR).

""The decision tantamounts to an indirect ban on new CNG TSRs, and also amounts to restricting market opportunities to one class of vehicles over another, without rational basis or intelligible differentia…A conjoint reading of the SC orders shows that the court never intended to place a cap on numbers of TSRs running on clean fuels, such as CNG and electricity,” the plea said.",412,-0.9930762052536011

Despite strong global cues, Indian market started the week on a negative note and slipped further during the week to the lowest level in the last three months at around the 16,900. It then saw a sharp bounce back with benchmark retesting the territory of 17,500. Post these wild moves, Nifty traded in a range for the last two days of the week and eventually ended the week with gains of 1.80 percent each against the previous week's close.

If we recall last week's outlook, we had clearly mentioned that the benchmark may see further consolidation between 16,800 and 17,500 before heading for the next leg of the action. This is precisely what has happened during the week as Nifty almost tested the lower end and closed at the mentioned higher range.

Now if we analyse the last two days' trading activity, buying was definitely seen on the intraday dips. However, we did see some tentativeness at higher levels as the benchmark has already rallied more than 3 percent from the intra-week low and has reached a cluster of resistance zone seen in the vicinity of 17,500-17,600-17,700.

During the week, we did participate in the relief move but directionally, we are still a bit sceptical whether the market has enough strength to surpass the higher boundary of this range. Hence, one needs to now start lightening up longs if Nifty extends the relief move in the coming sessions. On the flip side, we sense the base has shifted higher and the bullish gap left on Wednesday at 17,250 - 17,300 is to be seen as key support.

During the week, we witnessed many astonishing moves in midcap and smallcap stocks and traders can continue with the stock-centric approach, however, they need to be very selective going ahead as we are approaching the resistance zone.

Here are two buy calls for a week:

Bajaj Auto: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,344.75 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,280 | Target: Rs 3,440 | Return: 2.8 percent

The entire two-wheeler space has been the weakest link throughout this calendar year. When market was making new highs, this stock remained in a consolidation mode and last month, when we witnessed some correction in the market, it was among the first ones to confirm a breakdown.

As a result, the stock prices corrected ferociously and reached its cluster of supports last week. Now prices look a bit oversold and the way momentum oscillators are placed, we expect some bounce back in this counter.

We recommend buying for trading target of Rs 3,440. The stop loss can be placed at Rs 3,280.

Mahanagar Gas: Buy | LTP: Rs 915.35 | Stop Loss: Rs 889 | Target: Rs 945 | Return: 3.2 percent

This one of the rank outperformers previously has undergone a severe price correction over the past few months. In this course of action, we can see it reaching its key moving averages, where the recent hammering seems to have arrested.

Although, price wise there is no indication of any strength, we expect some pull back in coming days considering the cluster of supports and extreme oversold condition of momentum oscillators.

One can look to take a punt for a near term target of Rs 945. The stop loss can be placed at Rs 889.

Auto manufactures continue to remain under pressure as is evident from November 2021 wholesale numbers. Most of the segments have reported a significant decline on a month-on-month (MoM) basis. Factors such as scarcity of semiconductor chips, delayed monsoon impacting cash flows in rural areas, and de-stocking post the festive season impacted volumes. Within the passenger vehicle (PV) segment, market leader Maruti saw a marginal month-on-month (MoM) growth of 2 percent in volume in November.

Amid a persistent global chip shortage, Bajaj Auto reported a 10 percent fall in total sales volume to 3,79,276 units in November as against 4,22,240 units a year ago.

The automaker reported a weak domestic performance on the back of muted demand, as sales declined 20 percent to 1,58,755 units. Meanwhile, exports, which make up for more than half of the company’s sales, were down marginally by 1 percent.

The decline was largely led by two-wheelers as commercial vehicle sales saw good growth during the month. CV sales on the home turf rose 29 percent in November, while exports recorded a 2 percent uptick.

Two-wheeler sales declined 23 percent on year to 1,44,953 units in India and shipments dropped 2 percent to 1,93,520 units.

Overall, two-wheeler sales fell 12 percent, but commercial vehicle volumes rose 10 percent.

On November 15, a senior official at the company had told Moneycontrol that the automaker lost half of its planned production during the July-September quarter due to the semiconductor shortage. He, however, added that it did not affect sales majorly.

Demand for two-wheelers across most segments remained subdued over the last several months with festive days, too, seeing poor offtake. The April-September period witnessed 9 percent growth in wholesale volumes of two-wheelers, according to data supplied by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).

2021-11-19 14:53:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/is-the-indian-auto-industrys-kodak-moment-here-7739521.html,"Digital photography led to the destruction of Kodak’s traditional film-based model. Kodak missed the digital opportunity, which proved fatal with the company eventually filing for bankruptcy in 2012.

Could the Indian automobile industry be witnessing something similar to what Kodak went through? On the one hand, electric vehicles are coming, perhaps, sooner than later. And on the other, companies such as Uber and Ola threaten to disrupt the demand landscape.

In this backdrop, it’s become challenging to take a call on auto stocks. This was evident at the Moneycontrol Muhurat Roundtable, where investors were hugely divided on the outlook for the sector.

Samir Arora, founder of Helios Capital, pointed out that the sector has been his favourite short for the past one and a half years. While EVs will hit the road in future, how demand pans out remains uncertain and that’s an important variable.

“Nobody is saying that when you have electric vehicles that there’ll be more cars sold than before… And what happens when more players enter the same market for the same amount of growth more or less?” Arora asked, articulating his scepticism. Worse still, incumbents will make more investments to gain market share in EVs.

“There is no hope in this sector,” Arora quipped.

Growth potential

Value investor Raamdeo Agrawal, cofounder of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, finds attractive value in the auto sector. He said that during the transition to EVs, there will be growth in existing companies before the market takes to EVs at scale.

“Growth is going to come to Maruti or Hero or Bajaj or Eicher Motor. All of them will grow, they will make money,” Agarwal pointed out at the roundtable.

He noted that this would take place as the economy returns to normal after the pandemic and assuming that the sector’s semiconductor problems are over.

However, one factor to watch is how price-to-earnings multiples would shape up. While return on equity and cashflows may be high, the kind of valuations that the markets will assign them is hard to predict.

If crude oil prices remain strong, consumer preferences would tilt in favour of EVs, accelerating the transition. To combat the disruption, the incumbents would have to innovate and move quickly, which they’ve been reluctant to do so far.

Sunil Singhania, founder of Abakkus Asset Management, said companies tend to resist launching something that disrupts their own business in the near term.

“There is a little bit of apprehension from the existing auto makers to launch something which can be something new,” he said. Bajaj launched Chetak in an EV mode, but all its attempts so far have been half-hearted, he pointed out.

In contrast, Devina Mehra, chairperson of First Global, said automakers are smart and will make a comeback at the right time.

“Often, incumbents are a little late in the game, but I don’t think that they are going to leave the whole field wide open for only the newcomers,” Mehra said. “These have not been the Kodak kind of companies who have refused to disrupt their business model. Bajaj Auto is a case study of how they have disrupted their (business model) many times, whether it was exports or whether it was giving up scooters.”

While experts remain divided on the Indian auto sector, the market seems to be taking a sceptical view of the incumbents in the two-wheeler space, where there’s more disruption than in the passenger car segment. Shares of Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp and Eicher Motors have been inching lower since February 2021.

Shares of Tata Motors, which seems to be ahead in the EV game, have been racing past other companies in the passenger car segment. Others including Mahindra & Mahindra and Maruti Suzuki India are flirting with their 52-week highs.",626,-0.39850070476531985

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

The semiconductor shortage will likely lead to a fall in Bajaj Auto’s exports as the automotive industry continues to grapple with the severe crunch in chip availability, which has dragged on for nearly a year now.

The Pune-based company lost half of its planned production during the July-September quarter due to the semiconductor shortage, according to a senior official. The Pulsar, Avenger and Platina maker’s domestic volumes in October plummeted 26 percent to 198,738 units from the same month last year.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto, said: “We lost 50 percent of Pulsar, KTM, Husqvarna and Dominar volumes due to the shortage of semiconductors (in Q2FY22). But has this shortage resulted in exactly that many sales loss numbers? I don’t think so.”

Dismal demand environment

Demand for two-wheelers across most segments has remained subdued over the last several months with festive days, too, witnessing a poor offtake. The April-September period witnessed 9 percent growth in wholesale volumes of two-wheelers, according to data supplied by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). However, the data is not strictly comparable since there was a lockdown during that period last year.

Two-wheeler makers say that retail demand from rural areas has not picked up while demand from urban markets has been slower than expected. The 30-35 percent increase in end prices of two-wheelers coupled with the impact of the lockdown due to Covid-19 has crippled demand.

“In overseas markets we are going to see the loss in numbers for one or two months because of the long supply chain and we will begin to see the loss in retail in overseas markets because stocks are running out in November, December and January,” Sharma added.

Why exports matter for Bajaj Auto

Exports are a crucial component in Bajaj Auto’s overall automotive business as more than half of its production is sold overseas. The company sold nearly 56 percent of its two-wheelers in markets outside India during the April-October period in FY22, at 1.29 million units. The company exports to 79 countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia, Middle East, the Asean region and Europe.

Asked if the availability of chips is improving, Sharma said: “The situation is dynamic. It might appear that supplies are improving, and then suddenly, the problem reappears. That is why we feel it is uncertain. There are other companies like Tesla who are setting up huge capacities and soaking up semiconductor supplies. This has had a ripple effect on us. So, this up and down in supplies will continue for some time.”",435,-0.996118426322937

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One

Overall, the global cues were a bit favourable on Monday morning and hence after a long break, markets opened with a decent upside gap to test 18,000. However, within a few minutes of trade, all these gains just disappeared and in fact, we went on to slide below 17,850.

The market was not done with its twists and turns as we saw strong buying interest at lower levels to pull the market higher. The positive momentum gained some pace post the mid-session to surpass the morning high. This was followed by two days of consolidation in a small range. On the weekly expiry day, we had a soft opening on the back of some nervousness seen in major global peers. In fact, in the initial hour itself, the weakness extended in some of the heavyweight pockets.

This led to breach of 17,900 first and then after a decent consolidation, Nifty went on to even test the 17,800 mark. At the stroke of the penultimate hour, the expiry factor started playing out and this time it fortunately favoured the bulls as we witnessed a smart recovery towards the end to trim some portion of losses.

This was followed by a complete opposite action on Friday as we witnessed a gap up opening first and then due to sustained buying in some of the heavyweights, Nifty went on to reclaim the 18,100 mark at the close. The market seems to have trapped in a range and this week, although point wise we gyrated within 300 points, it's hardly one and half a percent range for the Nifty. So we would rather call it a consolidation in the range of 17,800 – 18,100.

For the coming week, 18,200 – 18,350 is to be seen as a crucial range and till the time we do not surpass it convincingly, we are not completely out of the woods yet. In fact, it would be too early to comment on it; but we can clearly see a bearish formation of 'Head and Shoulder' being in process on the daily chart of Nifty. The neckline support is around 17,700 – 17,600, which if gets broken, we could see difficult days for market in the short run. With reference to our recent cautious stance on the market, we will not be surprised to see it happening soon, if we fail to go beyond the mentioned zone of 18,200 – 18,350 in the forthcoming week.

The main reason for us to continue with the cautious stance is the formation of 'Shooting Star' pattern on monthly chart. As long as we do not break the high of the candle, it can prove its significance anytime. Hence, we reiterate on avoiding aggressive longs and even if one wants to follow stock specific moves, needs to be very selective.

Here is one buy call and one sell call for next 2-3 weeks:

L&T Infotech: Buy | LTP: Rs 7,243.25 | Stop Loss: Rs 6,950 | Target: Rs 7,500 | Return: 3.5 percent

This stock has been witnessing its dream run over the past few months. In July, stock prices formed a decent base around Rs 4,000 which was then followed by a strong price volume breakout. After this it never looked back as we could see it now surpassing the Rs 7,200 mark without giving any major correction all this while.

With Friday's strong upsurge, we can see resumption of its higher degree bullish cycle. Since it has already moved up a bit, we recommend buying on a minor pullback towards Rs 7,200 – Rs 7,150 for a short term target of Rs 7,500. The stop loss can be placed at Rs 6,950.

Bajaj Auto: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,635.05 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,790 | Target: Rs 3,500 | Return: (-3.7 percent)

Recently most of the auto stocks did extremely well but two-wheeler stocks like Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto did not participate at all. Now with most of the counters undergoing a corrective phase, these stocks have broken their key multi month supports.

For Bajaj Auto, Rs 3,650 has acted as a sheet anchor on multiple occasions in last few months. On Friday, prices not only slid below it, but also went on to confirm a breakdown on a closing basis.

One can look to sell on a bounce around Rs 3,660 - Rs 3,680 for a target of Rs 3,500. The strict stop loss to be kept at Rs 3,790.

Bajaj Auto’s headquarters in Akurdi, Pune, could start rolling out vehicles once again if the company decides to make electric two and three-wheelers from this plant. Akurdi, which housed Bajaj Auto’s first-ever manufacturing plant, last saw a product roll out in 2007.

Spread over 160 acres, the Akurdi plant currently houses Bajaj Auto’s research and development (R&D), corporate centre, and purchase and sales operations. A senior company official confirmed that Akurdi is the top contender to host the new plant, and that this would get confirmed in a couple of months.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto said, “There is a new plant for premium bikes, which is coming up. It will be our fourth plant. And for the fifth plant, one of the locations which is very attractive is Akurdi itself. We have 160 acres here. We could also look at Waluj, where we have a huge space. But we feel that Akurdi is a natural space.”

Fading out

After the birth of the Pulsar in 2001, which heralded the beginning for Bajaj Auto, scooters were gradually phased out from the company’s portfolio as motorcycles were made at the Chakan plant in Pune. Krystal was the last scooter made by Bajaj Auto from the Akurdi plant before a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) was offered to workers affected by the shutdown.

“Work on the location of the new plant - like what layout we need, logistics and space requirements, vendor requirement, all that assessment is being done now. Once that work is complete, we will know what the investment required is in a month or two,” Sharma added.

EV ambitions

Bajaj Auto currently has only one electric vehicle, the Chetak, in its line-up. The company is working on an electric model under the Husqvarna brand as well as further additions under its own brand. The long-delayed electric three-wheeler, which will mark Bajaj Auto’s entry into the space, will likely debut in 2022.

In July 2021, Bajaj Auto decided to set up a wholly-owned subsidiary to tap growth opportunities in the electric and hybrid two-wheeler, three-wheeler and light four-wheeler categories. The name of the new subsidiary is yet to be finalised and subject to approval by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).

The setting up of a new subsidiary comes amid accelerated participation by a number of start-ups and established companies in the EV space.

Start-ups such as Ola Electric, Ather Electric and Ampere Vehicles and established companies such as Hero Electric, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor Company are revving up their presence in the electric two-wheeler space.

Stake divestment

Pune-based Bajaj Auto is not averse to bringing in a partner for its 100 percent EV subsidiary. There have been a number of instances of consolidation within the EV industry over the last few years.

While Tata Motors sold an 11-15 percent stake to a TPG-led consortium, Greaves Cotton bought out Ampere Vehicles and Bestway Agencies. Ather Energy has had Hero MotoCorp as an investment partner for the last few years.

Asked if Bajaj Auto will tap partnership opportunities using the new subsidiary, Sharma said, “It all depends on how the market unfolds. If that is the best thing that is required at that point in time, we will do it.""

""It is an option on the table. But the most important thing is to understand the speed at which this market is going to transition in two and three-wheelers and what it will take to succeed in that. Basis that, all the other decisions are consequential. There is no boundary that states we will never do this,"" he added.",612,0.7463844418525696

Motilal Oswal's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s (BJAUT) 2QFY22 performance was impacted by high RM cost. While exports remained robust and domestic 3W continued to recover, a recovery in domestic 2Ws is still awaited. BJAUT’s ramp-up in EVs would be a key monitorable as the competitive landscape evolves. The company’s higher dividend yield will provide support to the stock’s valuation.



Outlook

We lower our FY22E/FY23E EPS by 5%/4% to account for the weaker domestic volumes and cost inflation. Maintain Neutral with a TP of INR4,200.

EBITDA margin improved 80 bps q-o-q to 16% in Q2FY22, led by operating leverage benefits and cost reductions, partially mitigated by a rise in raw material costs. As a result, EBITDA and PAT improved 10.7% y-o-y and 12% y-o-y at Rs 1,401 crore and Rs1,275 crore respectively. We continue to remain positive on BAL’s performance going forward, led by its expected market share gains in domestic 125cc+ markets and continued dominancy in key export markets. The company is well placed in terms of capabilities to scale up its electric vehicle (EV) production when it witnesses faster adoption of EVs than expected. Also, there has been a recovery in three wheeler (3W) sales across its sub-segments, small/large passenger vehicles and cargo vehicles. We maintain buy on the stock given its strong business outlook and comfortable valuation.

Outlook

BAL’s business outlook remains positive with a recovery expected in FY2022, as economic activities normalise in the domestic market. The management expects exports to remain a key growth driver in FY2022. We expect BAL to continue to increase its market share in the domestic and export markets, given its strong portfolio of premium brands and cost-effective, entry-level electronic injection systems. OPM would expand because of a richer product mix, operating leverage and cost-control measures. The company has strong long-term revenue visibility, given its leadership position in the premium bikes segment and key export destinations. The stock trades below its historical average P/E multiple of 14.5x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.4x its FY2023E estimates. Hence, we retain our Buy rating on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs. 4,800.

Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj said on October 28 that the company has been losing 30 percent in volumes in 150cc plus segment over the past six months. This trend may continue for 15 months, given there is no end to the chip shortage, CNBC-TV18 quoted him as saying.

In the last four quarters, there has been a 15 percent price rise in Bajaj auto bikes and scooters, due to increased commodity prices, although only eight to 10 percent of the commodity price pressure was passed on to end consumers.

Currently, Bajaj Pulsar is contributing one and a half million in sale volumes and the company is banking on Pulsar 250 to bring in the most sales. Notably, Bajaj Auto currently has a 20 percent market share in the 250-400 cc sports biking segment.

The demand and supply shortage due to the chip crisis has hit Bajaj Auto hard. So far, the company has performed poorly vis-à-vis EV sales due to a shortage of components.

However, with the intention to build a strong electric vehicle (EV) portfolio, the company will be rolling out the Electric Husqvarna scooter next year. The Bajaj MD said: “You will see something new from Bajaj Auto on two wheels next year.”

Going forward, Bajaj Auto has plans to roll out two and three-wheeler EVs every year, Rajiv Bajaj said, adding that the first electric three-wheeler can be expected next year.

The board of Bajaj Auto has approved the setting up of a 100 percent captive finance subsidiary that would finance only those products that are manufactured by the company.

Bajaj Auto Ltd on Wednesday reported a 71 per cent jump in consolidated profit after tax at Rs 2,039.86 crore for the second quarter ended September 2021, aided by an exceptional item gain and growth in exports.

Bajaj Auto said its Netherlands-based wholly owned subsidiary Bajaj Auto International Holdings BV (BAIH BV), which has 47.99 per cent stake in KTM AG, had swapped 46.5 per cent stake in KTM AG for 49.9 per cent shareholding in Pierer Bajaj AG on September 29, 2021.

""The resultant gain in fair value of Rs 501 crore is shown as an exceptional item in consolidated profit after tax of Bajaj Auto Ltd,” the company said.

During the second quarter, the company’s total vehicle sales stood at 11,44,407 units as against 10,53,337 units in the year-ago period, a growth of 9 per cent.

During the second quarter, the company’s total vehicle sales stood at 11,44,407 units as against 10,53,337 units in the year-ago period, a growth of 9 per cent.

Tw0-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto Ltd is set to announce its financial results for the three months ended September, the second quarter of the current financial year, on October 27. What are the expectations?

Double-digit revenue growth

Analysts expect the company to report double-digit, year-on-year (YoY) growth in revenue for the quarter, driven by a combination of growth in sales volume and price increases.

BNP Paribas Securities India Pvt Ltd expects revenue growth of 12.2 percent YoY on the back of an 8.5 percent increase in sales and higher realisation from price increases and product mix.

In the second quarter of the last financial year and the first quarter of the current year, Bajaj Auto’s revenues was Rs 7,156 crore and Rs 7,386 crore, respectively.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects Bajaj Auto’s revenue in the September quarter to increase at a relatively faster pace of 19 percent YoY led by a 9 percent increase in sales by volume and a 9 percent increase in average selling price.

Margin woes persist

To be sure, higher input costs are a big worry on the margin front. Bajaj Auto increased prices during the quarter, which would help soften the blow to some extent.

Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd expects Bajaj Auto’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin to remain little changed quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) owing to commodity cost pressure.

In the first quarter of the last financial year and the first quarter of the current year, the company’s EBITDA margin was 17.7 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively.

EBITDA excludes taxes, the cost of capital investments, and expenses associated with debt like interest and serves purely as an indicator of corporate performance.

Kotak expects the EBITDA margin to decline by 20 basis points (bps) QoQ due to an increase in raw material (RM) basket (300-350 bp negative impact), partly offset by price increases during the quarter (200 bp positive impact), the benefit of Remissionof Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme (30-40 bp positive impact) and lower employee costs. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Management commentary

Financial results in the previous quarter had suffered the impact of higher insurance costs on account of COVID-19.

Needless to say, investors would have to follow management commentary. Here, “guidance on 2W industry volumes for FY22 and FY23 (for domestic and export markets), reason for slowdown in domestic 2W market, visibility on festive demand, divergence seen between rural and urban demand, guidance on market share, margins for FY22 and FY23, comments on recovery in the domestic 3W market, discounting trends and strategy for the future” are some factors that investors should look for, says BNP Paribas.

Shares of Bajaj Auto have underperformed the broader markets in 2021. So far this calendar year, the Bajaj Auto stock has risen by around 10 percent versus a 30 percent gain in the Nifty 100 index.

Ahead of the results announcement, the stock was trading at Rs 3,810 at 11.34 am on October 27 on the National Stock Exchange.",502,-0.1614494025707245

Bajaj Auto and the promoters of KTM have finalised a share swap deal which would lead to the Indian company hold stake in a KTM Group company that holds equity in a listed entity of the Austrian bike maker.

Bajaj Auto International Holding BV (BAIHBV) has swapped 46.5 percent (out of its about 48 percent) stake in KTMAG, for a 49.9 percent stake in PTW Holding, thus becoming an equity holder along with Pierer lndustries in PTW Holding.

PTW Holding currently owns 60 percent in the listed entity Pierer Mobility AG (PMAG). After the share swap deal is completed, PTW Holding will increase this stake to 73.3 percent.

In a second step, PTW Holding will contribute a 46.5 percent stake in KTMAG to PMAG in exchange for 11,257,861 fresh shares in PMAG. This step approved by PMAG's management board on September 29, is targeted for implementation before the end of October 2021 on approval of the PMAG Supervisory Board.

The management board of PMAG has resolved to execute a capital increase against contribution in kind in the total amount of Euro 895 million, corresponding to 49.9 percent of the existing share capital, by making use of the authorised capital. In this context, 11,257,861 shares will be issued at an issue price of Euro 79.50 per share, which is higher than the current stock market price.

“The capital increase will be carried out exclusively against contribution in kind of KTM shares by PTW Holding AG and under exclusion of subscription rights of the other shareholders. The capital increase will be executed, subject to the approval of the supervisory board, in the second half of October,” PMAG said in a statement.

Following the execution of this transaction, the shareholding of PMAG in the operating KTM AG will increase from currently around 51.7 percent to around 98.2 percent. The Pierer Group will continue to retain sole control over PMAG.",326,

As part of the scheme, the government will provide incentives to the automobile industry over five years.

How will the PLI scheme help out the industry?

Last year, the government had announced the scheme for the automobile and auto components sector with an outlay of Rs 57,043 crore, for a period of five years.

The Cabinet has reduced the scheme for the sector to Rs 25,938 crore to shift focus on hydrogen fuel vehicles and electric vehicles. ""We are leapfrogging (technology) to environmentally cleaner vehicles. The new PLI scheme will work hand-in-hand with the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India Phase II scheme and PLI scheme for advanced cells and therefore meet all the requirements of the electric vehicle ecosystem in India,"" the Minister of Information and Broadcasting of India Anurag Thakur said when asked why the PLI scheme for the automobile sector has been reduced. For automobile original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avail the scheme, they must have a minimum of Rs 10,000 crore in revenue and will have to make new investments of Rs 2,000 crore in five years to take benefits from the scheme. For two-wheeler companies, the amount of new investment is Rs 1,000 crore. Auto-component makers must have a minimum revenue of Rs 500 crore and Rs 150 crore fixed assets investment to be eligible for the PLI.

While most industry participants welcome the PLI scheme by the government, Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Auto, said that he is not in favour of any such incentives or subsidies because the future can not be built on subsidies, it has to be built on competitiveness and sustainability.



Rajiv Bajaj while speaking to CNBC-TV18 said that the intention of the PLI scheme to boost exports has changed completely.





He said his inference, from reading between the lines is that with the arbitrary lockdowns over the last 18 months, the government finds itself in a position where it doesn’t have the Rs 57,000 crore, and only has Rs 26,000 crore and is trying to ""cut their suit to the size of the cloth available with them.”





However, Venu Srinivasan, Chairman, TVS Motor Co and Girish Wagh, Executive Director, Tata Motors welcomed the scheme.

“The revised focus of PLI scheme on alternative fuels, electric vehicles and utilisation of advanced technological innovation, will help the industry move faster towards the future technologies,"" Srinivasan said.

Srinivasan added that the government is clearly focussing on producing electric vehicles in India and the scheme gives the right impetus to the industry to move rapidly in that direction.

Similarly, Wagh also said that the scheme is both progressive and transformational.

""Several meaningful incentives have been offered across the entire value chain engaged in manufacturing of battery-powered electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell, as well as their supporting infrastructure and exports,"" Wagh said.

He added that the PLI scheme will boost localisation, domestic manufacturing and also attract foreign investments.

Sunjay Kapur, President, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India, also said that with global economies de-risking their supply chains, the PLI will aid India in developing into an attractive alternative source of high-end auto components.",616,0.9934428334236145

Tesla’s pitch for lowering import duty on fully-built electric cars has stoked a raging debate among automakers, dividing the industry right down the middle.

Billionaire CEO Elon Musk’s tweet about high import taxes has drawn a mixed responses from India’s automotive industry. While Hyundai agrees with Tesla for a cut in duties, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and start-up Ola Electric are against any such cuts.

Responding to Musk’s tweet, Bhavish Aggarwal, CEO and founder of Ola, had said on the microblogging site: “Let's have confidence in our ability to build indigenously and also attract global OEMs to build in India, not just import. We won't be the first country to do so!""

Responding to Moneycontrol, Venu Srinivasan, Chairman of TVS Motor Company and TVS Group said, “We should encourage local manufacturing as envisioned by the government. I believe that importing CBUs (completely built units) would be detrimental for the future of Indian manufacturing.”

TVS Motor Company joined the electric vehicle bandwagon in January 2020 with the launch of its first all-electric product; the iQube scooter, which is almost fully made at a TVS factory.

Industrialist Rajiv Bajaj, however, said he was in favour of a middle path. He said that a cut in duty is favourable till the time the market matures and demand grows but thereafter would warrant a high duty structure for failing to manufacture the vehicles locally.

“I favour a middle path, because for me the guiding principle is demand first and then supply,” said Bajaj, the Managing Director of Bajaj Auto. “So up to a certain volume per year which may be different for different segments ranging from mass to premium, duties should be lower.”

“As an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) progressively achieves this volume it must localise aggressively failing which duties applicable would be much higher. So, in effect, a simple phased manufacturing plan would give the OEM time to test the market for demand without investing prematurely while simultaneously ensuring that when scale is achieved jobs are created in India not elsewhere,” Bajaj added.

Bajaj Auto has also entered the EV space with the Chetak all-electric scooter which was launched in January 2020. The Pune-based company is in the process of creating a new company exclusively for electric and hybrid vehicles.

Maruti Suzuki Chairman R C Bhargava also said, ""The government policy is clearly in favour of local manufacturing and that applies to EVs also. There is no justification for changing this policy for any one particular product.""

Tata Motors, India’s third largest carmaker, is the leader in the electric passenger car segment. The Mumbai-based company controls more than half of the electric car demand of India with the locally made Nexon EV. Tata Motors also has spoken against Tesla’s pitch for duty lowering stating that the government is expected to follow the policy of promoting local manufacturing of EVs.

Speaking to reporters PB Balaji, Chief Financial Officer, Tata Motors said, “I am sure the government will remain consistent to the philosophy of phased manufacturing plans for EV and the principles of FAME II. This is what all of us are working towards. The companies who are investing in the EV segment are looking forward to long-term visibility of the policy.” FAME, which stands for Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles, is a central government-funded demand-incentive scheme for the promotion of electric vehicles.

Tata Motors’ stance on the subject comes at a time when the Rs one-crore Jaguar I-Pace, a fully electric and fully imported model, is on sale in the country.

Import duty on EVs in India is 100 percent if CIF (cost, insurance and freight) value is more than $40,000 and 60 percent if CIF value is less than $40,000.

The government, on its part, seems reluctant to cut import taxes. Moneycontrol had reported that senior government officials have categorically ruled out any possibility of granting Tesla any company-specific incentives or even an across-the-board cut in duties on fully built foreign vehicles.",673,-0.37950119376182556

After a prolonged lull Bajaj Auto will make a renewed push for the Qute quadricycle by the end of this fiscal year to tap the budget shared-mobility segment.

Established as a smart taxi within the space of a three-wheeler and a car, the Qute claims to offer car-like comfort and the travel cost of a three-wheeler. Bajaj’s Qute will be challenged by Mahindra & Mahindra’s own quadricycle called Atom which could be launched next year.

Qute is India’s first quadricycle, a new vehicle category created by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. The four-wheeled, four-seater vehicle is allowed to be registered as a vehicle used for commercial purposes (taxi) only.

Bajaj Auto introduced the Qute only in select markets including Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra before the onset of Bharat Stage VI at the start of Q1FY20. The Pune-based company joined hands with app-based ride sharing aggregator Uber to cater to the Bengaluru market.

Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto said, “Ride share aggregators are a good platform to take the Qute proposition to the masses. In the limited period we had before BS-VI, we collaborated successfully with Uber for a pilot in Bengaluru and used feedback from 1 lakh customers. Post relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions and readiness of the product in October-November this partnership will be picked up again in Bengaluru and rolled out in other metros like Hyderabad. We expect sales of the Qute to commence in Q4 of this fiscal.”

Following the pandemic-induced lockdown in FY21 and subsequent uncertainty of demand for the ride-sharing concept, Bajaj Auto stopped wholesale sales of the Qute in India. For similar reasons, during the same time, passenger three-wheelers and buses also took a knock. But with the faster rate of inoculation and the government’s target of vaccinating all citizens by December, shared mobility is expected to come back on stream.

“The introduction of Qute in India has been a long, arduous journey as it had to navigate the process of creating a new set of regulations at the Centre, followed by each state level. The Qute also has to conform to BS-VI standards. These were defined slightly later but this work will be completed for all variants of Qute by the end of Q3FY22. After which we should pick up the development effort for creation of this new category,” Sharma added.

In addition to the Chetak, Bajaj Auto is working on electrifying the Qute as well. This is in line with its plans of launching electric three-wheelers which was originally scheduled for the second half of this year. M&M will launch the Atom in an electric form and will be the cheapest electric four-wheeler from the company.",458,0.050507113337516785

The automotive industry may be bracing for the third round of price hikes in recent months as raw material costs continue to soar because of the relentless surge in steel and precious metal rates.

Companies that manufacture everything from scooters to heavy trucks have already raised prices a couple of times since April because of higher raw material costs.

The surge in input costs comes against the broader expectations of softening of raw material prices as per guidance given by the auto companies during the April-June quarter.

Speaking to Moneycontrol PB Balaji, chief financial officer, Tata Motors said, “We did expect some degree of softening of raw material prices but that has not been the case and steel in particular has been a runaway and along with that are the precious metals which are inflating very fast.”

Tata Motors has raised prices by 1-2.5 percent across commercial vehicles (CV) in July after a 2.5 percent hike seen in April. The Mumbai-based company is the market leader in the CV segment. In passenger vehicles (PV), Tata Motors raised prices to the tune of 1.8 percent in May but is yet to take a call for the second round.

“The first round of price hikes in CVs as the market leader is already taken and for PVs, we will follow the leader there. But the inflation is significant and its impact on margins is also significant and therefore we will do our best to mitigate it through our cost reduction plan but beyond a certain point we will have to look at price hikes,” Balaji added.

In a regulatory filing in June, car market leader Maruti Suzuki announced a price hike to be effective in the July-September quarter.

Commodity prices are expected to remain at multi-year highs in the first half of FY22 (resulting in multi-year high average in FY22), before softening in the second half of the year, as per report from rating and market intelligence company ICRA.

Bajaj Auto, the country’s third-largest two-wheeler brand, has undertaken a 5 percent increase in prices across products between Q1 and Q2 FY22 and is evaluating opportunities for passing on further increases.

The Pune-based maker of Pulsar motorcycles said it faced strong headwinds of cost increases to the tune of 3.7 percent in Q1 of which it could recover only about 1.5 percent keeping demand sensitivities in mind during that quarter.

Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto said, “We announced new pricing in early July through which we recovered two-thirds of the increase in raw material costs but there is still some work to do. We will evaluate further scope as the quarter progresses. We expect Q2 to be better than Q1 in terms of demand.”

Unlike the PV segment, demand for two-wheelers has been sluggish since the unlocking of markets in mid-June. The pent-up demand which was very strong in FY21 has remained muted in FY22 leading to higher than desired inventory levels at dealerships. Two-wheeler makers will have to factor in the demand trend when deciding on price hikes.

Soumen Ray, Chief Financial Officer, Bajaj Auto said, “We have seen further increase in input cost in Q2. We hoped that Q2 would be muted but it is as aggressive as Q1 was. In nine months, steel prices have gone up by 50 percent. I have never seen such a sharp surge in commodity prices. Steel continues to remain hot. The rate of increase in nickel and zinc has come down but their prices have not.”

Mahantesh Sabarad, Head - Retail Research, SBICAP Securities said, ""Historically automobile companies have always raised prices on various pretexts be it raw material cost increase, new model features or even excise (now GST) increases irrespective of demand conditions. This time is no different. When you raise prices when demand is weak, you do not further constrain it as the buyers who do come to market are the ones who have the need or necessity to buy a car. Besides, bank loan interest rates are at near historical lows.""",683,-0.12296035885810852

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s Q1FY22 revenue and PAT were in line with estimates, while EBITDA margin missed expectations. Management remained positive on growth prospects, especially exports, where BAL expects to gain market share in key regions, driven by brand recall, product launches and value-for-money proposition. We expect BAL’s earnings to report a 23.2% CAGR during FY2021-FY2023E, driven by a 21.4% revenue CAGR and 120 bps rise in EBITDA margin in FY23E. Stock trades below historical average P/E multiple of 14.5x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.4x its FY2023E estimates.

Outlook

We maintain a Buy on stock with an unchanged PT of Rs. 4,800, factoring strong business outlook and comfortable valuations.

BJAUT’s 1QFY22 performance was impacted by high RM and employee cost. While core business recovery is ahead of the market, its ramp-up in EVs would be a key monitorable as the inflection point for EVs comes closer. Higher dividend yield will provide a floor to valuations.

The first motorcycle born out of the partnership between Bajaj Auto and Triumph Motorcycles could hit the showrooms towards the end of FY23, after a delay of six-nine months.

Travel restrictions due to COVID-19 brought about by the Delta variant forced the UK to suspend air travel with India, and that forced teams from both the motorcycle companies to move slowly on product development schedules.

The Pune-based Bajaj Auto and UK-based Triumph Motorcycles are jointly developing the motorcycles that will be sold under the Triumph brand, having mid-capacity engines (250cc-700cc). The entry models could start below Rs 2 lakh. The current entry price of the Triumph brand is Rs 7 lakh.

Speaking to analysts, Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto, said: “We are in the (product development) stage, where we have made prototypes, and these require physical presence to make corrections, if needed. This whole process takes time. The partnership got hit because of COVID.”

From the earlier declared time-frame of 2022, the rollout of the Triumph bikes has been pushed forward to 2023.

“We expect towards the end of FY23 to probably present the products in the market. There will be a delay of 6-9 months from what we had indicated earlier,” Sharma added.

The collaboration will combine strengths in design, technology, cost- competitive manufacturing and an intimate knowledge of key target markets to deliver a range of products.

Bike to roll out from Chakan plant

Triumph bikes will be one of the brands to roll off the production lines from Bajaj Auto’s new Rs 650-crore plant at Chakan, Pune. KTM and Husqvarna will be the other brands to be produced from the same plant, which becomes operational in 2023.

After being in discussions since 2017, Bajaj Auto and Triumph Motorcycles signed the partnership agreement only in 2020. The non-equity partnership aims to have a high degree of localisation that will be on par with a Bajaj Pulsar or a KTM Duke manufactured in India.

The two companies are set to challenge the dominance and monopoly of Eicher Motors-controlled Royal Enfield in the mid-capacity motorcycle segment.

In addition, the upcoming bikes of Harley-Davidson, which is being developed by Hero MotoCorp, bikes of Jawa and bikes from the partnership between TVS Motor Company and BMW will also be challenged by the Bajaj-Triumph combine.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

BJAUT’s 1QFY22 results were impacted by lower scale of operations and RM cost inflation. Gross margins contracted 590bp YoY/ 110bp QoQ, yet better product mix led by higher share of exports and higher USD realizations partially offset the RM dent. Also launch of Pulsar helped BJAUT to gain market share in 125cc segment (+300bps in 1QFY22), thereby aiding domestic motorcycle segment. Market share stood at 19.7% in 1QFY22 v/s 18.1% in FY21. Management remained cautious on margin outlook amid RM inflation. However, factors such as 1) healthy exports momentum both for 2W/3W and 2) likely beneficiary of RoDTEP scheme, are favoring factors, in our view.

Outlook

We largely keep our estimates unchanged and retain ‘HOLD’ with revised TP of Rs3,919 (v/s Rs3,927, 18x Mar-23 EPS).

Bajaj Auto share price added a percent in the morning session on July 23, data after the company reported a standalone net profit of Rs 1,061.18 crore for the June quarter FY22, up from Rs 528.04 crore in the year-ago period. The auto maker's revenue more than doubled to Rs 7,386 crore in Q1FY22 against Rs 3,079.2 crore in Q1FY21.

EBITDA for the quarter came at Rs 1,153 crore, while the EBITDA margin stood at 15.6 percent. In the same quarter last year, EBITDA was Rs 441 crore and the EBITDA margin was 14.3 percent. Tax expense came at Rs 321.5 crore against Rs 156.3 crore YoY.

""Q1FY22 has been a challenging quarter; the recovery over the past three quarters got undone with the second wave of COVID-19, which again led to restrictions and full or partial lockdowns.

The stock was trading at Rs 3,872.70, up Rs 20.10, or 0.52 percent. It touched an intraday high of Rs 3,924.80 and an intraday low of Rs 3,854.60.

Volumes during the quarter stood at 10,06,014 units. Nearly 3,42,000 motorcycles were sold in the domestic market during the June quarter.

Bajaj Auto's domestic motorcycle market share improved to around 19.7 percent in Q1FY22 against 17 .3 percent in Q4FY21.

As many as 14,000 commercial vehicles were sold in the domestic market. The company said it sold over 6,48,000 units in various international markets during the quarter despite challenges in the availability of containers. By region, Africa, SAME and LA TAM continued to record strong sales.

Here is what global brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after Q1 earnings:

The first quarter was slightly below expectations but export outlook is healthy. The company's focus is on premium portfolio with margin catalysts in place.

Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target : Rs 4,550

The earnings were in-line. The company also formed an EV/hybrid focussed subsidiary. A weaker mix was offset by price increases during the quarter.

Citi | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 3,000

The commodity cost pressures were evident in Q1. Better pricing and lower SG&A expenses partly mitigated the impact on margin. ""Concerned about motorcycle product mix and domestic 3-wheeler demand. Reduce earnings estimates by 1-2 percent over FY22-24,"" it said.

Macquarie | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 4,053

The margin was impacted by lower volumes and input cost inflation. Near-term headwinds persist. Exports momentum and gradual domestic recovery will support earnings.

Though states have started gradual unlocking of markets, two wheelers are yet to see the kind of surge in demand witnessed by cars and SUVs. Bajaj Auto is expecting demand in India to be flat for the year, but exports are expected to hit an all-time high.

During FY21, Bajaj Auto, the third-largest two-wheeler brand in India, sold more vehicles outside India for the first time. Its exports of 2.05 million units (two-wheelers and three-wheelers) were higher than the 1.91 million units sold within India in FY21.

“The overall situation remains quite ambiguous for the industry. Its prospects are very closely inter-twined with the progression of the pandemic and the advancement of the vaccination programme and its consequent impact, directly and indirectly, on our business. However, based on our current information and visibility, we expect the year to be flat or to grow in low single digit over the previous year,” Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto, said at the annual general meeting of the company.

Slow demand leads to inventory pile-up

Demand for two-wheelers within India has not picked up as generously as expected, leading to a slightly higher inventory level at dealerships. As per the apex dealer association, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), inventory, at the end of June, stood at 25 days while retail volumes grew by just under 17 percent. The Street was expecting June volumes to rise on expected pent-up demand.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Soumen Ray, chief financial officer, Bajaj Auto, said: “Demand has not come back as fast as we would have believed, but these are early days. Let us look at it by the end of July. But yes, demand is not looking as strong as last year.”

During the April-June quarter, Bajaj Auto launched the CT 110X and the Pulsar 125NS motorcycles in the domestic market. The company claims to have lined up a series of launches for the year, which would start from September.

“We have an exciting pipeline of products, including upgrades as well as new platforms. Both our launches in Q1 have been received very well. Come September, we should see the start of exciting new introductions, both in the commuter and the sports segments, which will shift the industry standards and offer new propositions to customers,” Sharma added.

The current year will also see Bajaj entering four new export markets, including the Brazilian market, which is one of the top five markets for motorcycles in the world. With a targeted 200,000 units a month, the Pune-based company is expected to close FY22 with more than 2.4 million in exports.

“Internationally, we have been exporting over 200,000 vehicles every month to 79 countries, out of which 30 are very important markets for us. And they span across Latin America, Africa, Asia, Middle East and ASEAN countries. We expect to continue with the two-lakh plus exports every month,” Sharma added.",498,0.599723505973816

Bajaj Auto will set up a wholly owned subsidiary to tap growth opportunities in the electric and hybrid two-wheeler, three-wheeler and light four-wheeler categories.

The proposed authorised capital of the 100 percent subsidiary company will be Rs 100 crore and the paid-up capital being proposed is Rs 5 crore. The name of the new subsidiary is yet to be finalised and subject to approval by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

The setting up of a new subsidiary comes amid accelerated participation by a number of start-ups and established companies in the electric vehicle space. Start-ups like Ola Electric, Ather Electric and Ampere Vehicles and established companies like Hero Electric, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor Company are stepping on the gas in the electric two-wheeler space.

Speaking at the annual general meeting (AMG), Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto said, “We are evaluating the full spectrum of possibilities in micro-mobility to performance motorcycles on the electric platform. Today the board of directors have approved the formation of a 100 percent subsidiary purely to build the electric vehicle (EV) business. We view the future of the development of EV industry as an opportunity and not as a threat.”

Bajaj Auto's presence in the EV space is through the Chetak, a fully electric scooter which was launched in January 2020 but only in Pune and Bengaluru. Since then the Pune-based company expanded sales to one more market, Nagpur. However, plans are afoot to add 22 more before the end of this year.

“We have commenced sales (of the Chetak) in Pune and Bengaluru but demand exceeds supply. We should be looking at a strike rate of 1,000 units a month for the Chetak. We should be in four more cities within this quarter and in 25 by end of this year,” Sharma added.

Bajaj Auto further clarified that it has built a manufacturing capacity of 60,000 units a year for the Chetak. While the Chetak is the most premium electric scooter in India the capacity set up by the company pales in comparison to the company’s peers. Ola Electric, for instance, is setting a factory in Tamil Nadu with a full capacity of 10 million units. Ather Energy’s new facility has the capacity to produce more than 100,000 every year while Ampere Vehicles is setting up one million units a year capacity.

“We are very excited about the prospect of new opportunities EV offers particularly in the space of lighter vehicles like scooter and step-thrus. In the next 3-5 years this space offers a huge opportunity to enter a market of 5 million scooters in India and almost 7 million scooters and step-thrus overseas. The transition is expected to unfold over a period of time because the cost of EVs as of date is far in excess of similar ICE vehicles,” Sharma pointed out.

""We recognise that this may change in the future and therefore our objective is to be prepared to leverage this change as it unfolds. Our immediate focus is on building capability and consumer connect and we have started it with the Chetak,"" he added.",525,0.9998098015785217

The auto maker's revenue more than doubled to Rs 7,386 crore in Q1FY22 against Rs 3,079.2 crore in Q1FY21.

While revenue came in line with the expectations, profit was slightly below a poll of analysts by CNBC-TV18. As per the poll, profit was expected at Rs 1,137 crore and revenue at Rs 7,352 crore.

EBITDA for the quarter came at Rs 1,153 crore, while the EBITDA margin stood at 15.6 percent.

In the same quarter last year, EBITDA was Rs 441 crore and the EBITDA margin was 14.3 percent.

Tax expense came at Rs 321.5 crore against Rs 156.3 crore YoY.

""Q1FY22 has been a challenging quarter; the recovery over the past three quarters got undone with the second wave of COVID-19 which again led to restrictions and full or partial lockdowns. This resulted in weaker domestic demand, which was partially offset with strong exports across all major geographies,"" the company said in a BSE filing.

While the pandemic has impacted Q1 of FY21 and of FY22, the severity of impact was very different and

hence, the performance of the two quarters is not strictly comparable, it said.

Volume during the quarter stood at 10,06,014 units. Nearly 3,42,000 motorcycles were sold in the domestic market during the June quarter.

Bajaj Auto's domestic motorcycle market share improved to around 19.7 percent in Q1FY22 against 17 .3 percent in Q4FY21.

As many as 14,000 commercial vehicles were sold in the domestic market. The company said it sold over 6,48,000 units in various international markets during the quarter, despite challenges in availability of containers. By region, Africa, SAME and LA TAM continued to record strong sales.",298,0.20039560794830322

Due to the low base—the June quarter of the previous year was severely hit by COVID-19—the numbers may show a steep rise in percentage terms.

""Year-on-year (YoY) and quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) numbers are not comparable due to COVID disruptions,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities.

Kotak expects the auto maker’s volumes to have increased 127 percent YoY in Q1FY22 led by the low-base effect.

Net sales may come at Rs 7,468.1 crore, while adjusted PAT may be around Rs 1,077.4 crore for Q1FY22, Kotak said.

It expects EBITDA margin to decline by 115 bps QoQ due to a hike in raw material prices, which may be partially offset by price increase and cost reductions.

As per brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, strong exports partially offset a domestic sales loss of Bajaj Auto.

""Higher export contribution and price hikes taken in Jan-Jun’21 may dilute the impact of cost inflation. The decline in export incentives, higher commodity cost, and operating leverage may impact margin,"" Motilal Oswal said.

The brokerage expects the company's Q1 net sales at Rs 7,319.5 crore, while adjusted PAT may come at Rs 1,117.4 crore.

Brokerage firm BOBCAPS expects Bajaj Auto's volumes to decline 14 percent QoQ. Operating margin may contract 70 bps QoQ on higher raw material cost.

As per BOBCAPS estimates, Bajaj Auto may post net sales of Rs 7,615.2 crore for the quarter, while adjusted PAT may come at Rs 1,200 crore.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Bajaj Auto

BJAUT’s FY21 annual report highlights its resilient performance in a year impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, led by continuous premiumization and focus on R&D. Its focus on exports and on Premium Motorcycles helped it to outperform the 2W industry in a tough year. Contribution of exports to net sales grew 480bp to 46.8% in FY21. While its share in the domestic Motorcycle market declined marginally (50bp) to 18%, largely led by market share loss of 770bp in the Sports segment due to cannibalization by Pulsar 125cc. It expects to further strengthen its position in the Premium segment, with upper-end Pulsars, KTMs, Dominars, Husqvarnas, and the soon to be launched Triumphs. -Chetak is expected to be launched in additional cities in FY22, and would anchor BJAUT’s foray into the electric mobility space after seeing disruptions in FY21. In the domestic 3W segment, it lost ~670bp market share to 50.6%, due to the sharp impact of COVID-19 in its area of strength: urban 3Ws. It improved its market share in both Goods Carriers (+670bp to 33.7%) and the Diesel Passenger segment (+12.7pp to 41.7%), in turn gaining leadership in all segments of 3Ws. It has approved a new dividend policy that links payout to the level of cash/cash equivalents on its books, in turn increasing the payout up to 90% of PAT (v/s 50% payout under its old policy).

Bajaj Auto will set up an engineering design centre (EDC) in Barcelona, Spain, as well as an assembly plant in Brazil to boost its international presence.

This will be the Pune-based motorcycle specialist’s second EDC outside India. Last financial year, the company set up a similar centre in Bangkok, Thailand, which has now commenced operations.

“Bajaj Auto is going to set up an EDC in Barcelona. It is also in the process of setting up operations to address the motorcycle market in Brazil through a wholly owned subsidiary,” the maker of Pulsar and KTM bikes said in its latest annual report.

The EDC in Spain is Bajaj’s attempt at garnering European engineering talent, on the lines of its rivals Hero MotoCorp and Royal Enfield. Hero MotoCorp has a technical centre, operational in Germany from 2019. Eicher Motors-controlled Royal Enfield started its global technology centre in the UK in 2017.

The Spanish EDC will allow Bajaj to work closely with partner KTM’s Austria and Triumph’s UK-based technical centres. The three companies are cooperating on vehicle and engine technologies. Bajaj’s Pune-based factory is producing and exporting KTM and Husqvarna branded motorcycles and will soon produce Triumph bikes.

Thailand centre becomes operational

Bajaj Auto further stated that it has obtained all approvals in Thailand to set up an International Business Centre (IBC) and an EDC under the subsidiary, Bajaj Auto (Thailand).

While the start of activity was delayed by the pandemic, the EDC is now operational and international designers are operating from this new facility in Bangkok. It marks a new beginning for Bajaj Auto’s R&D expanding its design centre to trend-defining markets around the globe. Full-scale operations, including IBC, are likely to commence in FY22, the annual report further added.

Though Bajaj Auto is the third-largest two-wheeler brand in India, it is the largest exporter of two-wheelers and exported nearly 1.8 million two-wheelers during FY21.

With a share of 51 percent in two-wheeler exports, Bajaj Auto’s motorcycle exports were more than double, compared to domestic volumes, as per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) for April and May.

Bajaj Auto claims to be among the top two manufacturers in several countries in Africa, where it sells more than a million motorcycles a year. Latin America could become the next big market for the company, where it recorded the highest-ever volumes in many key countries, such as Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru and Bolivia.

Brazil’s two-wheeler market is the largest in Latin America, and the eighth-largest in the world. While Brazil’s two-wheeler market is nearly 1 million, it is dominated by Japanese heavyweight Honda, commanding a market share of 80 percent.",458,0.9999948740005493

Any more lockdowns enforced by COVID-19 may not necessarily control the spread of the virus but will surely impact businesses, hit employment, and cripple the economy, industrialist Rahul Bajaj warned.

Addressing shareholders for the final time as the Chairman of Bajaj Auto, the 83-year-old Bajaj – also one of the most outspoken of India Inc. bosses - said, “Let us hope that rapidly accelerated vaccinations coupled with a strict enforcement of masks and social distancing will soon bring the second wave under control. Let us also hope that we do not react to the epidemic by declaring more lockdowns, as we did the last time. For these will destroy business, employment and the economy without necessarily controlling the spread of the disease.”

The six-week lockdown announced during the first wave of the pandemic last year, April to May, saw automotive factories and showrooms shutdown overnight across the country.

Production and demand came back on stream only during the festive season later in 2020.

But following a surge in new COVID-19 cases by March 2021, as many as 20 states declared lockdowns and imposed restrictions on the movement of people.

As a result, business was hit again in April and May before some relief was visible in the second half of June.

As against 151,000 units during FY21, Bajaj Auto’s average domestic monthly sales of two-wheeler, fell to 93,500 units during April and May this year.

The Pune-based company makes bikes under the brands Pulsar, Avenger, KTM and Husqvarna. While Bajaj Auto’s financial performance for Q1FY22 is awaited, the company saw its net profit falling more than half during Q1FY21 compared to Q1FY20 due to the COVID-19 disruption.

“There is enough evidence to show that lockdowns have not worked to limit the spread of the virus. Instead, such lockdowns create massive economic uncertainty; threaten the livelihood of daily workers and the poor; prompt needless urban-to-rural migration; and sharply accentuate fears in an already fearful milieu. That will be an unmitigated disaster,” the management discussion and analysis attached in the annual report of Bajaj Auto added.

“The solution is a combination of strictly enforced safety — involving masks and basic social distancing — coupled with a rapidly accelerated vaccination programme. And, subject to basic safety and inoculation, work must continue. For that is what brings in the daily bread, feeds home and hearth and makes a nation grow,” the report further added.

Rahul Bajaj who has been one of the longest serving chairman in corporate India, stepped down from the role after holding the position for nearly five decades.

He has been made Chairman Emeritus while cousin Niraj Bajaj has been appointed as Chairman. Rajiv Bajaj will continue as the company’s Managing Director.

“This is my last Chairman’s letter to you. Though I shan’t write to you through this forum any further, rest assured that you and your company will forever remain in my heart,” Bajaj added.",495,-0.7125151668276105

Earlier this year, Bajaj had trademarked the names Fluir and Fluor. These two are expected to be two new electric vehicles from the brand.

As for the Freerider name, currently it is very unclear what Bajaj plans to do with it. Husqvarna recently unveiled the e-pilen electric scooter for international markets. Bajaj could use this platform to build the Freerider.

However, since the record is very clear on whether this name has been registered for a vehicle or a vehicle component, there is a good chance that Bajaj Auto is working on their own form of bluetooth connectivity. This new console could also be called Freerider.

Bajaj has run out of new launches for a while now. Sure, there is the upcoming Pulsar 250, but talk on that subject has cooled significantly and we are still waiting for news around. Most of the company’s offerings are beginning to age now and the Dominar was their last real new launch and the Pulsar 250 will be a good generation upgrade for the ageing Pulsar brand.

Bajaj isn’t the only one that is trademarking names, however. Royal Enfield is probably the king in this field with a variety of names trademarked and kept for use at a later date such as Sherpa, Hunter and Roadster. The Meteor, too, was one of the names that was trademarked a long time before the actual bike graced us with its presence.",255,0.9908134937286377

The stock has further upside and could cross Rs 5,000 in the next 6-12 months, Gautam Shah, Founder & Chief Strategist, Goldilocks Premium Research said in a report.

The stock traded in a range for almost five years in the 2015-2020 period. In this phase, the working range was Rs 2,000 on the downside and about Rs 3,400 on the upside.

This ranged behaviour was read as underperformance as other names in the sector did exceedingly well. However, in 2021, the tables turned as the stock could be in a new mega uptrend, said Shah.

Technically, we see multiple breakouts on the charts both in the short and long-term time frames. In April 2021, the stock corrected with the overall market, but the stock found support near the important Rs 3,400 level (See Chart). This reversal has looked solid on many counts.

Shah, based on the technical evidence, suggested that the current trend should take the stock past Rs 4,300 and towards Rs 4800, and the next level of the target is placed at Rs 5,800 in a matter of 6-12 months.

Bajaj Auto has started a vaccination drive for all its employees free of cost across its manufacturing facilities in a phased manner, the company said on Wednesday.

The mass vaccination drive will administer the Covishield vaccine to approximately 20,000 of its employees, off-roll employees, contract workers and their family members, the Pune-based automaker said in a release.

The company has already vaccinated employees and their family members above 45 years of age in the previous phase.

As part of the latest drive, vaccination camps have been started at the company's Akurdi, Chaka and Waluj facilities, where all employees, contract workers and their family members will be eligible for vaccination free of cost, Bajaj Auto said.

The vaccination at the Pantnagar plant in Uttrakhand will commence on June 5, the company said, adding it will gradually inoculate all its employees in a phased manner across the country.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

“With a vaccinated workforce, we will not only be able to significantly reduce the stress on the public health systems but also get back to regular economic activity much faster. We look forward to our employees leaving behind all pandemic-related stress after the completion of this vaccination drive,” CP Tripathi, Advisor, Corporate Social Responsibility at Bajaj Auto Ltd, said.

The company said as a requirement, all employees will need to register on the COWIN app prior to the vaccination drive.

The company's support services team will intimate the vaccination dates to all employees. All protocols will be followed to avoid overcrowding, it added.

This initiative continues Bajaj Auto's stated policy to being committed to the safety and wellbeing of all its employees, the company said.",558,0.8175447781880697

""We build 22.2 percent, 15.5 percent sales, PAT CAGR in FY21P-23E. We value Bajaj Auto at unchanged target price of Rs 4,500 using the SOTP method (core business at 21x FY23E EPS and 2x P/B on KTM investment),"" the brokerage firm said.

Bajaj Auto is stepping up product development to make up for the delay in FY21 and has lined up multiple launches for the year, including motorcycles sporting new platforms.

Within six months, we will be putting out newer platforms and newer variants and this will be a significant thrust in FY22,"" Bajaj Auto executive director Rakesh Sharma said.

Among the segments, the motorcycle-specialist will be targeting the so-called growth category, which has been the 125cc segment. The 125cc has grown significantly in recent months thanks to the Pulsar 125 portfolio. Bajaj’s market share in the 125cc segment increased to 19 percent by end of Q4 FY21 from 7 percent in FY20.

“We are going to be looking at pockets within the 125cc segment,” Sharma added without giving details.

Bikes powered by an engine bigger than 125cc now generate 60 percent of Bajaj’s domestic volume compared to 46 percent in FY20. To keep up the trend of premiumisation, Bajaj has decided to go big on the 250cc segment also.

“We are looking to build the 250cc segment because we believe the quarter litre segment is something that the 150cc segment customer is ready to jump to,” Sharma added.

Bajaj Auto added the 250cc engine in March 2020 to the Dominar family, bringing down the entry price of the model. Priced at Rs 1.7 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the Dominar 250 is one of the most affordable models in the 250cc range in India. Dominar also has a 400cc variant.

“A noteworthy progression, though small in terms of volume, but big implication from future product development point of view, is the performance of Dominar 250 which has made a very confident start,” Sharma added.

Bajaj Auto closed FY21 with a decline of 13 percent in domestic sales to 1.80 million units as against 2.07 million units sold in FY20. The fall was in line with the rest of the industry, which contracted by 13.35 percent during FY21.

With showrooms shut and increasing uncertainty over demand coupled with rising cost pressure of raw material, two-wheeler makers are wary of giving any outlook for the current quarter as COVID-19 threatens to hurt buyer sentiments.

The lockdown announced in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Goa, Tamil Nadu and Kerala has crippled retail sales. As per data shared by an apex dealer association only 8.65 lakh two-wheelers were registered in April, far less than the typical average of 1.2 to 1.3 million units clocked in a month.

Soumen Ray, CFO, Bajaj Auto, said, “While there is no issue with production what is however getting impacted is domestic two and three-wheeler sales. Showrooms in Maharashtra, Delhi, Rajasthan, Karnataka are shut. About 20-25 percent of our outlets are closed. We are living by the day. The scenario will definitely have an impact on the Q1 numbers at least with regards to April. We really do not know how much Q1 will be impacted”.

Market leader Hero MotoCorp has kept its factories shut since the start of May and won’t resume production before May 16. The Delhi-based company which has a retail-level market share of 34 percent, is expecting new COVID-19 cases in the country to peak in the middle of May before subsiding later in the month.

Speaking to analysts Niranjan Gupta, CFO, Hero Motocorp, said: “There are predictions of mid-May being the peak and therefore May-end could see cases subsiding and June could bring business back on stream, that is how we see Q1. Therefore, Q2 is the quarter that we see sanity coming back, and beyond that, the outlook remains positive”.

The Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) which tracks vehicle registration data in the country, has reported 30-35 inventory days for two-wheelers which have remained unchanged for the past 3 months. This is even as retail volumes of two-wheelers have seen a decline indicating a build-up of inventory forcing companies to make a correction on production.

“The first 9 days of May have seen extremely lean sales due to lockdown announced by the majority of states. Even where dealerships are open the walk-ins have dropped to 30 percent and customers are delaying their purchase decision,” FADA said in a statement.

Besides lack of sales two-wheeler companies have to deal with the increasing cost pressure of raw materials. While prices of steel have already hit a high cost of precious metals like rhodium, platinum and palladium have surged by 100 percent to 200 percent.

Hero MotoCorp raised its product prices by 4 percent during FY21 and has indicated further hikes if input prices keep rising unabated. Bajaj Auto undertook a price hike of 2 percent during Q4 FY21 followed by another increase in April by 1.5-2 percent. TVS Motor Company has also hiked prices by 1.6 percent in April.

TVS Motor Company, Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto, who together control 70 percent of India’s two-wheeler market, will add new production lines and launch new models including battery-powered scooters in FY22, although the pandemic may prompt them to recalibrate their capital expenditure

Bajaj Auto is going ahead with its planned new factory near Pune that will churn out KTM, Husqvarna and Triumph branded motorcycles. The total capex lined up by Bajaj Auto of Rs 800 crore for FY22 includes investment set aside for this new facility which is expected to begin production in 2023.

“We expect to spend about Rs 700-800 crore this year. We are opening a new factory at Chakan for which we have signed an MoU with the Maharashtra government and work will soon start. The pandemic has impacted its work a little,” Soumen Ray, CFO, Bajaj Auto, told Moneycontrol.

Chennai-based TVS Motor Company, India’s third largest two-wheeler seller, will spend up to Rs 600 crore in FY22 as capex. Additional outlay of Rs 150 crore is being lined up for the group’s finance company TVS Credit. The maker of Apache and Jupiter, however, cautioned that it will keep a watch on how the on-going June quarter shapes up.

Speaking to analysts K N Radhakrishnan, director and CEO, TVS Motor Company, said “This year the capex will be between Rs 500-600 crore. We will closely monitor the Q1 situation and take a call. But all these investments will be in EV and other emerging technologies and new products. Separate investments in TVS Credit will be around Rs 150 crore”.

TVS plans to expand its sales network of its only electric two-wheeler iQube to 20 cities from two, which will involve a significant rise in production. It is being planned in synchronisation with the planned expansion of its electric vehicle portfolio as well as investment in emerging technologies.

Market leader Hero MotoCorp plans to spend Rs 800-1,000 crore in FY22 as capex, which senior company officials say may be reviewed depending on the partial lockdown impact felt in the June quarter.

Speaking to analysts Niranjan Gupta, CFO, Hero MotoCorp, said, “FY21 we spent Rs 600 crore. FY22 we are not outlining any numbers as of now. As far as Quarter 1 is concerned all of us are going through a very different level of crisis and challenges and we will recalibrate our capex plans.”

FY22 will mark the entry of Hero MotoCorp into the electric two-wheeler space. A product launch has been planned in the January-March quarter of FY22. The Delhi-based maker of popular bike brands like Splendor and HF Delux, is working on its own line of fixed-battery electric models as well as swappable battery models with its Taiwanese partner Gogoro.

In view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation across the country, Hero MotoCorp has decided to extend the shutdown of its manufacturing facilities by another week, till May 16, 2021. Hero MotoCorp observed such shutdowns in a staggered manner for four days between April 22 and May 1 which was later extended till May 9.

“Although the outlook for Q1 FY22 is very difficult to provide we are confident that with the accelerated vaccine programme the market should be back on its feet in Q2 and we should have a good year”, Gupta added.",557,0.9827460646629333

A year after renouncing the position of executive chairman, which he had held for nearly five decades, Rahul Bajaj, one of India’s most animated industrialists, decided to step down as non-executive chairman of Bajaj Auto, effective April 30, 2021.

Bajaj had one of the longest serving chairmen in corporate India, next only to KM Mammen Mappillai, the founder of Chennai-based tyremaking behemoth MRF, who held the reins for 51 years.

Bajaj who turned 83 in June, 2021 and age was the reason for his resignation. In 2020, he stepped down as chairman of Bajaj Finance, the biggest company in Bajaj Group by market capitalisation, and later at Bajaj Finserv.

While his younger son Sanjiv Bajaj took over as Chairman at both the finance companies last year, cousin Niraj Bajaj was appointed Chairman of Bajaj Auto while elder son Rajiv Bajaj will continue as managing director.

Credited with making brand Bajaj a household name through the launch of blockbuster models such as the Chetak and Priya in the 1970s, an identity later cemented by the marketing tagline ‘Hamara Bajaj’, he successfully steered the company through The Emergency, License Raj and Economic Liberalisation that began in the 1990s.

Not just scooters

But geared scooters were not the only roots of the Pune-based company. Through the 1950s and 60s the Bajaj Group sold three-wheeled autorickshaws and mini trucks under license from Germany. Called Bajaj Tempo, this unit was later bought by the Firodia Group in the late 1960s, and the name changed to Force Motors in 2005.

Bajaj launched the Chetak, one of the company’s earliest independent two-wheeler models. Its design and styling was borrowed from the Vespa of Italy. Chetak became a runaway hit among Indian middle-class households, which were looking for an affordable and easy personal vehicle. Such was the demand that the waiting period stretched to 10 years, as there was a production cap in place then.

Rahul Bajaj then steered the company into the motorcycle segment, becoming one of the first to launch a locally made motorcycle in India through a tie-up with Kawasaki of Japan. But though the popularity of motorcycles began to rise steadily through the 1980s and 1990s, he refused to let the scooter fade away without a fight.

Modern and improvised versions of the Chetak, such as the Classic and other new scooters, made their way into Bajaj showrooms with the hope of reviving demand. However, by then the cheap and easy-to-ride motorcycles made by Japanese companies had made dramatic inroads into the Indian market.

Chetak’s Death and resurrection

Chetak, the most iconic of Bajaj’s offerings, saw its last rollout from the Akurdi production line in 2005, the same year Rahul Bajaj gave up the managing director’s position to elder son Rajiv.

Open disagreements between the duo over Chetak’s phase-out made headlines in newspapers but the decision was already made. Motorcycles were to become the mainstay of Bajaj Auto, led by the Pulsar, which was introduced in 2001.

However, the close association of Chetak with Rahul Bajaj was to be resurrected 15 years later. The iconic scooter was resurrected in 2020 when Bajaj Auto launched a fully electric version of the model, marking its entry in the electric vehicle space. That same year Rahul Bajaj stepped down from his position as executive chairman of Bajaj Auto.",565,0.3479427695274353

Two-wheeler and three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto has reported a 1.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in its standalone profit to Rs 1,332.1 crore for the quarter ended March 2021, impacted by lower other income, but supported by healthy revenue growth.

Revenue from operations jumped 26.1 percent to Rs 8,596.1 crore compared to the year-ago with volumes rising 17.9 percent YoY.

Bajaj Auto sold 11,69,664 units during the March quarter compared to 9,91,961 units sold in the same quarter last year.

Net realisation, at Rs 73,473 per unit, has grown 6.9 percent in the quarter ended March 2021 versus Rs 68,711 per unit in the corresponding period the previous year.

Numbers were ahead of analysts' expectations. Profit was estimated at Rs 1,299 crore on revenue of Rs 8,220 crore for the March quarter, according to the average estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

The operating performance was mixed as EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) grew by 21.7 per cent year-on-year to Rs 1,524.1 crore in Q4 FY21, but margin contracted 70 bps YoY to 17.7 percent during the quarter.

Other income fell 46.8 percent in Q4 FY21 to Rs 283.6 crore compared to Rs 532.7 crore in the year-ago.

In FY21, the company reported an 11 percent decline in profit to Rs 4,555 crore and a 7 percent fall in revenue to Rs 27,741 crore compared to the previous fiscal.

Full-year numbers were not comparable as Q1 and FY21 was an absolute washout due to the pandemic, and Q4 and full-year FY20 had Rs 119 crore and Rs 234 crore as dividend income respectively. For FY21, no dividends were received.

Bajaj Auto on April 29 is expected to report muted growth in the March quarter profit due to weak margin performance, but double-digit growth in volumes and rising average realisation may drive revenues.

""We expect revenues to increase by 19 percent YoY led by (1) 18 percent YoY increase in volumes and (2) 1 percent YoY increase in average selling price (ASPs) in Q4FY21,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 1.1 percent YoY increase in profit for the quarter.

Volumes during the quarter increased by 18 percent YoY led by 24 percent YoY increase in export motorcycle volumes and 21 percent YoY increase in domestic motorcycle volumes, offset by 12 percent YoY decline in three-wheeler segment volumes in Q4FY21.

According to Prabhudas Lilladher, the realisations are expected to increase 3 percent YoY (led by higher mix of 125CC segment, higher 3-wheelers share and price hike). Consequently, revenue is expected to grow around 22 percent YoY, and profit growth could be 1.9 percent, the brokerage said.

The operating income is also expected to see double-digit growth but higher raw material prices could hit margin growth.

Within 48 hours of re-opening bookings for its electric scooter Chetak, Bajaj Auto on Thursday put the brakes as it stopped taking bookings due to supply chain uncertainties.

The company had received an overwhelming response after the bookings were opened at 900 hours on April 13, which was also the auspicious day of Gudi Padwa, and customers were able to book Chetak online on a first come first serve basis.

In a statement on Thursday, the company said it has received an overwhelming response to the re-opening of bookings for Chetak in Bangalore and Pune.

""A large number of confirmed orders were placed by customers requiring the company to cease acceptance of bookings within 48 hours. The company will review the supply situation and announce the next round of booking opportunity,"" Bajaj Auto said.

Last year, COVID-led disruptions resulted in an unintended and long waiting period. Despite the disruptions, Bajaj saw very few cancellations of bookings, according to the statement.

""We are absolutely delighted to see the fabulous response to the re-opening of bookings for the Chetak electric scooter in Pune and Bengaluru. We thank our customers in these two cities for their patience and now this overwhelming response,"" Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director of Bajaj Auto Ltd, said.

""We are conscious that customers would like to receive early deliveries of Chetak and start enjoying it as soon as possible. Therefore, we have had to take the difficult decision of closing the bookings in view of continuing supply chain uncertainties,"" he said.

He noted that it is the company's endeavour to resolve the supply chain issues at the earliest, re-open bookings as well as roll into more cities within the next quarter.

Bajaj has widened its commuter portfolio with the launch of the new CT110X priced at Rs 55,494. The CT110X gets a host of changes from the standard CT110 making it all the more rugged.

The Bajaj CT110X stands at the top-end of the CT series of commuter bikes and Bajaj Auto says the new changes have been made keeping in mind the challenging roads and riding conditions.

Design-wise, yes, there are a lot of changes. The headlamp for one is now a round halogen unit complete with a new fairing and two bars that seem like crash protection. It gets a wider tank with tank pads on either side for better knee grip. Crash guards are new and thicker as are the rear grab rails. Additionally, the grab rails also integrate a luggage rack capable of carrying up to a 7 kg load.

To add to this new rugged look of the bike, there are some cosmetic upgrades as well. The front fender is slightly raised from the standard and fork gaiters on the front suspension adds to some kind of off-road pedigree. Speaking of which, the 5-spoke alloys, too, are shod with semi-knobby tyres.

Powering the new CT110X is the same 115cc air-cooled single-cylinder engine that produces 8.6 PS of power at 7,500 rpm and 9.8 Nm of peak torque at 5,000 rpm.

Commenting on the launch, Sarang Kanade, President, Motorcycles – Bajaj Auto said “With the launch of CT110X, we are offering a differentiated product that adds value through superior features, greater riding comfort and durability without compromising mileage. The new CT110X is for those who have always wanted to own a vehicle which not only looks good but is also strongly built and can take on the toughest of riding conditions. We are putting rider-centric innovation at the core of the CT brand and we are confident that our newest offering – the CT110X, will help us further serve our customers better, in this segment.”

The Bajaj CT110X is available for purchase at any of the Bajaj showrooms across the country. While there is no like-for-like comparison to the CT110X, there are a number of motorcycles in the segment. This could be a funky new trend, however, in a vanilla commuter market.",385,0.027987927198410034

Bajaj seems to be testing out a new Pulsar and this time, it’s not just new colours or a new headlamp unit. There are a lot more changes.

It was only recently that we got to see spy shots of a new Bajaj Pulsar being tested out. Of course, there was a lot of camouflage on it, but the wrap still betrayed a lot of the design elements.

First, the bike seems to be designed around an all-new frame from the current Pulsars in the market and now features a monoshock at the rear. The headlamp is a new unit and the tank features sharp panels that extend all the way to the forks. The rear, too, features a more aggressive slant and stepped-up seat for the pillion.

Powering the bike could be a new engine as well and not the same as the Dominar 250. The new engine is likely to be an air and oil-cooled unit but might have mildly lower-rated performance numbers if not the same. The possibility of a slipper clutch can be ruled out, however, since the Pulsar is targeted towards the budget segment and will have to do without those.

There could be other feature updates though. Expect a new instrument cluster complete with connectivity options, LED headlamps and hopefully, dual-channel ABS.

The Pulsar is still some time away, but not too far now. If things go right, the new bike should be out by the time the festival season rolls around. As for pricing, there’s no telling where it could end up. The Pulsar NS 200 is priced at Rs 1.33 lakh while the Dominar 250 retails at Rs 1.68 lakh. Somewhere in the middle should place it right around where most competition has priced their 250cc segment motorcycles.",301,-0.9919169545173645

Pierer Mobility AG and Bajaj Auto are strengthening their strategic cooperation in the development of electric two-wheelers with the first of these products set to hit the market in 2022.

Moneycontrol had first reported of development work of the electric scooters, electric mopeds and electric bicycles by Bajaj Auto and KTM. The two companies are also working on the development of high-end electric motorcycles.

The two entities have been in partnership for the last 15 years building KTM and more recently Husqvarna motorcycles for sale in India and export markets. Both recently joined hands to build battery electric two-wheelers which will be produced from Pune, Maharashtra.

Austria-based Pierer Mobility is the largest manufacturer of street bikes in Europe while Pune-based Bajaj Auto is India’s second-largest two-wheeler maker. In December 2020, Bajaj Auto announced an investment of Rs 650 crore towards setting up a new manufacturing plant in Pune which would also house electric vehicles.

“This renewed strategy will centre on the development of common electric platforms to deliver the advantage of scale, regarding all critical components, allowing both companies to quickly and effectively adapt to evolving customer needs globally,” Bajaj Auto said in a statement.

In 2022, the first fully battery-electric two-wheeler will most likely be a scooter. The two companies are developing a common 48-volt electric two-wheeler platform in the power range of 3 to 10 kW. The development of a fully electric scooter and a motorcycle is in the process.

“Part of this remit involves an open approach to all battery opportunities, aiding the parallel advantage of both fixed and swappable solutions. The initial output from this manufacturing impetus will see the first of these shared platform vehicles beginning of 2022,” Bajaj Auto added.

In early 2020, Bajaj Auto made its entry into this space with the launch of the electric Chetak. The Chetak was also destined to hit the European markets but a shortage of parts supplies impacted those plans.

The two companies have been in an alliance since 2007 and have continuously expanded the boundaries of their partnership. From joint development and production of performance motorcycles for KTM, the alliance now makes products under other brands as well.

The entire production of entry-level Husqvarna motorcycles has been moved to Pune by KTM.",386,0.49961724877357483

Motilal Oswal's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto (BJAUT)'s board has approved a new dividend policy that links dividend payout to the level of cash/cash equivalents, in turn increasing the payout to 90% of PAT (against 50% payout in the old policy). Considering a) strong operating cashflows, b) limited avenues to deploy cash on the books, and c) declining yields on treasure, this is a step in the right direction and could lead to a rerating.

Outlook

Valuations at 18x/17x FY22/FY23E consol. EPS largely captures the strong growth momentum. Maintain Neutral, with TP of INR3,875 (~18x Mar'23 consol EPS).

Bajaj Auto share price was trading lower by over a percent in the morning trade on March 19 as the company announced an amendment to its dividend distribution policy.

According to the amendment, ""subject to the caveats given in the Policy, the Board shall endeavour to arrive at a dividend pay-out as a percentage of profits after tax on the company's standalone financials, taking into account the surplus funds available with the company,"" the company said in an exchange filing.

""Surplus funds"" for this purpose comprises investments in Financial Assets other than in Equity shares of group companies and strategic investments.""

(Photo courtesy: BSE website)

Prior to the amendment, the policy referred to ""dividend payout of around 50 percent of profits after tax on standalone financials, to the extent possible"".

In the new policy, the dividend distribution will be up to 50 percent in case of surplus funds of up to Rs 7,500 crore, up to 70 percent if it is between Rs 7,500 crore and Rs 15,000 crore and up to 90 percent if it is above Rs 15,000 crore.

""The final dividend will be recommended by the Board for approval of the shareholders in a general meeting, while interim dividend, if any, may be declared by the Board. The company currently has only one class of shares, i.e. equity shares,"" it added.

Japanese research firm Nomura has maintained buy call on the stock with target at Rs 4,403 per share. It is of the view that sharp increase in payout ratio is likely to improve return on equity. The return on equity can go up from over 25 percent/25 percent to 28 percent/30 percent in FY22/FY23, which is attractive, it said.

""Amended dividend distribution policy can support re-rating of the stock,"" it added.

JP Morgan has maintained overweight rating on the stock with target at Rs 4,400 per share. The brokerage firm believes that the dividend payout of up to 90 percent is a welcome move and will imply a 4.5 percent+ dividend payout.

The research firm believes that the buziness model warrants a better valuation multiple adding that PLI and export incentives could be additional catalysts.

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Auto

BAL is expected to benefit from growth in the premium bikes segment, which is recovering, aided by premiumization trend and new launches. Moreover, we expect BAL to gain market share in exports, driven by its brand equity and enhanced distribution network. Improvement in operating profit margin (OPM) witnessed in Q2 & Q3 of FY21 is likely to stay, driven by cost and operational efficiency. The stock is trading at P/E multiple of 17.9x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 12.2x its FY2023E estimates and is at below its long-term average multiples. We retain our Buy rating on the stock.



Outlook

We interacted with the management of Bajaj Auto Limited (BAL) to discuss its plans for electric two-wheelers (e-2Ws) and readiness to benefit from increasing e-2W penetration in the medium to long term. The company is well positioned both in terms of capacity and capability to roll out faster e-2Ws, if the adoption of electric vehicles succeeds at a faster rate.

Bajaj Auto on Tuesday said it has launched the new version of its 102 cc bike Platina 100 Electric Start (ES) priced at Rs 53,920 (ex-showroom Delhi).

The bike comes with spring-in-spring suspension that provides more comfort on longer journeys, further strengthening the promise of comfort for both the rider and the pillion.

It also comes equipped with tubeless tyres, assuring a safe and hassle-free ride.

""The brand Platina has an unmatched proposition of comfort with over 7 million satisfied customers as a testament to its segment-leading attributes,” Bajaj Auto Head of Marketing Narayan Sundararaman said in a statement.

The new Platina 100 ES offers yet another compelling proposition at a ground-breaking price that allows the vast majority of kick-start riders to upgrade to the much sought convenience of self-start, he added.",143,0.9999999205271403

Bajaj Auto on Monday reported 6 percent rise in total sales at 3,75,017 units in February, as against 3,54,913 units in the same month last year.

Total domestic sales declined by 2 percent to 1,64,811 units last month, as compared to 1,68,747 units sold in February 2020, Bajaj Auto said in a regulatory filing.

Bajaj Auto’s total two-wheeler sales were up 7 percent to 3,32,563 units, as compared to 3,10,222 units in the year-ago month.

The iconic Bajaj Pulsar is all set to get a major refresh and the test mule has already been spotted testing just outside of Pune.

According to a report in Bikewale, the new Pulsar will sport a new engine and if the spy shots reveal anything, it is that the new Pulsar will be redesigned completely to look bigger and more aggressive.

The images captured are that of a heavily camouflaged bike, but some things can be made out. The headlamp will be completely new and will, in all likelihood, be an LED unit. In fact most of the lighting elements will be powered by LEDs. The tank will be bigger with large side panels extending up to the front fork. The seat will be a split unit but will be a lot more aggressive compared to the current gen Pulsar seeing as how the pillion will most likely sit higher.

The highlight however, will be a new air cooled 250cc powertrain. The current Pulsar ranges from the 150cc to the 220cc engines. The new engine will bring a significant increase in power and torque figures. The Dominar 250 sports a liquid-cooled motor, meaning it won’t be the same engine coming to the Pulsar. A monoshock suspension will also make it to the new bike.

Of course, there isn’t any kind of confirmation on pricing yet, but expect slightly north of the Pulsar 220F’s Rs 1.25 lakh, but maybe lower than the Dominar 250’s 1.67 lakh price tag.",253,0.9997074007987976

After a delay of two years, Bajaj Auto will commercially launch its first electric three-wheeler in the second half of the 2022 financial year (FY), a top company official said.

The Pune-based company, which is the market leader in the passenger three-wheeler segment - also known as auto rickshaw - had earlier planned to launch the vehicle in 2019, followed by the introduction of its first electric two-wheeler.

While the electric Chetak, which was launched in January 2020, ultimately became the first battery-powered vehicle by Bajaj Auto, the introduction of the electric three-wheeler was postponed.

The COVID-19 pandemic became the biggest reason for the delay in the launch of the Bajaj electric three-wheeler as there was widespread shortage of battery cells and the common aversion of commuters to use three-wheelers for fear of contracting the disease.

While the two-wheeler segment has returned to pre-COVID levels, the demand for three-wheelers is getting back on track too with the reopening of schools, offices and other commercial spaces like shops and malls.

Bajaj is thus planning a range of electric three-wheelers for roll-out. In addition, the company is also working on the electric version of the Qute, the quadricycle which Bajaj Auto had launched a few years ago.

Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto said, “We are actively pursuing a broad programme of building three-wheelers and the Qute on our electric platform. The market will see a range of electric three-wheelers making their appearance commercially the next financial year, in the second half”.

As of FY20, Bajaj Auto had a market share of 57 percent of the three-wheeler segment.

The organised electric passenger three-wheeler space is dominated by Mumbai-based Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M). Italian auto brand, Piaggio, also entered the segment nearly two years ago. Lohia Auto, Kinetic Green and Atul Auto are some of the other players from the organised sector. TVS Motor Company, another major competitor in the petrol three-wheeler space, is set to enter the segment with an electric three-wheeler in 2021-22.

“The prototypes are under test. We can address range anxiety and operational profitability for the drivers. The issue is less about launching an electric three-wheeler, which can be very easily done. But we want to study it carefully and capture all the positive developments in terms of cost reductions”, Sharma added.

Due to the large presence of unorganised players who import the electric three-wheeler in parts from China, the exact market size in India of electric three-wheelers is not known.

In FY19, the segment sales of electric three-wheelers at 6.3 lakh overtook even the fossil-fuel powered three-wheeler sales at 5.72 lakh in the same year, as per data shared by the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicle (SMEV).

The boom in demand for electric three-wheelers is due to the low costs of ownership and operation. As per estimates, the running cost of an electric three-wheeler is around Rs 0.5 per km compared to Rs 4-5 for a petrol-powered three-wheeler.

With the ever-increasing price of fossil fuels, three-wheeler owners have favourably switched to battery-powered three-wheelers to save on costs.",520,0.10416923250470843

Motilal Oswal's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto (BJAUT)’s operating performance was driven by favorable mix, lower marketing spends, and operating leverage. It has both near (3W recovery) and long term (premiumization and exports) levers, which are fairly reflected in current valuations. n We upgrade our FY21E/FY22E EPS by 7%/5% to factor in mix, cost savings, and an upgrade in KTM’s PAT. Maintain Neutral.

Outlook

Valuations at 17.9x/16.6x FY22E/FY23E consolidated EPS largely capture the strong growth momentum. Maintain Neutral, with a TP of INR4,000/share.

With factories running at peak capacity and companies struggling to meet demand, it's probably the best time to be an employee with an automotive company. The better-than-expected turnaround in demand has made automotive and auto parts makers to not only roll back salary cuts but also reward employees with increments.

Senior executives and board members of some companies had adopted voluntary pay cuts during the start of FY21 following depressed market conditions brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. Auto sales (across all segments) crashed 75 percent during the April-June quarter to close at the lowest level in many years following a strict lockdown.

But a sharp rebound in sales in the July-September quarter (only 1 percent drop against the same quarter last year) saw companies untie their purse strings to reward employees. While some companies stuck to their annual increment cycle with a Covid-induced delay of about a quarter, others have already started with the second round of pay hikes, effective from the upcoming financial year.

Hyundai

India’s second largest carmaker Hyundai Motor India (HMIL) will start its performance appraisal process from February. Sources say the grading process will start shortly, followed by actual increments from April. “There were no salary cuts at HMIL at any level. In fact, everyone got a raise in August,” said one of the sources cited above.

Hyundai’s sales closed 16 percent down in the April-December period but sales between September to December period grew by 10 percent.

Bajaj Auto

Two-wheeler major Bajaj Auto had to delay staff promotions due to the pandemic and adverse market conditions but followed the process nonetheless. Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto, said: “There was no pay cut on account of Covid. Promotions were delayed but done along with the accompanying increments. The bonus and increment cycle is from April 1st, so we will follow that and decide the quantum at that time.”

The increments at Bajaj Auto come in the wake of a 23 percent decline (domestic sales and exports) in volume during the April-December period to 2.8 million units against the same period last year. However, the October-December quarter saw the Pune-based two- and three-wheeler maker post a 9 percent jump in sales to 1.3 million units.

JK Tyre

In March, Delhi-based tyremaker JK Tyre announced that its senior management had taken a voluntary pay cut in the range of 15-25 percent. Chairman and Managing director Raghupati Singhania, who had taken a pay cut of 25 percent, said JK Tyre has not only reversed all such salary cuts but made an upward revision in pay packages this month.

“The salary cuts were taken up voluntarily. I am grateful to our team JK Tyre members for their consideration to participate during the adversity. The salary cuts were taken back at different levels at different points of time. As of today, all the salaries are restored. We have decided to go ahead with the annual increments effective January 1, 2021,” Singhania said.

Ceat

JK Tyre rival Ceat had to hire additional workers to manage the ramp-up in production to meet supply shortages. Therefore, in addition to increments given to employees during the December quarter, the Mumbai-based company had to incur additional costs in new employee wages.

“On a sequential basis, our standalone employee cost went up by Rs 20 crore (during the December quarter), an increase of about 12 percent. This included higher sales and incentive payouts and provisions. We incurred some performance and related incentives and bonuses,” said Anant Goenka, Ceat’s Managing Director.",595,0.2080952748656273

EBITDA margins expanded 150bp YoY at 19.4% (PLe 18%) helped by better gross margins at 29.2% (PLe 28.5%) due to favorable mix.

Dolat Capital Market's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s Q3FY21 EBITDA was 8% ahead of our expectations on the back of better than expected gross profit and lower other expenses. EBITDA grew 27% YoY to Rs 17.29bn with margin of 19.4% (+152bps YoY) owing to better mix (higher share of Pulsar 125 and ultra-premium segment and strong export volume) and cost control measures. Management appears enthused by market share gains in export and the domestic 125cc segment with ramp-up of Pulsar sales. However, they are cautious on the margin front due to rising input prices. In Q3, the company took a price hike of 1% and further 1.5% in January (mainly in the entry level segment) to offset commodity inflation. Management expects RM cost to increase by 300bps QoQ in 4Q and rise in other expenses due to the increase in advertisement cost.  We maintain our positive stance on Bajaj Auto given 1) improving profitability in its domestic 2W business, 2) diversified revenue stream (45-50% sales comes from export and 3) strong cash reserves. Recovery in high end bike volumes and continued exports growth momentum would drive decent earnings growth (15% over FY21-23E).



Outlook

However, we believe that consensus estimates adequately factor all the near term positives. Current valuations at a P/E of 20/18x on FY22/FY23E leave limited scope for re-rating. We change our rating from Accumulate to Reduce with target price Rs 3,852 (17x FY23E core EPS + cash + KTM stake).

Two of India’s biggest two-wheeler manufacturers, Hero Motocorp and Bajaj Auto, will up their ante this year with two launches planned every quarter by both companies.

Pune-based Bajaj Auto will launch at least two products every three months starting in the ongoing quarter as it looks to push up its domestic market share.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto, said: “We have a nice and active (product) pipeline and within this quarter itself you will see us introducing new products. Almost every quarter there will be1-2 introductions. These will be both new models and upgrades”.

While Sharma declined to provide details on product types lined up for launch, sources said Bajaj Auto will build its focus further on the premium segment where it sells the Pulsar, Avenger, Dominar, KTM and Husqvarna range. Bajaj Auto is also the market leader in the premium segment with a share of 38 percent, as of December end.

In response, Hero MotoCorp, India’s largest manufacturer of two-wheelers, has promised to have 10 launches every year for the next five years. Premium motorcycles and scooters will have an overarching share in Hero’s launches, accounting for about two-thirds of them.

Till date Hero has been criticised for being overdependent on its bread-and-butter, low-power, high-mileage bikes such as the Splendor, Passion and Dawn. The Delhi-based company commands 65 percent of the economy and executive domestic motorcycle segment.

Despite being one of the earliest to enter the premium segment with products such as Karizma and CBZ, Hero failed to attract buyers and build its presence in the premium segment. The company’s share in the 150cc-250cc segment stood at 6 percent at the end of December 2020, as per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.

Even in the scooter segment, Hero failed to stop a rising TVS Motor Company which now occupies the second spot, behind Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India. Hero’s share in the scooter segment stood at 10 percent at the end of December 2020, while TVS’s share was 21 percent and Honda’s was 52 percent.

Other two-wheeler makers are also turning on the heat. Italian premium bike maker Ducati will launch 12 models in 2021 including new models and upgrades. Another Italian brand, Chinese-owned Benelli, intends to launch one new model every month till August.

New Capacity

To support their launch plans for this year and the next few years, both Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto are readying new production capacity.

Bajaj Auto has lined up Rs 650 crore capex to set up a 1-million-unit per annum facility in Chakan, Pune. This new plant, which will produce the KTM, Husqvarna and electric two-wheelers, will take Bajaj’s production capacity to 2.2 million units per annum.

“We are very comfortable as far as capacity is concerned. The issues keep coming in from the vendor side. We have been facing shortages for higher-end bikes and electric. The production capacity of the new Chakan plant is going to be a million units but this is going to be modular,” Sharma added.

Hero MotoCorp had earlier announced its intention of investing Rs 10,000 crore over the next few years, including investments on new manufacturing lines. Its current production capacity stands at 11.6 million units per annum.",550,0.3304433524608612

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

A year after launching its first all-electric scooter, Bajaj Auto is now ready to open bookings for the Chetak in 24 more cities in FY22, after having been forced to initially restrict them to just Pune and Bengaluru.

Bajaj could not open bookings in more cities as planned because of the disruption in supply of the battery cells powering the Chetak. These cells were to be procured by Bajaj Auto’s India vendor from Wuhan, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Bookings for the Bajaj Chetak are still closed.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto, said: “We have not yet reached the stage to add more cities at the moment, which is a bit disappointing because we have been hit by supply chain issues. First it was electronic components from Wuhan and then there was the COVID-led impact. Then post-COVID there was a surge in semiconductors, which again caused interruptions. Because of this vulnerability in the supply chain we have been very cautious about reopening bookings for the Chetak.”

The Chakan factory near Pune restarted producing the electric Chetak from June onwards after output came to a complete halt around February. Production was again hit in December perhaps due to the global shortage in availability of semiconductors, a crucial component required for the software programmes controlling an electric vehicle.

Good response

“We got a very good response. We have 50,000 registrations right now, which is basically an expression of interest from buyers who are waiting for the bookings to reopen. We certainly want to reopen bookings of the Chetak and be faced with good demand,” Sharma added.

China controls nearly three-fourths of the world’s lithium-cell manufacturing capacity, according to a BloombergNEF report. This is even as a handful of automotive companies have started work on installing battery-cell manufacturing plants in India. Even as battery packs are developed within the country the cells still have to be imported.

“We are hoping that these issues will get ironed out over the next 2-3 months and we will get back to our agenda of not just servicing bookings in Pune and Bengaluru but we have a master plan of going to two dozen cities in India in the next financial year”, Sharma added.

Deliveries of the Chetak, with six colours and two variants, commenced from February-end and again after the lifting of the lockdown.

Bajaj Auto's share price added over 2 percent in the early trade on January 22, a day after the two-wheeler manufacturer clocked its highest-ever standalone profit of Rs 1,556.3 crore in the December quarter, rising 23.4 percent compared to the year-ago period, driven by volume growth and operating performance.

Its revenue increased by 16.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 8,910 crore, which was also the highest for a quarter. Volumes grew by 9 percent YoY, driven by a 26 percent growth in motorcycle exports and an 8 percent increase in domestic volumes but the three-wheeler segment declined 36 percent year-on-year.

LKP Research

Bajaj came out with a strong set of numbers in Q3, thanks to its strength in the exports markets and domestic two-wheeler (2W) recovery. The company reported its strongest ever volumes, revenues and PAT in the quarter. As the economy opens up, things will improve further.

With intrinsic demand getting back almost to the pre-COVID level production/ supply constraints have reduced. 2W demand in the domestic markets is expected to continue its uptrend, with strong rural demand driven by good monsoons and pent-up demand.

With exports improvement expected to continue and high margin models to sell well in domestic markets, margins are expected to improve. We maintain our ""buy"" rating on the stock with an improved target price of Rs 4,142 (at 20x FY 23E earnings).

Prabhudas Lilladher

Bajaj Auto's 3QFY21 revenues were in-line while there was ~ 6.6%/6% beat at EBITDA/adj. PAT. This was led by continued tight cost control. EBITDA margins expanded 150bp YoY at 19.4 percent (PLe 18 percent) helped by better gross margins at 29.2 percent (PLe 28.5 percent) due to favourable mix. While the near-term outlook looks positive given 1) healthy exports momentum both for 2W and 3W and 2) likely beneficiary of RoDTEP scheme, the same is reflected in valuations.

We raise FY22/23 EPS by 4 percent/8.6 percent to factor in for a sharp increase in KTM profits and better export outlook. We retain hold with revised target price of Rs 3,489 (v/s Rs 3,215, 17x Mar-23 EPS). BJAUT trades at 20x/18x FY22/23 EPS (v/s 18x 5yr LPA).

Dolat Capital

We maintain our positive stance on Bajaj Auto because of improving profitability in its domestic 2W business, diversified revenue stream (45-50 percent sales come from exports and strong cash reserves.

Recovery in high-end bike volumes and continued export growth momentum would drive decent earnings growth (15 percent over FY21-23E). However, we believe that consensus estimates adequately factors in all the near-term positives. Current valuations at a P/E of 20/18x on FY22/FY23E leave limited scope for re-rating. We change our rating from ""accumulate"" to ""reduce"" with a target price of Rs 3,852 (17x FY23E core EPS + cash + KTM stake).

East India Securities

We maintain ""accumulate"" rating with a target price of Rs 4,094 (17x FY23e EPS of Rs 227 + the value of KTM at Rs 244/share). Increasing multiple from 16x to 17x and rollover from Sept ’22 to FY23e led to the increase in the target price.

1) Faster rebound in exports, 2) Bajaj’s dominant position in the premium, 3) success of the 125cc, 4) demand from students’ community to emerge, and 5) refreshers/upgrades should sustain demand momentum in the coming quarters, justifying premium multiple.

Bajaj Auto, one of India’s largest two-wheeler makers, may have to increase prices of its motorcycles if raw material prices continue to head north as they have in the past few weeks.

The Pune-based manufacturer of Pulsar and KTM range of bikes has seen costs rise by 2-4 percent since November led by a jump in the price of raw materials like steel and precious metals. This has forced the company to increase prices of its products in the range of 1-3 percent.

Speaking to Moneycontrol Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto said: “We have taken price increases in November and then in January. This has, however, not fully recovered the cost increase we have suffered. We are very conscious that demand is recovering and we have to balance demand and profitability. We are watching the competition as well.""

Bajaj Auto, which announced its December quarter revenue today, clocked an increase of 8 percent in domestic two-wheeler sales to 5.85 lakh; however, sales of commercial vehicles dropped 65 percent to 34,230 units.

“We can expect to see at least for the next three months some headwinds cost increases led by raw material cost increases. We don’t like to digest the cost increases we would like to pass it on. But the only concession we allow ourselves is to calibrate the passing-on of the cost increases particularly because the business environment is a wee bit fragile,” Sharma said.

Tyremaker Ceat raised prices by around 3 percent in December and another 3 percent increase is expected in this quarter. The price was raised across categories, except the two-wheeler segment where the company carries a premium over rival brands. However, Ceat is not ruling out a price increase in two-wheeler tyres as well during the current quarter.

Domestic two-wheeler demand has been positive since the past few months till December. Volumes of the January-March quarter of this year compared with the same quarter of last year will have a low base effect.

Two-wheeler manufacturers had to reduce supplies to their dealers during the fourth quarter of last year as they had to switch to Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) emission norm from BS-IV from April 1, 2020. The dealers were asked to get rid of BS-IV stock before the BS-VI arrived.

“Demand is now running almost equal to last year. The numbers will look really very good because of the base effect. Companies were running down stock in the Q4 of last year. We are in low single-digit growth in Q4 if we were to look at the Q4s of last few years and discount the Q4 of last year from it,"" Sharma added.",450,0.6531000733375549

Bajaj Auto, the two-wheeler manufacturer, clocked its highest ever standalone profit at Rs 1,556.3 crore in December 2020, rising 23.4 percent compared to the year-ago period, driven by volume growth and operating performance.

Its revenue increased by 16.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 8,910 crore, which was also the highest for a quarter.

Volumes grew by 9 percent YoY, driven by a 26 percent growth in motorcycle exports and 8 percent increase in domestic volumes but the three-wheeler segment declined 36 percent year-on-year.

The company's share of the domestic motorcycle market was 18.6 percent, up from 17.5 percent in the previous quarter and 18.5 percent in FY20.

Domestic commercial vehicle business remained affected due to inadequate demand for short-distance mobility, the company said.

At operating level, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 26.5 percent to Rs 1,730 crore and margin rose 150 bps to 19.4 percent in Q3FY21, YoY, driven by higher operating leverage and better product mix.

Numbers were ahead of analysts' estimates. Profit was estimated at Rs 1,348 crore on revenue of Rs 8,872 crore and EBITDA was expected at Rs 1,527 crore with the margin at 17.1 percent for the quarter ended December 2020, as per a CNBC-TV18 poll.

As of December 2020, the company said it had surplus cash and cash equivalents at Rs 16,891 crore as against Rs 16,240 crore at the end of September 2020.

Bajaj Auto in December 2020 signed a memorandum of understanding with the Maharashtra government to set up a new unit at Chakan for manufacturing of high-end motorcycles and electric vehicles at a proposed investment of Rs 650 crore. The facility is expected to commence production in 2023, said the company.

Two & three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto is likely to register more than 16 percent year-on-year growth in standalone profit, revenue and operating profit for the quarter ended December 2020 led by festive demand.

Profit is expected to be supported by revenue and operating performance, while higher volumes and average selling price (ASPs) could boost topline during the quarter.

Volumes increased by 9 percent YoY in Q3 FY21 led by 26 percent YoY increase in export motorcycle volumes and 8 percent YoY increase in domestic motorcycle volumes, which were offset by 36 percent YoY decline in three-wheeler segment volumes.

""We expect revenues to increase by 19 percent YoY led by 9 percent YoY increase in volumes and 10 percent YoY increase in ASPs in Q3 FY21,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 18.6 percent YoY growth in profit.

According to Narnolia, Bajaj Auto is expected to record revenue growth of 16 percent YoY led by 16 percent volume growth in the 2-wheeler segment on the back of strong festive demand seen in the quarter. Realisation is also expected to improve by 8 percent YoY on the back of improved product mix.

At the operating level, operating profit margin is likely to get impacted by higher raw material cost, though supported by cost reduction and better 2-wheeler mix.

""We expect EBITDA to increase by 18 percent YoY led by 19 percent YoY increase in revenues and cost-reduction efforts, partly offset by raw material cost pressure and negative impact of the withdrawal of the export incentive scheme in Q3 FY21,"" said Kotak which sees margin falling 4 bps.

Emkay Global also said, ""Despite the better scale, benign currency and cost reduction efforts, EBITDA margin is likely to contract on the adverse mix and higher input costs. Mix has turned adverse due to lower share of 3-wheeler.""",319,0.7499817311763763

Bajaj Auto, the country’s third-largest two-wheeler manufacturer, has announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Maharashtra government for setting up a factory that will make the Chetak and KTM, Husqvarna and Triumph motorcycles.

The proposed investment for this new facility, which will come up next to Bajaj’s existing facility at Chakan near Pune, will be Rs 650 crore. The unit is expected to commence production in 2023.

The announcement by Bajaj Auto comes at a time when its rivals like Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India and Suzuki Motorcycle have adopted a ‘go-slow’ approach as far as new investments are concerned. Market leader Hero MotoCorp, however, had announced a Rs 10,000 crore investment over 5-7 years towards new products and manufacturing facilities.

“Under the arrangement, the Government of Maharashtra will facilitate Bajaj Auto in obtaining necessary permissions/ registrations/ approvals/ clearances/ fiscal incentives etc. from the concerned departments of the state, as per the existing policies/ rules and regulations,” said Bajaj Auto in a statement.

The existing Chakan facility produces the same brand of two-wheelers except the proposed motorcycles under the Triumph brand. Bajaj Auto and Triumph Motorcycles are working together on a range of mid-capacity bikes the first of which will debut in 2022.

The Indo-British collaboration will explore the 200-750cc bike category to offer multiple product options across different segments. The starting price range of these bikes could be below Rs 2 lakh.

KTM partnership

Bajaj Auto holds around 48 percent stake in Austrian bike making company KTM. The 13-year-old partnership has made the Austrian company the world's biggest premium bike manufacturer, beating US heavyweight Harley-Davidson (in volumes) in 2018 and 2019.

From worldwide volumes of 280,099 units clocked in 2019, KTM is expecting to sell around 400,000 two-wheelers in 2022. This will include nearly doubling of production at Bajaj Auto’s Chakan plant to 200,000 units, from around 108,000 units at present. This will include a mix of joint products (of KTM and Husqvarna bands) and KTM products distributed by Bajaj on a licence fee model.

The two companies have also started work on electric two-wheelers. The first of such e-bikes having power range between 3 and 10 kW (48 volts) will roll off the Chakan production line. The platform will support various product variants under the brand of both the partners.

KTM is developing a 4kW electric scooter under the Husqvarna brand whose market launch is expected to take place in 2021. This will be followed by the launch of Husqvarna E-Pilen, a 4kW/10kW, fully electric motorcycle with a modular battery system. The Husqvarna E-Pilen is expected to be launch-ready in 2022.",450,

Bulls have extended the rally and a new all-time high was witnessed in benchmark indices in the past trading week. The gain of approximately 250 points on a week-on-week basis has placed the Nifty above the 13,750-mark.

Though the strength is still intact, but the bell of caution can be heard as momentum indicators are trading in a highly overbought zone and prices are trading far above short-term moving averages. The overbought indicators do not indicate the weakness but the pause in an ongoing trend. The indicators might remain in the overbought zone for the extended period and the price could still go higher and this rally can extend up to the 13,950 level (61.8 percent projected retracement level of previous month's trading range).

The caution at a higher level is required as mild correction in order to maintain demand/supply adjustment might not be ruled out from the afore mentioned levels. The short-term support is emerging at 13,570 and 13,411 and any fall till these levels would offer buying opportunities to traders. Considering the derivatives data and moderate India VIX (volatility index) levels, the major fall is not expected in the short term and stock-specific opportunities would keep the traders in high spirits.

We have identified three trading ideas that could provide up to 15 percent return in the short term.

Bajaj Auto: Buy | CMP: Rs 3,347.55 | Target: Rs 3,600 | Stop Loss: Rs 3,220 | Return: 8 percent

After a recent upmove, the stock has retraced mildly from the higher levels keeping its higher top and higher bottom cycle intact. The ongoing consolidation has taken the shape of a bullish flag pattern and the bullish candle formed on Friday's trading session suggests that a probable breakout could take place. The fresh leg of buying might not be ruled out in coming trading sessions.

The mild correction has been arrested at the short-term moving averages ribbon and RSI is bouncing back from a significant support level. The rising average directional index (ADX) indicating the strength of an ongoing bullish trend. Traders can initiate buying at the current market price (CMP) and on any dip till Rs 3,310 with the short term perspective.

Bajaj Consumer Care: Buy | CMP: Rs 215.10 | Target: Rs 245 | Stop Loss: Rs 200 | Return: 14 percent

The prolonged downtrend of the stock seems to be coming to an end. The prices have started trading above a 50-week exponential moving average and the bullish crossover of short-term and medium term moving averages ribbon in the weekly time frame suggesting that trend reversal buying is expected in the counter in the near term. The RSI has started trading in a bullish zone for the first time since February 2018.

In the daily time frame, the stock is trading above all major short term and medium term moving averages and the falling trend line resistance has been breached on an upside. Traders can initiate buying positions at CMP and on any dip till Rs 208.

Birlasoft: Buy | CMP: Rs 207.15 | Target: Rs 238 | Stop Loss: Rs 196 | Return: 15 percent

The stock looks poised for a fresh breakout. After a recent rally, the counter went sideways for almost 2 months and formed a rounding pattern where the consolidation of prices near its 20-day moving average has laid the foundation for a fresh up move. The short-term moving averages have developed a positive curve and momentum indicators have started trading in the bullish zone. Traders can initiate buying at CMP and add more once the stock starts trading above the Rs 211 level.

The Platina 100 Kick Start gets a host of new features for the new model including some aesthetic upgrades as well.

Design-wise, the new Platina Kick Start remains similar to the electric start save for a few additional features. The bike gets the same headlamp unit that includes a strip of LED DRLs sitting atop the main headlamp, a protective tank pad, new indicators and mirrors as well as wide rubber footpegs for better comfort. The Kick start however, also gets a new set of hand guards that look fairly fine on the little commuter.

Additionally, the Platina Kick Start also gets the new spring-on-spring Nitrox suspension. The company says this adds 15 percent more comfort on long rides. It also gets a quilted seat and tubeless tyres for more convenience.

Powering the Platina 100 Kick Start is the same 102cc single cylinder engine. This produces 7.9 PS of power at 7,500 rpm and 8.3 Nm of torque at 5,500 rpm. All of this is transmitted via a 4-speed gearbox.

Commenting on the launch Mr Narayan Sundararaman, Head of Marketing, Bajaj Auto Ltd said, “The Brand Platina has made a notable presence with its unmatched proposition of Comfort making it one of the best motorcycles in the commuter segment.

Bajaj Auto confirmed on December 1 to have received the proposal to move its stake in KTM AG to Pierer Mobility AG (PMAG), the parent company of KTM AG, before eventually getting a stake in a new holding company.

The Pune-based company holds 48 percent stake in KTM AG and about 51.7 percent is held by PMAG. PMAG is listed in Vienna, Zurich and Frankfurt exchanges. After the transaction, the stake of PMAG in KTM AG will increase to approximately 99.7 percent, a statement from PMAG said.

PMAG also holds 100 percent in Pexco, the maker of conventional and electric bicycles, apart from stakes in a few companies. Pierer Industrie (a Pierer Company) holds over 60 percent in PMAG, with the balance being free float.

“The proposal envisages Bajaj swapping its 48 percent stake in KTM AG for a stake in PMAG and both Pierer Industrie and Bajaj moving their stakes in PMAG, to a new Holdco between them”, Bajaj Auto said in a statement sent to the stock exchanges.

Bajaj Auto holds a stake in KTM AG through its 100 percent Netherlands-based subsidiary Bajaj Auto International Holdings BV.

PTW Holding AG is the newly formed holding company formed by KTM. Pierer Industrie will transfer its 60 percent stake in PMAG to PTW Holding AG and both Bajaj Auto and Pierer Industrie will get stakes in PTW Holding AG, as per the proposal.

“The discussions are currently at a very preliminary stage and this disclosure is being made only by way of abundant caution. Bajaj will evaluate and decide on the proposal in due course, following due corporate processes such a deal entails”, Bajaj Auto added.",286,

Bajaj Auto and partner KTM have restarted talks on transferring the 48 percent stake held by the Indian company in the Austrian bike maker back to its holding entity.

Bajaj Auto’s 48 percent equity, along with the 51.7 percent stake held by Pierer Mobility AG, make up the shareholding of KTM AG, the legal entity that is responsible for making products under its own brand, Husqvarna and GasGas brands.

KTM Group and Bajaj Auto are holding discussions to transfer the 48 percent stake of Bajaj Auto in KTM AG to the listed company Pierer Mobility AG. The discussions are being held between Bajaj Auto International Holding BV, the Netherlands-based subsidiary, and Pierer Industrie AG, the parent company of Pierer Mobility AG.

Although finer details of the proposed realignment of the partnership has not been shared by either companies, sources say that this would kick-start a new chapter in the 13-year-old partnership that has so far seen joint design and development of products, common use of manufacturing facility, overseas distribution pact and joint marketing and sales.

The two companies had held the same discussions in March 2019, with the transaction decision targeted to be made in the second quarter of the same year. But less than three months later, both companies aborted the plan for unspecified reasons.

“Pierer Mobility AG was informed by Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj that they have restarted discussions on assessing the possibility of transferring Bajaj's 48 percent stake in KTM AG to Pierer Mobility AG, with the Pierer Group continuing to retain the controlling majority over Pierer Mobility AG”, a statement from Pierer Mobility AG said.

What is different this time is the proposal to make PTW Holding AG, a newly formed entity by KTM, the 60-percent stake holder in Pierer Mobility AG. This translates to transferring the said 60 percent stake from Pierer Industrie AG to PTW Holding.

“Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj will now evaluate the proposal in detail,” the statement further added.

The authorised capital enables a capital increase of up to 50 percent of the existing share capital. After the transaction, the stake of Pierer Mobility AG in KTM AG will increase from the current 51.7 percent to approximately 99.7 percent, the statement added.

KTM increases 2020 forecast

The announcement of restarting discussions of stake transfer comes less than two months after the Austrian bike maker increased the forecast for the second half of 2020, following sustained high demand for all brands including e-bikes.

The management board of Pierer Mobility AG decided to increase the sales forecast published at the end of August 2020 for the second half of 2020 to over € 850 million (previously € 800 million). Around 64 percent of KTM’s revenues come from Europe, followed by North America, and Mexico with 17 percent.

Riding on Bajaj

The partnership with Bajaj Auto made the Austrian company the world's biggest premium bike manufacturer, beating US heavyweight Harley-Davidson (in volumes) in 2018 and 2019.

Of the 90,331 motorcycles sold in the first half of 2020, 22 percent was manufactured and sold by Bajaj Auto in India and Indonesia. In return, Bajaj has benefited from technology sharing and becoming the sole manufacturer of KTM and Husqvarna bikes outside of Europe, with exports reaching the US, Japan and South Asia.

From worldwide volumes of 280,099 units clocked in 2019, KTM is expecting to sell around 400,000 two-wheelers in 2022. This will include nearly doubling of production at Bajaj Auto’s Chakan, Pune-based plant to 200,000 units, from around 108,000 units at present. This will include a mix of joint products (of KTM and Husqvarna bands) and KTM products distributed by Bajaj on a licence fee model.

The two companies have also started work on electric two-wheelers. The first of such e-bikes having power range between 3 and 10 kW (48 volts) will roll off the Chakan production line. The platform will support various product variants under the brand of both the partners.

KTM is developing a 4kW electric scooter under the Husqvarna brand whose market launch is expected to take place in 2021. This will be followed by the launch of Husqvarna E-Pilen, a 4kW/10kW, fully electric motorcycle with modular battery system. The Husqvarna E-Pilen is expected to be launch-ready in 2022.",718,0.7363612453142802

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto (BAL) reported a steady Q2FY21 performance. Net revenue was at Rs 7,156 crore (down 7.2% YoY) with blended ASPs at Rs 67,935/unit (down 2.2% QoQ). Lower share of 3-W in total volumes (~8% in Q2FY21 vs. ~16% YoY) impacted ASPs. Volumes for the quarter were at 10.5 lakh units (down 10.2% YoY) units wherein 2-W volumes were at 9.6 lakh units (down 2% YoY), 3-W volumes were 88,872 units (down 53% YoY). Reported EBITDA margins came in at 17.7%, up 110 bps YoY, primarily due to lower other expenses (fell 190 bps YoY on percentage of sales basis). BAL undertook impact of MEIS export incentive withdrawal amounting to Rs 78 crore for H1FY21, in Q2FY21, without which EBITDA margins could have been 18.5%+. PAT in Q2FY21 was down 18.8% YoY to Rs 1,138 crore tracking lower other income & high effective tax rate in base quarter (Q2FY20).

Outlook

For BAL, we build 2.8%, 7.4%, 5.6% volume, sales, PAT CAGR in FY20-23E. Margins are seen improving to 18.4% by FY23E tracking improvement in operating leverage, cost actions. We value BAL at a revised target price of Rs 3,570 using SOTP method (core business at 18x FY22E & FY23E average EPS and 2x P/B on KTM investment) and upgrade the stock to BUY. In our view the stock offers adequate valuation comfort at CMP considering expected all-round uptick in coming times.

East India Securitie's report on Bajaj Auto

Q2FY21 performance was reasonably good with a sharp recovery witnessed in domestic 2Ws and exports almost back on its feet. With the increase in inquiry levels in cities during festival season, Bajaj’s premium portfolio sales should shoot up. In exports, major markets like Africa, LatAm & the Middle East witnessed a swift recovery. 2Ws exports reached at 90% levels and 3Ws at 75-80%. With stability in currencies, oil prices and political situation in international markets, the sales could be back to 100% of the normal level by Jan 2021. The worrying signals are only in domestic 3Ws, which is moving up at a snail’s pace. Margin should sustain at 16.4% level as a rise in commodity prices should get offset by better product/geographic mix and baby step increase in model prices should help offset some of the impact.

Outlook

Accumulate. We maintain ‘Accumulate’ rating with a target price of 3,300 (16x Sept ’22 EPS of Rs 196 plus the value of KTM at Rs 165/share).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

BJAUT’s 2QFY21 revenues/EBITDA were in-line while adj. PAT slightly missed estimates at Rs11.4bn (PLe Rs12bn), led by lower other income. EBITDA margins expanded 110bp YoY at 17.7% (in-line) led by cost optimization initiatives. For 2HFY21, sustainability of these margins is unlikely due to a) sharp increase in key RM prices (by 10-15%) and b) we expect marketing spend to be back as BJAUT has lost ~130bp retail level market share to 11.3% in 2QFY21 (despite several product interventions). We believe 2W recovery both in domestic and exports markets have been better (to an extent 90-95%), BJAUT’s 3W portfolio to remain under pressure (~25-30% recovery in domestic 3W led by cargo).

Outlook

We upgrade FY21/22/23 EPS by 5%/1%/3% to factor in for cost efficiencies and maintain ‘Hold’ on the stock with revised price target of Rs3,108 (earlier Rs3,014) at 17x (in-line with 10 year LPA Sep’22 EPS, unchanged). BJAUT trades at 16.6x/15.9x FY22/23 EPS.

Bajaj Auto, the two-and-three-wheeler maker, is expected to see around 10 percent YoY fall in bottomline and around 5 percent in revenue for the quarter-ended September 2020 due to decline in sales volumes and higher tax cost, but the sequential growth across parameters may be seen strong due to low base in June quarter amid lockdown.

Profit as well as revenue on sequential basis may grow more than 130 percent each in Q2.

The company sold 10.53 lakh units in the September quarter, down 10.2 percent compared to 11.74 lakh units sold in same period last year, but up 137.7 percent QoQ.

The volume decline YoY was due to 53 percent YoY fall in the three-wheeler segment and 11 percent YoY decline in export 2-wheeler volumes, but that was offset by 6 percent YoY growth in the domestic motorcycle segment volumes in Q2FY21.

""We expect revenues to decline by 5 percent YoY led by 10 percent YoY decline in volumes and 6 percent YoY increase in ASPs in Q2FY21,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities.

""The volume mix has been unfavourable with lower share of premium motorcycles and 3-wheeler resulting in decline in realisation by 1 percent QoQ (up 5 percent YoY),"" said Prabhudas Lilladher.

The bike gets 43 mm upside down forks up front and a rear monoshock to handle suspension duties. Braking is handled by discs at both ends with dual-channel ABS as standard. It even gets the LED headlamp unit that its bigger sibling gets.

Bajaj Auto, TVS increase prices over the last couple of months. Maruti Suzuki reduces discounts in July, compared to the June quarter. The automotive industry had recorded zero sales in April after the nationwide lockdown announced in March.

Two of India’s biggest two-wheeler companies Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company , which control nearly 30 percent of the country’s motorcycle and scooter market, have raised prices over the last couple of months.

Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest carmaker, has already reduced discounts in July, compared to the June quarter.

Retail demand for two-wheelers, cars and SUVs has come back strongly so far in July, with many manufacturers claiming that sales have nearly reached pre-COVID-19 levels. The automotive industry recorded zero sales in April following the nationwide lockdown announced in March.

A price increase during what is assumed to be ‘stressed market conditions’ is the last resort for any company as there is always the risk of demand falling.

Talking to analysts, K N Radhakrishnan, director and chief executive officer, TVS Motor Company, said on Wednesday: “Retail demand has been much higher than whatever we were able to produce and supply to the market. The inventory is much lower than the usual 35 days’ stock. We increased prices in Q1 by 0.7 percent and by 0.4 percent in Q2.”

TVS, India’s fourth-largest two-wheeler manufacturer, is yet to see full-fledged operations from its dealers. In July, only 85 percent dealerships were open. This went down to 75 percent in recent days, following lockdown measures by local administrations.

“In those areas where dealerships are open, demand is almost similar to last year’s,” added Radhakrishnan.

Bajaj Auto, India’s third-largest two-wheeler player, increased prices in July. The company hopes this would improve gross margins on motorcycles going forward, considering that no substantial raw material cost increase is predicted.

Soumen Ray, chief financial officer and president – finance, Bajaj Auto, said in a recent conference call: “There has been multiple rounds (of price hike) in various parts of the portfolio in various rounds. The last one we undertook was on July 7, which was only for 3 or 4 models”.

Bajaj Auto claimed that the first 10 days of July 2020 saw demand reaching 90-95 percent levels of July 2019. It subsequently came down to 80-85 percent, like TVS, after further lockdowns were announced at local levels.

Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest carmaker, has already reduced discounts in July compared to the June quarter. Senior company officials said that during the April-June quarter, the company doled out an average discount of Rs 25,000 per vehicle at the wholesale level, but at the retail level, the discounts were below Rs 20,000 per vehicle.

The current trend of discounting by Maruti Suzuki is much lower than the record average discounts of Rs 33,000 per vehicle, the highest in its 37-year history, doled out during the December quarter.

Demand for Maruti Suzuki cars climbed to 90 percent of pre-COVID-19 levels in July, forcing the company to ask its parent company Suzuki Motor Corporation to start an additional shift that will push up production by 22 percent.

“July discounts are lower than Q1 and it is expected to stay like this”, said Shashank Srivastava, director (sales and marketing), Maruti Suzuki, in an analyst call.",552,-0.19321048259735107

As battery costs remain high and India continues to depend on China for battery cells, Bajaj Auto has decided to go slow on its electric vehicle plans for the time being.

Bajaj Auto became India’s first large two-wheeler maker to enter the electric vehicle space with the launch of the battery-powered Chetak, which was introduced in the last quarter of FY20.

The launch, however, has been restricted to only two cities (Pune and Bengaluru) so far, while the company is working to honour delivery commitments for bookings made by customers a few months ago.

“While we believe that there is a strong case for electric vehicles (for the Indian market) it is mainly at the product level because obviously EVs are very convenient and environmentally friendly. But at this stage their commercial proposition is very weak. The high battery costs limit the development of the category,” said Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto, at the 13th Bajaj Auto annual general meeting.

In addition to the two-wheelers, Bajaj Auto, the market leader in three-wheelers, is also working on electric solutions for the three-wheeler segment and also for quadricycles. In fact, its electric three-wheeler was scheduled to enter the market in 2017 itself, years before the earlier target of 2020.

Prices still high

Though global battery prices have fallen by 85 percent since 2010, from more than $1,000 per kWh to $150 per kWh in 2020, according to a research report released by Avendus Capital, they remain discouragingly high for mass adoption.

“It is quite probable that cost will reduce through technical innovation, and the category, in due course, will be widely prevalent. But the timing of this occurring is highly uncertain and hence our approach is to undertake a limited development of the electric portfolio both in 2-wheelers and subsequently in 3-wheelers so that we build our capabilities and move up the learning curve and be prepared for the future”, added Sharma.

China dominates battery supply

The Avendus Capital report has predicted a further fall of 27 percent in the prices of batteries to $110 wKh by 2025. China controls nearly three-fourths of the global lithium cell manufacturing capacity, according a BloombergNEF report.

Further, given the uneasy geopolitical situation between India and China, unhindered supplies of battery cells from China are not guaranteed. This is even as a handful of automotive companies have started work on installing battery cell manufacturing plants in India.

India had instituted heightened scrutiny on shipments originating from China, Hong Kong and Macao at sea ports leading to severe congestion and delays of multiple days. Bajaj's Chetak also depends on components from Wuhan in China and is expected to face delays getting them.

Bajaj’s rival TVS Motor Company, which launched a Chetak rival in the last quarter of FY20, has also lined up an electric three-wheeler model. Italian automaker Piaggio recently launched its first all-electric three-wheeler to compete against Mahindra & Mahindra which has been selling electric three-wheelers since nearly one year.",505,-0.6742153934070042

For most two-wheeler manufacturers, motorcycle sales have recovered 80-85 percent of pre-lockdown levels, the report added.

Demand for cheaper motorcycles has risen, possibly because people are becoming averse to public transport during the COVID-19 outbreak.

""We are seeing a new set of buyers emerge. All those who never owned a motorcycle are coming into the market as they do not want to use public transport,"" the dealer told Business Standard.

Bajaj Auto recorded domestic two-wheeler sales of 146,695 units in June, as against 39,286 in May.

Note: Replugging this column after Rahul Bajaj resigned as the chairman of Bajaj Auto on April 29, 2021.

For a man who is believed to have said “Only fools retire”, Rahul Bajaj’s stepping down as chairman of Bajaj Finance may seem a bit odd. Still sprightly at 82 and sharp as ever, will the man who turned his fledgling family business into Humara Bajaj, be content with a seat at the family dining table?

The release from the company was carefully worded: “Rahul Bajaj, non-executive chairman of the company, having been at the helm since its inception in 1987 and the group for over five decades, as part of succession planning, has decided to demit the office”.

The reference to succession planning holds the key not just to this decision but also the man’s singular achievement that goes beyond just the numbers.

Indeed, Rahul Bajaj’s single biggest accomplishment might have been the smooth transfer of his power to his sons and then in turn the bifurcation of business interests between the two of them.

No stranger to simmering discontent between siblings which in the past led to a bitter parting with his own brother, last year, he engineered a family settlement with his cousins, Shekhar, Madhur and Niraj, that laid down the terms of joint ownership of group companies along with a formal process to handle any future conflicts.

Plan this way

What’s more, he has also made sure that his sons are free from any such tensions.

With that the senior Bajaj has laid out a perfect template for Indian business families on how they can enhance value from one generation to another.

Defying the unwritten rules of Indian business families, it is the fourth generation of the Bajaj family, led by Rajiv and Sanjiv, which has grown the empire the most and created enormous shareholder wealth in the bargain.

Today, three Bajaj group firms, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv and Bajaj Auto rank among the 35 most valuable companies in the country.

It was in 1968 that Rahul Bajaj took over the small family business of scooters, cement and electrical appliances from his father Kamalnayan Bajaj who in turn had inherited it from his father Jamnalal Bajaj whose contribution to India’s freedom struggle far exceeds that to Indian business.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, Rahul Bajaj turned the company into a household name stretching the business to the limits permitted by the asphyxiating license-permit raj of the era.

When liberalisation came, the feisty, outspoken business leader was among those who raised their voice against the sudden assault of foreign capital and technology and asked for no more than a level playing field.

Soon enough though, the canny businessman figured out the new rules of the game and played it better than most. By the late 90s, Bajaj Auto was once again king of the Indian roads.

But here’s where Rahul Bajaj departed from the time-honoured script for successful patriarchs. He knew when it was time for him to step back. With both his sons having apprenticed long enough on the shop floor, the man who had built the company into a two-wheeler giant transitioned smoothly into a mentor and guide, leaving operational control to them.

A good call

It was a wise and ultimately enriching decision.

Rajiv, the elder of the two and the appointed heir to the two-wheeler business, steered it out of a mini-slump following the onslaught of motorcycles in which arch-rival Hero Honda took the lead.

Soon though Bajaj had recovered lost ground and in 2009, the company took the momentous, though at that time highly, questionable decision to exit the scooters business. Subsequent events show that what the company lost on market share it made up in profitability.

But it is the newer business of financial services that has proved to be a bonanza for the group.

Outspoken and frank in public, Rahul Bajaj is anything but reckless in his business. Even as many Indian businessmen flamed out following ill-thought through forays into disparate businesses, Bajaj stuck to knitting through the company’s healthy balance sheet, allowing it to constantly explore related opportunities. Financial services were an integral part of that diversification strategy.

Though the entry into this business was largely Rahul Bajaj’s idea (in 2001, the company signed up with Allianz SE to start a general insurance business) he left it to Sanjiv to grow it the way he thought best.

To Sanjiv’s credit after 10 years learning the ropes of the two-wheeler business, his ability to make a success of the financial business turning Bajaj Finance into one of the largest retail asset financing NBFCs in the country, is a remarkable feat.

Just as the evolution from the Bajaj Chetak to the Pulsar bike marks a generational shift in the group’s two-wheeler business, the emergence of a powerful financial services entity whose market cap dwarfs that of the original entity Bajaj Auto marks an equally successful diversification.

In both these, Rahul Bajaj provided the ballast and more significantly the original impetus by empowering his sons at the right time and giving them distinct lines of business to run.

Dolat Capital's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto reported a decent performance in Q1FY21 amid turbulent times led by cost control measures and favorable FX movement. EBITDA fell 66% YoY to Rs 4.09bn (vs est Rs 3.88bn) with margin at 13.3% (vs est 11.96%) led by 60% fall in revenue. The management is hopeful for a quick recovery in 2Ws aided by increasing preference for personal mobility and improvement in rural sentiments. Motorcycle demand is back to 80-85% of normal levels in July for domestic markets. There are initial signs of recovery in export with demand back to 75-85% of normal levels. Nigeria sales are back to 75% while Philippines and Colombia are at 80% of normal levels for motorcycles. While the timing for full fledge recovery may be uncertain, we believe Bajaj Auto will be one of the biggest beneficiaries in the export markets over the medium term due to lower penetration of 2W in African market and increased preference of personal mobility Gross margin improved in Q1 (+133bps QoQ) due to price hike, a better geographic mix (high export) and FX benefit. However, reversal in commodity prices and INR appreciation to put pressure on margins in Q2. The company has taken several cost control measures and curtailed marketing & adv spends while keeping employee costs intact.

Outlook

We maintain our positive stance given 1) improving outlook for domestic and export 2W segments owing to increasing preference for personal mobility, 2) operating efficiency and volume recovery to support EBITDA margin and 3) strong cash reserves. At CMP, the stock is trading at 17x/15x FY22E/FY23E earnings, which leaves little upside on the stock. We roll forward our valuation from FY22 to FY23E and value the stock Rs 3,204 (16x FY23E core EPS + cash + KTM stake).

East India Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s 1QFY21 was extremely challenging as focus was on restoring the supply chain amid strict lockdown & demand contraction. The operational performance was more or less in-line with our estimates. There were clear visible efforts on stringent cost control measures. 2W domestic demand reached at 80-85% of normal levels in July, while 2W exports demand is also not too far behind. 3W domestic business is still area of concern as the recovery is going to take time (currently just 20% of normal levels), while 3W exports is 10% lower than the 2W recovery levels. We are particularly cautious on the sustenance of demand in domestic as our comprehensive dealer check reveals that atleast 1/3rd of the demand is pent-up & only serious buyers are visiting showrooms. Rising Covid cases related uncertainty & frequent lockdowns may disrupt the recovery. Other concern is its export markets, which are more dependent on crude oil (still hovering below $50) and availability/devaluation of currency in key markets. The outlook for its high profitable domestic 3W business too looks grim in near term.

Outlook

We believe current valuation has incorporated all the near term positivities about demand recovery. Hence, risk reward is not favourable. Recommend ‘Hold’.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

BJAUT results were operationally better with positive surprise on EBITDA margins at 13.3% (-220bp YoY, PLe 12.5%) led by three year high gross margins at 32.9% (+470bp YoY, PLe 32%). The beat was led by favorable forex impact. However, Adj.PAT came in lower at Rs5.3b (-53% YoY, PLe Rs6.2b) due to lower other income. With weak product mix (higher domestic share) and currency benefit largely witnessed, margins to contract QoQ. The recent price increase in the domestic market (average Rs1-3k/unit) only covers cost and not margins. We believe 2W recovery both in domestic and exports markets have been encouraging (to an extent 80-85% of normal), BJAUT’s 3W portfolio to remain under pressure (~20% recovery in domestic 3W led by cargo). We upgrade FY21/22 EPS by 2%/1.4% to factor in for cost efficiencies.

Outlook

We maintain ‘Hold’ on the stock with the revised price target of Rs2,713 (earlier Rs2,664) at 15x (10% discount to 10 year LPA roll forward to June’22 EPS).

Emkay Global Financial's report on Bajaj Auto

Revenue declined 60% yoy to Rs30.8bn (est.: Rs30.6bn), dragged by a 64% fall in volumes. Demand is gradually improving and has reached 80-85% of last year levels in 2Ws in Jul’20, but remains subdued at ~20% in domestic 3Ws and 70-75% in overseas 3Ws. Despite a steep decline in volumes, EBITDA margin contraction was limited to 220bps at 13.3% (est.: 13.2%), due to better gross margin and cost reduction efforts. Gross margin expanded 460bps yoy to 32.9% (est.: 32.3%), supported by INR depreciation, better mix and price increases. Demand outlook remains subdued for high-margin segments such as 3Ws and exports. Domestic 3Ws demand is under pressure due to steep price increases and financing issues. Demand in overseas markets has been impacted due to adverse currency trends.

Outlook

Volume growth expected to be muted at 2% CAGR over FY20-23E. We retain Hold/UW stance in sector EAP, with a TP of Rs2,978 (Rs2,629 earlier), based on 14x Sep’22E EPS (FY22E EPS earlier) and value of KTM at Rs96/share.

Bajaj Auto is expected to see a steep fall in June quarter earnings due to a significant decline in volumes across segments, but realisation may increase on price hike and rupee depreciation.

According to brokerages, profit in Q1 FY21 could drop 44 percent which could be supported by higher other income and lower tax cost. Revenue during the quarter may decline around 60 percent compared to June quarter last year, while operating profit may drop over 66 percent YoY.

Bajaj Auto's sales volumes declined by 65 percent year-on-year to 4,43,000 units led by (1) 70 percent YoY decline in domestic bike volumes, (2) 74 percent YoY fall in three-wheeler volumes and (3) 55 percent decline in export two-wheeler volumes in Q1 FY21.

""We expect revenues to decline by 59 percent YoY led by 65 percent fall in volumes and 10 percent increase in average selling price due to the BS-VI transition in the domestic market,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees profit falling 44 percent for the quarter YoY.

According to Sharekhan, realisations are expected to increase 13 percent YoY driven by prices hikes due to BS6 transition.

Operating profit margin is expected to decline 260 bps YoY due to negative operating leverage, said the brokerage which expects EBITDA to decline by 67 percent.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s (BJAUT) FY20 annual report highlights the potential impact of COVID-19 on demand with weakness continuing at least till 1HFY21. The company expects the Super-sports segment to grow in FY21. Also, BJAUT expects the premiumization trend to continue in the long run. The company is well positioned with its portfolio of Husqvarna, KTM, Dominar, Pulsar and the planned Triumph launch. Its competitive positioning in both domestic motorcycles and 3Ws was broadly stable in FY20, however, it lost share in 3W exports from India. Overall, share of exports from Africa increased 6pp to 53%; however, the company witnessed a similar decline in share from South Asia and the Middle East (ME). In FY20, BJAUT started granting employee stock options (ESOPs). Interestingly, BJAUT’s ESOP Trust would be buying stocks from the open market for giving shares on exercise of ESOPs.



Outlook

Valuations at 17.3x/15.9x FY21/FY22E consol. EPS is a fair reflection of the tepid earnings growth expectation as well as near-term volume weakness. With outlook over the next 6-9 months remaining challenging due to the impact of COVID-19 as well as BS-VI related cost inflation, we estimate BJAUT’s EPS to decline at 3.5% CAGR over FY20-22E. Maintain Neutral with TP of INR2,895 (16x Jun’22E consol. EPS v/s 10-year average P/E of 17.3x).

With the local administration in Aurangabad opting for a district-wide lockdown for nine days starting July 10, questions have now been raised on the Bajaj Auto's Waluj facility and if it was following COVID-19 related standard operating procedures (SOPs).

Sources told Moneycontrol that little more than 400 COVID-19 positive cases have emerged, including 10 deaths, from the automaker's Waluj factory. The rise in cases, sources said, is attributed to resistance from the employees to follow the SOPs.

These floor workers said a large proportion of the workforce did not wear masks while on duty, flouting one of the crucial SOPs. “Workers have complained of heat and breathing problems while wearing a mask,” a worker who is part of the union told Moneycontrol.

Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto, had earlier noted that 60 percent people in Aurangabad don't wear masks.

Other workers who are part of the union told Moneycontrol that the reason behind the spike in the number of cases at the Waluj plant is because of a previously existing medical condition of workers, most of whom are above the age of 50.

“The Chakan plant has not had a single case so far. It is not because a different set of SOPs was employed at that plant compared to the Waluj plant. Both factories have similar SOPs. Workers at the Chakan factory have been following all the rules thoroughly. Besides the average age of a worker at the Chakan plant in under 30 years, whereas at the Waluj plant it is 55 years,” said another worker from the union.

COVID-19 has beem found to be more lethal for older age groups, as per studies.

While the Waluj factory continues to report new COVID-19 positive cases, Bajaj Auto’s other plant located 220 km away at Chakan, Pune has not reported even a single case so far.

The Waluj plant is the oldest of the three manufacturing plants run by Bajaj Auto. It employs more than 8,100 employees and contractors, producing Platina, Discover, three-wheelers and the Qute. A bulk of Bajaj Auto’s exports are managed from this plant.

Pay cutsA decision to enforce a lockdown was taken on July 6 by the Aurangabad Divisional Commissioner Sunil Kendrekar after a meeting with district officials and corporators.

The lockdown will not just result in the shutting down of the Bajaj Auto factory, but the entire industrial belt in the vicinity as well, which includes the plants of auto ancillaries.

This will be the first shutdown of the plant after the company reopened on April 24, following a month long closure. Bajaj had indicated of a 50 percent reduction in salaries in the event of a lockdown.

“We are waiting for final instruction. If there is a lockdown in Waluj and the plant has to be closed, then those employees will face a 50 percent cut for the duration of the lockdown,"" said a company source.

“Bajaj has helped us, but the number of cases is not coming down. I have been asked by the company to get quarantined for seven days because my co-worker tested positive. Thankfully, my report has come out negative,” said Thengade Bajirao, leader of the worker union at Bajaj Auto's Waluj plant.",544,-0.8279917389154434

""We are demanding that due to increased number of COVID-19 cases, work should be suspended for few days to break this cycle of transmission of disease. We are just seeking temporary suspension of work for few days,"" Bajaj Auto Workers' Union President Thengade Bajirao told PTI when contacted over the matter.

A mail sent to Bajaj Auto regarding the issue remained unanswered.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""There are already over 400 positive cases and seven deaths have also taken place. The management is also trying to find solutions but the fact remains that the number of cases are increasing,"" Bajirao said.

He further said: ""We have even told them that we will compensate for the production loss for the 8-10 days by working extra time and on holidays. There won't be any loss to the company due to this suspension of work. We won't work against the factory.""

The last discussion with the management took place in the preceding week and ended without any headway, he said.

""We will again talk to the management regarding this. We are also looking to speak to government authorities to mediate regarding this. A decision on speaking to authorities will be taken in a day or so,"" Bajirao said.

Bajaj Auto has three plants in the country -- one each at Waluj and Chakan (Maharashtra) and one at Pant Nagar in Uttarakhand.

The company employs over 8,100 people at the Waluj plant which rolls out models like Discover, Platina, CT 100, Boxer and three-wheelers (RE).

Bajaj Auto’s Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj has confirmed that there are 250 active cases of COVID-19 among persons associated with the automaker’s Aurangabad facility in Maharashtra. Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Bajaj said while there had been no salary cut so far, the company would have to lower wages by 50 percent if another hard lockdown was imposed.

Bajaj said that it was not correct to presume that people were getting infected and dying at the production facility. He further said that a lot of the people who have tested positive for COVID-19 were not coming to work and that many were already locked down in containment zones.

Gram Panchayats are also in agreement with the company on keeping the plant open, he added.

With over two lakh COVID-19 cases reported so far, Maharashtra remains the most-severely affected state in the country. Besides the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Aurangabad, where the Bajaj Auto plant is located, has also seen high number of cases.

As many as five people have died due to the outbreak in the factory.

Situation on the ground is contrary to media reports, Bajaj claimed, adding that the management was in touch with union and local administration on daily basis.

There is zero social distancing in Aurangabad and 60 percent people not wearing masks, Bajaj claimed even as he reiterated that the “safest place to be in Aurangabad is inside the factory”.

Workers at Bajaj Auto, India's biggest exporter of motorbikes, are demanding the temporary closure of one of its plants after 250 employees tested positive for coronavirus, its unions said on Saturday, as companies struggle to ramp up operations.

India went into complete lockdown in late March to curb the spread of the virus but it has recently eased restrictions despite the number of cases surging, putting some companies in a difficult position as they try to revive production.

The Bajaj Auto factory affected is located in western Maharashtra, the state with the highest number of cases of COVID-19, the disease the virus causes.

The company said on June 26 that 140 of the roughly 8,000 staff at the factory had caught the virus and two had died.

It said work there would not be stopped as the company wanted to learn to ""live with the virus"", and in a letter to employees this week it said those who did not show up for work would not be paid.

An official in Aurangabad district, overseeing the Waluj area where the plant is located, said the number of cases had now gone up to more than 250.

Bajaj Auto did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

On Saturday, India reported a record number of more than 22,000 daily cases of infection, taking the nationwide total to more than 640,000.

""We requested the company to temporarily close the plant for 10-15 days to break the cycle but they said there is no point as people will continue to gather for social events outside of work,"" the Bajaj union's Bajirao said.

In May, Chinese smartphone maker OPPO suspended operations briefly at a plant near New Delhi after some workers tested positive.

Workers and union leaders say Bajaj has taken steps to ensure social distancing on the factory floor and in its cafeteria, besides arranging separated seating on its buses and providing masks and sanitisers for staff. But they say this is not enough.

""On the assembly line, multiple people touch the same engine. We were wearing gloves but still caught the virus,"" said one worker who was in hospital after testing positive for COVID-19.

Though the company recorded its best-ever annual profits in FY20, Bajaj Auto chairman Rahul Bajaj has called for intensified efforts to tackle the COVID-19 slowdown and its impact on business operations.

Addressing shareholders in the 13th annual report, Bajaj said, “In any event, it would be almost foolhardy to believe that demand will not get affected for at least the first two, if not three, quarters of FY2021. We will have to deal with this grave situation in many innovative ways.”

Bajaj Auto reported a net profit of Rs 5,100 crore in FY20 — an increase of 9.1 percent, compared to FY19. Its turnover, however, declined by 0.5 percent to Rs 31,652 crore during FY20 from FY19.

Though the central government partially eased lockdown in the first week of June, many automotive dealers restarted sales in May itself. They were based in areas that were not part of the designated containment zones.

While initial reports suggest that retail sales of two-wheelers have picked up with consumers preferring personal mobility over public transport, manufacturing facilities are operating at less than half their full strength.

“To my mind, the battle may have just begun. The national lockdown on account of COVID-19 has effectively wiped out 40 days, of which 32 have been in FY2021. With a partial easing of lockdown, our facilities at Chakan, Waluj and Pantnagar have opened, but are far from working at full pace,” Bajaj added.

Bajaj’s domestic sales of two and three-wheelers in May stood at little over 40,000, which were 83 percent less than the same month last year and less than half, compared to exports during in the same month. This is after the Pune-based company reported zero sales in April, along with the rest of the automotive industry.

While no company has provided a clear outlook for demand for FY21, the most common expectation is that of a pick-up closer to the start of the December quarter, after the exhaustion of the ‘pent-up demand’.

“We will have to use every lesson learnt in marketing and selling to recreate markets for our bikes and three-wheelers. We will have to delight our customers with a slew of new products. We will have to increase operational efficiencies everywhere. We will have to eliminate all unnecessary costs,” Bajaj added.

Though many new projects are running behind schedule, companies like Bajaj Auto are trying to make up for lost time by expediting work on the research and development (R&D) front. Bajaj is working on projects under its own brands like Chetak, and that of international brands like KTM, Husqvarna and Triumph.",441,-0.28077972928682965

Signalling the continuous risk of COVID-19 despite following stringent measures to keep it at bay, 264 workers at JSW Steel's Karnataka plant have tested positive for the virus.

""Of the 264 who were infected, 154 have been discharged,"" Vinod Nowal, JSW Steel's Deputy Managing Director told Moneycontrol. ""The rate has gone down. Initially, up to 13 percent of those tested were turning positive. Now it is down to 4 percent,"" he added.

The cases, first of which was reported in early June, have led to the country's leading steelmaker putting restrictions on the movement of workers in what is among the largest single-location steel manufacturing facilities in the world. The plant, spread across 10,000 acres, has a capacity to make 12 million tons of steel a year.

JSW Steel is not the only major manufacturer up against the challenge. Earlier this month, some employees at two-wheeler major Bajaj Auto's Auarangabad tested positive, and two died.

""We have more than 8,100 employees and contractors employed in our Waluj plant. Our current incidence of 140 cases of COVID is less than 2 percent of our strength. Two of our infected employees with underlying conditions of hypertension and diabetes have unfortunately succumbed to the infection,"" said Ravi Kyran Ramasamy, CHRO, Bajaj Auto in a statement.

The incidents have highlighted the risk of getting infected as companies across sectors open up and employees get back to offices and factories. At the same time, industry executives point out it is unviable for businesses to remain shut after nearly two-months of lockdown in April and May.

In fact, Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj questioned the extension of lockdown in some states such as Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.

COVID-19 cases in India are nearing the 5.5 lakh mark, and more than 16,000 have lost their lives.

Worker movement

JSW Steel's Karanataka facility is located in the Bellari-Hosptel iron ore belt, which has seen 725 positive COVID-19 cases till now. It added 80 new cases on June 28, the highest single-day surge.

The increase had led to many locally calling for a complete shutdown of the plant. But local industry bodies have voiced against it, saying more two lakh people depend on the steel plant.

To limit the further spread, JSW Steel has asked about 11,000 workers to stay back at home. ""We have asked these workers to not to come to the plant. These are workers who come from villages up t0 40km away,"" said Nowal. About 17,000 workers live in the steel township and colonies nearby and the attempt is to limit workers living beyond these areas, to come into the facility.

""We are taking additional steps to test and isolate any employee that shows symptoms,"" said Nowal. The company has converted the hospital inside the steel plant township into a COVID-19 centre, with 140 beds. Another training facility has become a 'parallel hospital' with 250 beds. About 200 beds have been separately arranged for those who have been quarantined.

The restrictions on workers movement mean that the company now runs two shifts in the plant, instead of the usual three. ""Our production is at 85 to 90 percent of the capacity. It was 85 percent in May,"" said Nowal.",821,-0.20410341769456863

The number of COVID-19 infections has seen a sharp increase after staggered lifting of restrictions began on June 1. The first phase of reopening the economy, or Unlock 1, ends after June 30.

""And to clarify, I am not saying that because of the lockdown the number of infections or deaths has increased. I am saying whatever was suppressed that time has come out just now. So take the average of both—it is probably going to be what it would have been if this kind of lockdown hadn't been implemented?"" he said.

Bajaj also told the publication that companies cannot survive by halting their operations and paying their employees for staying at home for a prolonged period.

""So if you want to be absolutely safe and you want to sit at home till the vaccine comes, you are welcome to sit at home.

This is the single largest instance of cases found from one manufacturing location. The cases surfaced despite the company following SOPs.

More on this later in the copy but here is a brief look at what else made headlines in the automotive space during the week.

Audi opens bookings for RS7 Sportback

German luxury car maker Audi on Tuesday announced the opening of bookings for its all-new performance car RS 7 Sportback, which is expected to be launched in the domestic market next month.

The five-seater second-generation Audi RS7 Sportback can be booked either online or from the nearest dealership at an initial amount of Rs 10 lakh, and deliveries will commence in August, the company said in a release.

Indian co hit by Maharashtra’s Chinese MoU freeze

The decision by the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government to put ‘Chinese’ memorandum of understanding (MoU) on hold has inadvertently hit an Indian company hard.

Foton PMI Bus Manufacturing Company, a joint venture (JV) where 70 percent equity is held by Haryana-based PMI Electro Mobility Solutions, is one of the three companies that now have their MoU on hold by the Maharashtra government.

India’s share in Suzuki’s basket goes down

Growing influence of its neighbours and the cyclical slowdown saw India report its lowest share since 2016 in Suzuki’s global automotive sales during FY20.

India’s share in Suzuki Motor Corporation’s (SMC) worldwide automotive sales ended at 50.35 percent last financial year reporting sales of 1.43 million units. A year ago, it was 52.72 percent.

Imports from China stuck at Indian ports

Auto components procured from China are very likely to face unaccounted delays after cargoes landing up on India’s sea ports are being subjected to unusual and extended scrutiny.

Several auto component and vehicle manufacturing companies have complained of ‘very high’ congestion at the Mumbai port after their shipments that sailed from China got stuck.

Honda opens bookings for the new City

Honda has officially opened up bookings for the next-gen Honda City. The car's launch was pushed back due to the lockdown and the launch will now finally take place in July.

The company has started accepting bookings for the car and deliveries too, are expected to begin from July onwards. 300 Honda dealerships across the country are operational.

Bajaj Auto hit by COVID-19 cases

Two workers who lost their lives were among the 140 confirmed COVID-19 positive cases found at the Bajaj Auto plant in Aurangabad, the Pune-based company said on on June 26.

This is the first time that Bajaj Auto has reported COVID-19 positive case since easing of the lockdown restrictions and partial resumption of production activity.

This is also the first in corporate India that such a large number of COVID-19 positive cases have been found from a single manufacturing location.

In earlier instances, workers at Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai plants were reported to have contracted the disease. The Tamil Nadu chief minister had even decided to enforce another lockdown in the Chennai and Kanchipuram districts (having multiple auto plants) to restrict the spread.

The cases have been detected despite the affected companies claiming to have put in place the standard operating procedures (SOPs) formed internally and also those mandated by the state and district administration.

“Either the rules were not followed or plant heads were not alert. In both conditions this does not augur well for the rest of the manufacturing industry and not just the automotive industry”, said a mid-level executive of a tyre manufacturing company.

Before getting the green signal automotive companies were busy convincing the state governments to allow them to restart production operations after having kept them shut for more than 40 continuous days.

While at first states allowed only negligible staff to return to work, the cap was revised upwards to 30 percent in subsequent days. Some companies are presently operating at 50 percent of their worker strength. Subdued demand conditions have prevented the companies to ramp up production to 100 percent levels.

Maintaining social distance, adhering to sanitation norms and avoiding public transport were some of the several SOPs formed by the industry.

Entry and exit of non-employees to and from the offices and manufacturing plants were strictly controlled.

However a vehicle is made of hundreds of parts, most of which are produced by vendor partners. Constant unhindered supply of such parts to feed the plants continuously is required which raises the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

“If cases continue to grow it may force the state or the central authorities to put in some undesired counter measures. This could be stoppage of production or reduction in number of workers,” the executive mentioned above feared.

Almost all automotive plants in India have now become operational. 70-80 percent of showrooms have also reopened. Demand has started to pick up although showroom footfalls have been low. Several enquiries have come through the digital means.

After cases of redundancies and cut back in salaries and other overheads auto companies were hoping to scale up production and introduce new products in the market. If their manufacturing plants do not keep the disease at bay output will take an impact.",876,-0.6727633078893026

Electric scooter Chetak of which bookings were halted by Bajaj Auto after an unprecedented surge, is set to see production resuming at its Pune factory soon. Bookings for the model could also reopen in the next few weeks.

Bajaj Auto had to turn down booking requests for the Chetak as the company felt that deliveries would take longer than expected, leading to dissatisfaction in the brand. The Pune-based maker of Pulsar and Avenger launched the Chetak only in Pune and Bengaluru after its January debut.

Talking to Moneycontrol, Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director - Bajaj Auto, said, “Bookings are closed because we got so many of them and our supply chain got interrupted because one component was actually coming from Wuhan, China. So that was a big setback for us.”

Battery cells of all electric vehicles produced in India have to be imported from China. Bajaj does not directly purchase battery packs or cells from the Chinese exporter, but it is one of Bajaj’s vendor partners who imports it for the Chetak, which is also the company’s only electric two-wheeler.

“Now we are resuming production. In fact those components have now arrived at the Mumbai port as we speak and it will reach the factory in a few days and we will resume production shortly. Supplies from China have resumed,” Sharma added.

A decision on reopening bookings for the Chetak will be taken by mid of July also by when the company hopes to have an unhindered supply of all components of the two-wheeler.

“Booking amount is only Rs 1,000 and we would refund it if there is a cancellation but we don’t want the customer to wait endlessly and get frustrated. We want to ensure that there is a continuous supply of components,” added Sharma.

The research and development work and production of other Bajaj products resumed after partial easing of lockdown restrictions however production of Chetak remained suspended. Bajaj has two plants in Maharashtra and one in Uttarakhand.

“Even the sea ports are congested and it is costing time there too. By mid-July we should be able to get a good flow of components and then we will take a call on bookings by then. We had a waiting period of five years for the older Chetak but we don’t want that of this Chetak,” added Sharma.

Priced at Rs 100,000 (ex-showroom) the Bajaj Chetak is one of the most expensive electric two-wheelers available in India and much higher than the most affordable Pulsar, the most popular bike brand by Bajaj priced at Rs 70,000.

Deliveries of the Chetak with six colours and two variants commenced from February-end. Around 13 dealerships in Bengaluru and four dealerships in Pune were earmarked for retailing the two-wheeler.",465,-0.2286718249320984

Bajaj Auto clocked revenues of nearly Rs 30,000 crore during FY20 to become the highest income generator in the two- and three-wheeler categories. Bajaj sailed past Hero MotoCorp which had held onto the position of being the company with the biggest turnover for more than 10 years.

Bajaj’s fall of 1.4 percent in the revenue from operations to Rs 29,919 crore during FY20, as compared to FY19, was lower than Hero’s which reported a drop of 14 percent in revenue from operations to Rs 28,836 crore in FY20 compared to FY19.

In addition to sales from motorcycles Bajaj Auto’s turnover also includes revenues from the three-wheeler business. Hero MotoCorp, however, does not make three-wheelers but it sells scooters which Bajaj Auto stopped making a decade ago.

Bajaj Auto saw 8 percent decline in sales volumes during FY20 to 4.61 million units while Hero MotoCorp reported 18 percent decline in volumes to 6.39 million during the same year, as per data shared by both the companies.

Since the majority of Hero’s volumes comes from the domestic market it maintained its position as the market leader in the two-wheeler space in India during FY20. Bajaj finished fourth in the domestic two-wheeler market one-third of which is controlled by scooters. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India and TVS Motor Company are the second and third largest two-wheeler sellers, respectively.

Despite a volume difference of more than 1.78 million units Bajaj Auto was able to clock higher revenue than Hero MotoCorp. A major reason behind this is the export play of Bajaj. The Pune-based company exported 47 percent of its production last year which was much higher than 41 percent clocked in FY19.

The 79 export markets of Bajaj Auto including markets in Africa, Latin America, South Asia and Middle East report higher revenues and richer margins than in India. Since December 2019 Bajaj’s exports have been higher than domestic sales. Bajaj also makes KTM and Husqvarna branded bikes for India and export markets.

In comparison, Hero MotoCorp exported less than 3 percent of its production during 2019, lower than earlier years. Hero is present in 40 countries including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Nigeria, Columbia. As much as 75 percent of Hero’s sales come from the low priced models such as Splendor, HF Dawn and Passion.

Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto, said, “While FY 2019-20 was a challenging year, we note that not only have we emerged as the overall leader in our segment, we have also put in place several initiatives that will build momentum. Despite the uncertainties surrounding the immediate future, we are confident that our strategic path will serve our ambitions of global leadership and business success.”",456,0.4275952066693987

With revenue shooting up to Rs 29,919 crore in 2019-20, Bajaj Auto on June 17 said that it has clocked a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 percent in the last ten years.

The company also said it has achieved several milestones in the last financial year that has helped it set the tone for its next phase of growth.

Last October, Bajaj Auto brought back the iconic Chetak scooter in an all-new electric avatar. Bookings opened in January 2020 in Pune and Bengaluru and deliveries commenced in early March.

The automaker said it posted revenues of Rs 29,919 crore in 2019-20 with operating EBITA margins of 17.6 percent at Rs 5,253 crore and profit before tax of Rs 6,580 crore.

""After the announcement of corporate results for FY20, Bajaj Auto has emerged as the largest 2/3-wheeler manufacturer in the country measured in terms of revenue. The company has clocked a CAGR of 10 percent over the last decade (2010 – 2020), with revenues moving up from Rs 11,509 crore in 2009-10 to Rs 29,919 crore in 2019-20,"" Bajaj Auto said in the release.

This achievement is testimony to the company's unwavering focus and relentless pursuit of its three pronged strategy –- using its R&D to develop innovative products and create differentiated brands; building a global business and leveraging principles of TPM to simplify operations and deliver top class quality, said company's Executive Director Rakesh Sharma.

""Despite the uncertainties surrounding the immediate future, we are confident that our strategic path will serve our ambitions of global leadership and business success,"" he added.

The company continues to leverage its R&D prowess to deliver meaningful innovation and differentiated value propositions to customers in the mass commuter segments, the company said.

In the last 12 months, it has rolled out new models such as Platina H-gear and the CT110 besides increasing its leadership market share of the intra-city business unit comprising the RE, Maxima and Qute brands of 3-wheelers and quadricycles.

“Our reach in global markets coupled with a diverse and evolving product portfolio has helped us de-risk our business as we are not overtly reliant on any one geography or product. Consequently, our revenues and profits are not dependent on any specific sets of products or geography,"" CFO Soumen Ray said.

""Our strong operating performance is a combination of our export performance, product mix and forex, which allow us several levers to protect our industry leading margin,"" Ray added.

Bajaj Auto, which accounts for over 50 percent of the country's 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler exports, said that 47 percent of its production was consumed in the overseas markets in the previous fiscal across over 79 countries.

The company's growth and presence in the domestic and international markets have been on the back of its own brands as well its alliance with KTM, the company said in the release.",486,0.9564165830612182

A couple of WhatsApp group that I am a part of should be renamed the China Problem group. Ninety percent of discussions is on how China hijacked the world economy, how they do not deserve to do so, how all politicians have let us down, how they are stealing all intellectual property and how we are doomed if we do not stop downloading Tiktok.

All true. And no, this article is not about disagreeing with this narrative. This article is not about the fact that an average Chinese student in the US beats the hell of all other students (including Indians) in terms of hours she works and the only disadvantage she has is that her English is not good enough, but she is getting there.

No, this article is not about the fact that the people of China worked their butts off while Italians holidayed and French wanted a four-day workweek. No, this article is not about the fact that one cannot hire a decent machinist or a forger in India because all of them are sitting in call centres answering questions from technically-challenged Americans. Of course, I agree and support the view that China and its people do not deserve the place they have reached (I don’t want to be trolled). After all, they are intellectual property (IP) thieves and do not take four-week holidays. They should be punished.

So what is this article about? This is about an industry where China has been beaten by India. It has been shown that it’s not the government, neither the people; it’s really the companies that compete. And as far as India is concerned the people responsible for the demise of manufacturing in the county are these companies.

In 1983, I graduated out of a Mumbai engineering college considered to be one of the best. Irrespective of the branch that you studied—mechanical, electrical, civil, production, textile—80 percent of the graduates became coders for the software industry.

In 2000, I was at Bajaj Auto as Human Resources (HR) head (after working 15 years in technical capacity), and I was off to conduct campus interviews to hire 100 engineers who would design and build world-class motorcycles. On day 5, I was in Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI), Mumbai and all other regional engineering colleges (RECs). I ended up hiring ten people from 15 colleges. In every college I was told by the training and placement officer (TPO) that technology companies get preference in hiring. I asked, were designing and building an engine not technology? No, that’s manufacturing, I was told. Writing COBOL code for a bank in New York by a software company employee is technology. May be the Chinese forced us into this thinking.

The following year I wrote to all colleges. I want to be day 0 in your campus. I will give three times salary of the “so called best technology company”, but only if I am day 0. Hiring 100 engineers at three times salary was no problem for me as compared to say TCS, which had to hire 2,000 ‘bodies’. They could never match that salary.

And that’s how Bajaj Auto built its research and development—batch by batch. Making designing and manufacturing of motorcycles sexy and paying for it. The selection ratio was 1:15. Most of the IITs, RECs, and VJTIs had toppers who were absolutely useless. They could not draw a Carnot cycle, could not tell the difference between a diesel and petrol engine. Give them an elevation and plan they could not draw the side view. Most of them were focusing on writing code. But we found gems, we found guys who were passionate and knowledgeable but could not express in English. I started conducting interviews in Hindi, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil and so on.

There was another company using the same approach—TVS Motor Company. Based in south India, they also built a great R&D department.

In 2005, Chinese motorcycles attacked India with products which were 30 percent cheaper. Many dealers started selling them. Press predicted demise of Indian manufacturers. But within six months they went broke. Their quality was no match to Indian motorcycles. They never came back again.

Bajaj then started attacking them in Africa. Africans had two choices: buy expensive Japanese motorcycles or cheap Chinese ones. Chinese motorcycles used to come in a box. You bought the box and took it to a mechanic and he would assemble it.

In Nigeria motorcycles are used as taxis. So no one is going to pay you a dime more than the basic requirement. In such a market Bajaj launched its fully assembled motorcycle. It was priced more than the Chinese models but less than the Japanese ones. The company set up dealerships, service centres, trained mechanics and developed a relationship with the taxi riders. Today Bajaj is a market leader. TVS is number two. The Chinese have been driven out.

You can see videos of the love that the okada (taxi) drivers have for Bajaj bikes. Country after country in Africa and in South America Indians companies captured the market driving their Chinese counterparts out.

In 2018 India became the largest manufacturer of two wheelers in the world (producing twice more than China). Indian companies have started buying out European brands. The market leader of motorcycles in Europe is not BMW, its KTM, which is part-owned by Bajaj. China is slipping fast not only in the manufacturing of bikes, but also in the manufacturing of components. Indian suppliers are beating them hands down. Between three Indian companies—Hero, Bajaj and TVS—India today dominates the world motorcycle market.

Why was this not done in TVs, computers, mobile phones, pharmaceuticals and other industries? It’s the same country, same labour laws, same infrastructure, but not the same entrepreneurs. Indian businessmen are characterised by a myopic vision—it’s both, short-term outlook as well as geographically limited. Of course, the government also does not help.

So who is responsible for the Chinese dominance—the government, people or the corporates?

I think it’s all the three. When even ITI-trained turners and fitters refuse to work in a shop floor, when a stock broker is paid more than an engineer, when typing code is mistaken for technology, when governments refuse to amend antique labour and land laws, when corporates think local and not global, and finally when you, yes you the reader, will not send your son or daughter to work on the shop floor, each one of these factors is as responsible for the Chinese dominance as their ‘ethical corruption’. We have been looted because we left our doors and windows open.

No, this article is not supporting the Chinese. How dare they work so hard? And how dare they obey a communist government? We should stop buying all their goods and we will make everything in our country. But we will work nine to five with a three-day weekend. We will overcome. One day.

""Things are changing everyday. We are now working at 50 percent capacity. The lockdown conditions keep changing daily . There is unfortunately not one aligned approach to restart.

He said it is hard for him to fathom why why the working population should be stopped from going to work.

He said if the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative means exclusion of MNCs, then the policy won't work.

On his learnings, he said: ""I learnt the hard way that getting product right is necessary, but not all in exports. A product without a story is not a brand. Position, communication and experience must be right for a brand to succeed. Government can create a lot of problems deliberately or unwittingly. We have over-regulated markets & today bikes cost 35% more in 18 months, situation for every industry in the world.""

Bajaj said he does not think anything dramatic should be expected in this financial year and said government did the right thing by fixing GST for electric vehicles at 5 percent.

Commenting on the recovery period, he said: ""We should see things come back close to normal in h2-FY21. We can't do much to push demand but can tempt people with our aspirational brands. If we can sharpen our proposition, will be able to gain an edge over competition.""

Rahul Gandhi's dialogue with industrialist Rajiv Bajaj on the economic fallout of the COVID-19 crisis will be aired on Thursday, the latest in the series of deliberations the former Congress chief is having with experts from various fields on the impact of the pandemic.

In the teaser of the conversation released on various social media accounts of the party, Gandhi, citing experts, is seen talking about the fear of the coronavirus disease, which, if spreads once, is difficult to get rid of.

In the teaser, Managing Director of Bajaj Auto, Rajiv Bajaj, is seen talking about the effect of the lockdown on the economy.

""The virus is waiting to hit you, so you have not solved that problem, but you have decimated the economy. You have flattened the wrong curve -- not the infection curve but the GDP curve. This is what we have ended with -- the worst of both worlds,"" Bajaj says.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

The first such dialogue was held on April 30 when Gandhi discussed the coronavirus pandemic and its economic implications with former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan.

He then held a conversation with Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee who had said India should come out with a large enough stimulus package to revive demand.

The former Congress chief last week spoke to globally renowned public health experts -- Professor Ashish Jha of Harvard Global Health Institute and Swedish epidemiologist Johan Giesecke.

""Tomorrow, Thursday, 4th June, 10 AM onwards, join my conversation with Mr Rajiv Bajaj on the Covid crisis, across all my social media platforms,"" Gandhi said on Twitter.

LKP Research's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto posted a strong set of numbers in Q4 FY20, as a volume fall 0f 17% yoy was quite arrested by a 10.1% hike in realizations on a better product mix and benign hike in input costs. The topline fell by 8% yoy and 11% qoq. Better realizations, steady forex benefits, RM costs tailwinds led to an 8 quarter high EBITDA margins at 18.4% up from 15.7%/17.9% yoy and qoq respectively. RM costs to sales ratio fell to 70.6% from 74% yoy and 71.8% qoq leading to a robust margin performance. Other income grew by 23%, while depreciation grew by just 4%. On 24% tax rate, net profits zoomed up by 36% yoy to ₹13.1 bn. On a qoq basis, they grew by 4%.

Outlook

We are expecting even margins to pick up in H2 and FY 22 as the high margin 3W sales also will move up with 2W. FY20 has witnessed a special dividend from BAL and we are not building the same for the next two years in our forecast. In view of a positive H2 FY21 and FY22, we are maintaining our BUY rating on the stock with reduced estimates and target of ₹3,055.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj Auto

BJAUT results look better at Revenue/EBITDA/PAT where EBITDA margin came in at 18.4% (PLe 16.2%), expanding 50bp QoQ. The beat in margin was led by higher realizations at Rs68.7k/unit (PLe Rs63.7k/unit) aided by favorable mix and forex movement. We have slashed FY21/22 eps estimates by 5.3%/2.6% as we cut sales by 11%/8% due to uncertainties in both domestic and exports volumes (both in 2W and 3W).

Outlook

BJAUT is already experiencing financing issues in domestic 3W segment. Additionally, 2W exports are likely to dent due to sharp currency devaluation and decline in crude oil prices. With favorable valuation (FY21/22 at 17x/14.4x) and limited downside, we maintain Hold rating on the stock with revised price target of Rs2,504 (earlier Rs2,554, 14x FY22 EPS).

East India Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

The operational performance in Q4FY20 was commendable due to better product mix and forex benefits. We believe it is not sustainable due to lower scale in FY21 and Bajaj would need to absorb some of the BS6 cost to pull customers towards showrooms. Lower commodity price benefits would continue in the coming quarters. The domestic & exports outlook looks subdued to us due to uncertainty, suppressed purchasing power & weak oil prices. A possible risk for Bajaj’s market share is due to downtrading, where its competitor has a strong hold. While 2nd half looks better and any improvement in the economic situation in export markets would yield in better volumes. However, we believe that near term uncertainties and positivity of a pick-up in the 2nd half is almost factored into the current levels of Bajaj Auto and hence, we see a limited upside.

Outlook

We have factored in some of the uncertainties of Covid-19 and built a gradual recovery in FY22e. However, we believe most of the positives are factored into the valuation. Hence, we have ‘Accumulate’ rating with a target price of Rs 2,747 (15x FY22e EPS of Rs 176 plus the value of KTM at Rs 109/share).

The nation-wide lockdown has pushed back scheduled market expansion of Bajaj Auto’s first all-electric, celebrated two-wheeler Chetak by a few months, a top company official told Moneycontrol.

Commercially launched in January this year, the electric Chetak went on sale only in Pune and Bengaluru. The company later had shut down bookings of the two-wheeler.

Interruption in supply of components from China coupled with the process of getting product experience feedback from customers are some of the reasons why Chetak’s entry into other Indian cities could get delayed by 4-5 months.

While production of other Bajaj products has resumed after partial easing of lockdown restrictions Chetak is yet to restart rolling out from the Pune factory.

Speaking to Moneycontrol Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto said, “We had some components coming from China, from Wuhan actually which got interrupted. We had a very good order book and eventually we had to freeze the order book because when the supplies started getting interrupted we felt that we cannot keep going to our customers and keep apologising. So we declined to take more orders.”

The company declined to state the number of orders it received for the Chetak but said that the priority is to fulfill the pending customer orders first before opening sales in more cities.

“Going forward we will continue to focus on Pune and Bengaluru for some time and then review the expansion to some other key cities in due course. That process of advancement of sales has got delayed. When things open up we will first try to accomplish what we had set to do in the first two cities,” added Sharma.

“First we wanted to service demand and secondly we wanted to see how the product is received, how the ecosystem of charging is responding, how the subsidy thing is working out, we wanted to see if any modification was required by the consumers. So we had a set of objectives that we had to accomplish first. We are at a loss of 4-5 months depending on when the lockdown reopens,” added Sharma.

Besides the domestic market Bajaj has committed to export the Chetak to European markets helped by its partner KTM for sales and distribution. This plan too has got delayed.

Priced at Rs 1,00,000 (ex-showroom) the Bajaj Chetak is one of the most expensive electric two-wheelers available in India and much higher than the most affordable Pulsar, the most popular bike brand by Bajaj priced at Rs 70,000.

Chetak is the first of many electric models planned by Bajaj Auto, including those in partnership with KTM. Deliveries of the Chetak with six colour and two variants commenced from February-end. Around 13 dealerships in Bengaluru and four dealerships in Pune were earmarked for retailing the Chetak.

Designed on the lines of the original Chetak, the popular geared scooter of the 1960s and 70s, the battery-powered scooter has been designed and developed in-house by Bajaj Auto.",498,-0.6875579059123993

Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL) Q4 results beat estimates driven by higher realisations per vehicle and margins due to better product mix and favorable forex realisation. 2W are expected to witness faster recovery owing to higher rural exposure. Rural sentiments are strong due to strong rabi harvest. Recent Government move to open end markets for farmers would also boost income. BAL is expected to continue outpacing industry driven by new launches in domestic market and entry into newer markets overseas.



Outlook

Though capital expenditure (capex) for FY21 will be revisited, the company won’t have any issues in providing for it if the situation demands, a top official of Bajaj Auto said on May 21.

The Pune-based company has restarted production in a limited manner at each of its three plants after keeping them shut for more than six weeks. About half of Bajaj’s dealerships have begun functioning.

Speaking to Moneycontrol Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto said: ""The capex is not such an issue at Bajaj in any case because of the already existing facilities. Even last year, the capex was Rs 211 crore and most of it were in things like dies and moulds. We were not required to have a heavy capex this year and therefore we are not required to cut it also.""

Two other listed automotive companies, Maruti Suzuki and Apollo Tyres, have brought down their capex for the year by nearly half as there is a general tendency to conserve cash and raise working capital especially with the gradual restarting of business operations.

""There is a need for cash conservation whether it is revenue or capital so there would be a focus on doing what is must to be done. It is not as if we don't have cash. If capex is required, it will be done but if it can be deferred it will be deferred. So certainly, the capex is expected to come down this year. For the first three months, we won’t be able to do anything. We are concerned about getting our supply chain running and capex is not the focus. But directionally discretionary capex will be cut down,"" said Soumen Ray, Chief Financial Officer, Bajaj Auto.

The maker of Pulsar and Avenger, however, clarified that there will be no cutback on any of the ongoing product development projects. In addition to its own product pipeline, Bajaj Auto is working with KTM and Triumph for the next generation motorcycles that will be powered by internal combustion engines and electric batteries.

When asked if the company has suffered delays in projects because of the lockdown, Sharma said the interruption will likely last till June because of which there can be delays.

""It is very difficult to estimate. We have lost two precious months and one cannot do R&D work sitting at home. It terms of product development these two months and may be bit of June will be an interruption,"" Sharma said.

Bajaj, however, has put the research and development (R&D) work on the fast track with the opening of business operations as allowed by the local administration in Pune.

""I think the need of the hour is such as that we will probably have to work double the time to respond to this crisis and try to get the projects back on track as fast as possible. Even today, when we were allowed 33 percent attendance, we have maximised the R&D attendance and minimised the commercial side,"" Sharma added.

Shares of Bajaj Auto gained 6.4 percent intraday on May 21 after March quarter earnings surpassed analysts' expectations.

While maintaining buy call on the stock and raising price target to Rs 3,000 (from Rs 2,800 earlier), global brokerage CLSA said Q4 results were significantly better than its and consensus expectations.

Earnings derived comfort from the company's margin resilience and strong free-cash-flow conversion, the research house feels. CNBC-TV18 reported.

Hence, CLSA increased its FY21/22 EPS estimates by 6-7 percent.

The two-and-three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto on May 20 reported a 0.4 percent year-on-year growth in Q4 standalone profit at Rs 1,310.3 crore on revenue of Rs 6,815.85 crore that declined 8.1 percent.

Profitability was supported by lower tax rate and higher other income, but there was a high base in the year-ago period and lower sales volumes (down 16.9 percent YoY) which caused a moderate growth in earnings.

In Q4 FY20, EBITDA margin stood at 18.4 percent (up 185bps YoY, up 50bps QoQ), led by favourable mix and exchange rate.

Japanese brokerage Nomura also said Bajaj Auto's Q4 was a beat with healthy margin outlook from currency benefit and price increases.

""We expect volume recovery in the second half. we maintain buy call and raised price target to Rs 3,030 per share,"" it added.

Kotak Institutional Equities also has a buy rating with a target at Rs 3,000 per share as EBITDA was above its estimates,

""The near-term will remain challenging for domestic and export markets, but the company will maintain operating margin in these challenging times,"" the brokerage said.

JM Financial which has also maintained a buy call on the stock with a target at Rs 2,850 per share said, ""While 50 percent of the dealerships have re-opened, overall retail sales stand at 25 percent of the normal levels. Shift towards personal mobility will support volumes albeit at a gradual pace starting in the second half of FY21.""

The management anticipated two-wheeler exports to relatively outperform domestic two-wheeler sales. JM Financial has factored in a 20 percent YoY decline in domestic 2-wheeler sales in FY21, as financing for entry-level products may become a constraint in the near-term.

However, the brokerage believes that domestic two-wheeler sales should normalise by FY22. ""Given the successful track record of product intervention by Bajaj Auto in the last few years, it is best placed to navigate the current environment. We estimate revenue / EPS CAGR of 3 / 4 percent over FY20-22,"" it said.

However, Emkay Global and Prabhudas Lilladher have a hold rating on the stock with a target at Rs 2,629 and Rs 2,556 per share respectively.

The stock was quoting at Rs 2,697.25, up Rs 139.20 or 5.44 percent on the BSE at 09:45 hours IST.

Industrialist Rajiv Bajaj said a cut in the goods and services tax (GST) could have given a boost to consumer sentiment.

Speaking to The Economic Times, the Bajaj Auto Managing Director shared his thoughts on the Centre's Rs 20 lakh crore economic package, which is intended to provide relief during the COVID-19 outbreak.

""A bold move like a dramatic GST reduction, even if for a short period, would have done wonders for sentiment and hence the economy,"" Bajaj told the publication.

Bajaj added that ""mood elevators"" are required to revive consumer demand after a period of ""suppressed demand"" due to the nationwide lockdown.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""I can only comment from the point of view of the motorcycle market. And that view is that the package, however real or otherwise aside, the government's haphazard attempts at unlocking the supply side are taking us nowhere,"" Bajaj said.

Demand across most sectors has taken a hit during the lockdown, since shops and all malls were closed during the period, and only essential items could be sold in the initial days of the lockdown.

Many automobile manufacturers, including Bajaj Auto, reported zero domestic sales in April 2020.

Bajaj called the lockdown harsh and said it should be lifted immediately, permitting free movement of people aged 20 to 60.

""We should have taken the middle path that so many others have between doing nothing, which no country has, and enforcing such a draconian lockdown, which only India has,"" Bajaj said.

Slowdown in retail demand may not trigger downtrading wherein a buyer settles for a lower priced product than earlier decided but will rather look for alternatives within the segment, a top Bajaj Auto official said.

The two-wheeler segment, which is considered to be the most price sensitive of all auto segments, is expected to witness shifting of buyers' preferences for products given the possibilities of salary cuts and job losses in the economy.

However, India’s third largest two-wheeler maker, that has introduced more motorcycles than any other company, believes that the customer will most likely stick to the same segment of his choice but will likely opt for a lower value product.

Rakesh Sharma, executive director, Bajaj Auto, said, “People will move to brands offering specific value. The buyers won’t pay for bells and whistles. I don’t think there will be a case of wholesale downtrading; the phenomena where buyers switch to 150cc over a 100cc. But within the 150cc he will certainly look at value. People will look at those models which do away with the frills.”

A case in point was when there was a significant price hike seen in two-wheelers because of the mandatory fitment of new braking standards - CBS and ABS – seen during FY20. Despite a steep increase in prices of premium bikes there wasn’t a significant shift in buyer’s choices.

“We have seen it in FY20. When the cost in price increase of the CBS against the ABS of Rs 500 and Rs 8000 happened there wasn’t any significant downtrading. The segment share came down but by 60-70bps only. So there was no major downtrading inspite of the fact that the gap between a 125cc and 150cc went up from Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000”, Soumen Ray, chief financial officer, Bajaj Auto.

This is despite the fact that first time buyers made up 56-59 percent of the two-wheeler sales pie for Bajaj Auto last year. The company further expects higher conversion rates following easing of the lockdown restrictions in several parts of the country.

“The casual buyer will reduce and the serious buyer will step out. People won’t visit multiple stores. People will probably do their homework digitally. Therefore levels of enquiries will reduce and there will be a rise in conversion rates”, added Sharma.

Almost 50-60 percent of Bajaj’s dealerships are in the green zone and these are witnessing about 50 percent productivity in sales.

“At an overall level on the basis of very early information we are looking at something like 25 percent business compared to the normal level. Service has climbed to 70-75 percent of the normal level,” added Sharma.

As per popular expectations the spread of COVID-19 will probably force people to ditch public transport and opt for a personal choice of mobility.

This would mean a jump in first time buyers of two-wheelers. However, production will not see a speedy ramp up given the riders stipulated by the local authorities where the manufacturing plants are located.

“We think social distancing related issues around use of public transport will impact the customer behaviour positively towards owing of two-wheelers. We feel that Q2 will probably go in disentanglement in the ways of working. None of these forces can come in to play if the whole flow of business is so severely bottlenecked by one issue of the other like plant opening protocols. But we feel Q3 and Q4 onwards we should see a return and we will be surprised positively compared to what we can imagine today,” added Sharma.",599,-0.10428843327930995

Two-and three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto is expected to report flat to moderately negative profit for quarter ended March 2020 on the back of low sales volumes and weak operating income. Decline in tax rate, growth in other income and healthy exports to provide support to the numbers.

According to brokerage houses, revenue from operations for the quarter could see decline in the range of 12-16 percent as sales volumes fell 17 percent YoY, but realisation may increase in the range of 1-4 percent on price hikes.

Bajaj Auto reported a 34 percent YoY decline in domestic two-wheeler volumes, 28 percent YoY decline in three-wheeler volumes, but that was offset by 15 percent YoY increase in exports.

""Topline is expected to decline by 16 percent YoY. Volumes have dropped by 17 percent due to lockdown on account of COVID-19 and dealer inventory correction ahead of BS-6 transition. Realisations are expected to grow marginally by 2 percent, driven by price hikes,"" Sharekhan said.

Kotak Institutional Equities expect revenues to decline by 12 percent YoY led by decline in volumes and 6 percent increase in average selling price (ASPs) due to price increase taken by the company in select models in Q4FY20.

It is almost as if they are waiting for the PM to reverse their decision.” He called the back-and-forth a “Ping-Pong game”.

He told Barkha Dutt: “Rs 20 lakh crore sounds good. But even those who know these things, no one I know has said ‘wow!’ Seedha-sadha (straight and simple) economics I understand. This seems like a ghoom-phir ka stimulus (roundabout stimulus). Maybe it’s just my ignorance.”

“Companies have zero revenue, they have losses, they have debts, people don’t have jobs and they don’t have salaries. This is acute stuff that has to be dealt with immediately. I don’t think I have heard any announcement in this respect. When somebody says we are going to put out Rs 20 lakh crore I would like to believe that at least some part of it would be real and effective,” Bajaj added.

Bajaj Auto on Monday said it has commenced reopening of dealerships and service centres in various parts of the country following relaxation in guidelines by the government for the third phase of lockdown till May 17.

The reopening began on May 4 with the dealerships taking permission from respective local authorities. All the touch points are following mandated protocols to ensure the safety of customers and dealer staff, Bajaj Auto said in a statement.

Commenting on reopening of dealerships, Bajaj Auto Ltd Executive Director Rakesh Sharma said, ""India is gearing up for the new normal post the COVID-19 pandemic and so are we at Bajaj Auto. The opening of workshops and dealerships is another step towards making a fresh start.""

To ensure safety, speed and efficiency with minimal contact, a new workflow process has been put in place for both sales and service, he added.

All the facilities have been have been sanitised prior to restart of business. There are social distancing protocols in place at all customer facing touch points at dealerships, the company said.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Mandatory thermal screening at the entrance and regular monitoring of employees' health is being done to ensure a completely safe environment at dealerships and service locations, it added.

Sharma said Bajaj Auto had earlier announced extension of free services and warranty for customers.

""We have now also prioritised commencement of workshops to ensure that the vehicle service requirements of all our existing customers are met. Our engineers and workshops are now geared up to ensure that all service requests are met at the earliest to provide a hassle-free commute to our customers,"" he added.",555,0.5499602556228638

Most auto companies, for the first time, reported zero sales in April, due to the nationwide lockdown.

With factories and dealerships shut during the month, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) Mahindra & Mahindra (automotive segment), Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor, Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki reported almost no business.

However, as the government allowed agricultural activities (except in the containment zones), M&M and Escorts sold a few tractors. M&M, TVS Motor, Bajaj Auto and Eicher Motors managed to export some vehicles.

As it announced the third phase of lockdown that began on May 4, the Centre has allowed companies to start operations and dealers to reopen business, with the permission of state governments, in the areas that are coronavirus-free.

In an interaction with brokerage houses, OEMs indicated they were evaluating the possibility of restarting operations and waiting for permissions from state governments. Most of them have inventories of three to eight weeks.

Even after recommencing operations in some plants with a minimum manpower due to social distancing, getting spare parts would be difficult as most auto ancillary plants are in red zones or the coronavirus hot spots.

For instance, Bajaj Auto's two plants, including in one in Pantnagar, are operational. ""30 percent of Bajaj Auto's dealers are located in the green zone and 50 percent are in green/orange zone. Hardly 2-3 percent of its dealerships have reopened for business, and hence, there is near-zero demand for vehicles or spares. Hence, the Pantnagar plant being operational does not help,"" Motilal Oswal said after talking to Bajaj Auto.

M&M told the brokerage that tractor plants have not restarted yet, as the company had enough inventories (for around eight weeks) in the system, even at the plant level. ""Auto plants have started at Nashik, Haridwar and Igatpuri (engines). Chakan plant is yet to start,"" it said.

Hence, given the uncertainty due to COVID-19 crisis, brokerages expect the recovery to take longer time and all companies to see negative growth in FY21 against FY20 but there could be recovery in FY20 on low base of FY21.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has not only put the brakes on the initial signs of recovery seen in 2Ws/PVs but has also brought in uncertainty considering the several unknowns associated with its impact. This potentially deepens the impact of BS6 related price increase on FY21 demand,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Given the lockdown of nearly two months, the economy will likely take time to reach normalcy, say brokerages.

Leading agencies such as CRISIL and the World Bank have slashed India's FY21 economic growth forecast to 1.5-2.8 percent from 4.8-5.2 percent.

""Slower economic growth is likely to impact discretionary purchases such as automobiles and we expect the demand to remain under pressure in the near term. We expect recovery from FY2022 as long-term growth triggers, such as lower vehicle penetration and favourable demographics, are intact,"" Sharekhan said.

Moreover, pent-up demand (automotive volumes have been under pressure for the past six quarters) and pick-up in economic growth (post normalisation) would lead to a recovery from FY2022, it feels.

The Nifty Auto Index has corrected by about 21 percent in the past two months (compared to a correction of 18 percent in the Nifty) after the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown.

Most automotive stocks have also corrected sharply and are trading at 15-45 percent below their historical long-term average multiples.

Given the weak demand going ahead and attractive valuations, brokerages prefer to pick quality names less impacted by COVID-19 and have strong balance-sheet position.

""The demand is expected to remain under pressure in the near term on account of a slowdown in economic growth. Further, dealer support from auto companies may also impact their margins in the near term. Hence, we stay neutral on the automobile sector and prefer a selective approach,"" Sharekhan said.

The brokerage likes companies that are relatively less impacted by COVID-19 such as Balkrishna Industries and M&M (67 percent and 35 percent revenue from agriculture, respectively).

It also prefers companies that have a strong balance sheet and cash position and are leaders in their segments such as Hero MotoCorp, Exide Industries and Mayur Uniquoters.

Motilal Oswal also said valuations appeared attractive across companies but given the uncertain macro environment and threat of a possible prolonged impact of the coronavirus, it preferred stocks offering higher visibility of demand recovery, better competitive positioning, scope of higher operating leverage and strong balance sheet.

Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki are its top largecap picks, among mid-caps, it preferred Endurance Technologies.

Markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday imposed a penalty of Rs 30 lakh on two persons for circulating unpublished price sensitive information pertaining to quarterly results of Bajaj Auto through WhatsApp prior to official announcement by the company. In an order, the regulator levied a fine of Rs 15 lakh each on Neeraj Kumar Agarwal and Shruti Vishal Vora.

Some news reports had referred to the circulation of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) in various private WhatsApp groups about certain companies ahead of their official announcements to the respective stock exchanges.

Against this backdrop, Sebi initiated a preliminary examination in the matter during which search and seizure operation for 26 entities of WhatsApp Group were conducted and about 190 devices, records, among others, were seized.

WhatsApp chats extracted from the seized devices were examined further and while examining the chats, it was found that earnings data and other financial information of around 12 companies were leaked in WhatsApp messages.

Bajaj Auto was one of the firms whose quarterly financial results for the fourth quarter of 2016-17 closely matched with the messages circulated in WhatsApp chats.

Accordingly, the regulator carried out an investigation in the matter of circulation of UPSI through WhatsApp messages with respect to Bajaj Auto to ascertain any possible violation of the PIT (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations during the period April 1, 2017 and May 18, 2017.

It found that Agarwal and Vora being insiders had communicated the UPSI relating to Bajaj Auto Ltd to other person(s) through WhatsApp messages, which is in violation of the provisions of PIT Regulations.

Sebi said that messages about the financial results were circulated prior to the official announcement made by the company.

As per the PIT norms, any person who is in possession of UPSI is regarded as an insider.",309,

""In the month of April, fortunately because we do export, we will see sales of something like 30,000-35,000 number. In May, we are looking at operating at about 50 percent of our capacity across all our plants put together which points to about 200,000 vehicles. Again the majority would be for exports. In June, we are hoping – subject to how things are unlocked – to record something in excess of 250,000 vehicles, which means we are about our two-third capacity. So from this point of view, it is not so bad for us but that is again because half of what we make is exported,"" he added.

Speaking about salary reductions and cost-cutting measures, Bajaj said, “We have already implemented almost all of the cost-cutting measures. It will save us somewhere between Rs 150 crore and Rs 200 crore this year. However, what we have continued to clearly communicate to our people is that there are no plans to cut jobs and we are not going to cut jobs at this stage. We are a large profitable company, thanks to our employees. We are going to do everything we can to keep the company going as well as it can in these times without cutting back on salaries of employees.”

When asked what would be his two key recommendations to the government, he replied, “I would make only one recommendation which is we cannot save ourselves out of this crisis. We have to sail ourselves out of this crisis. If the government cannot reduce goods and services tax (GST), there are other suggestions I had made with respect to the insurance, with respect to the absurd safety norms that were brought in last year. If those things are corrected at the front end and there is some liquidity brought in the NBFCs etc, demand side will be fine.”

On April 20, Bajaj came out to sharply criticize the government’s lockdown strategy and described it as a “solution looking for a problem”.

""Lockdown is not the long term answer to the health crisis. The young and healthy need to go back to work. The lockdown is arbitrary and not an answer to the economic crisis either"".

""I think job losses have already happened. You just have to speak to suppliers and dealers. The government is pretending as if there are no job losses and no salary cuts"", said Bajaj.

Bajaj said the company has started taking major cost reduction measures. ""Our marketing budget used to be Rs 200 crore a quarter, this time it is virtually zero. We have also frozen our capital expenditure almost entirely barring R&D,"" he said. The industry veteran also predicted that investment plans would be on hold for at least one year.

The company recently announced that it would be reducing the salaries of employees for the period of the lockdown. The company had said its employees had volunteered to take pay cuts due to the unprecedented situation.

Bajaj said that the company was not just reviewing employee wages but the entire spectrum of benefits.

""Our HR has worked out a plan to save Rs 150-200 crores annually, which we will implement. We are tightening everything. We need to secure the ship"", he said.

The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has requested the government for relief measures to boost demand and liquidity. The industry body has called for a temporary goods and services tax (GST) reduction and availability of working capital at concessional rates. Bajaj rejected such demands but hoped that the government would act logically and sensibly.

""Please start the front end, the ports for exports and dealership. Then work on smoothening transportation of goods and then work backwards and allow us to start our plants with all due precautions"".

Bajaj confirmed that the company had received permission to restart its Pantnagar plant but said there are difficulties in resuming production.

""Production is an issue in terms of access for employees and supplies and what is the point of producing if dealerships are shut,"" he said.

He added that demand will come rushing back post lockdown as there is pent up demand in the system and there would be greater demand for personal affordable transport due to COVID-19.

“KTM is expecting 30-40 percent higher demand for powered two-wheelers compared to the situation before this crisis. KTM does not want 11,000 two wheelers as they wanted earlier, they now want 16000 KTMs and Husqvarna’s but our plant is shut.”

Bajaj urged governments to scrap rules according to which a dealership or factory could be sealed for three months if an employee is infected with COVID-19.

""This is a draconian move and is preposterous. We will take every precaution and you can inspect premises every day. Do not hang this sword on people. How will people open up,"" he said.

Bajaj Auto, India’s third biggest two-wheeler manufacturer, has proposed a 10 percent pay cut for factory employees if production does not resume on April 21. The proposed cut will be for little over half of April and until the lockdown is lifted on May 3.

“If production resumes from April 21, then there will be no cut. But if no production happens, then we have been told to expect a pay cut of 10 percent, which works to around Rs 2,000-2,500 for factory employees,” said a source at Bajaj Auto.

As per guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on April 15, the government is allowing industries to start operation in rural areas. In addition, manufacturing and other industrial establishment with access control in special economic zones (SEZ) and export oriented units, industrial estates and industrial townships can restart production from April 20.

The maker of Pulsar and KTM bikes, which has had several run-ins with the labour union on issues including wages in the past years, has received the backing of the union this time around. No retrenchment of employees has happened till now and nothing is on cards yet, the source said.

In a reply to a query from Moneycontrol, Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto, said, ""Given the extension of the lockdown till May 3 and continued uncertainty beyond that, particularly related to resumption of industrial and commercial activity, we are looking at all options for reducing costs. As part of this preparation, we are also deliberating a cut in salaries and wages for the lockdown period. Employees, unions and contract staff have been given a heads up.

Bajaj Auto and its Austrian partner KTM have included mopeds in their multi-product line-up that will be made in India and exported to other markets.

These light-weight mopeds will be powered by low power electric motors, with commercial production expected to begin in 2022 from Bajaj's plant in Pune. Electric scooter and electric bicycles are already part of the project.

While the two partners plan to sell these products in India, the timeline is not yet known.

During FY20, the Pierer Mobility Group (earlier called KTM Industries) and Bajaj Auto started a development project for Powered Two Wheeler (PTW) electric vehicles in the power range between 3 and 10 kW.

The platform will support various product variants – scooters, moped and motorized bicycles – under the brand of both the partners, Pierer Mobility said in its annual report.

TVS Motor Company is the only company in India to make mopeds powered by a 100cc engine, selling 50,000-65,000 units on an average every month. These mopeds attract the lower income households or small entrepreneurs and are mostly favoured for their utility purpose.

""As part of the series development project for PTW electric vehicles in the low voltage range (48 volts), which was developed together with Bajaj, various product variants in the segment of electroc scooters will be produced from 2022 under both the brands of both partners,"" said Stefen Pierer, Chairman of the executive board, Pierer Mobility, in an address to shareholders.

The two companies have been in an alliance since 2007 and have continuously expanded the boundaries of their partnership. From joint development and production of performance motorcycles for KTM the alliance now makes products under other brands as well.

The entire production of entry level Husqvarna motorcycles have been moved to Pune by KTM. Bajaj in return will start exporting the electric Chetak to KTM to be sold in Europe.

Besides low power electric vehicles the two companies are working on high-power electric motorcycles as well. KTM has started series production of two electric motorcycles – KTM SX-E 5 and Husqvarna EE 5 – in Europe.

KTM closed 2019 with 7 percent rise in sales at 280,099 comprising 234,449 KTM motorcycles and 45,650 Husqvarna motorcycle. Almost 24 percent (66,206 units) of all KTM units sold last year were manufactured by Bajaj Auto. Production volume at Pune for KTM is expected to increase to over 200,000 units over the next years, KTM declared.

Despite the production and demand disruption caused due to the coronavirus outbreak Pierer Mobility AG has confirmed its sales target of 400,000 motorcycles for the 2022 financial year.

Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

TVS Motor Company, the Chennai-based maker of Apache and Jupiter brand of two-wheelers, has taken the lead in switching over to Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) even as rivals Hero Motocorp and Bajaj Auto continued to produce BS-IV models well into February.

TVS completely shut production of the soon-to-be outdated BS-IV models in January itself while introducing BS-VI upgrades including that of Jupiter, Apache, RR310 and XL (moped). About 60 percent of dispatches in January were of BS-VI kind, TVS informed analysts.

Further, the company claims to have developed two different types of technologies using BS-VI transition that is tuned for either good mileage or race performance.

N. Radhakrishnan, President, CEO & Additional Whole-Time Director, TVS Motor Company, said, “We stopped BS-IV production in January. We have developed two versions of BS-VI fuel injection platform, namely, Ecothrust Fuel Injection (EtFi) and Race-Tuned Fuel Injection (RTFi). EtFi technology provides enhanced overall performing across drivability, smoothness and fuel economy. RTFi technology is designed to enjoy the racing experience or driving conditions.”

TVS, which is India’s fourth largest two-wheeler maker, also said that there will be an improvement of 12-15 percent in fuel efficiency besides a drop of 93 percent in emission in the new BS-VI models compared to the BS-IV models. TVS is holding five weeks of inventory, most of which is BS-VI.

India’s largest two-wheeler maker, Hero Motocorp, was producing BS-IV models until the middle of February. But, it stopped producing BS-IV scooters in December itself, the company informed.

Speaking to analysts Niranjan Kumar Gupta, CFO, Hero MotoCorp, said, “All our models are BS-VI ready. We are geared for the transition. We will be stopping our BS-IV production by middle of February itself and we're completely geared for a smooth transition to the BS VI regime”.

BS-VI variants of Passion Pro, HF, Splendor iSmart, Xtreme 160R, Glamour 125 and Pleasure have been made ready; some of which have been launched in the market too. Most of the BS-VI version retails will commence from March simply because there is a price hike of 12-15 percent in cost of the products compared to BS-IV.

“As far as inventory is concerned, we were down to close to six weeks at the end of December and by January-end, we were down to actually five weeks of our retail. So effectively, inventory is a nonissue. And pretty much we're geared for a transition. In fact, it's a good opportunity for any buyer today to actually pick up the BS-IV because he gets to buy at Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 lower even on a BS-IV or BS-VI price,” added Gupta.

Bajaj Auto, the country’s third biggest two-wheeler manufacturer, is not expecting any surge in discounting on BS-IV stocks as most of it has been replaced by BS-VI variants. The company has been producing BS-IV variants but in limited numbers thanks to a mini surge in demand in the final days of January.

Rakesh Sharma, Chief Commercial Officer & Executive Director - Bajaj Auto, said, “We have consciously managed our stocks of BS IV downwards with the objective of ensuring that we are free of BS IV stock by first week of March. And I think we are on track, particularly if we witness some pre-buying.”

He added that the company had produced some of the BS IV models in February.

""There are pockets (in the market) where we were a little bit overstocked, and there are pockets where we were under-stocked. And we are already stocked out when it comes to BS IV. So we have had to do a little bit of a top-up production of BS IV, but very, very little in first half Feb. And we don't want to stock out situation. That's why we are doing it,” said Sharma.

During the changeover to BS-IV from BS-III in 2017, two-wheeler manufacturers resorted to flash sale and product prices were dropped to half as they became desperate to liquidate stocks. There will be no repeat of this situation, the industry has assured.

“We are very, very clear that we are not pumping in BS-IV (stocks). We do not want to do unnatural things to advance the people by luring them beyond whatever the arbitrage is and putting in more discounts on that. So given that strategy, we are fairly on track,” added Sharma.",728,0.6875967457890511

Bajaj Auto has started delivery of the Bajaj Pulsar 220F to select dealerships ahead of its official launch, according to a report on ZigWheels.

The new 220 is similar to the Pulsar 150 in design. The price hike too is just under Rs 9,000 more than the previous variant.

The price of the bike is Rs 1.16 lakh (ex-showroom, Pune).

Mechanically, the BS-VI 220 gets a fuel injection system, ECU and a catalytic convertor. It will run on the same 220cc single cylinder that makes 20.93 PS of maximum power and 18.55 Nm of peak torque.

This is not the first time the 220 gets a fuel injection setup. The first generation Pulsar 220 was available with the system, but to keep costs low, Bajaj decided to use a carburettor from the second generation onwards.

The official launch of the BS-VI Pulsar 220 is scheduled for the end of this month and it goes up against the likes of the Hero Xtreme 200 and Yamaha Fazer 25 that will also go be updated to the BS-VI norms very soon.",189,

Cosmetically, the bike remains unchanged from the outgoing BS-IV model. It still gets the aggressive styling as on the older models. Mechanically, the too, apart from the injection system, the bike remains the same. It gets the same 149.5cc single cylinder that produces 14 PS of maximum power at 8,500 rpm and 13.25 Nm of torque at 6,500 rpm. These numbers, too, are almost identical to the BS-IV variant but the revs come in a little higher.

The Pulsar 150 is available in two variants, a twin disc version and a single disc version. Both bikes do get single-channel ABS however as is the norm now. The bike is available in two colours – Black Chrome and Black Red.

Commenting on the launch, Sarang Kanade, President – Motorcycles, said, ""The introduction of these models continue the transition of our products to BS6 norms. Bajaj Auto has scaled up the range of BS6 compliant vehicles. You will see this range expand over the next few weeks.

Lagos, the financial hub of Nigeria, recently banned the use of commercial motorcycles and three-wheelers following the rise of fatal accidents in the city.

Nigeria is one of Bajaj Auto's largest export markets, and the news, and a 22 percent decline in January two-wheeler domestic sales in Q3, caused shares to fall on the BSE by over three percent.

The government in Lagos imposed the ban on motorcycles that were running commercially as well as auto rickshaws on February 1. The increased number in vehicles have reportedly added up to four hours to the daily commute in the city. Known as Okadas, commercial two-wheelers have become a popular mode of transport because of their ability to snake through traffic alongside three-wheelers, known as kekes. This has also unfortunately given rise to the number of fatal accidents.

However, Bajaj says that the ban isn't of major concern to the company. In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director of Bajaj Auto said that though Nigeria comprises of about 25 percent of the company's exports, Lagos in itself, contributes to only 6-7 percent of the total exports in two-wheelers, whereas that of three-wheelers is about 10 percent.

Sharma also said that they are not expecting any significant hit to businesses due to the news from Nigeria. ""This kind of thing keeps happening in international business; Bangladesh did it last year. So it’s not a significant event from our perspective, not for Nigeria and not for international business. So I don’t see any reason to be circumspect about the future of Nigeria in our portfolio,"" he said.",275,-0.9594151775042216

Leading two-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto beat Street estimates on January 30 to report nearly 15 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit to Rs 1,262 crore in the December quarter. A CNBC-TV18 poll had estimated the number at Rs 1,191 crore.

The company’s revenue, however, fell short of the estimates, as revenue from operations inched up 3 percent YoY to Rs 7,640 crore against a CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of Rs 7,747 crore. The company reported a revenue of Rs 7,436 in the December quarter of FY19.

EBITDA improved 13 percent YoY to Rs 1,406 crore in December quarter against Rs 1,239 crore in the previous year's same quarter. EBITDA margin climbed to 18.4 percent in Q3FY20 against 16.7 in Q3FY19, the company said in a BSE filing.

Here are highlights of Bajaj Auto's earnings call, collated by Narnolia Financial Advisors:

According to the Bajaj Auto management, the overall demand scenario has not picked up significantly though last week of January saw some uptick in sales, largely due to pre-buying.

Demand will be impacted for a couple of quarters after implementation of BS-VI. The profitability of the BS-VI products will be same as BS-IV. The BS-VI variant of CT100 model is priced 15-18 percent higher than BS-IV models.

The company will move all its products to BS-VI by middle of February. To eliminate cost the company will offer electronic injection technology with BS-VI in the entry segment motorcycles in place of fuel injection. The fuel injection technology is largely used in Pulsar and KTM brands, it said.

Bajaj Auto witnessed strong growth in 125cc segment as compared to 150cc segment. The margin expansion is largely attributed to higher export contribution, product innovation and upgradation, the management said.

On the export front, growth is driven by African markets. Bangladesh is facing some regulatory issues while Sri Lanka and Nepal continue to be in the negative zone.

LATAM has grown by 37 percent YoY in Q3FY20 largely because of low base. On a full year basis, this market also seems flat.

The management said the company has started exporting 3,000-4,000 3-wheelers to Egypt from January. The company created 16 new markets for 3-wheelers.

The 3-wheeler cargo segment recorded a growth of 11 percent YoY as against a decline of 3 percent YoY for the industry and the market share stands at 26 percent.

The 3-wheeler cargo segment will be the biggest beneficiary of BS-VI transition, as most of the smaller 4-wheeler products may go out of the system (sharp price increases).

The company will expand the Chetak portfolio. Currently 17 dealerships are giving test rides across the country. Dealer inventory stands at five weeks.

Bajaj Auto's long serving Chairman Rahul Bajaj will step down from executive role to become a non-executive director while continuing to hold his current position, the company said on Thursday.

Bajaj, who has been a director of the company since April 1, 1970, was last reappointed by the board for a five-year term with effect from April 1, 2015, and his term as executive chairman is expiring on March 31, 2020, the company said in a regulatory filing.

""Due to certain commitments and other pre-occupation, Rahul Bajaj has decided not to continue as a whole-time director of the company after the expiry of his current term on March 31, 2020,"" it added.

Bajaj Auto further said its board of directors in a meeting held on Thursday approved his appointment as non-executive director with the designation continuing as the chairman of the company with effect from April 1, 2020, subject to shareholders' approval.

Since Bajaj has already attained the age of 75, approval of shareholders will be taken by special resolution by way of postal ballot for his appointment as non-executive chairman as required under SEBI regulations, the company added.

After taking charge of the Bajaj Group business in 1965, Rahul Bajaj led the company to its growth path. Under his stewardship Bajaj Auto, the group's flagship company, saw its turnover grow to Rs 12,000 crore from just Rs 7.2 crore with the firm's scooters becoming the mainstay.

He steered the diversified entity during India's transition from a closed economy to a liberalised one and drove the company to expand its product portfolio with the Bajaj brand finding foothold in global markets.

In 2005, Rahul Bajaj started passing the baton of the company to son Rajiv Bajaj, who became the managing director of Bajaj Auto and led the company to become a truly global automobile player.

EBITDA improved 13 percent YoY to Rs 1,406 crore in December quarter against Rs 1,239 crore in the previous year's same quarter while EBITDA margin climbed to 18.4 percent in Q3FY20 against 16.7 in Q3FY19, said the company in a BSE filing.

""For Q3FY20, operating EBITDA margin improved sequentially by 150 bps, from 16.9 percent in Q2FY20 to 18.4 percent in Q3FY20. This improvement was largely driven by a reduction in the cost of material, increase in prices and additional realization from the US dollar to the Indian rupee,"" Tech Mahindra said.

The company's turnover for the quarter stood at Rs 8,006 crore, up 2 percent YoY from Rs 7,849 crore.

As on December 31, 2019, surplus cash and cash equivalents stood at Rs 17,407 crore against Rs 15,986 crore as on September 30, 2019, said the company.

The company claimed it registered highest ever export volumes to the tune of 5,62,772 units, up 7 percent YoY. Overall volume stood at 12,02,486 units.

The company's total domestic volume fell 13 percent YoY to 6,39,714 units in Q3FY20 against 7,35,111 units in Q3FY19.

Two-and-three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto on January 30 is likely to report more than 10 percent year-on-year growth in Q3FY20 profit, driven by operating income, realisation and lower tax cost.

According to brokerages, revenue from operations is expected to see around 5-7 percent growth despite lower sales volumes, led by higher realisation.

""We expect revenue to increase by about 3 percent QoQ (up 7 percent YoY) led by better volume growth and a sequential improvement in average selling price (ASP) due to higher share of 110/125cc motorcycles,"" said Edelweiss which expects 19 percent YoY growth in profit.

According to Reliance Securities (which sees 7 percent growth in revenue and 19 percent in profit YoY), positive impact of healthy exports coupled with favourable exchange rate would boost profitability, while discounts on domestic 2-wheelers may lower the benefit to some extent.

Bajaj Auto reported a 4.6 percent year-on-year degrowth (up 2.5 percent QoQ) in volumes during the quarter ended December 2019, due to 16 percent YoY decline in domestic bike volumes and 13 percent fall in exports of 3 wheelers, but continued to see market share gains. Volumes were better than its peers Hero MotoCorp (down 14.4 percent YoY) and TVS Motor (down 17 percent YoY).

Realisations are likely to grow over 9 percent YoY, but there could be a 2 percent decline on sequential basis.

Motilal Oswal feels realisations are expected to rise 9.4 percent YoY to Rs 64,360 per unit (against Rs 58,812 per unit YoY), but may decline 2 percent QoQ. Prabhudas Lilladher also expects the same.

At operating level, the growth is likely to be driven by lower raw material cost and favourable currency, which may drive margin higher by more than 100bps YoY.

""We expect Bajaj Auto's margin to improve by 132bps YoY (up 34bp QoQ) amid gross margin improvement vis-a-vis last year due to commodity, currency and pricing gains,"" Antique Stock Broking said.

Motilal Oswal sees 12 percent rise in EBITDA and 100bps margin expansion in Q3 YoY while Prabhudas Lilladher said with favorable currency movement and raw material cost to remain benign, it expects margins to inch-up 120bps YoY/ 20bps QoQ and EBITDA to rise 12.4 percent/1.7 percent YoY/QoQ.

Update on pricing and specs for Chetak (e-scooter), and update on upcoming new product launches & BS6 pricing would be key to watch out for.

The Indian market witnessed a sharp surge in January ahead of the big event - Budget 2020 - pushing the S&P BSE Sensex beyond 42,000, and Nifty50 above 12,400 levels.

The expectations, which are powering the rally, are that Budget 2020 will be tilted towards stimulating growth. The measures expected to be rolled out include cut in personal taxes, and a possible cut in long term capital gains tax (LTCG).

The expectation is running high from the upcoming Union Budget to provide stimulus to revive the economy, and lay down the path for India to achieve $5-trillion GDP by 2024.

Most economists and analysts see the government missing out on the fiscal deficit target by at least 50 bps but that is mostly factored in by markets, but anything more than that could be fatal for the sentiment on the Street.

“A 50-60 bps slippage in the fiscal deficit target for FY20 is now the consensus. We believe markets are already building in the same. But anything beyond that is not a great outcome. We believe the market is focussing more on FY21,” Ritu Arora – CEO & CIO, Allianz Investment Management Singapore Pte Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“We hope to see FDI norms being relaxed meaningfully in sectors such as insurance. This will bring in large pools of capital to India as well as help in further developing and deepening the financial sector, which is essential for India to reach its 5 trillion dollar goal by 2025,” she said.

In Union Budget 2020-21, most analysts on D-Street expect the government to continue with its policy push to revive economic growth and demand by focusing on boosting disposable income and that is one of the prime reasons why we are seeing a rally in the small & midcap stocks.

In terms of sectors, the usual beneficiaries include infrastructure, agriculture, rural economy, automobiles, Make-in-India thrust, more on ease of doing business, employment generation thrust could gain focus from the Budget, suggest experts.

Other sectors could be defence, banking, auto, infrastructure and consumption which will be the key sectors to watch out for in Budget 2020.

“Given the expectations that the government would take measures to ease the demand-side concerns, we expect consumption both staple (FMCG) and discretionary (consumer durable goods, automobile, etc.) to hog the limelight for the upcoming Budget 2020,” Pankaj Bobade, Fundamental Research Head, Axis Securities Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Infrastructure creation is expected to be another focus for the government given the need for better infrastructure; hence, infrastructure plays viz., capital goods, cement, metals, pipes and infrastructure companies viz., EPC players, road construction companies etc would also enjoy demand in the near term,” he said.

Investment in railway infrastructure, mass rapid transport is also going to be keenly watched out for in the upcoming budget.

We have collated a list of companies from different brokerage firms that are expected to benefit from Budget proposals:

Sharekhan picked 12 companies, which it thinks will be in focus in the run-up to the Union Budget and have the potential to give good returns in the long term.



Antique Stock Broking:

We expect increased allocation to various rural-centric schemes, along with strong Rabi season may help revive rural demand.

These measures if announced may accelerate earnings largely led by higher volume growth for all consumption linked stocks. Likely key beneficiaries are in Auto (M&M, TVS Motors, Bajaj Auto), consumer durable/electrical (Crompton Consumer, Voltas), Paints and other household linked stocks (Asian Paints), Consumer staples (HUL, Colgate, Dabur) and retail (Avenue Supermarket).

We have projected a 10% growth in FY21 capital expenditure including expenditure over road, highway and railways (in line with our estimate of 10% FY21 nominal GDP) because of the ongoing fiscal constraint.

Likely key beneficiaries are L&T, NTPC, UltraTech Cement, Adani Ports, Siemens, ConCor, Bharat Electronics, Honeywell Automation, Gujarat Gas, Solar Ind., KEC, Timken, APL Apollo, Birla Corp, BEML and KNR Construction.

Angel Broking

In the backdrop of the current slowdown we believe that fiscal slippage is necessary and will go a long way in boosting growth given that India doesn't have a twin balance sheet problem like 2013, said the brokerage firm.

Expert: Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities Ltd.

Investors can look at high dividend-yielding stocks such as ONGC, Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta which might pick up the pace if there is some relief on the personal tax front.

Like the Constitution, the Indian automotive industry also has four pillars:

Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto began as a simple imported two and three-wheeler seller in India. After being established on November 29, 1945 as Bachraj Trading Corporation Private Limited, it introduced its first self-manufactured Product — the Vespa 150 — and kick-started its success story.

Beginning with the Italian manufacturer Vespa, Bajaj has partnered with various foreign manufacturers and has given the Indian market countless classics.

These include the likes of Kawasaki, KTM and the most recent, Triumph. Bajaj has introduced the two-wheeler culture to the roots of Indian society by providing a plethora of scooters and motorcycles.

Currently, Bajaj Auto is the world’s third-largest manufacturer of motorcycles and the second largest in India. It is also the world’s largest three-wheeler manufacturer and dominates the segment in the Indian market as well.

Mahindra & Mahindra

Founded as a steel trading company, Mahindra & Mahindra was established on October 2, 1945 as Mahindra & Muhammed.

It entered the automotive industry by assembling and selling Willys Jeep in India. This cemented Mahindra as a heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer. The company soon diversified into light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and kept expanding thereafter.

Mahindra never shied from experimenting and soon entered the two-wheeler market by taking over Kinetic Motors in India. The company also introduced the REVAi electric car in India, at a time when electric vehicles (EVs) were quite unknown to the market. Currently, Mahindra has a host of rugged SUVs and MPVs on offer, as well as a wide range of commercial vehicles.

The company is also an extensive manufacturer of farm equipment.

Tata Motors

Tata Motors branched out from its parent company in 1945 and began its life as a locomotive manufacturer. In 1954, Tata Group entered the commercial vehicle sector after forming a joint venture with German Daimler-Benz.

This was followed by Tata’s entry in the passenger vehicle segment with the Sierra SUV in 1991. Tata’s Indica was the first fully indigenous Indian passenger car when it was launched in 1998 and became one of the best-selling cars in the history of the Indian automobile industry.

Tata Motors has also partnered with various foreign manufacturers to diversify its line-up. Tata acquired South Korean Daewoo’s truck manufacturing unit in 2004, a 21 percent controlling stake in the Spanish bus and coach manufacturer Hispano Carrocera in 2005, a joint venture with the Brazil-based Marcopolo in 2006 and the Jaguar Land Rover from Ford Motor Company in 2008.

Maruti Suzuki India

Founded by the Government on India in 1981 as Maruti Udyog Limited, Maruti Suzuki India Limited was formed after it was merged with Japanese automobile manufacturer Suzuki in October 1982.

It ventured in the market as an importer of cars and received the right to import 40,000 fully built-up Suzuki in the first two years. The company began in December 1983 and launched the Maruti Van soon after.

After that, the company launched a plethora of vehicles in the passenger and commercial vehicle segment.

In recent times, the company has diversified into multiple segments, launched its premium dealership called NEXA and has launched various peripheral services for the Indian audience like Maruti Insurance, Maruti Finance and Maruti Driving School.

Along with other brands, these four manufacturers have made India the fourth largest automobile market in the world and even helped surpass Germany in terms of sales.",584,0.8711362779140472

The two automakers had announced a non-equity partnership in August 2017.

The bikes produced under the brand will be available from 2022 and will have price starting at less than Rs 2 lakh, Triumph Motorcycles Chief Commercial Officer Paul Stroud said here.

The partnership will build a new engine and vehicle platform in the mid-capacity range (200-800 cc) and offer multiple options to address different segments in this class.

""The triumph brand is an iconic one the world over. So, we are confident that there will be a huge appetite in India and other emerging markets for these new products,"" Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj said.

""The products that will come out of the partnership will also help attract a younger, but still discerning, customer audience and is another step in our ambition to expand globally, particularly in the fast-growing markets of South East Asia but also driving growth in more mature territories like Europe,"" Triumph Motorcycles Chief Executive Officer, Nick Bloor said.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

With just over a week to go for the Union Budget, various industry, corporates and other experts voiced their expectations in their interviews with CNBC-TV18.

Rajiv Bajaj, MD, Bajaj Auto said if the auto industry has to be put back on 15 percent growth track then the government would need to do three simple things.

""First, this mandatory insurance that was brought into play in September 2018, should be rolled back. Second, imposing anti-lock braking system (ABS) on 150 CC or 200 CC scooters or motorcycles was complete overkill and I would urge the government to consider recalibrating this to at least for 250 CC plus two-wheelers. Third, at a time when goods and services tax (GST) for electric vehicles (EVs) has been correctly lowered to 5 percent, we should consider lowering GST for petrol or diesel vehicles from 28 to 18 percent.""

However, if this is not done, then I anticipate around 20 percent plus degrowth from March or April once BS-VI prices come into play, he said.

According to him, we have to do what is doable right now. ""My point for the last several months has been that the industry has been systematically done in by overregulation. This overregulation, whether it is of insurance or of safety norms and now BS-VI, has pushed up the cost of two-wheelers ranging from between 20 percent and 30 percent, depending on whether it is the small or a big vehicle. If you are going to have this kind of cost escalation in a 12-18 month period then it is bound to have an impact on volumes,” he said.

On the rationale behind the demand for removal of mandatory insurance

“We are a big country. People are riding all kinds of two-wheelers, people are living in all kinds of circumstances. If somebody is buying a little vehicle that can do no more than 50 kilometres an hour, and living outside the city, there is no crazy traffic and he doesn’t have to be overly concerned as long as he is wearing a helmet then that choice should be left to him.”

On rural demand growth and whether there signs of recovery

“You will see from the January results of industry – we all talk to each other and we have a feel of where we are headed this month in terms of retail and billing, and I certainly don’t see signs of that. If you look at communications from carmakers, from two-wheeler makers, everybody is only communicating the urgency to pre-buy BS-IV, which tells you that retail is not moving and if you talk to dealers across the auto industry, that is what you will largely hear. Maybe there are some pockets that are doing better but I would not be aware of that.”

On sales

January is slightly better than December which was impacted by a huge pre-buying in October. January-February would be better. ""For sure we are going to continue to see degrowth, manufacturers are also very concerned about the billing of BS-IV etc and how things may pan out because there are two views again. One is that in March, we will have a lot of pre-buying of BS-IV and the other view is that we may not.""

""Our view is that we cannot take the chance and I mean that three years back when we moved from BS-III to BS-IV we had to follow our competition that put out discounts ranging from Rs 7,000 to Rs 25,000. We don’t make that kind of money on most of our motorcycles. So, it is better to produce BS-VI, to let go of BS-IV because if you are left with BS-IV inventory with the dealers then between the dealer and manufacturer, you are going to suffer a lot of pain,” he said.

On the time required to return to double-digit growth

“Most of us will be selling only BS-VI vehicles from sometime in March – from the middle of March or so at least we would not want to carry BS-IV stock beyond the first week of March etc., and we have planned our production accordingly. If that means we are going to lose some share in March because competition will have heavy discounts on BS-IV vehicles and push up their share for the month; we are not playing that game.""

""Having said that, compared to last year – if from April, BS-VI models are going to be 15-20 percent more expensive, definitely we are going to see strong degrowth. Nobody knows if it is going to be 20-25 percent degrowth but it is going to be very significant,” Bajaj said.

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Auto

BAL is likely to outpace 2W industry driven by new launches across segments and is aiming for 24% market share over the next few years as against 19% currently. BAL would be least impacted by transition to BS6 norms given higher share of premium motorcycles (about 40%). Also, higher share of exports (about 45%) which are immune to BS6 would limit impact further. Motorcycle exports are on strong footing driven by market expansion in key geographies and entry into new markets. We expect 7-8% growth in exports to continue. We expect BAL to report mid single digit volume growth in FY21 as against flat volumes expected for the industry. Earnings growth to accelerate to 9% over FY20-22 as against 3% in FY17-19 period. BAL is preferred pick in 2W.

Outlook

We upgrade our recommendation on Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL) to “Buy” from “Hold” earlier with revised PT of Rs 3,575 as we rollover our target multiple on FY2022 earnings.

Strategy setup - Covered Put

Bulls continued having an upper hand in the previous week and Nifty50 registered fresh all-time highs. But the overall structure suggests that some breather is expected and we could go through mild correction in coming days.

Some stocks which have weak technical structure have offered bull back in last few days and now trading near the resistance level.

We have identified Bajaj Auto from the pack. Traders can form a 'covered put' strategy in the counter to gain theta from Put option and can take advantage of the expected fall in form of selling future.

Option chain analysis

Resistance at higher level is clearly visible as per option chain as the immediate facing call option of 3,150 strike price has added fresh open interest addition of 11,500 contracts and cumulative open interest has added to 53,250 contracts.

On the other hand, dry volumes in Put options indicates the low confidence of Put writers and any particular strong base is missing in the counter. 3,100 Put option holds maximum cumulative open interest of 45,500 contracts but change every minute in open interest addition reflecting the reluctance of bulls.

Data suggests that negative bias should be maintained while forming the trading strategy.

Technical structure

After a sharp pullback, the stock has formed a 'dark cloud cover' candlestick pattern and the prices are trading below major medium term moving averages.

The stock has also taken resistance of 20-Day Moving average and higher top and higher bottom cycle has been disturbed.

There is a range shift in RSI from bullish to sideways zone in intraday chart suggesting that the stock is likely to resume the downtrend again. Rs 3,151 is emerging as a strong supply zone for the stock and decline till Rs 3,010 is expected in the days to come.

Strategy – Covered Put (30th January, 2020 Contract)

Looking at the overall market structure and option data, traders can form 'covered Put' strategy where short positions in the futures can be initiated with the short positions in out of the money put options.

Trader can go short in the futures at Rs 3,129.05 and put option of strike price Rs 3,000 can be sell at 14.75.

Profit in the strategy can be booked in Rs 3,020-3,000 zone and stop loss of Rs 3,170 need to be placed.

Sell Future at - Rs 3,129.05

Sell 3000 PE at - Rs 14.75

Maximum Profit - Rs 143.8

Breakeven points – Rs 3,143.8

The model has been largely developed by Bajaj Auto with inputs from KTM. Powered by a 373cc single cylinder engine, the Adventure 390 will be up against the BMW G310 GS and the Royal Enfield Himalayan.

The same engine is also seen on two KTM bikes, Duke 390, RC 390 and the Bajaj Dominar. A smaller engine variant called Adventure 250 will also be launched in due course. This will rival the Hero X Pulse.

Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto said, “There are lot many launches coming up. Besides the deliveries of the Chetak, starting in February, we will also launch Adventure 390 and the two Husqvarna bike in February.”

On January 14, Bajaj Auto launched its first electric product, Chetak, in the market priced at Rs 100,000.

The Pune-based company unveiled two Husqvarna bikes – Vitpilen and Svartpilen – at the India Bike Week in Goa in December last year. These two bikes, which will be made at the Chakan (near Pune) plant will be rolled out next month.

When asked about the outlook for two-wheeler demand, Sharma said it will take at least nine more months for the recovery to begin if there is no boost provided by the government.

“The whole of next fiscal will be a decline despite this year being a low base year. There will be a big dent in demand soon after the implementation of Bharat Stage VI on April 1. The first quarter will be a washout and then monsoons will follow, when generally demand stays low. It is only in the festive season that one can expect some recovery in demand,” Sharma added.

After implementation of BS-VI, prices of two-wheelers are expected to rise by Rs 7,000 to Rs 18,000, the management said, adding that it will commence supplies of BS-VI bikes to its dealers in the coming days.

During the nine months period ended December, Bajaj Auto’s domestic two-wheeler sales fell 13 percent year-on-year to 1.67 million units.

In comparison, the industry recorded a fall of nearly 16 percent to 13.91 million units during the same period, including a 15 percent fall in volumes of motorcycles to 8.95 million units, data supplied by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) revealed.",384,-0.5219893157482147

In my view, the Budget was never a problem in the first place. Business sentiment has been done for the past one-and-a-half years,"" said Bajaj.

Speaking to the media on sidelines of launching the electric Chetak Bajaj, he stated that the upcoming Union Budget won’t fix the issues plaguing the industry unless issues of over regulation is tended to.

Two-wheeler sales have been hit the most due to the slowdown, recording a dip of 14.19 percent to 18.56 million units in 2019 as compared to 21.64 million units in 2018, as per data supplied by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).""There are multiple reasons for it but in my view the single most important reason or something that is responsible for the state of affairs is over regulation. It is over regulation that is killing the industry. All this started in September 2018 in terms of insurance cost where several thousand rupees of increase was imposed on the customer followed by change in safety norms where ABS and CBS that was imposed and now BSVI,"" added Bajaj.The six-fold hike in insurance premium for third party covers hit the two wheeler segment dearly when premium costs jumped 356 percent to Rs 3285 from Rs 720 for budget motorcycles powered by a 100cc engines. Bikes above 150cc but below 350cc have seen premiums jump to Rs 5453. Above 350cc the same has jumped to Rs 13034.

Likewise the mandatory upgradation to new braking system norms – antilock braking system and combined braking system – pushed up the costs further in April 2019.

""So, within a period of less than a year a typical 150cc motorcycle that costs about Rs 70,000, paying another Rs 15,000 is huge. A manufacturer struggles to improve productivity and reduce cost to keep his price increase as close to zero as possible but inevitably he has to pass on 3-4 percent every year. But instead of that it is 20 or 30 percent increase,"" added Bajaj.

The implementation of Bharat Stage VI emission norms from April 1 would shoot up the prices further. Some of Bajaj’s rivals like Hero, Yamaha, Honda and Suzuki have rolled out BSVI compliant vehicles with a price hike of Rs 7,000. Bajaj will start rolling off BSVI vehicles in the next few days.

""It would be politically incorrect to say that BSVi is not the right route but in my view getting rid of old vehicles would have been much more effective than squeezing the last bit of emission from BSIV vehicle. But instead of that we are going to implement BSVI and impose another Rs 8,000-10,000 Increase. Some of the BS VI two wheelers launched are priced Rs 7,000-18,000.

""In a one- and- a- half year, prices of two-wheelers will have gone up by 30 percent. To me this is the hard and tangible issue. Nobody's wallet will grow by 30 percent in 18 months. Now does the government have the humility to reflect and roll back some of this (hike)? Can they be pragmatic and just like on EVs where they have brought down the GST to 5 percent from 12 percent they bring down the GST on internal combustion engine vehicle to 18 percent from 28 percent for a period of time till growth returns?"" added Bajaj.",577,-0.9339609980583191

Brent Crude oil prices have risen by about 10 percent since December and are expected to surpass crucial hurdles around $70/bbl tracking geopolitical concerns.

Crude Oil prices witnessed a steep rise on news of the assassination of a top Iranian general by the US in an airstrike at Baghdad airport which triggered risk-off sentiment in markets and pushed oil prices on the upside.

Experts are of the view that crude oil prices are likely to remain at elevated levels in the next few weeks and we could see Brent Crude surpassing $70/bbl in the short term that would result in high inflation in oil-importing countries like India.

“After easing of tension between the US and China, and output cuts undertaken by OPEC and its allies, crude oil prices were already rallying,” CARE Ratings said in a report.

“Now coupled with the US airstrike, price of Brent has the potential to increase and cross the $70/bbl mark in the coming few days, depending on the retaliation planned by the Iran government and the longevity of the feud is continued by both the countries,” it said.

Any increase in the price of crude oil is always going to be a cause of concern for India considering it imports more than 80 percent of oil requirements.

According to the CARE Rating report, in the current financial year, India has imported 4.5 mb/d (April-November) of crude oil and the import dependency based on consumption which has increased to 84.5 percent compared with it being 83.3 percent a year ago in the same period.

Jateen Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst (Commodity & Currency) at LKP Securities said that the recent tensions between the US and Iraq escalating strongly due to US airstrike killed key Iranian and Iraqi military personnel, raising concerns that escalating Middle East tensions may disrupt oil supplies.

Trivedi is of the view that Brent Crude can rally over $70/bbl and domestic MCX can touch 4,700 in this cross border tension.

Increase in crude oil is likely to impact current account deficit as well as the fiscal deficit, inflation trends, and could possibly increase the production cost of companies that use crude oil as raw material cost.

“OMCs (oil marketing companies), tyre and paint stocks will be impacted most with higher crude prices and may see correction,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

We spoke to various experts and collated a list of stocks that are likely to get impacted the most from a rise in crude oil:

Expert: Rajesh Palviya, Technical and Derivative Research Head, Axis Securities

Oil Exploration companies like ONGC, OIL India would benefit from any rise in crude prices. Other sectors that use crude oil as a raw material would have a negative impact on this surge in crude prices namely automobiles, OMCs, paints, plastics and packaging material.

Stocks that are likely to get impacted the most include Maruti Suzuki India, Bajaj Auto, HPCL, IOC, and Asian Paints.

Expert: Amit Gupta, Co-Founder, TradingBells.

ONGC, OIL India and oil exploration companies might get benefit from a rise in Crude oil prices whereas IT and Pharma companies may outperform if rupee sees further weakness.

Generally, OMCs, paints, aviation and financial stocks remain under pressure due to a surge in crude oil prices.

Expert: Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities.

ONGC and Oil India are likely to benefit the most from a rise in crude prices. Higher crude prices will entail higher price realizations for these players.

The company's overall sales for the month of December stood at 3.36 lakh units compared to 4.03 lakh units in November.

Domestic sales for December were 1.53 lakh units compared to 2.07 lakh units in November. However, month on month exports were flat at 1.82 lakh units compared to 1.95 lakh units in November.

Discussing the outlook going forward, Soumen Ray, chief financial officer of the company, said the pressure on numbers may not continue in coming months. In fact, there is expectation of some pre-buying ahead of BS-VI transition, he said.

""In the month of December, the retail sales have gone back to the trends that were tracking in Q2. However, let us see how Q4 pans out. Hopefully, there would be some buoyancy which would come back towards the later part of Q4,"" he said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

""There has been increase in footfalls in the sales outlets and we think by the time we come towards end of January or beginning of February, this would increase,"" he added.

Exports, he said has been a great story, although December to December it may look a little flat. ""In Q3, we have done the highest ever exports, primarily backed by motorcycles in all three geographies – Africa, Latin America and also in Southeast Asia,"" he said.

The domestic commercial vehicle (CV) growth too is coming back, he said, adding that there was a very strong growth in December, basis which they now have a positive growth in the third quarter versus decline seen in Q1 and Q2.

""So, both export motorcycles and domestic CVs are doing pretty well in December, and overall in the quarter,"" he said.

Although it would be difficult to predict growth, he is of the belief that the trajectory of retail sales per month would increase in January over December and sequentially, in February and March.

""Q4 growth will be a little better primarily driven by the pre-buying that may happen because of BS-VI transition,"" he noted.

With regards to market share, he said: ""We should be in the range of 19-20 percent market share in domestic retail segment.""

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Auto

Lower channel inventory coupled with highest share of exports (45% contribution which is immune to BS6 emission) makes BAL better placed in transitory phase of BS6. BAL also has a relatively higher share of premium bikes (40% contribution) where the price increase due to BS6 norms is relatively less as compared to entry level bikes which further reduces impact. BAL is likely to outpace the industry volume growth given the lower impact of BS 6 transition and healthy growth in exports. We expect mid single digit growth in FY21 for BAL as against flattish volumes for the industry. We introduce FY2022 earnings estimates in this note and rollover our target multiple on average of FY2021 and FY2022 earnings.

Outlook

We upgrade our recommendation on Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL) to “Hold” from “Reduce” with a revised price target of Rs 3,400.

What is making some of the biggest names in India's auto industry go slow on electric vehicles? Probably the lack of infrastructure to charge these electric vehicles?

Not really. Instead, it is the conflict of interest that is making vehicle makers to go slow, believes Rajiv Bajaj, MD of Bajaj Auto.

Vehicle makers who have already spent billions of dollars in developing an ecosystem of dealerships, vehicle service and spare parts sales are reluctant to give it up for a much more economical solution (read: electric vehicles).

Interestingly, at the same time young startups are not only building but launching electric vehicles at a rapid pace.

""The biggest challenge for electric vehicles is the conflict of interest in the minds of vehicle makers who are currently making internal combustion (IC) engine products. What one can see around the world is that large successful organisations which make petrol and diesel vehicles who have enormous resources have been generally very slow in developing EVs. Whereas everyday there is a new start up which is willing to burn cash to do the same,"" said Bajaj at a recent event in Pune.

While Pune-based Bajaj Auto has promised to commercially launch its first all-electric two-wheeler Chetak in January 2020,its rivals including Hero MotoCorp and Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, are yet to formulate product strategies for electric vehicles.

The two Delhi-based companies control 63 percent of domestic two-wheeler sales. Together they have more than 10,000 dealerships, service center and touch points spread across the country.

A dealer clocks a margin of 2.5-3 percent on vehicle sales but for vehicle service the operating margins range between 10-13 percent. Vehicle service is the main profit driver for any dealer. An electric vehicle has around 10-20 moving parts compared to more than 2000 in an IC engine vehicle thereby resulting in greater wear and tear.

""Service and spare parts are huge part of a dealer's revenue. After the introduction of EVs it will become almost unheard of. There will hardly be a need for service or part replacement. This is why there is a reluctance on the part of existing incumbents to move quickly in this direction. Whereas those who are new and have nothing to lose are steadfastly moving in that direction. So these are the two extremes,"" added Bajaj.

Almost every vehicle maker has cited lack of charging stations as one of the main reasons for them going slow on electric vehicle adoption. The other reasons being high vehicle acquisition cost, limited driving range and dearth of battery makers.

Bajaj equated the electric vehicle conundrum with CNG adoption, when it was first introduced in Delhi.

""When CNG was first introduced autorickshaw drivers used to wait for 6 hours in the queue for filing the fuel. But demand for it gradually became so strong that now there is abundance of CNG pumps. Same way infrastructure for EVs will also come up. We should not get caught in the chicken and egg situation because nobody is going to put the infrastructure for anything unless they actually see demand. Once demand is created everything else will fall in place,"" added Bajaj.

Startups such as Ultraviolett Automotive, Evolet, Ather Energy, Emflux, Tork Motors and Yulu Bikes are some of the companies which have either launched electric two-wheelers in the market or are in advanced stages of launching them.",569,-0.5073549598455429

However, nothing concrete took shape on that front even as we are nearing the end of the year.

In an interview with Zee Business, Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto, confirmed that the Husqvarna bikes will be launched in the first week of December.

Of course, there is also the India Bike Week (IBW) that will go on and KTM will have a stall there. Seeing as how KTM owns the Husqvarna brand, we can expect to see the launches taking place at the IBW itself. Sharma also goes on to say that retail sales of the bikes are set to begin as early as January 2020.

Apart from this, Sharma also says that ""high-end bikes at 790 levels"" from KTM will also be launched, so people can expect a 790 Adventure, too. And if the rumour mill turns out to be good, we can also look forward to the launch of the much-awaited KTM 390 Adventure.

As for the Husqvarna bikes, one is the Vitpilen 401 and the other is the Svartpilen 401. Both bikes are based on the 390 and get largely similar mechanicals. So, the same 373.2cc engine that churns out 4 PS of power and 37 Nm of peak torque, and mated to a 6-speed gearbox. Cycle parts too come from the Duke with the same trellis frame, USD front forks and a rear mono-shock. Unlike their international counterparts, the bike will get alloy wheels and tubeless tyres.

However, bikes are designed differently. The Vitpilen 401 is a café racer bike and has low-set clip-on handlebars while the Svartpilen 401 gets a taller handlebar and dual-purpose tyres as a scrambler. Both bikes have been designed keeping retro in mind, so while the silhouette is that of an old-school bike, a proper look will drive home a sense of modernity.

The Husqvarna bikes will be manufactured at Bajaj's Chakan plant and sold through the KTM dealerships in India. in terms of pricing, expect a premium over the KTM 390 Duke.",355,

Shared e-mobility service provider Yulu on November 26 said it has secured $8 million (approximately Rs 57.2 crore) investment from two-wheeler major Bajaj Auto.

As part of the tie-up, Yulu will source electric two-wheelers from Bajaj Auto which have been co-designed and manufactured exclusively for shared micro-mobility, Yulu said in a statement.

Bajaj Auto will also consider facilitating vehicle finance needs of Yulu for a large-scale deployment of its micro-mobility electric vehicles, it added.

“We believe that... congestion reduction and pollution control will drive the segment of shared micro-mobility in the future,"" Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj said.

That, coupled with the expansion of mass rapid transport systems like Metro in large cities, will further boost the demand for flexible last-mile connectivity, he added.

""In Yulu, we find an experienced and committed partner with robust achievement of success metrics in a very short time. And this is why we decided to partner with them in their journey of bringing Yulu service to every neighbourhood of urban India,"" Bajaj said.

The ongoing slowdown may be one of the worst India Inc has experienced in recent decades but it is not the right time yet for the corporate sector to take out the begging bowl, feels Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto.

Speaking to the media on the sidelines of welcoming the Chetak riders into Pune, Bajaj said that it was the excess inventory in the market that became the root cause of the perceived slowdown.

""The auto industry is very big and I feel that at the drop of a hat (if) we take out our begging bowl, it does not suit our stature. So first we have to ask ourselves 'what we have to do better' and then if necessary, we can ask the government for help,"" said Bajaj.

As per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), the passenger vehicles segment (comprising cars, SUV and vans) recorded a fall of 24 percent in April-September period while the two-wheeler segment fell by 16 percent. Commercial vehicles fell by 23 percent during the same period.

SIAM has been advocating for a cut in Goods and Service Tax (GST) rate - to 18 percent from 28 percent - but the GST Council has not given its nod.

""In terms of facts the retail slowdown was only 5-10 percent. The 20-30 percent (fall) was only because of stock reduction being made by the manufacturers for several months. There is no business in the world which is growing all the time. Corrections (do) take place. If you cannot face 10 percent downturn in the business then you should not be in business,"" added Bajaj.

In the hope to see a revival in demand, manufacturers continued to pump in volumes into the showrooms despite early indications by the dealer lobby body of a supply glut. Thus, every manufacturer was forced to shut its factories to contain further build-up of unnecessary stock.

Volumes of car market leader Maruti Suzuki, for instance, was down 27 percent while that of Tata Motors was down by 43 percent during the April-September period. Hero Motocorp sales to dealers was down by 17 percent and that of Honda was down by 19 percent.

Bajaj also made a point about over dependence on one market for growth. As per SIAM data, the automotive industry exported only 17 percent of the total production till September. Bajaj exported 45 percent of its two-wheelers and three-wheelers until September.

""Why should the industry be dependent only on one market? You should be global. At some point in time there will be a slowdown sometime in every market and if you are spread across the world, then the slowdown will not affect you (even) if one or two markets are down,"" he said.",470,-0.9985597899981907

That included Pratap Bose, the head of design at Tata Motors, who called the zero emission scooter a ‘missed opportunity’ for its design.

This, however, has not gone down well with Rajiv Bajaj, the managing director of Bajaj Auto. “Pratap Bose should know that he is talking to the World’s Favourite Indian that sells its 40 percent of the production across the world,"" Bajaj said.

Earlier in 2019, Bajaj Auto moved from its iconic 'Humara Bajaj' identity to 'World’s Favourite Indian'.

""The problems with these things is that a lot of people think about this in engineering terms. The problem with engineers is that they only see the product,” Bajaj said while responding to a question from Moneycontrol.

“The brand comprises of six elements, the product itself, story of the brand and experience. The product is then made of three aspects, design and styling, performance and price. Without understanding this big picture if somebody comments that they have lost the opportunity then good luck to Tata Motors, if he is the representative of the talent they have over there,” added Bajaj.

Bose, responsible for nearly half a dozen designs at Tata Motors like the Tiago, Tigor, Nexon, Harrier and Altroz, likened the design and styling of the Chetak to the Vespa, a brand created by Italian company Piaggio.

On the day of the unveiling of the Chetak on October 16, Bose tweeted, “Very Vespa. Missed opportunity to do something more unique. Wonder what Piaggio will have to say about this”.

Bajaj also attacked the messaging in the advertisements of the Rs 13 lakh SUV Tata Harrier, which play up the fact that it is based on the Land Rover platform.

“They have so much confidence in their design [which is based on] JLR that they tell customers to buy this (product) because it is a poor cousin of the Land Rover,” Bajaj said. “This has also come from Mr. Bose’s design lab.”

Chetak, which was once the best-selling two-wheeler in India, was born out of a technical collaboration of license manufacturing with Italy’s Piaggio.

“Chetak was born around the same time when the relationship between Bajaj and Piaggio came to an end. That was not because the partners wanted that but the government created a situation or policy that led to that. Chetak carried the whole company forward on its shoulders. There was a 10 year waiting on it and it was a matter of pride owning one,” added Bajaj.

It is the product perception that consumers buy and not the product itself, Bajaj further explained. According to him, aChetak has an emotional connect of the past with the buyers. He gave the example of Maruti Suzuki whose compact cars were preferred by buyers over almost all other rivals.

“Do you really believe that small cars from Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford, Renault, Nissan are such poor products that Maruti’s small cars are superior products to them because they sell in high numbers? And if that is the case then why do people prefer buying Toyota, Skoda and Honda the minute they have Rs 7-8 lakh in their pockets? As marketing people we understand that people buy into perceptions not products. If you want a small reliable, fuel-efficient and cheap service it is better to buy a Maruti Suzuki and behind every perception there is a story. The reason Royal Enfield is such a fantastic success is because there is story behind it,” added Bajaj.",592,-0.25527753432591754

Bajaj Auto’s first electric vehicle, Chetak, will also become the product base for scooters from KTM and Husqvarna brands, and these will be manufactured in India.

Bajaj has a decade-old alliance with Austrian off-road bike specialist KTM which in turn owns brand Husqvarna. While KTM bikes are made and sold in India, Husqvarnas will follow suit in a few months.

The two foreign brands will make use of the Chetak platform to spin off their own products. This will be much on the lines of an existing product development, manufacturing and distribution arrangement that Bajaj has with KTM.

Rajiv Bajaj, managing director, Bajaj Auto, said, “Being a global company everything we do is done with a global perspective. Which means we should be able to address all markets around the world. To do that we build platforms which are modular and flexible and can be leveraged by different brands. So one of several strengths we are going to have going forward is that we can use the Chetak platform for KTM and Husqvarna scooters in future.”

All the three scooters will sport brand-dependent characteristics. For instance, the KTM scooter will have racing-oriented appeal while Husqvarna will have a ‘cool and urban image’. The Chetak will be driven by the legacy of the bygone era of 1970s.

“There is a product development underway. So if it has to be KTM it has to be ‘Ready to Race’ if it has to be Husqvarna it has to have the ‘cool image’. If it is from emerging markets it has to be endearing, warm and family image like that of the Chetak. So we will have different brands and models and progressively these will be rolled out,” added Bajaj.

Bajaj will use a common platform to produce the Dominar, KTM RC200, KTM Duke 390, to name a few. Before end of 2019, the Pune-based company will roll out Husqvarna bikes using the same platform. This helps the company to benefit from economies of scale.

The Chetak will be sold through the 500-strong KTM dealership channel managed by Bajaj Auto and not through the regular Bajaj Auto dealership. The battery-powered scooter will be sold in Pune and Bangalore to begin with before being extended to other parts of the country.

As of now, Chetak won't have a fast charge feature as Bajaj wants the battery to last at least 70,000 kms. “Fast charging reduces the battery life by 25-30 percent and we want the Chetak carry on the durability feature like its previous one,” said Eric Vas, head of Urbanite division, Bajaj Auto.

The company provides a three-year and 50,000 km warranty on the Chetak.

The pricing of the Chetak will be announced in January and will be in the bracket of Rs 1-1.5 lakh. Bookings will also open in the same month.",479,0.9997353255748749

In an amendment to the 'Listing and Disclosure Requirement' in May last year, the regulator called for separation of the posts of Chairman and Managing Director (MD)/CEO of listed companies. It said the Chairperson of a company's board should be a non-executive director and not related to the MD/CEO.

The new directive, however, is not applicable in the case of listed companies that do not have any identifiable promoters, as per the report. The top-500 listed companies were given till March 31, 2020 to implement the same.

However, big names in the business world like Rahul Bajaj and Venu Srinivasan have expressed their disapproval, saying that Western concepts should not be imported into the Indian system, as a joint family system distinguishes it from Western businesses.

The article quotes Rahul Bajaj, Chairman of Bajaj Auto, as saying that he opposes the SEBI directive in the Indian business scenario as even the top 200 private companies here have over 90 percent identified owners managing or controlling them. His son, Rajiv, is the MD of Bajaj Auto.

Chairman and MD of TVS Motors Venu Srinivasan told the paper that families in in Asia in general and India in particular have significant holding in companies and are committed to create wealth. ""So, simply importing Western concepts into the Indian system does not seem like a very good idea,"" he stated.

Even industry associations like Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) have called the move a 'needless reform at the wrong time', seeking a review ahead of the March 2020 deadline for the rule.

The CII has even pointed out that the Companies Act, 2013 also ultimately leaves the decision to the shareholders of the company.",315,

October has been a good month for Bajaj Auto that saw it clock its highest-ever retail sales.

""We have highest ever retail sales of all businesses in history of Bajaj Auto during October 2019. We have seen 28 percent growth over festive season YoY,"" Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto, told CNBC-TV18.

The company saw its best commercial vehicle (CV) retail sales during the month and inventory was in a manageable zone and the opening stock was the lowest in last 20 months. ""Last resort of discounting bet was a very poor way to fight this time,"" he said.

The two-and-three-wheeler maker sold 4.63 lakh units in October 2019, 9 percent lower YoY due to weak domestic business, but was ahead of Nomura expectations of 4.36 lakh units. Month-on-month, total sales increased 15.2 percent due to demand during the festival season and higher discounts.

Domestic sales declined 13 percent year-on-year to 2.78 lakh units, while exports fell 1 percent to 1.84 lakh units, the company said in a BSE filing.

Motorcycle sales in October 2019 stood at 3.99 lakh units, 8 percent lower YoY, and 3-wheeler sales dropped 13 percent to 64,295 units compared to October 2018.

""We are happy that half of sales was driven by new motorcycles launched in the last six months, and brought down inventory,"" Sharma said.

Considering the strong performance, Bajaj Auto should have also moved market share a bit, though it was a bit early to talk about it, he said.

""Given the feedback from all branches and competition, we have outpaced the industry growth by 15 percentage points, though we don't know the exact numbers,"" Sharma said.

He said after the festival season, sales tend to fall, but the company would see similar kind numbers in November.

""What the festive season has done is that the negative growth of 15 percent and 16 percent seen earlier seems to have absolutely bottomed out, now we have to navigate through turbulent change and need to observe consumer behaviour during BS-VI transition,"" Sharma said.

Overall business mix was positive in October, though within the motorcycle segment, there was little bit of relative decline in performance of over 150cc bikes due to the impact of ABS cost increase.",381,0.16485477487246195

Two-and-three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto said it sold 4.63 lakh units in October 2019, 9 percent fewer than in it did in the same period last year, due to slower domestic business. It had sold 5.06 lakh units in October 2018.

The October numbers, however, beat estimates. Japanese brokerage Nomura's expectations was of 4.36 lakh units.

The renewed buying interest for vehicles during Diwali has lifted sentiment in the auto space. This may help passenger vehicle sales see marginal growth in October.

However, this growth may not reflect in two-wheeler and commercial vehicle segments.

According to Japanese brokerage Nomura, passenger vehicles could see around 3 percent growth as festive season retail sales increased by mid-single-digit and wholesales should benefit from the festive season being bunched up in October 2019.

""Substantial increase in discounts and aggression by public sector banks toward auto loans has boosted Diwali sales. Inventories post the festivities are less than 30 days. However, given the possibility of moderation in discounts by OEMs, dealers are not yet clear about the sustainability of this recovery,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Maruti Suzuki, the country's largest car manufacturer, may report 15.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in sales at 1.7 lakh units in October due to strong retail sales in the festive season and leaner inventory than competitors, Nomura said, adding Mahindra & Mahindra's utility vehicle segment may post 15 percent decline in sales YoY.

Tata Motors is also likely to show double-digit fall in sales YoY during the month due to focus on inventory correction.

In the case of the two-wheeler segment, the slowdown is likely bottoming out, but the industry sales may fall in double-digit YoY in October.

""The segment witnessed a sharp pick-up in demand this Diwali, particularly motorcycles in the entry/executive segment. This has resulted in inventory correcting back to below 30 days. Royal Enfield also saw a good spurt in demand, however, low inventory (around 3 weeks) has resulted in a stock-out situation in many key markets,"" said Motilal Oswal.

Hero MotoCorp's retail sales may decline 17 percent and Bajaj Auto 25 percent YoY fall while Eicher Motors' Royal Enfield sales could increase 7 percent YoY, according to Nomura.

On wholesales front, Motilal Oswal expects Bajaj Auto wholesales to decline around 10 percent (around 18 percent fall for domestic 2-wheeler volumes), while TVS Motor volumes are estimated to dip around 6 percent YoY. ""Hero MotoCorp wholesales are estimated to slip around 9 percent and Royal Enfield dispatches should decline around 5 percent YoY,"" it said.

Medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) sales volume decline is likely to be steep at 49 percent YoY due to weak demand and inventory clearance.

Nomura said, ""Our industry interactions lead us to believe that retail sales have been higher than wholesale volumes and inventory stands at around a month.""

""There were no signs of recovery in the CV segment. However, continued production cuts by OEMs over the last few quarters have led to inventory correction (of around 30-35 days). We expect CV wholesales for both Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland to decline around 37 percent YoY (around 49 percent decline for M&HCVs),"" Motilal Oswal said.

Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors are likely to show around 41 percent decline each in sales each during October, according to Nomura.

The recovery in auto space already reflected in stock prices as the Nifty Auto index rallied 20 percent since August 23 when the government started announcing several measures to boost the economy.

""Given this outperformance and current valuations, sustained demand recovery would be the key to further stock performance hereon. Our preference remains for PVs over CVs/2Ws as the segment is (a) expected) to be least impacted by the BS6 transition, and (b) likely to face less risk of EVs as well as competition, in turn reflecting better earnings growth,"" said Motilal Oswal.

Its top picks in autos are Maruti, Tata Motors and Motherson Sumi among large caps and Ashok Leyland and Endurance among midcaps.

Mukul Kochhar, Co-Head Equities, Investec Capital Services, prefers two-wheeler players like Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company compared to Maruti Suzuki India. ""While a cyclical bounce in volumes should be similar, we have more comfort on valuations and the competitive positioning of the leading two-wheeler manufacturers than Maruti,"" he stated.

Kochhar is bullish on companies from the financials, retail, white goods, and cement space and select auto and commodity stocks.

Edited excerpts:



Q: What are your views on consumption and automobile companies that have seen some value buying coming due to the festive cheer?A: Auto companies were beaten down and part of the rally is mere normalisation after a couple of years of poor performance. However, we have been fairly selective in this rally and are backing two-wheeler players like Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor compared to Maruti Suzuki India.

While a cyclical bounce in volumes should be similar, we have more comfort on valuations and the competitive positioning of the leading two-wheeler manufacturers than Maruti.

FMCG companies are interesting -- they are expensive, but been extremely resilient in their volume growth performance despite the ongoing economic slowdown.

So, the growth model has proven to be one of the most robust in the country, and the stock performance this year is reflective of that. However, this is more of a relative play, than a sector that can deliver absolute returns from here.

Q: There are plenty of headwinds for Indian markets in terms of Brexit delay or trade war between the US and China. What are your views?A: Brexit and US-China trade war are the two primary near-term issues that the global economy is grappling with. The economic cycle, especially in the US, being long in the tooth -- it has become the longest expansion in history -- is not helping either.

These factors are underpinning some caution in the market. Having said that, global monetary policy is increasingly accommodative, which makes earnings yield from stocks still attractive.

In a low rate environment, growth remains at a premium, which is the reason why you have seen a stronger performance from franchise growth compared to value stocks this year.

Q: The Nifty is up about 10 percent from last Diwali. It has been a roller coaster ride for investors in the last one year. Can we say that testing times for investors are over at least for now or will the pain last for some more quarters?

A: Volatility in the Indian equity market has been reflective largely of the pain in the non-banking financial services space, which has impacted credit availability in the economy.

A market-driven solution to the problem will take time to resolve, and is currently the favoured position of this government. As a base case, we expect volatility to remain for the next few months as the market figures out solutions.

Since late last year we have maintained that the market remains investible as the current dislocation is providing enough winners to bet on.

If we take out 11 stocks from the Nifty, the market is trading below its 10-year average, implying that over-valuation is hardly a secular theme in India.

Q: Which sectors can investors track for the next one-year?A: Financials still remain a very attractive sector to track and invest in at current levels. The discretionary consumption space like retail, white goods and select autos is another space that we find very attractive. We also like the consolidation process ongoing in cement and select commodity stocks.

Q: What advice would you like to share with our readers with respect to portfolio management for Samvat 2076?

A: Accept that equity investment is risky and allocate only an amount that you can afford to take losses on. Once you have mentally set aside this amount, one can be more dispassionate in investing. Then, remember that every market dislocation produces winners, embrace volatility and invest in those winners.

Q: Largecaps had a good run in Samvat 2075, do you think that Samvat 2076 could belong to the small & midcap space?A: It is tough to time any investment, but valuation is in favour of investing in midcaps. While it may take longer than expected to make returns, investing at today’s prices in some of these beaten-down midcaps can be a profitable strategy.

Q: Most high debt companies were also wealth destroyers from last Diwali. Where do you see the next pain emerging from in terms of sectors?A: Excessive leverage is almost always the leading cause of substantial permanent value destruction in any sector. Some of the leverage issues have not been resolved yet, and we would still stay away from investing in highly indebted companies. It is unlikely that most of these will make any meaningful comeback as they get into a debt trap.

Shares of Bajaj Auto gained more than a percent intraday on October 24 after global brokerage houses raised target price on the stock as second quarter earnings beat analyst expectations.

The stock has gained more than 25 percent in the last three months amid hope of recovery in volume growth in the festival season and steps taken by the government. It was quoting at Rs 3,175.00, up Rs 13.65, or 0.43 percent, on the BSE at 1032 hours.

The two and three-wheeler maker reported a 22 percent decline year-on-year in profit at Rs 1,402 crore despite lower tax expenses. Revenue slipped 4.1 percent YoY to Rs 7,707 crore, while operating profit declined 9.6 percent and margin contracted 100bps YoY (but sequentially up 120bps). These numbers were impacted by lower volumes amid subdued demand, but were higher than analyst expectations.

As a result, global brokerage houses raised their price target while maintaining a bearish stance on the stock.

Maintaining underperform call on Bajaj Auto, Macquarie raised its target to Rs 2,700 from Rs 2,200 per share, as operating profit margin improved QoQ despite lower sales volumes.

The brokerage raised its FY20-22 EPS estimates by 8-10 percent to factor in lower tax rate.

The company expects festival season sales to be flat YoY, but things have improved in last one month and margins increased due to price hike and better USD realisations, Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director of Bajaj Auto, said in an interview to CNBC-TV18. The situation was volatile, he said, reserving comments on guidance.

The company was still sitting on 60 days of inventory, but situation was under control, though Q2 was a difficult quarter for domestic motorcycle industry, he said.

Realisations increased 6 percent sequentially to Rs 65,871 per unit in Q2 against Rs 62,187 per unit in June quarter.

CLSA also retained its sell rating as the stock at 18x FY21 estimated PE is expensive. It, however, revised target price upward to Rs 2,800 from Rs 2,525 per share as it raised FY20-22 EPS estimates by 2-3 percent factoring in higher margins.

Exports were moderating as there were more regulatory headwinds coming in for two-wheeler industry, the brokerage said.

Citi also maintained its sell call on the stock, but raised target to Rs 2,350 from Rs 2,100 per share, as Q2 was buoyed by gross margins expansion.

""Margin expansion & benign commodity costs reflected in current valuations, but volume recovery is still uncertain,"" the brokerage said, adding margin may decline in Q3 if there was heavy discounting.

Citi raised its EBITDA estimates over FY20-22 by 3-4 percent.

Highlights:

- Double-digit decline in volume; motorcycles hurt

- Better realisation arrested fall in top line and operating margin

- Near-term business outlook weak, positive for long term

- Accumulate in a staggered manner --------------------------------------------------

Bajaj Auto (CMP: Rs 3,198, Mcap: Rs 91,939 crore) unveiled its September quarterly results in line with expectations amid weak demand. What was surprising is the higher single-digit growth in realisation, which arrested the fall in both top line and operating margin. Operating margin shrank owing to negative operating leverage.

We continue to like the business on the back of its strategy of increasing market share, new product launches and reasonable valuations (15.9 times FY21 projected earnings).

The September quarter in numbers

High points

Volume – weak demandTwo-wheeler demand in domestic market has been lacklustre for long now, which is visible in Bajaj Auto’s volume numbers for the segment. The segment witnessed a significant decline of 24.8 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. The company had 20 percent retail market share by the end of Q2 FY20.

The domestic three-wheeler (3W) segment also witnessed volumes shrinking in the domestic market, primarily because of the large base of the previous year.

In export markets, 3W dropped 19.3 percent whereas motorcycles grew 6.7 percent.

Decline in the overall volume pulled down top line by 4.1 percent. What helped is the 9.4 percent growth in realisation led by a rich product mix. Negative operating leverage hurt operating margin. It reported an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin of 16.6 percent, down 99.6 bps YoY.

Outlook

Domestic industry – Challenges to persistThe domestic two-wheeler industry has been facing myriad challenges leading to lacklustre demand. Factors such as liquidity crunch, higher compulsory long-term insurance prices and slow economic activity have all dampened two-wheeler demand in India.

The outlook continues to be bleak, with no pick-up in demand. The management expects some improvement during the festive season. In the three-wheeler market, it expects to surpass volumes in FY19 driven by a focus on increasing market share.

Export markets - StableThe management indicated that the international market outlook is stable with fast growth in Africa and Asia, but muted growth in Latin America. It indicated that emerging markets are showing 2-3 percent growth in the two-wheeler segment.

Market share improvementThe company’s current strategy to gain market share by aggressive pricing in the entry-level segment is working well. This has led to expansion in its market share to 20 percent from 18.3 percent at the end of Q1 FY20.

New products – Key growth driverThe management has highlighted that the next leg of growth will come from new variants of the existing products or fresh ones. Bajaj plans to launch six new models or upgrades in FY20.

Operating margin on an upward trajectoryEBITDA margin has come off from around 20 percent levels achieved in the past few quarters owing to price cuts in the entry level bike segment. The management, however, indicated that the margin has bottomed out. This is evident from the Q2 FY20 results as margin read 16.6 percent, up from 15.8 percent in Q1 FY20.

Reasonable valuationThe company is trading at 15.9 times FY21 projected earnings. We advise investors to accumulate this company, given the strong growth potential.

Bajaj Auto, the country’s third largest two-wheeler maker, has lined up a series of launches after the onset of Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) next year, including introduction of an all-new brand.

KTM-owned Husqvarna models will debut only after April 1, 2020, strapped with BS-VI engines. It was originally planned for launch around Diwali. Similarly, high-end KTM models, a new Dominar and Pulsar models are on the anvil, a senior company executive confirmed.

With the exception of a couple of launches until FY20-end, there will be no other launches by Bajaj Auto.

“We have a robust pipeline of launches for the next 18 months. Our problem is sequencing. These are Husqvarna, high-end KTMs, Dominars, Pulsar and other variants. One might see a lull between now and April, though there are couple of introductions, and an accelerated product introduction after April, 2020,” Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto, told analysts in a recent conference call.

Bajaj Auto will start switching to BS-VI emission norms from the current BS-IV from November, with the commencement of production of a BS-VI models. The management does not want to make BS-VI models compete with heavily discounted BS-IV models at present.

“The launches will accelerate post BS-VI because we don’t want to handicap an absolutely new product with BS-VI cost while competing with BS-IV players,” Sharma added.

Husqvarna is a Swedish dirt bike brand to be powered by a common engine and will be based on a common vehicle platform developed by Bajaj Auto and KTM engineers. The platform and engines are also used by bikes of Bajaj Auto and KTM. The first Husqvarnas to debut in India are expected to be the Vitpilen 401 and Svartpilen 401.

“We will start production of Husqvarnas by 2019-end, starting with exports. By first quarter of next year, we will be launching certain models in India,” Sharma stated.

Market shareNew launches are expected to boost Bajaj Auto’s market share next year in the domestic market. The company claimed to have a retail market share of 20 percent by September-end. This came on the back of 25 percent decline in motorcycles during the September quarter.

“In recent times, our market share has stabilised. One of the reasons for that is when the industry is declining in high double-digits, there is hardly any room to manoeuvre. We will see a consistent improvement in market share month-on-month,” Sharma added.",406,0.928761675953865

Bajaj Auto reported a healthy 21.7 percent year-on-year growth in Q2 FY20 profit, largely driven by the corporate tax rate cut.

Net profit during the quarter under review increased to Rs 1,402.4 crore from Rs 1,152.5 crore in same period last year. Tax expense fell sharply to Rs 206.5 crore from Rs 500.2 crore in the same period YoY.

Revenue from operations declined 4.1 percent to Rs 7,707.3 crore, with a 12 percent YoY drop in volumes.

Bajaj Auto sold 11.73 lakh units in quarter-ended September against 13.39 lakh units sold in same period last year.

""Q2 was a difficult quarter for the domestic motorcycle industry. In retail terms, the decline was 14 percent (in billing terms, the decline was 21 percent) as against Q2 FY19. Performance was in line with the industry. Retail market share stood around 20 percent,"" the two-wheeler maker said in a BSE filing.

In the commercial vehicle segment, the auto major continued to maintain its dominance with a market share of 59.4 percent at the end of September. It sold 1.07 lakh units during Q2.

At the operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) declined 9.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,278 crore, with margin contraction of 100 bps YoY at 16.6 percent.

Overall earnings were ahead of analysts' estimates. According to an analyst poll conducted by CNBC-TV18, profit was estimated at Rs 1,189 crore on revenue of Rs 7,481 crore. EBITDA was expected at Rs 1,171 crore, with margin at 15.6 percent.

The stock rallied three percent to hit more than a 20-month high of Rs 3,217.10 after better-than-expected earnings. It was quoting at Rs 3,188.40, up Rs 65.10, or 2.08 percent, on the BSE at 1333 hours IST.

During Q2, the company's other income grew by 26.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 393.4 crore in Q2.

The management said its international business now contributes 41 percent to net sales. The division recorded sales of over 5.44 lakh units in the September quarter.

Surplus cash and cash equivalents stood at Rs 15,986 crore at the end of Q2 after payment of dividend and tax thereon of Rs 2,072 crore, it said. Surplus cash stood at Rs 17,126 crore at the end of the June quarter.",382,0.33332529332902694

Two-and-three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto is expected to report a marginal increase in its profit for the September quarter due to a cut in the corporate tax rate, but the rest of the earnings parameters could show negative growth due to subdued sales volume growth.

Profit growth for the quarter is likely to be in the range of 3-8 percent compared to year-ago as the government slashed corporate tax rate by 10 percent in September.

According to brokerages, revenue in the quarter that ended on September 2019 may decline more than 8 percent year-on-year (YoY) as volumes declined 12.4 percent to 11.74 lakh units YoY.

The company reported a 25 percent YoY decline in the volumes of its domestic bikes, a 4 percent fall in the domestic three-wheeler market and a 19 percent YoY decline in the three-wheeler export market, but all this was offset by the 7 percent YoY increase in the volumes of the two-wheeler exports.

""We expect a revenue contraction of around 8.4 percent YoY led by a similar volume decline,"" Edelweiss said.

But higher realisation, which could be in the range of 4-5 percent growth YoY, may support its topline for the quarter. Bajaj Auto has taken a price increase in select models.

At operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) may decline more than 10 percent YoY with a contraction in margins.

""We expect EBITDA margin to decline by 90 bps on a YoY basis in Q2FY20 largely led by negative operating leverage and increase in discounting in the economy motorcycle segment,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities, which expects EBITDA decline of 10 percent YoY.

The stock gained nearly 14 percent year-to-date, outperforming the Nifty50 (up over 7 percent) as well as Auto index (down more than 13 percent).

Key issues to watch out for would be an update on the two-wheeler demand outlook from urban and rural areas; price increase in domestic markets across segments; export demand outlook and pricing in key currency market; comments on the three-wheeler demand momentum in domestic market and updates on its electric vehicle strategy.",357,-0.5441218217213949

Prices of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds will see an increase in November as manufacturers look to release Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) variants into the market.

Two-wheelers strapped with BS-VI compliant engines are expected to see a 10-15 percent price rise, translating in a minimum increase of around Rs 4,000 on a 100cc bike costing Rs 40,000 (ex-showroom Mumbai). More expensive models will see a higher increase.

While the official date of switching to BS-VI mandated by the Supreme Court is April 1, 2020, manufacturers have to ensure that they get rid of all BS-IV grade stocks by March 31, 2020.

Some manufacturers like Honda and TVS Motor Company have begun production of a few BS-VI models, while others like Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp will follow suit shortly.

KN Radhakrishnan, President & CEO, TVS Motor Company, said, “We have already started (production of) some models with BS-VI engines. Billing will start next month. Post-Diwali, we want to release BS-VI products into the market.""

TVS, which sells 19 two-wheelers models including variants, has not revealed any details of the quantum of the hike expected on its products, stating that it will be known closer to the launches. “Price and cost management will be known closer to the rollout of the stocks. By early November we will start producing BS-VI vehicles. By last quarter of this fiscal, it will be completely BS-VI supplies, so that actively remove BS-IV stocks. With respect to stocks, we want to maintain the same at five weeks,” he added.

Speaking to mediapersons after unveiling the electric Chetak, Bajaj Auto's Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj said the process of switching to BS-VI production will happen from November and will continue till the last quarter of FY20. ""If a GST cut in envisaged, then it would be opportune for the industry to implement it during the switchover to BS-VI to negate the price hike,"" he stated.

“From next month, we will start with the process of changeover (to BS-VI), it will go right up to February or so. When we are making three million vehicles (domestic), they cannot be converted in to (BS-VI in) two or three weeks. As each variant goes to market, we will have to raise prices as BS-VI technology is expensive. That is why we have made a pitch from the beginning that reduction in GST should be considered in conjunction with BS-VI implementation as the auto industry is already facing some pretty strong headwinds. If we have to pass on all of the BS-VI cost to the customer, I am very sure this will have a very detrimental effect on demand,” he explained.

In September, Honda became the first two-wheeler company in India to launch a BS-VI compliant product in the form of the Activa 125. The model, which was already Honda’s most expensive scooter on sale in India, is 10-14 percent more expensive than the BS-IV version.

India’s largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp showcased the Splendor iSmart 110 motorcycle with a BS-VI engine a few months ago. However, the company is yet to commercially launch it.

Despite a reduction in production by all manufacturers in recent months, inventory with dealers continue to remain high. As against the normal 35-40 days, the two-wheeler segment has been running an inventory of 60-65 days. “Two-wheeler inventory, despite factoring in the coming festive season demand, continues to be remain high and is a big cause for concern,” said a statement from the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association.",589,-0.061756864190101624

As a ritual, almost every shareholder who gathers at the annual general meeting at Bajaj Auto’s Akurdi headquarters in Pune makes a plea to the senior management to reconsider its renunciation of scooters.

After all, it was the understated scooter that laid the foundation for Bajaj Auto for over two decades. The company gave it all up later in pursuit of becoming a specialist in motorcycles.

Chairman Rahul Bajaj, who turned 80 this year, has been an open critic of his son Rajiv’s policies towards scooters. The younger Bajaj considered scooters to be a hindrance to the company’s goals of becoming the biggest global manufacturer of motorcycles.

“I feel bad, I feel hurt,” the octogenarian entrepreneur told PTI in an interview in 2009, two years after Bajaj Auto rolled out the last scooter Kristal from its production lines. Since then, the company has been producing only motorcycles with engine capacity 100cc to 790cc.

At the peak of their dominance in recent years, scooters commanded 33 percent of the Indian two-wheeler market, having grown from just 15 percent five years ago. In FY18, growth in scooters outpaced motorcycles, bringing further flak to Rajiv.

Of the total two-wheeler sales of 21.18 million units in FY19, scooters made up nearly a third at 6.7 million units. Japanese heavyweight Honda controls 55 percent of the scooter market, followed by TVS Motor Company with a 19 percent share. Despite its massive retail reach, Hero MotoCorp has just 10 percent share in scooters.

While shareholders and analysts tracking the company criticised Rajiv’s long-term strategy, which overlooked the growth opportunities in scooters, he has been busy furnishing explainers at every AGM and press meets.

“No company can compete successfully in every segment. May be it sounds defensive to you, but let me give you two examples. Yes, it is true that Hero participates in scooters, but do you know that in a segment which sells five lakh motorcycles a month, including sports motorcycles and exports, Hero does not have much of a presence there. TVS participates in scooters but completely misses out on the middle motorcycle market, which is worth seven lakh motorcycles a month. Now, both these markets are equal to if not bigger than the scooter market,” said Rajiv at the 2018 AGM.

Rajiv even went on to promise shareholders that when Eicher Motors-owned Royal Enfield forays into scooters, Bajaj Auto would follow it. “Siddharth Lal (MD of Eicher Motors) earned 29 percent EBIDTA margin, perhaps even more because he does not make scooters,” he stated.

However, the company's AGM in August missed out this crucial tradition. Not one shareholder made the scooter plea to the management, and coincidentally this anomaly happened in the very year that Bajaj Auto unveiled a scooter.

The company showcased a battery-powered Chetak on October 16, announcing its re-entry into the scooter space after about two years of development. The fully electric premium two-wheeler will go on sale in January. Rajiv will closely track the responses for the e-Chetak (to be launched only in Pune and Bengaluru initially) before making further strides in this segment.

Since Bajaj Auto is chasing a differentiated and premium positioning for the electric venture, close on the lines of Tesla, future products from the company could be in the premium range. A good illustration is the company’s joint work with KTM, where both companies are working on electric motorcycles. For now, the younger Bajaj has held his cards close to his chest.

Why scooters?With the launch of an electric scooter, critics would argue that Bajaj Auto once again did a strategy U-turn (the earlier one being its return to the 100cc motorcycle segment). Rajiv though defended the move.

“Getting into electric is inevitable, but it is also a niche segment just like three-wheelers and quadricycles. I want to make the product irresistible, which will force people to buy even if they don’t really need it,” said Rajiv at the Chetak launch.

For the company having an electric scooter is safer than having an electric motorcycle. This is because a performance-focused bike could disrupt Bajaj Auto’s petrol-powered bike range. But an e-scooter will only bring in incremental volumes as there is no chance of cannibalisation.

“We felt the obvious choice for an electric foray would be the scooter as it was a no-conflict situation. With more EVs I sell, I will lose volumes in some other segment. Our specialisation in motorcycles very neatly sidestepped conflict,"" said Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto.

Upcoming years could see the debut of several electric vehicles from Bajaj Auto, but the management resolutely promises no slowdown in the pace on new fossil fuel-powered bikes either. Petrol-powered motorcycles under four distinct brands -- Bajaj, KTM, Husqvarna, Triumph -- will make their way to showrooms, most of which will be designed, developed and manufactured by Bajaj Auto in India.

The 2018 Bajaj Auto AGM brought out the colour and legacy of the Bajaj group.

“Some of my colleagues told me that maybe he (Rahul Bajaj) will retire if I make a scooter,” Rajiv told shareholders. “It is such a special occasion that we can’t make just another stupid 100cc scooter. I think we should make a Rolls-Royce on two wheels, an outstanding scooter which does not exist anywhere in the world.”

He then asked the shareholders two questions.

Rajiv: “Should we make such an outstanding scooter?”

Shareholders: “Yes”’

Rajiv: “And if we make such a scooter, should my father retire?”

Shareholders: “No”

Rajiv: “I knew that.”",924,0.33794095686503817

Bajaj Auto announced on October 16 that it would be making a comeback into the scooter segment with an electric scooter designed along the lines of the original Chetak. The company exited the segment over two decades back, pulling out its last scooter from the market.

Bajaj said that, although motorcycles would remain the company's core, with niches like quadricycles and 3-wheelers in the market, the Chetak electric scooter would be priced attractively.

He added that the biggest hurdle for electric mobility, in his opinion, were the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). They are more reluctant to enter the electric vehicle (EV) market than they should be.

""We are the first large, established OEM that has taken the plunge into the electric vehicle market,"" Bajaj said.

Bajaj Auto, the country's third largest two-wheeler maker, has slashed prices by as much as Rs 6,000 on its range of motorcycles as part of the upcoming festival offers.

The Pune-based company is also offering five free services and five years warranty to buyers. The offer which is valid till October 8 also includes zero processing fees.

The offer is valid on the CT110, the entry model for Bajaj Auto, Platina, Pulsar 150, Pulsar 220F, Dominar 400 and the full range of Avenger, V and Discover.

While the CT110 carries a total consumer benefit of Rs 3,200 including cash discount, the Dominar carries a total benefit offer of Rs 7,200. Pulsar 150, one of the best-selling bikes for Bajaj has an offer for Rs 4,200 while the Pulsar 220 has an offer for Rs 5,000.

The company has not specified on which model the price has been slashed by Rs 6,000.

The announcements come in the wake of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman slashing corporate tax rate cuts on September 20. Bajaj Auto, expected to save around Rs 120 crore every quarter because of the tax cut, however, did not state if the discount offers were a result of the government's decision.

Piaggio's offer

Italian bike brand Piaggio has announced offers on Vespa and Aprilia range of two-wheelers. Aimed at the festive season, customers can avail the offer till October and earn benefits worth Rs 10,000 on both the brands.

The company is also offering five-year warranty and insurance on 125cc Vespa and Aprilia models for 150cc worth Rs 4,000.

The Aprilia is sold under models such as SR 125, SR 150 and SR 150 Race while brand Vespa is sold under SXL125, SXL150, VXL 125, VXL150 and Elegante models.

Rajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, in an interview with CNBC-TV18, shared his views on the government's latest attempt to stimulate the economy.

“This has been extremely positive. As much as everyone else has also said, this is outstanding for the long-term and that was always my contention that whatever is done should be done for long-term competitiveness and to make strong companies even stronger. So with this kind of a windfall, the ability of a company like Bajaj to invest in technology for the future, electric vehicles (EVs), in particular, is bolstered. You will see in a matter of weeks the impact of that,” he said.

""I have no argument with the math that RC Bhargava (chairman of Maruti Suzuki) or Pawan Goenka (managing director of Mahindra and Mahindra) have presented. That is absolutely perfect but there is another way to look at it.

""Bajaj has put out very aggressive festive offer and in one stroke, the FM has reimbursed to us all the money that we are putting out both in terms of a consumer offer and also the media spend that is behind it. So if you look at it that way, it is not insignificant. Let me finish by saying that we had already planned to do this and the tax rate will not take care of anything that EBITDA dilutive.

""So as a prudent company, we have budgeted ourselves keeping an eye on our EBITDA but ultimately, your ability to pay out dividends or your ability to invest in the future depends on what you make after tax. So if the FM has taken care of your entire marketing budget for the quarter, I don't think that is small,"" he added.

“This translates into Rs 460-470 crore for the year. so simplistically if you divide it between four quarters, that is about Rs 115-120 crore and I would only say that this kind of a gain in a quarter is not very different from what we are going to have to spend or would like to spend in this festive both invest in the consumer offer as also in the media spend behind that.

""September is better than August, which was bit of a surprise because I didn’t see any obvious reason for the uptick. It is marginal so far but keep in mind also that we are now still in the so-called inauspicious Pitrupaksh period. So from this point of view, it is promising. I believe RC Bhargava said something similar.

""In terms of the festive season itself — all of which is captured in the month of October — we are at a monthly rate of about 2 lakh or just under 2 lakh motorcycles a month in the domestic market. In the interest of stirring growth and more importantly and specifically in the interest of liquidating the dealer stock and being prepared for BS-VI, our aim was to try and double that to about 400,000 vehicles. There is good reason to believe that this will happen now because general sentiment is up,"" he said.

This has come as a big surprise given the slowdown that the automakers are already reeling under. There are talks of a goods and services tax (GST) rate cut, but it's unlikely to be announced in the September 20 meeting.

Rationale behind the move

The company's MD Bajaj shared his rationale behind the price hike in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

""In our portfolio of domestic motorcycles, about half our portfolio in volume terms is this sports segment and about half of it is in the commuter segment. In the sports segment, we have not only been the leader but in the last 15 months, we have extended our leadership, gained a lot of market share. Fundamentally because we have had 8 very effective product introductions, four in the Pulsar brand, one in the Avenger, one in the Dominar and we have two new KTMs out there,"" he said.

""What has happened is each of these has served to increase our leadership share even further and I think depending on the month we are talking about, our share of this sports segment is now between 35 percent and 40 percent. This has affected all our competitors from Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) and TVS Motor Company to Yamaha and particularly Royal Enfield,"" Bajaj said.

""So in this segment, across SKUs, our price increase has been only a modest 1 percent. I would have liked to have more with the exception of just two SKUs for good reason, one is the Pulsar 150 Neon which was so far the cheapest Pulsar and the second has been on the Dominar 400 where we had a massive upgrade of the product in both in engine and suspension terms. So we put that cost out there in the market space as well,"" he added.

""As far as the commuter segment is concerned, where we are a strong number 2, we have not changed any prices but on one SKU of the recently introduced CT 110 which represents only 5 percent by volume of our commuter portfolio. There we are not in a position to dictate pricing power and there we have not been able to increase. So it is quite a non-event. I don’t know why there is so much excitement around this subject,"" said Bajaj.

On the demand for GST rate cut on automobiles

""Given that retail sales for the industry whether two-wheeler or cars seem to be down year-on-year (YoY) by no more than 5-7 percent barring one-two companies, which have issues of their own, I don’t think this qualifies as a crisis and I don’t see any reason why a government – if I were in their position – would respond with something as drastic as a 5-10 percent goods and services tax (GST) loss for this purpose. I would go further to say that they should clearly signal that this is not on the cards, this is not going to happen. We hear from the channel that some customers are waiting in anticipation that something may happen on September 20th or soon thereafter, I think that is not helping at all,"" said Bajaj.

Increase in price of the Dominar and the Pulsar Neon

""Both on the Dominar where it is about Rs 10,000 on the base of Rs 1,80,000 and on the Pulsar Neon about Rs 4,000 on an ex-showroom price of Rs 70,000. We are very well placed in those segments and there is very good reason. As the old adage goes, you must have the courage to change what you can, the humility to accept what you cannot and the wisdom to know the difference. I think our price increase has been very wise,"" he said.

""One percent price increase is really a non-event and if it is 5 percent because there is a new product out there or a new regulatory requirement has driven the adoption of ABS technology in the case of the Pulsar then I think consumers understand that,"" Bajaj added.

In terms of discounts, Bajaj said, ""I expect from Hero a mother of all schemes to start very soon towards the end of this month because unless they liquidate over a million BS-IV vehicles, they are going to have trouble with BS-VI just around the corner. So I think the industry will be shaken up by a huge promotion by the market leader and in anticipation we have to be ready for that.""

“Key stock market Death Cross have occurred over the history of the stock market. There are 6-8 such past instances recorded for Nifty50 and Nifty500 since 2003. On March 23, 2008; March 4, 2011; October 20, 2015 these Death Crosses occurred on the eve of the most spectacular market crashes in history,” he said.

Considered a bearish signal, stock market Death Cross can usher in waves and waves of fear and this often can trigger a selloff but we have seen that 50 percent of the times markets did not fall meaningfully,” Deepak Jasani, Head Retail Research, HDFC Securities told Moneycontrol.

A Death Cross is considered a bearish signal and traders are advised to stay cautious in the aforementioned stocks as the trend seems to be on the downside. But, it can also be viewed as an opportunity for long term investors, who can pick stocks with strong fundamentals that are currently in the rut due to recent headwinds.

Since touching its all-time high of 12,103 in June 2019, Nifty has lost more than 10 percent due to factors such as the fear of economic slowdown and mounting geopolitical concerns. The most recent pummel can be attributed to sudden rise in crude oil prices, which shot up tremendously in the wake of drone attacks on Saudi oilfields on September 14.

Typically, the most common moving averages used by technical experts in this pattern are the 50-day and 200-day moving averages.

In technical terms, the Death Cross is a technical chart pattern which points towards a potential for a major selloff in the stock or index. It is formed when the short-term moving average crosses below its long-term moving average.

The Nifty50 turned negative for 2019 on September 17. But the situation only seems to be getting worse as more than 60 percent of the constituent companies registered the formation of a ‘Death Cross’ on the daily candlestick charts, indicating the potential for a major selloff.

The relevance of the Death Cross reduces due to the fact that it is a laggard signal. It comes at a time when most of the other parameters are also suggesting a similar trend.But, it does act as a confirmation signal for most traders and validates the bearish trend seen in the stocks. At this juncture, without any second thought, larger part of the market slipped into bearish phase since January 2018 correction.“The current Death Cross formed when 50-day moving average below its 200 days is only pointing out that long term trend is in a bear grip. This indicator is a laggard shall not be construed as a fresh sell signal on charts as many of the momentum oscillators on intermediate time frame are already in sell mode as stocks already witnessed deep correction and hence basket selling should be avoided,” Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.

“Best basket selling opportunity may arise once Nifty decisively breaches August 2018 lows of 10637 as that may set in enough panic in the market facilitating bigger sell-off,” he said.

Is there a shorting opportunity?

The stocks which have registered a Death Cross on daily charts suggest that the trend is bearish but it does not necessarily mean a shorting opportunity, experts suggest. However, it could turn out to be good opportunity for long term investors, they added.

History suggests that the Death Cross regularly produce false signals. Therefore, a Death Cross should always be confirmed with other signals and indicators before putting on a trade.

“This signal may not fail if it breaches the recent low (low prior to forming the signal). The average correction expected due to Death Cross is 10-12 percent (index) and in stocks 15-18 percent (largecap) 20-25 percent mid & smallcap,” said Jasani.

“The probability of fall in Nifty increases when the recent low is taken out. Hence traders must wait for high probability set up to create fresh shorts,” he said.

Jasani further added that the latest low in Nifty is 10,637 and the index is currently trading at 10,817 as of Tuesday's closing. Any move below this level (10,637) could lead to further correction in markets which could result in a shorting opportunity.

Other signals to use:

Now that we know that this a laggard indicator, traders should add a couple of more indicators such as RSI or relative strength index or ADX while punching a buy or a sell order.

When the Death Cross if formed we might probably be somewhere in the middle of a bearish trend. Since this lag is huge it may be followed by some consolidation but the overall indication is that trend is negative for now, suggest experts.

“Apart from Death Cross traders could use many other indicators such as Relative Strength Index which shows the strength in prices if they are sustaining above some long term moving average. A reading above 50 shows bullish bias while above 60 shows strong strength in prices,” Mustafa Nadeem, CEO Epic Research told Moneycontrol.

“But, post a death cross signal, this can help identify oversold opportunities. ADX is another indicator that shows the strength in trend. One should also observe that Death Cross may be happening on a daily scale and it has a lot of noise. So one should also look at Weekly or Monthly Scale,” he said.

Jasani of HDFC Securities recommends Bollinger Bands which will also help to identify the volatility cycle, so that traders can avoid shorting during excessive volatile times or after an extended down move.

“Two classic price pattern has been witnessed in the past before any major trend reversal to up i.e. double bottom and Inverted head and shoulder. Double bottom (March 2009, January 2012, March 2016 and Oct 2018); Inverted Head & shoulder (Sep 2009, in progress since July 2019),” he said.

Motorcycle specialist Bajaj Auto and Austrian off-road bike manufacturer KTM are taking their 12 year-old partnership to the next level. Bajaj will not only increase stake in the European unit, but may also launch electric cycles, a first in its storied history. Plans are also afoot to launch a range of performance electric two-wheelers by 2022.

Both companies are working on a high-end electric motorcycle project, which is independent of the electric scooter that Bajaj has developed and will launched in FY20.

All these battery-powered two-wheelers will be produced at Bajaj's Pune-based factory.

“In June, KTM Industries and Bajaj Auto decided to launch a development project series for powered two-wheeler electric vehicles in the performance range three and 10 kW (48 V) at the KTM AG level. The platform will support various product variants -- powered two-wheelers and electric bicycles -- under both partners' brands,” KTM Industries AG said in a presentation.

One of India’s best-selling modern electric scooters is the Ather 450, which is powered by a 5.4 kW motor and priced at Rs 1.28 lakh.

With a consistent push by the government for switching to 100 percent electric mobility in future, India is witnessing dozens of experiments by established companies and start-ups in electric two and three-wheelers. A US-based start-up Fuell is launching an Rs 2.6 lakh electric bicycle in India with a range of 200 km.

“Production of the series will begin by 2022 at Bajaj’s production location in Pune. The required (product) development budget is covered in the medium term planning. This will represent a significant step in strengthening its cooperation with Bajaj,” KTM added.

To further strengthen their alliance, Bajaj has agreed to buy shares in the parent company of KTM, which is getting renamed shortly. It already holds nearly 48 percent stake through an overseas subsidiary in KTM AG, the owner of KTM and Husqvarna brands.

Bajaj will buy equity shares in KTM Industries AG, which is the parent company of KTM AG.

“The Bajaj Group has further strengthened its commitment to the KTM Industries-Group and the board of Bajaj Auto has approved acquisition of one percent stake in KTM Industries AG, which will be known as Pierer Mobility AG, held by Pierer Industrie AG,” KTM added.

At present, KTM has only one electric model -- Freeride E-XC -- on sale. It was launched in October 2017 in Europe but is not available in India. Priced at 7,500 euro (equivalent to around Rs 6 lakh), the motorcycle is suited for off-roading. KTM is also developing a 4 kW off-road motorcycle called Freeride Light that will be launched next year.

Under the Husqvarna brand, KTM launched an electric bicycle in early 2019 priced in the 3,400-4,200 euro range (equivalent to around Rs 2.67-3.3 lakh).

A stand-up scooter (without a seat) is under development and will be launched in 2020-21. In the same period, a full electric power scooter will also be launched.",497,0.7897455841302872

Just three years after its launch, the fate of Bajaj Auto's V series of motorcycles, which was built using metal from the famed India naval aircraft carrier Vikrant, hangs in balance.

While sales of V12 (a 125cc version) stopped in May last year, the original model -- V15 (150cc engine) -- has seen no sales from April till July.

From clocking average monthly sales of 16,500 units in the first year of launch (2016), the V15 saw a gradual decline to 7,300 units per month in 2017. It further slumped to 2,400 units in 2018.

The V12, meanwhile, clocked average monthly sales of 4,600 units in 2017 before slumping to just 270 units in 2018.

The poor performance by both models has given rise to speculations that the V brand will go the Discover way.

The Pune-based manufacturer of motorcycles and three-wheelers had at one time more than 12 models under the Discover brand itself before the company was forced to phase out all but two models following poor retail offtake.

Bajaj, however, has decided against phasing out V15 for the time being though no production of the bike has happened this year.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director Bajaj Auto, said, “The V’s performance is disappointing. It caught the fancy (of the buyers). It is appealing to a very small segment of buyers. We did have the option of expanding the V range, but later we decided against that option. But we are not withdrawing it from the market, we are leaving it out there.”

Bajaj Auto is pushing for volumes at the budget end of the market where it has models like the Platina, CT100 and the Pulsar 125. The Pulsar underwent its biggest shift in product strategy after a 125cc variant was launched recently. This is the first time that such a small engine has been strapped on the Pulsar, which has always been known for bigger engines such as 200c and 220cc.

“Because there are bigger fish to fry we are not backing it (V) up with a large marketing expenditure that new brands need. One would be very unkind to say that V is not doing well at all. It is disappointing and it is doing very small volumes. At this point in time, we would like to leave it there and those people who like that format and style will continue to service them,"" Sharma added.

Launched in early 2016 the V was heavily promoted because of the metal Bajaj Auto was using to build the bike. India’s first aircraft carrier and the most celebrated warship Vikrant, which played a pivotal role in the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, made its way to the Bajaj V15.

The retro-looking stylish V15 even sported a special logo to commemorate the aircraft carrier that was formerly HMS Hercules before being inducted into the Indian Navy in 1961. Bajaj Auto had purchased the Vikrant metal and processed it to produce the fuel tank of the V model.",508,-0.9932937962668282

The automobile industry must look at its own shortcomings before asking for stimulus from the government, said Rajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto.

""Most of the automobile slowdown is the industry's own making,"" he said in an interview with CNBC-TV18 on August 22.

Bajaj said that Indian auto products are mediocre and the sector needs to ask itself if it's done enough to become globally competitive.

""Lot of these companies are not able to export because frankly, by world-class standards, their products are mediocre. Obviously, I don't want to name them but when you make everything… when you will make scooters, and bikes and cars and jeeps and SUVs and trucks and buses and everything under the sun, you are obviously not going to be world-class at anything,"" he said.

Talking about the two-wheeler segment, he said the retails sales in the space declined 5-7 percent. This drop, according to him, cannot be called a crisis.

""In terms of motorcycles, I was looking at these numbers yesterday, year on year, the decline in retail sales is only around 5-7 percent... if that can be called a crisis then what is it we mean by the normal up and down cycle of a business?"" he asked.

The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on August 19 released the July 2019 vehicle registration data, which showed that on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, the overall sales declined 6 percent.

Two-wheeler sales dipped by 5 percent, passenger vehicles (PV) by 11 percent and commercial vehicles (CV) by 14 percent, showed the data.

Bajaj, however, acknowledged that it is a difficult time for the sector and said that the government should not make it worse by raising registration fees.

Further, Bajaj said that the focus was on now ensuring that retail sales are as good as wholesale. ""We will use the festive season to completely correct stock at the dealership level,"" he added.

It replaces the erstwhile Pulsar 135 LS and is equipped with class-leading features.

Bajaj Auto has equipped the Pulsar 125 Neon with a 125cc DTS-I engine which makes 12 PS of maximum power and 11 Nm of peak torque. This gives it a considerable headstart in its segment. The engine is mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox, with a primary kick. This enables the rider to start the bike in any gear by depressing the clutch. It also has a counter-balancer as a class-leading feature, which reduces the engine vibrations even at its top speed.

The Pulsar 125 Neon is decked with Neon accents to appeal to a younger audience. It comes with colour co-ordinated Pulsar logo and grabrail, 3D variant logo on the rear cowl and neon coloured streak on black alloys to complete the look on the motorcycle.

The Pulsar 125 is suspended by telescopic forks in the front and twin gas-charged shock absorbers in the rear. It has 80/100 section tire in the front and 100/90 at the back. Drum brakes on both the wheels are offered as standard although a disc brake at the front can be opted for.

Bajaj is offering the Pulsar 125 Neon in three colours: Neon Blue (on Matte Black body), Solar Red and Platinum Silver. Mr Sarang Kanade, the President of Bajaj Auto said, “We are excited to bring out the Pulsar in the 125cc variant. The new Pulsar 125 Neon will open up a new segment targeting the premium commuters who have always wanted to buy a sporty motorcycle with outstanding performance, style, and thrill at an amazing price point.”

The Pulsar 125 Neon is available at a price of Rs 64,000 (ex-showroom) for the drum brake version and Rs 66,618 for disc brake version across all Bajaj Auto dealerships in India.",327,0.9951558709144592

The global investment bank has said that markets could be nearing a bottom.

“We are getting to a bottom in share prices, as our valuation and sentiment indicators suggest, but risks remain on the horizon for the real economy and a slowing global economy,” Morgan Stanley said in a report.

The risk-to-reward ratio favours buying equities, but a V-shaped recovery in stocks depends on the actions of policymakers, says the August 6 report. Investors with a bit of patience will likely be rewarded well in the next 12 months.

The S&P BSE Sensex has fallen around 9 percent from its record high of 40,312.07 touched in early June. The market has continued to head south, weighed down by budget proposal of higher tax on the super rich, selling by foreign investors, slowdown in growth and escalating trade war between the US and China.

Despite the selloff, Morgan Stanley maintains its base-case scenario of 45,000 on the Sensex by June 2020, and a bull-case of 50,000. Its bear case possibility sees the Sensex at 35,000 by June 2020.

“Indian equities look attractive in a relative context amid subdued oil prices, global trade tensions and better relative valuations in what is a low-return world,” says the note.

It, however, says policy action is still needed to protect India’s relative performance, which has sunk since the budget was presented on July 5.

From a portfolio perspective, Morgan Stanley likes financials, consumer discretionary and industrials, both large-and midcaps.

Policymakers could turn to measures such as strategic divestments of public-sector companies, recapitalisation of public-sector banks, trade deal with the US and other countries, rationalisation of GST rates, a new Direct Tax Code, infrastructure spending and fiscal prudence, and a moratorium on higher taxation for FPI trusts, Morgan Stanley says.

Highlights: - The government took a tough stance after firms didn’t meet the deadline for submitting plans to transition to electric

- NITI Aayog had asked two- and three-wheeler makers to prepare a plan for next five years to make transition to EVs

-------------------------------------------------

Two- and three-wheeler makers in India may be asked by the government to pay up for causing vehicular pollution if they do not meet a deadline to produce electric vehicles (EVs).

The hardening of stance comes after the manufacturers not only failed to adhere to the two-week government deadline to submit their plans to convert a part of their internal combustion engine (ICE)-driven two-wheelers and all three-wheelers into electric, but also sought four months instead.

Federal policy think tank NITI Aayog, which is spearheading the government’s EV initiatives, and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, among others, have been considering a policy proposal to ban all ICE-driven two-wheelers under 150cc by 2025, and three-wheelers by 2023. Nearly 80 percent of all vehicles sold in India are two- and three-wheelers.

At a meeting held on June 21, NITI Aayog had asked executives of two- and three-wheeler makers to prepare a plan of action for the next five years to make the transition to EVs, and submit it within a fortnight.

In case the companies fail to meet the deadline, the government plans to impose the “polluter pays” principle—wherein the victim of pollution has to be compensated and the manufacturer also pays for the cost of environment degradation, said a senior government official on condition of anonymity. The Centre is also not averse to further tightening the fuel efficiency norms for transportation fuels such as petrol and diesel, added the official.

“There is no question of reconsidering the decision. While some manufacturers have finally come around to the idea, there are others who are trying to lobby at different political levels to delay the inevitable,” said another senior government official, requesting anonymity.

India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, has taken several steps in the past few months in its push to combat widespread pollution in its major cities. The government also aims to trim its hefty fuel import bill through the shift to electric vehicles.

Last month’s meeting at NITI Aayog was attended by executives of top two- and three-wheeler makers, including Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj, TVS Motor Co Chairman Venu Srinivasan, and Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers Director General Vishnu Mathur. Even as the companies protested the suggestion, NITI Aayog asked them to spell out their respective plans in two weeks. These companies are yet to respond.

“They were supposed to get back to us in two weeks. Now they (automobile companies) have sought four months’ time... Three wheeler-makers such as Mahindra & Mahindra are ready (to switch to electric mobility). It is only the two-wheeler makers — Bajaj Auto and TVS — that are not ready and are opposing,” said the government official cited earlier.

Queries emailed to the spokesperson of M&M on July 29 remained unanswered. Bajaj Auto and TVS declined to comment. NITI Aayog did not respond to an email sent on July 30.

At the June 21 meeting, NITI Aayog cautioned automakers that if they didn’t take steps to reduce pollution by shifting to EVs, then the courts would eventually step in.

“If the two-wheeler makers are not ready for this transition, they will be left behind as the startups (working on electric mobility) will definitely take the lead,” the official said.

The Narendra Modi government is making an aggressive push for a cleaner and cost-effective mode of transport.

As part of the strategy, India is putting the final shape on a plan to build at least four Tesla-style giga factories to manufacture batteries with an investment of around $4 billion, as reported by Mint on July 25. The plan to set up these factories of 10 gigawatt hours each to accomplish what Tesla has done at its Gigafactory in Nevada, US, also involves a nearly $1 billion concessional loan facility to be drawn from multilateral lenders such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Investment Bank, New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

To be sure, EVs have an almost negligible presence in India’s auto market, billed to become the world’s third largest by 2025.

“As electric vehicles represent the next generation in sustainable mobility, India must emphasize on them. Currently, the market share of electric cars is only 0.06 percent when compared to two percent in China and 39 percent in Norway,” according to the Economic Survey 2019.

The government has been trying to incentivise the adoption of EVs through several steps in the past few months, similar to those taken by governments in China and Europe. On July 27, the Goods & Services Tax Council headed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman reduced tax on EVs and chargers to five percent from 12 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Besides, in the Union Budget earlier in July, Sitharaman announced tax rebates of up to Rs 1.5 lakh to customers on interest paid on loans to buy EVs, with a total exemption benefit of Rs 2.5 lakh over the entire loan period. She also announced customs duty exemption on lithium-ion cells, which will help lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries in India, as they are not produced locally.

As part of the strategy to encourage private sector investment in the strategically important sector, the government is also looking at a raft of tax incentives for manufacturers and a suitable basic customs duty safeguard from 2021 to 2030 for making advanced chemistry cells and battery in India.

In March, the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles or FAME II scheme — to expand commercial vehicle fleet — was also announced with an outlay of Rs 10,000 crore.",974,0.16500920057296753

HDFC Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

Financials: Realizations increased 2% YoY despite the lower share of 3Ws, with ABS/CBS across the bike portfolio (avg. Rs 4k/vehicle). EBITDA margin at 15.4% fell 110bps QoQ as S&D grew. Management believes margins are bottoming out. We are baking ~15.5% over FY20-21E as BJAUT’s aggression in entry level bikes runs into lower commodity prices. New launches in exec segment to drive market share: BJAUT will launch a 125cc bike in 2QFY20 (ahead of the festive season). After the entry level launches of FY19, this holds potential to gain market share in the exec segment. Well-equipped for BSVI: Bajaj has been supplying BSVI compliant bikes in KTM’s global markets. We think a technically smooth BSVI transition in India is feasible. Exports: The outlook for export markets is mixed. Our estimates factor 2% volume growth in 2W exports and 5% decline in 3W exports in FY20E. 3W exports will be impacted by new license plate norms in Egypt. Electric vehicles: Management will display an electric 2W by year end. While Bajaj is preparing for EVs, they are unsure about the adoption of these products due to infrastructure constraints (relating to charging). Products will be launched as the market gradually expands in size.

Outlook

Bajaj’s 1QFY20 PAT (Rs 11.3bn, +1% YoY) was inline. After gaining market share in FY19, we expect further gains from Bajaj in FY20, driven by new launches. The OEM is well equipped for BSVI given existing supplies to KTM. Further, its diversified product portfolio (3W/exports are ~50% of volumes) provides cushion against volatility in domestic 2Ws. Re-iterate BUY, with a TP of Rs 3,000 (based on 10-year avg P/E of 17.5x on FY21E EPS).

Dolat Capital's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s (BJAUT) 1QFY20 EBITDA was ` 12bn (-6.5% YoY) and margins was 15.4% (-182 bps YoY/-27bps QoQ), broadly in line with our estimates. The management expects 2W industry volume to remain subdued in the near-term, due to challenging macro conditions, we however expect BJAUT to outperform the industry’s growth rate. We maintain our positive stance, given its 1) wide product portfolio and diversified geographical mix, 2) continued boost of distribution network, and 3) strong cash balance (22% of current market cap). However, margin recovery is unlikely in the medium term, given its aggressive market share aspirations and the related high regulation-led cost pressures. We lower our EPS estimates by 5/7% for FY20/21E, factoring in weak 3W volume and cost pressure. We expect 8% EPS CAGR over FY19-21E, primarily led by 8% growth in revenue (+4% volume, 4% in ASP).

Outlook

We recommend Accumulate rating, with a SOTP-based TP of ` 2,950 (16x FY21E core EPS + cash + 40% discount for the KTM stake).

Auto sector, reeling from slowdown in sales amid liquidity crisis, regulatory & policy changes and pollution norms , is staring at more trouble with the government proposing a hike in registration fees on old and new vehicles.

Nifty Auto index fell more than 2.6 percent intraday against around half a percent fall in Nifty50, as Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor Company, Ashok Leyland, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors etc corrected 2-6 percent intraday.

""There's a structural shift away from auto stocks and I don't think pain in auto stocks is going away anytime soon,"" Samir Arora of Helios Capital, who has shorted a few auto stocks recently, said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

In a draft notification on July 24, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) proposed to increase vehicle registration fees. The government also plans to change motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years to spur adoption of electrical vehicles.

The main objectives of the policy are to boost sales of electric vehicles and provide an enabling mechanism for the scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years. The government has invited comments and suggestions from stakeholders within 30 days, said Japanese brokerage firm Nomura, which listed out key changes .

They are:

> A significant increase in renewal of registration fees for both old and new vehicles

> An increase in fees for certificates of fitness

> Fitness certificates for vehicles older than 15 years to be conducted every six months

> No registration fee for scrapping an old vehicle and buying a new one in the same category, with the use of a certificate from a certified scrapyard.

If the proposals are accepted, registration fee for a new motorcycle will go up Rs 1,000 from Rs 50 and heavy goods vehicle from Rs 1,500 to Rs 20,000 .

The report also stated that owners of light motor vehicles will pay Rs 10,000 to register their vehicle instead of Rs 1,000 and three-wheelers will attract a charge of Rs 5,000 as against the current Rs 300 fee.

Nomura said two-wheelers would be hit hard due to a higher cost increase for them (around 2.5 percent) followed by cars and MHCVs (around 1 percent).

Global brokerage CLSA said higher registration fee was unlikely to boost auto demand and regulatory costs were adding up for the Indian auto industry.

""We entered 2019 with a cautious view on autos & see few reasons to change it,"" said the investment firm, which has sell ratings on 70 percent of its auto coverage and recommended underweight stance on entire sector.

Maruti Suzuki, on July 26, reported a 27 percent fall in its June quarter profit, while Tata Motors posted a loss of Rs 3,680 crore in Q1 due to JLR woes.

In a draft notification, the government proposed renewal of fitness certificates for vehicles older than 15 years every six months instead of the current one year timeframe .

""The ministry has issued a draft notification for amendments to the CMVR (Central Motor Vehicles Rules) for providing a boost to the electric vehicles, ensuring divyang friendly features in buses, and providing an enabling mechanism for scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years,"" MoRTH said in a statement.

Brokerages also raised concerns over scrappage policy proposal.

Nomura said challenges need to be resolved for the scrappage policy to be successful .

""We don't expect any one-time jump in scrappage demand from this policy. Owners of trucks older than 15 years may have already renewed their registration or will do so for Rs 1,500 by the time the policy is implemented to avoid paying Rs 40,000. However, the truck owners whose trucks are coming up for renewal as they cross 15 years of age may decide to scrap them if the policy is made effective. This could improve the scrappage rate going ahead,"" Nomura said.

Meanwhile, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, in its 36th meeting on July 27, slashed the GST on electric vehicles (EVs) to 5 percent from 12 percent. The council also slashed the tax rate on EV chargers from 18 percent to 5 percent. The new rates will be effective from August 1.

The government has been pushing for EVs. In the first Budget of Modi 2.0, the Finance Minister exempted such vehicles from registration charges while extending several benefits to buyers and tax rebates to manufacturers.",745,-0.3180186694318598

Two-and-three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto's June quarter (Q1) earnings beat analyst expectations as the profit grew one percent compared to the year-ago period. The numbers were driven by better-than-expected revenue growth amid subdued environment in the auto industry.

Profit during the quarter increased 0.94 percent to Rs 1,125.7 crore from Rs 1,115.23 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. This was far better than its peer TVS Motor which posted 5.5 percent decline in profit amid warnings of poor industry growth in the second half of FY20.

Revenue from operations rose 3.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 7,755.82 crore despite tepid volume growth of 2 percent YoY, led by healthy realisation on price hike during the quarter.

Realisation per unit increased by 4.1 percent year-on-year.

Total 2-wheeler sales volume for the quarter was at 11 lakh units, up 5 percent YoY, while 3-wheeler sales volumes were at 1.6 lakh units, down 16 percent YoY.

Overall volumes increased 2 percent year-on-year (up 4 percent QoQ) to around 12.47 lakh units due to a 2 percent YoY decline in domestic volume and a 3 percent YoY increase in export volume.

Total motorcycle volumes increased by 4 percent YoY, while 3-wheeler volumes declined 20 percent YoY.

The company recorded a growth of 3 percent YoY in the domestic motorcycle segment against industry de-growth of 9 percent.

""Overall share in the domestic motorcycle market stood at 18.3 percent against 16.3 percent in the previous year. Retail share in the domestic motorcycle market is nearly 19 percent,"" it added.

In the sports segment, the company said it continued to maintain its dominance with a market share of 46.9 percent during the quarter ended June 2019.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation declined by 10.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,198.2 crore and margin contracted 249bps YoY to 15.45 percent in quarter ended June 2019.

Except for margin, which was in line with estimates, the numbers exceeded expectations of the analysts. Profit was estimated at Rs 1,075 crore on revenue of Rs 7,587 crore and EBITDA was expected at Rs 1,186 crore with margin at 15.6 percent for the quarter, as per poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18.

Other income also drove profitability higher, rising 24 percent to Rs 441.2 crore compared to year-ago while tax expenses declined 9.4 percent to Rs 453.11 crore YoY in Q1.

As on June 2019, Bajaj Auto's surplus cash and cash equivalents stood at Rs 17,126 crore compared to Rs 16,368 crore, as on March 2019.

Two-and-three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto is expected to report a better than industry performance, partly driven by positive volume growth, in the quarter ended June 2019.

The stock has also outperformed the two-wheeler industry in 2019. Bajaj Auto declined 7 percent, as against a 21 percent fall in Hero MotoCorp, a 25 percent drop in Eicher Motors and 33 percent drop in TVS Motor Company.

""For Q1 FY20E, Baja Auto is expected to report the best quarterly performance among auto original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) with steady 2 percent increase in total volumes (12.5 lakh units), muted commodity prices and operating leverage benefits,"" said ICICI Direct, which expects a profit growth of 2.8 percent and revenue of 2.7 percent YoY.

Total 2-wheeler sales volume for the quarter was at 11 lakh units, up 5 percent YoY, while 3-wheeler sales volumes were at 1.6 lakh units, down 16 percent YoY.

Overall volumes increased 2 percent year-on-year (up 4 percent QoQ) to around 12.47 lakh units due to a 2 percent YoY decline in domestic volume and a 3 percent YoY increase in export volume.

Total motorcycle volumes increased by 4 percent YoY, while 3-wheeler volumes declined 20 percent YoY.

""We expect realisation to increase marginally by 0.4 percent YoY (down 2 percent QoQ), led by price increase. Consequently, net sales are expected to increase by 2.1 YoY (up 2.4 percent QoQ),"" Motilal Oswal said.

Overall brokerages expect a three-digit decline in operating profit margin for June quarter YoY.

Kotak expects EBITDA margin to decline by 210 bps on YoY basis largely due to inferior product mix, higher commodity costs and an increase in discounting in the economy motorcycle segment, while Motilal Oswal expects EBITDA margin to contract by around 180bps YoY.

The company will be launching refreshed versions on existing models over next 6-9 months in both entry and 125 cc segments. There will also be launch of an electric vehicle in FY20.

Key issues to watch out for are updates on the demand outlook for 2-wheelers from urban and rural areas, a price increase in domestic markets across segments, export demand outlook and pricing in key currency market, comments on 3-wheeler demand momentum in the domestic market, and updates on electric vehicle (EV) strategy.

""There is a draft notification that suggests that perhaps all three-wheelers and most two-wheelers should become electric and that is to be achieved also by banning IC engine scooters, motorcycles and three-wheelers and that I am completely, 110 percent opposed to because I do not believe that these two things should be coupled in this manner,"" Bajaj said.

When asked whether it should be a phased transition, Bajaj said, ""By definition, it has to be phased because when you are making 25 million two-wheelers and three-wheelers it is not a switch that you can switch on or off overnight. This is not a chai ka stall that you can open and shut overnight.""

""So right now from what I have understood, of what the government wants to do, I think, if I may say so, they are guilty of overestimating what can be done in the immediate future and they are underestimating what can be done in, somewhat more, medium-term future like ten year,"" he added.

On Bajaj Auto's plan to launch (EVs), he said, ""I believe for the last three or four years that we have been doing our own work both in the two-wheeler space and in the three-wheeler space, both are important for us.""

""The three-wheeler a little more because we have very large stakes there being the world’s largest three-wheeler manufacturer, but the two-wheeler space is also obviously very important to us especially the motorcycle space. I have always believed that just before the BS-VI norms come into play in April 2020, it would be a good time for electric vehicles to make their way to market,"" he added.

For four months on the trot, sales of the Karizma, which was once one of India’s most popular bikes marketed by Hero MotoCorp, has come to naught, highlighting the repeated struggles faced by the country’s top two-wheeler manufacturer in the premium bike segment.

According to wholesale data released every month, not even one unit of the Karizma has been sold since the start of February. Though no sales would normally result in a phase out of the model, the management said that since the Karizma caters to the export market, it refused to discontinue the same in India.

“Karizma is not discontinued and continues to be a part of our portfolio. At present, we are focusing on the model in our overseas markets,” the company said in an emailed response.

Launched in 2003, the Karizma was the most powerful bike that Hero could offer at that time; a breakaway from its image of the maker of value-for-money, no frills bikes such as the CD100. Karizma became one of the first bikes in India with a fully faired styling and powered by an engine that was more than twice the size, which powered its largest selling bike Splendor.

Despite the 16-year old legacy and numerous associations with youth-centric reality TV shows like Roadies and whose brand ambassador was actor Hrithik Roshan in its earlier years, Hero failed to make the Karizma a success.

The company introduced numerous derivatives during the years, with the last one debuting five years ago with an added moniker ZMR. However, the Karizma remained a fringe player in the premium mass market segment.

Failure of Karizma though did not deter Hero from continuing experiments in the premium segment. In May, the company introduced three products -- Xtreme 200S, XPulse 200 and XPulse 200T -- with a common 200cc engine.

Karizma’s rivals, however, have fared much better in comparison. Bajaj Auto has as many as eight models that directly and indirectly compete against the Hero bike under brands such as Pulsar, KTM Duke and Avenger.",347,0.14034005403518676

Bajaj Auto shares gained more than 2 percent intraday on July 1 after auto sales in June beat analyst expectations

The two-and-three-wheeler maker sold 4.04 lakh units in June 2019, which was ahead of Nomura's estimate of 4.02 lakh units.

The company had sold 4,04,429 units in same month last year. The moderate growth was driven by exports that grew by 3 percent to 1.75 lakh units in June 2019 YoY.

Domestic sales fell 2 percent to 2.29 lakh units in the month gone by, against 2.34 lakh units sold in the same period last year, Bajaj Auto said in its BSE filing.

Its motorcycle sales grew 4 percent year-on-year to 3.51 lakh units while 3-wheeler sales fell 20 percent to 53,333 units in June.

Rakesh Sharma, ED at Bajaj Auto told CNBC-TV18 that auto industry has been witnessing a decline but the company has outgrown industry by 15-16 percent in last 3-4 months though retail demand has been very sluggish in the second half of June. ""We do not see any green shoots going ahead,"" he added.

""We are falling back on R&D and product innovation to keep sales momentum intact. We will be introducing a new model in the mid-segment next month,"" he said.

In its Annual Report for 2018-19, the Pune-based firm said while its motorcycles, three-wheelers and quadricycles will be ""fully BS-VI compliant not just on April 1, 2020 but some months earlier, it is difficult to anticipate the state of BS VI readiness of our competitors"".

""For the industry as a whole, we believe that the joker in the pack will be the tough Bharat Stage VI, or BS VI, emission norms that will come into play from 1 April 2020,"" the company wrote to its shareholders.

""However, it is difficult to anticipate the state of BS VI readiness of our competitors. If some, or most, of them have a large stock of unsold BS-IV vehicles in the second half of FY2020, they will perforce have to dump these in the market before the advent of April 1, 2020.

""That could trigger an unwarranted price war, to the detriment of all. We cannot claim that such a scenario will definitely play out; equally we cannot ignore a distinct risk overhang on that account,"" it added.

Bajaj Auto further said the domestic market will get more competitive across the various segments and ""the days when a manufacturer could claim quasi-monopolistic presence in one or more segment is rapidly coming to an end"".

It, however, said ""armed with a surplus of over Rs 16,000 crore, we at Bajaj Auto have the strength to deal with such competition"".

The company told its shareholders that a large part of its strength lies in its success in exports, where the markets are not only diverse but also less prone to acute competitive pressures as the domestic market.

""Our strength also lies in the primacy that we have in the three-wheelers and commercial vehicles segment. Therefore, so long as we have new and exciting models on offer, we can meet the competition and succeed,"" it said, adding the near-term outlook, therefore, should be healthy for Bajaj Auto.

Changing from conventional two-wheelers to 100 percent electric is ""not like Aadhaar, not a software and print cards"" and such transition is completely uncalled for, according to TVS Motor Co and Bajaj Auto.

Strongly objecting to government think tank NITI Aayog's proposal to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) for three-wheelers by 2023 and two-wheelers by 2025, the two companies said the policy has not been made with adequate study and diligence.

""This is not like Aadhaar, not a software and print cards. You have to set up a whole supply chain, and migrate from the current supply chain,"" TVS Motor Co Chairman & Managing Director Venu Srinivasan told PTI.

Last week, NITI Aayog had asked auto industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) along with conventional two-and three-wheeler makers to suggest within two weeks, concrete steps towards transition to electric mobility keeping in mind the 2025 deadline.

Srinivasan further said,""we have said we will take four months to come with a plan. The plans will start with one city (that has the highest number of two-wheeler population) and that too, to a percentage of one city and migrate over a period of time.""

Asserting that a ""black or white, zero-one change"" is not possible ""with 20 million vehicles, $15 billion in sales, one million employees"", he said and added that ""the whole thing is not thought through. I hope saner thoughts will prevail and people will think through the real implications of all this.""

When contacted for comments, Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj said ""we believe 100 percent transition is completely uncalled for"".

Earlier, he had also asserted that the move was impractical and ill-timed, considering the scale involved when stakeholders do not have ""any meaningful experience with any of the pieces of the EV puzzle"" and that too a date so close to BSVI implementation.

Besides, he had argued that ""to target two and three wheelers but not cars etc makes it an incomplete initiative”.

Srinivasan also asserted that ""changing to batteries running on thermal power will not reduce one iota of pollution.""

Another segment first is the semi-digital instrument cluster on the bike. In addition to a gear shift indicator, the console also indicates the current gear.

Everything else remains the same. The commuter bike is powered by the same 115cc single-cylinder that delivers 8.4 bhp of power and 9.81 Nm of torque. Suspension duties are handled by telescopic front forks and nitrox dual shock absorbers in the back. CBS, of course, comes standard.

The Bajaj Platina 110 H Gear is available in two variants. The drum brake variant retails at a price of Rs 53,376 while the disc brake variant is priced at Rs 55,373.

HDFC Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

Financial highlights: Bajaj Auto continued to outperform the motorbike industry with volumes rising +14% YoY. Realisations were up +5% QoQ as the OEM benefitted from higher share of premium bikes, which contributed to 49% of the domestic sales (vs. 38% QoQ). Thus, revenues grew 9% YoY, flat QoQ to Rs 74bn. The EBITDA came in at Rs 11.6bn with margins at 15.7% (+10bp QoQ, -370bp YoY). The margins are stabilizing at these levels as the RM expense ratio has been constant at ~72.5% for the past three quarters. There was a one time write back of Rs 3,420mn (relating to reversal of NCCD duties that were paid earlier to the government). Bajaj expects to grow ahead of the domestic motorbike market in FY20 with new launches across segments. After aggressive growth in the entry portfolio in FY19, they will launch new products in the executive segment in FY20. Bajaj is well prepared to transition to BSVI as it supplies similar products for export markets as well as to KTM. The outlook for export markets though is mixed – while African/ ASEAN markets have bounced back, the Egyptian market is expected to be impacted by the license plate norms that have been introduced by the government (for three wheelers).

Outlook

Bajaj’s adj. 4QFY19 PAT at Rs 10.7bn (-1% YoY) was inline with our estimates. We expect Bajaj to grow ahead of the market in FY20 as well driven by new launches across its product range. Our revised TP is Rs 3,330 (based on its long term ten year average PE multiple of 17.5x on FY21E earnings). While the two wheeler industry growth has been benign, Bajaj has expanded market share by recalibrating its strategy. Further, the company has a diversified product portfolio with three wheelers and exports accounting for ~50% of volumes. Re-iterate BUY.

Highlights:

- Disappointing set of numbers from auto majors in all segments

- New axle load norms, tight liquidity and non-availability of finance weigh on CVs

- Lower Rabi sowing than expected pushed down tractors sales

- Two-wheeler and passenger vehicle segments continue to disappoint

- A rate cut in the upcoming RBI policy meet may act as a catalyst for the sector --------------------------------------------------

Indian automobile industry continues to falter, as is evident from May sales numbers. Demand remains soft because of multiple headwinds the industry is facing, including increase in cost of ownership due to mandatory long-term insurance, tighter safety norms, non-availability of retail finance and moderate economic activity because of the just-finished elections.

Segment-wise, commercial vehicle (CV) numbers fell short of the crease for all the automakers. Operating environment continues to be tough for a myriad reasons. Liquidity crunch, the lagged impact of new axle load norms and slowdown in economic activity all have affected demand. Tractor segment is also losing steam, thanks to last year’s higher base and subdued farm sentiment.

Ditto for three-wheeler (3W) sales, which are feeling the pinch from a very high base last year. Two-wheeler volumes are no better, hit by a confluence of adverse factors.

What could act as a catalyst for the industry is lowering of interest rates by the RBI in its upcoming policy review on June 6. A rate cut would help improve economic activity, boosting auto demand.

Commercial vehicles – No respiteThe economic downturn and stagnant industrial output coupled with the liquidity, financing and regulatory issues have dampened customer demand for CVs. The companies expect the demand to recover, post-election.

Company-wise, Tata Motors registered a decline of 24 percent year-on-year (YoY) in CV volume, hurt by 32.4 percent fall in medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs). Eicher Volvo also saw a drop of 16.3 percent. M&M monthly volume came down by 2 percent, with significant softness in M&HCV segment playing out. Ashok Leyland was on the same boat, logging a decline of 4 percent. However, the slide was arrested by a significant jump of 30.5 percent in LCV segment.

Car segment stays under pressurePassenger vehicle segment continues to be under immense pressure, with no visible signs of recovery. Negative sentiment is mostly an upshot of high finance cost and regulatory headwinds. That explains the lower PV volume for May.

Volume for the market leader, Maruti, was down 23 percent for the month. The management expects the demand to be muted in H1 FY20 which could recover only in H2 FY20 and witness 4-5 percent growth for the whole financial year. Tata Motors’ passenger car space paints a similar picture, down 37 percent YoY. UV segment, however, continues to put up a strong show, racking up 12.7 percent growth for May. M&M had to suffer a decline of 0.5 percent in its monthly volume.

Rougher ride for two-wheelers (2W)Two-wheeler space has been the worst hit in the auto space, given a very weak consumer sentiment. Hero, the leader in the space, put up with a significant decline of 7.7 percent. Eicher, the leader in premium bike segment, too took a beating of 16.5 percent in its monthly sales. Bajaj Auto, on the other hand, bucked the trend, notching up 6.8 percent growth in volume on the back of aggressive pricing at the entry level segment, which helped it capture Hero’s market share. TVS sales fell 1 percent in May.

Three-wheeler (3W): Soft numbersThe overall 3W market felt the heat in May. TVS posted a growth of 9 percent and M&M 4.9 percent. Bajaj Auto, the leader of the pack, registered a decline of 6.2 percent, chiefly because of high base last year.

Tractors: Blame it on Rabi sowingTractor segment ran out of gas as Rabi sowing came in lower than expected and farm sentiment remained depressed. While Escorts numbers fell significantly by 22.1 percent, M&M’s fall in volumes stood at 15.8 percent. The management expects that the government focus on agri initiatives coupled with a near-normal monsoon forecast by IMD would stoke tractor demand in the near future.

Exports in troubled watersExports are turning negative, with many countries facing multiple challenges. Several factors like drop in retail sales in Bangladesh and Nepal, high stock in the SAARC region and slump in the Middle-East have affected the overall industry volumes in these markets.

Barring Bajaj Auto, Escorts and TVS, exports for all auto majors contracted in May.

Higher raw material costs and greater volumes of a loss-making model will restrict Bajaj Auto’s attempts to drive its operating margin back to historical highs of 20 percent.

The Pune-based maker of motorcycles and three-wheelers declared an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin of 17 percent for the March quarter. During the preceding December quarter, its margin came in at 17.2 percent.

Over a conference call with analysts, Bajaj Auto’s senior management said that going forward its margin will remain rangebound.

Soumen Ray, President Finance and CFO, Bajaj Auto, said: “We are seeing a bit of headwinds towards consumption of domestic commercial vehicles. We are committed to pricing the product at the right level and bringing costs down. There will be some firming up of costs by the time we hit Q3. So, H2 is not going to be as benign as H1 is. We have a margin threshold and I would like to believe that we are reasonably rangebound now on the margin front.”

Though Bajaj Auto has pushed its market share higher to close the March quarter at 20 percent, a 430 basis points (100 bps=1 percentage point) jump compared to 15.7 percent posted in FY18, the company has come under criticism from stakeholders for sacrificing profitability in the process.

A recent note from Yes Securities stated, “The fall in margin was on account of the price cuts implemented during Q1 FY19; only partial pass-through of contribution on ABS/CBS price hikes; a weaker product mix, wherein exports to African nations have been inching higher relative to other markets; and rising share of entry-level bikes in the overall domestic portfolio.”

But company officials said the new launches in existing and new segments will help push profitability slightly higher in coming quarters. These new launches will be in the entry level (100cc), executive (125cc) as well as sports segments, where it sells the KTM range of motorcycles.

Rakesh Sharma, Executive Director, Bajaj Auto, said, “We learnt a few expensive lessons a few years ago when we took a knock on our Discover 125 range. This year, we are going to attack the mid-segment (125cc). We tried to get into the sports side of the mid-segment by up trading those already in the mid-segment and then attracting those veering towards the entry level.”

The company recorded a growth of 29 percent to 2.5 million units in domestic two-wheeler sales last fiscal.

“In the next 12 months, we will have a far more complete portfolio, which will address everything from entry models at the lower end of the pyramid all the way to KTM. Every single segment and sub-segment will most likely be covered,” Sharma added.

Bajaj Auto sells two models in the entry segment -- CT 100 and Platina -- the former being the cheapest geared motorcycle in India. After price cuts in the CT 100, it witnessed a robust spurt in demand for the model and also for Platina, which overtook the CT 100 in sales volumes. In the sports segment it has the Pulsar, Avenger and Dominar models under its own brand and the KTM range at the upper end of the price band.

“We will continue to increase our entry-level market share and have a couple of launches planned there. We also have a couple of launches lined up in the next two-to-three months in the middle segment. So, the next six-to-nine months will be very active for the company. We have already rolled out the Avenger 160 and prior to that the Dominar upgrade,” Sharma added.

A recent note from Elara Capital stated, “In FY20, the company will target a market share gain across all segments, led by new launches especially in the entry level and mid-segment (125cc). The management expects the company to outpace industry growth in FY20.”",678,0.2701779868867662

Though the fourth quarter earnings for the auto major was a good show in a tough environment, the company is expected to face margin pressure, market experts said.

At the BSE, shares of Bajaj Auto opened at Rs 3,071, but slid 2.88 percent to its intra-day low of Rs 2,953.95. They finally settled at Rs 3,005.85, down 1.18 percent over its previous close of Rs 3,041.80.

At the NSE, the scrip of the company fell 0.82 percent to close the counter at Rs 3,015. Intra-day it was trading at a low of Rs 2,951.

Bajaj Auto was trading in the negative zone even as the broader market was trading with significant gains. The stock was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack.

""While we believe that margin downgrade cycle (but for any change to product mix) is behind, focus on domestic market share and higher share of Africa in exports are likely to keep margin range bound,"" Edelweiss Research said in a note.

It further noted that a subdued demand environment, costs related to the entry in middle/executive segment (current market share of around 3 percent) and technological changes due to BS-VI will restrict margin to the current level.

Bajaj Auto, the country’s third largest two-wheeler, manufacturer will be launching around six models before November this year.

The Pune-based maker of the Pulsar and the Avenger said that the company was able to beat the downtrend in the market on the back of market share gains during last year in key volume segments.

Rakesh Sharma, chief commercial officer, Bajaj Auto said, “The segment which is driving the growth for us is the entry level segment. Here we have increased market share by 6 percent. The second segment which has grown for us is the sports segment where we have gained 5 percent share.”

After cutting prices on the CT 100, only to raise them to near previous levels, the company witnessed a growth in demand that outpaced the average growth of the two-wheeler market.

The company recorded a growth of 29 percent to 2.5 million units in domestic two-wheeler sales last financial year as compared to 5 percent growth recorded by the industry during the same year.

“The market will see a lot of action beginning June. We already had a couple of introductions in the last two months. There has been an upgrade to the Dominar and the Avenger. Across the spectrum over the next 3-4 months the market will see 3-4 launches. These will be on smart innovations but not revolutionary. These will become the primary drivers of growth”, added Sharma.

Sources say that Bajaj will spruce up its CT100 and Platina further and also have a model in the 125cc segment before the market hits festive period.

Apart from this there will also be the launch of the Husqvarna series of bikes. The Swedish dirt bike specialist's models in India will be powered by a common engine and will be based on a common vehicle platform developed by Bajaj Auto and KTM engineers.

Talking about the Husqvarna launches to Moneycontrol, Sharma added, “We are on track with it and it will be launched in the middle of the year. It could be September–November period because that’s also when the festival sales peak. We have to make sure it has an impact. We are on track with that”.

Earlier today the company announced financial results for the January-March quarter announcing 21 percent rise in net profit thanks to an exceptional item of a reversal of Rs 342 crore to the accounts.

Its EBIDTA margin however remained much lower at 17.6 percent than its historical average of around 20 percent.

“We try to optimize the pricing and rationalize cost. We operate in an industry where we have competion, and we have to price the product in a certain way”, said Soumen Ray, Chief Financial Oficer (CFO) for Bajaj Auto.

About the rearrangement of its share-holding in its Austrian partner KTM the company said it is yet to arrive at a final decision.

“As of now it is still in discussion stage and it will be evaluated between the two partners. Nothing concrete to mention as of now”, Ray added.

In March Bajaj Auto had said that its Netherlands-based subsidiary Bajaj Auto International Holding BV is in talks for transferring its 48 percent stake in KTM AG to the promoter company KTM Industries AG.

After a proposed 50 percent increase in share capital in KTM Industries AG, subject to legal and economic requirements, the promoter company's total stake in KTM AG would increase to 99.7 percent from 51.7 percent presently.

Bajaj Auto is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter earnings on May 17. Research and broking firm Sharekhan expects the auto major to report a net profit of Rs 1,017.1 crore, down 5.8 percent year-on-year and 7.7 percent quarter-on-quarter. Net sales are expected to increase 5.5 percent YoY (down 3.6 percent QoQ) to Rs 7,142.6 crore.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is likely to fall 416.7 percent YoY (down 35.2 percent QoQ) to Rs 15.3 crore.

Prabhudas Lilladher pegs net profit at Rs 1,048.4 crore, down 2.9 percent YoY and 4.9 percent QoQ. It sees net sales rising 10.3 percent YoY and 0.8 percent QoQ to Rs 7,468.8 crore, but EBITDA falling 8.6 percent YoY (up 4 percent QoQ) to Rs 1,201.9 crore.

Narnolia Financial Advisors expects six percent revenue growth, largely driven by 14 percent volume growth in Q4. It sees realisation declining eight percent because of higher sales of entry-level motorcycles in domestic and export markets. Net profit is seen down 13 percent QoQ at Rs 1,024 crore.

Margin is expected to improve 20 bps QoQ to 15.8 percent, led by reduction in commodity prices. Higher sales of Platina will also lead to EBITDA break-even in the entry segment. Two-wheeler inventory across the industry is as high as 80 days, but the same for Bajaj Auto stands at 45 days.

Domestic three-wheeler volumes (contributes 53 percent of 3W volumes) are expected to grow five percent YoY due to higher base and increasing e-rickshaw penetration in FY20. However, volumes may remain close to one lakh units going forward.

The company expects 10-12 percent growth in exports to emerging markets, which will be mainly driven by African market. The same to ASEAN and Middle East will show average growth, while Latin America will continue to stagnate.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects net sales to rise 8.6 percent YoY (but fall marginally by 0.7 percent QoQ) to Rs 73,550 crore. Volumes increased 14 percent, led by 22 percent and nine percent growth in domestic and export bike volumes, respectively.

The research firm expects revenue to rise nine percent YoY as average selling price will decline around five percent due to an inferior product mix.

It sees EBITDA margin declining 350 bps YoY basis (over 30 bps QoQ) largely due to an inferior product mix, higher commodity cost and increase in discounting in the economy motorcycle segment.

Key things to watch out for:Market share in entry segment (the management targets to achieve 45 percent as against 33 percent at present) and launch status of electric two-wheeler Urbanite.",470,0.33054127991199495

Nifty snapped 9-day losing streak on May 14 and reclaimed 11,200. However, for bulls to regain control, the index has to close above 11,250-11,300 convincingly else selling pressure could continue.

The final tally – the S&P BSE Sensex rose 227 points to 37,318 while the Nifty closed 73 points higher at 11,222.

“On the higher side, 11,280-11,300 indeed proved to be a key resistance zone for the day. If the bulls manage to take out that hurdle then 11,370-11,400 shall act as a subsequent barrier,” Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.

“Nevertheless, the overall trend for the index continues to be down. Once the bounce is over, the Nifty can head lower towards the medium term rising trendline drawn from the October low, which is near 11,000,” he said.

We have collated technical outlook on five stocks which saw wild swings in intraday day trade:

Analyst: Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.

Vodafone Idea: Stock fell post Q4 results| Use pullback to exit

The stock is in a bearish trend for over three years now making lower tops and lower bottoms. There has been some sideways movement, but the overall momentum has been in the favour of the bears.

Failure to take out previous swing highs, lower tops and lower bottoms, minor pullbacks are some indication that bears are aggressively riding it.

Technically, there may be some pullbacks but those eventually end up trapping biases of investors. We believe this stock may remain in a negative trend and any pullback is an opportunity to exit.

Also, this sector has been underperforming since the last few quarters as the weakness continue to haunt telecom as space. This is an avoid/sell the stock.

HDFC: Buy on dips post Q4 for your long-term portfolio

This is one of the stocks that is a must in any investor or trader’s long-term portfolio. It has been in its secular uptrend since 2009, post the fall of 2008.

Though in last few quarters we are seeing sideways consolidation in stock as it is oscillating in the range and capped at Rs 2,100.

Trend indicators are also pointing towards sideways trading. The stock should be accumulated on any dips and correction towards Rs 1,800 as there is an uptrend channel formation.

The stock could retest higher targets of Rs 2,200. Hence once should continue to hold or buy on dips.

Tech Mahindra: IT stocks remained under pressure| Down over 3 percent

Tech Mahindra is in an overall uptrend and may continue to remain strong. The stock has recently breached its previous all-time high placed at Rs 748 to mark a new all-time high.

Since prices are in the unchartered territory, we believe the trend may remain in place with Rs 748 being the point of inflection.

There is also a positive (golden) cross on a higher timeframe which will now attract smart money on any dips. Hence, any correction from Rs 750 is an opportunity to enter into the bullish trend for a target of Rs 900. It is a hold/ buy on dips stock.

Bajaj Auto Ltd: Sell on rallies as long as it trades below Rs 3,150

The stock has broken out from a long term upward channel that prices were trending since 2009. The overall pattern of stock now looks weaker since the stock is seeing a change of character.

We believe it may face stiff resistance around Rs 3,110-3,150. Further, a break below Rs 2,800 would confirm its correction and the stock may slip to Rs 2,450. We believe as far as stock is below Rs 3,150, it is a sell on advances.

Bajaj Finance Ltd: Use dips to buy this blue chip stock

It was one of the outperformers that clearly witnessed smart money flowing in on dips in the last 3-4 years of its bullish run.

Though, in this stock, one should be looking for dips rather than buying at random points. It has recovered from the last three major corrections.

The stock is well supported by long-term support line that now comes at Rs 2,550–2,600. Hence, any correction in stock towards these levels should be utilized to buy. At present we believe the stock is expensive.

But, a list of specs and additional side profile released by auto magazine Motoroids, reveals more.

The fully faired sports bike will be called Gixxer SF 250. It will directly compete with the likes of the Pulsar RS200, the KTM RC 200 and the Honda CBR250R.

Equipped with a lower set of clip-on handlebars, split seat configuration and slightly rear-set footpegs, the design gives the new bike a fairly aggressive riding posture.

The tank is similar to the current-gen Gixxer, but the fairing and headlamp units are different. And while we will have an accurate idea only after the bike is launched, let us compare the specs we have in hand now.

The Gixxer gets a 249cc single-cylinder pumping out 26.5 PS of power and 22.6 Nm of torque, identical to the CBR250R. The other competition, the Pulsar RS200 and the RC 200, however, fall slightly lower at 24.5 PS/18.6 Nm and 25 PS/19.2 Nm respectively. All bikes get six gears with top speed claimed to be in excess of 140 km/h.

While all bikes also get a rear monoshock, the RC 200 is the only one with upside down forks in the front, and the others feature the conventional telescopic forks. All bikes also get disc brakes at both ends, with single channel ABS for the Pulsar and RC, but a dual channel for the other two.

Coming to dimensions, the Honda takes the cake with a 1369 mm wheelbase - the longest, followed by the Bajaj at 1355 mm, the Suzuki with 1345 mm and the KTM with 1340 mm.

The KTM has the tallest seat at 820 mm, while the Suzuki gets 800 mm. In terms of weight, the CBR250R is 167 kg at the kerb, while the Gixxer weighs in at 161 kg.

Not a part of the specs sheet, but pricing can still be compared. While there is no official word on the Suzuki Gixxer SF 250's pricing, we expect it to be within the Rs 1.7 lakh range.

The Honda CBR250R is the most expensive here at Rs 1.96 lakh, followed by the KTM RC 200 at Rs 1.88 lakh, and the Bajaj Pulsar RS200 coming in as the most affordable at Rs 1.4 lakh.",391,0.6867518424987793

Bajaj Auto's total vehicle sales rose 2 percent in April to 423,315 units supported by highest ever exports of motorcycles, offsetting a 13 percent fall in commercial vehicle sales. Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director of the company, spoke to CNBC-TV18 about the numbers.

Bajaj said retail sales in the auto industry remained under pressure.

""The weakness that we are seeing post festive season continues and you will hear from everyone progressively today on how YoY there is degrowth and retails are under pressure; they are under pressure for example, even in states like Maharashtra which had the strong festive season of Gudi Padva. So despite the positive seasonal inputs, the market for some reason continues to be soft,"" Bajaj said on May 2.

Talking about the business, Bajaj said, ""Not only in terms of growth have we relatively outperformed the industry but we will also see when we will announce our results later in May that despite all that has been said about Bajaj Auto discounting, you will see that the same impact on margins is there for all those who have announced the result so far.""

""Therefore, what I want to say is we do not discount. For the last 9 months I am trying to explain that just because we sell one stock keeping unit (SKU) that is 10 percent of your portfolio at 10 percent discount doesn’t mean we are engaged in a price war or initiated a price war,"" Bajaj added.

On the growth front, Bajaj said, ""Our Platina brand has grown 77 percent YoY in April and that’s unheard especially at this time in the month of May we are looking at 100 percent growth for Platina. Similarly, at the other end of the spectrum, there are people who are moving up, who are choosing something better and that’s where we are doing well with the Pulsar that has again clocked double-digit growth in April and we are looking at over 20 percent growth in May as well. So that is what helped us in domestic motorcycles.""

Bajaj said that the inventory level is at 55 days plus and that they should be able to get back to 45 days inventory by June-July.

When asked about Siddhartha Lal's decision to give up all responsibilities at Royal Enfield, Bajaj said, ""When you go through such a rough patch it is not for no reason. There has to be some strategic misalignment somewhere. I have my own view of what that might be but it would not be appropriate of me to say it now. I will tell Siddhartha (MD & CEO of Eicher Motors) when I see him because we are often in touch.""

""However, I will say it again that he is outstanding, we know they are super outstanding. They will be back, no doubt,"" he said.

Eicher Motors last month appointed Vinod K Dasari as the chief executive officer of its Royal Enfield unit after Siddhartha Lal's exit.

But in India, Bajaj Auto had quite a battle getting the 'car' approved.

The launch date is set for April 18 and will be available for both commercial as well as personal use. Powered by a 216cc single-cylinder engine, the Qute gets two mono-fuel versions. This basically means running on either petrol or CNG, but never both.

The petrol variant is capable of putting out around 13 bhp of maximum power and 18.9 Nm of peak torque, while the CNG produces just over 10 bhp and 16 Nm. Both engine are mated to a five-speed sequential gearbox.

As a people mover, Bajaj Auto is hoping it will replace the auto rickshaw as it provides much better weather protection and safety, while still being easy to manoeuvre through traffic and not very smooth village roads.

As much as 75 cash-rich companies in the BSE 500 index can distribute a whopping Rs 1.1 lakh crore to their shareholders as dividend or buyback, finds an industry report.

The findings by advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services India (Iias), is based on FY18 financial statements of the BSE 500 companies.

In its 2018 study, based on FY17 financials, the proxy advisory firm has identified 92 companies that can pay incremental dividends of Rs 34,000 crore.

""This Rs 1.1 lakh crore equals the aggregate post-tax profit reported by 75 companies and is in addition to the Rs 62,100 crore they had paid out in FY18 as dividend,"" the report said.

The excess cash, if distributed, translates to a median dividend yield to 5.2 percent, significantly higher than the current 1.4 percent, it said.

Five of these 75 companies, are sitting on much excess cash it translates into an additional dividend yield of over 15 percent--Indian Energy Exchange, MOIL, Multi-Commodity Exchange of India, Bhel and Godfrey Philips, it said.

The 75 companies can return a median of 49 percent of their total cash and cash equivalents to their shareholders.

There are nine firms that can distribute over 75 percent of their FY18 on-balance-sheet cash, which are Abbott, Symphony, Lal Pathlabs, Bajaj Consumer Care, Godfrey Phillips, Honeywell Automation, Bata, Pfizer and Hindustan Zinc.

Of the 75 companies, just five companies aggregate over 50 percent of the total incremental distributable cash of Rs 1.1 trillion. These are Hindustan Zinc, ITC, Wipro, TCS, Bajaj Auto.

Voices of disagreement over government’s incentive plan for electric vehicles have started to surface from the automotive industry.

Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto, said FAME-II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles) scheme overlooks the issue of lack of demand for such green vehicles.

“The scheme for incentivising electric vehicles (EV) under FAME II isn’t optimal as it glosses over the fundamental issue of demand generation,” Bajaj told Business Standard.

In February, the Cabinet announced the Rs 10,000-crore FAME-II to promote electric and hybrid vehicles. It provides subsidy to such cars priced below Rs 15 lakh, subject to battery power and range of the vehicle. However, the scheme does not offer any incentives to personal car buyers.

To avail incentives, vehicle manufacturers will have to ensure that half of the content of the electric or hybrid car is procured within the country. It is this rider that has upset the apple cart of vehicle manufacturers.

“If the vehicle is priced for profitability, there will be no demand. If it’s priced for strong demand, it’s suicidal for the manufacturer. It will help if the scheme or the government’s policy is aimed at mitigating this conflict,” the article quoted Bajaj as saying.

Bajaj Auto, which is India’s third biggest two-wheeler manufacturer, was busy clearing the decks for launching its first electric vehicle later in the year, a battery-powered three wheeler. An electric scooter was to follow later.

Under FAME–I, the incentive for lithium ion-powered two-wheelers stood at Rs 17,000-22,000. FAME-II has linked the demand incentive to the size of the battery, with the government providing Rs 10,000 per kWh used by electric two-wheelers.

“As the average size of a lithium ion battery in electric scooters sold during FAME-I was about 1.5 kWh (average subsidy of about Rs 15,000 per vehicle), it reduced the average subsidy per vehicle by Rs 2,000 to Rs 7,000 under FAME-II,” Crisil Ratings said.

Crisil stated that the requirement of a high percentage of localisation in manufacturing under FAME II will prove to be a hurdle for many original equipment manufacturers. “Going forward, upgradation of products and localisation will increase the costs for e-scooters, which could hurt demand,” it said.

Bajaj Auto said he supported a phase-wise expansion in production of electric vehicles, which requires setting aside a small percentage of production of such vehicles, starting with two percent.

“It can be two percent in 2020, five per cent in 2021, and 10 percent in 2022. This will help manufacturers to learn, consumers to mature, infrastructure to come up, and there will be confidence among all stakeholders,” Bajaj added.",444,-0.4988847076892853

Though the bike has already been showcased along with all its specifications and technical details, what we didn’t know was the price. Finally, we now know it is Rs 1,73,870 (ex-showroom Delhi).

There are quite a few changes to the 2019 iteration of the Dominar and they are not limited to just the engine. The latter is still the same 373.3cc engine, but this time it feature a double overhead camshaft (DOHC). This boosts the power figure from the previous 35 PS to now 40 PS. Torque still remains the same at 35 Nm.

The other big change on the bike is the addition of USD forks. While making the Dominar look a little more impressive, it also helps in strengthening the bike and slightly improving riding dynamics. Braking is handled by disc at both ends and gets dual channel ABS as standard.

Speaking about the 2019 Dominar, Sarang Kanade, President – Motorcycles, Bajaj Auto, said, “Dominar 400 has been able to create a strong following for itself and has become the preferred choice for city riders and long distance tourers, alike. Customers have pushed the bike into extreme long distance and challenging geographies with aplomb, which inspired us to strengthen the sports tourer credentials in the new Dominar.”

Bajaj Auto has also decided to include a set of bungee straps under the seat for riders to lash on gear or other belongings to take on long distance tours. The exhaust end-can too has been swapped out for a dual exhaust system, giving the bike a slightly throatier note. The instrument cluster too, while still a dual unit, displays more information like gear position, mileage per litre, etc.

The bike is available at all Bajaj Auto dealerships and comes in two colour variants: a Vine Black paint scheme and a new Aurora Green colour option. In terms of competition, the 2019 Bajaj Dominar competes with the likes of the KTM Duke 390, the Royal Enfield bikes, BMW G 310 R, and the TVS Apache RR 310.

Moreover, the new bike also features a distinctive new twin barrel exhaust which produces throaty exhaust note with heavy bass that augments the sports tourer feel, the company said.

The 2019 Dominar 400 also has a host of additional innovative offerings, like bungee straps tucked under the seat to help secure gear during long distance touring, redesigned secondary display showing time, gear position, trip information and space craft inspired tank pad decals, it added.

""Customers have pushed the bike into extreme long distance and challenging geographies with aplomb, which inspired us to strengthen the sports tourer credentials in the new Dominar,"" Bajaj Auto President - Motorcycles Sarang Kanade said.

The new Dominar 2019 is now available across all Bajaj auto dealerships in dual-channel ABS variant, the company said.",222,0.9674522578716278

Highlights:

- A disappointing set of numbers for March by auto majors in all segments

- New axle load norms, tight liquidity and non-availability of finance weigh on CVs

- Postponement of the festive season to April and lower-than-expected Rabi sowing dampened tractors sales

- Two-wheeler segment is the worst hit with inventory reaching alarming levels --------------------------------------------------

Indian automobile sector continues to be in a slow lane as is evident from March 2019 volume numbers. The slowdown is due to multiple challenges such as an increase in the total cost of ownership due to mandatory long-term insurance and implementation of safety regulations, higher cost of retail finance and moderate economic activities ahead of elections.

Commercial vehicle (CV) segment sales were flat for the players in the space. The segment continues to face challenges, primarily, due to the liquidity crunch, non-availability of retail finance, lagged impact of new axle load norms and a slowdown in economic activities ahead of elections. Tractor segment also continued to remain weak on the back of the higher base of last year and subdued farm sentiments.

Three-wheeler (3W) sales were mixed on the back of very high base for last year. Two-wheeler volumes were subdued due to weak consumer sentiments led by higher cost of ownership, the high base of last year and adverse macro factors.

Commercial Vehicle – continues to be under pressureMacro challenges led by liquidity problem, financing issues, rising interest rates, lagged impact of new axle load norms and a slowdown in economic activity ahead of elections dampened customer demand for CVs. The long-term outlook, however, continues to be positive, primarily, due to the government’s focus on construction and infrastructure and increase in mining activities.

Company wise, Tata Motors registered a 1 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in CV volume led by 1.9 percent growth in the M&HCV segment and 0.3 percent in the LCV segment. Eicher Volvo witnessed a decline of 7.8 percent. Ashok Leyland and M&M posted a decline of 4 percent each in their monthly volume, primarily, due to a significant decline in M&HCV segment volume.

Cars Segment – no signs of recoveryCar segment continued to show weakness for the ninth consecutive month with no signs of recovery. Inventories were at alarming levels. Negative sentiments in the space were due to an increase in total cost ownership led by rising interest rate and mandatory long-term insurance that dampened consumer sentiments. Hence, companies in the space have posted a decline in PV volume for the month of March 2019. New product launches though helped companies.

The leader, Maruti, posted a decline of 4 percent in its volume for the month. Tata Motors’ passenger car segment witnessed a decline of 12 percent (YoY). The management of Tata Motors expects good months ahead as its new SUV, Tata Harrier has been receiving good traction. M&M, on the other hand, posted a growth of 4 percent in its monthly volume, driven by its newly-launched XUV300 model.

Two-wheeler (2W) segment: Inventory at alarming levelsThe two-wheelers space has been the worst hit with inventory days touching 100 versus normal inventory of 20 days. Hero, the leader in the space, witnessed a significant decline of 20.4 percent, Eicher, the leader in premium bike segment, also witnessed a decline of 20 percent in its monthly sales numbers and TVS posted a decline of 2 percent. Bajaj Auto, on the other hand, witnessed 38.5 percent growth in its volume on the back of aggressive pricing actions by the company on its entry-level segment which helped it captured Hero’s market share.

Eicher Motors has announced the appointment of Vinod K Dasari, ex-CEO and MD of Ashok Leyland, as the CEO of Royal Enfield. Eicher Motors will get a new perspective from its new CEO.

Three-wheeler (3W): mixed showThe overall 3W market posted mixed numbers in March 2019. TVS posted a very strong growth of 32.6 percent and M&M posted a growth of 5.2 percent. Bajaj Auto, the leader in the space, posted a decline of 12.6 percent, primarily, due to a high base of last year.

Tractors: losing momentumTractor segment has also come under pressure due to the postponement of the festive season to April and lower Rabi sowing than expected. Escorts posted a decline of 1.1 percent and M&M posting a significant decline of 30.1 percent. M&M management expects positive sentiments on the back of government's focus on rural development, a good forecast for horticulture production and an increase in the MSP that will positively impact demand for tractors in future.

Exports: mixed sentimentsBarring Maruti and Tata Motors, auto majors have posted strong growth in the export markets in the month of March 2019. Tata Motors’ management indicated the decline was due to new regulations and political uncertainty in Sri Lanka and the slump in the Middle East affecting the overall industry volumes in these markets.

Bajaj Auto on Tuesday reported an 18 per cent rise in total sales at 3,93,351 units in March, compared to 3,34,348 units in the same month a year ago.

Total motorcycle sales during the month grew by 20 per cent to 3,23,538 units from 2,69,939 units in the same month last year, the company said in a BSE filing.

Bajaj Auto had just recently unveiled the 2019 update for the Dominar 400, but is yet to reveal details on pricing. Reports are now emerging that in addition to the bikes arriving at dealerships, the pricing has also been announced. Various media reports are quoting dealers saying that the Dominar is being priced at Rs 1.73 lakh (ex-showroom).

This is a premium of Rs 11,000 when compared to its outgoing model. However, the change in price comes in line with the tweaks made to the bike. The biggest change is the reworked 373.5cc engine that now gets a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) set-up and a higher compression ratio. The ECU has also been re-tuned and the engine generates 40 PS of power, 5 PS more than the outgoing 35 PS. Torque remains unchanged at 35 Nm.

The other big change would be the suspension. The front now gets USD forks in place of a conventional telescopic suspension on the older model. This will help with better riding dynamics for the Dominar. The exhaust end-can has also been swapped out for a twin-exhaust unit. A few tech updates have also been made. For example, the instrument cluster, while still split between a traditional handlebar mount and a tank mounted one, now displays more information.

Weight of the bike has increased by just 2 kg and features a new colour scheme that company calls Auroral Green. Even with the price increase, the Dominar 400 undercuts most of its 300-400cc rivals, including the 390 Duke, Apache RR 310 and the BMW G 310 R.",263,

Bajaj Auto has launched the Platina 100 KS in India at Rs 40,500, which comes with a Combined Braking System (CBS) as per the new safety norms.

The Platina 100 KS (kick start) is cheaper by Rs 7,000 when compared to the electric start variant and is now the new entry-level motorcycle in the Platina line-up. The bike, however, still continues to use a 130 mm drum brake in the front and a 110 mm drum in the back.

The powerplant too remains the same with a 102cc motor producing 7.9 PS of power and 8.34 Nm of torque, mated to a 4-speed gearbox. Suspension is handled by a conventional telescopic front fork and a spring-in-spring set-up at the back.

The bike also continues to feature the 'ComforTec' technology, which includes longer suspension, rubber footpegs and spring soft seat for better ride quality. Colour choices include a black and a red paint scheme with silver decals.

Commenting on the new variant, Sarang Kanade, President of its Motorcycle Business, said, ""Platina is known for delivering supreme comfort along with great mileage to commuters. With the introduction of the Platina 100KS, we are now able to offer great value at an unbeatable price point.""

Bajaj Auto and Austria's Pierer Industrie AG have started discussions to assess the possibility of transferring Bajaj's 48 percent stake in KTM AG to KTM Industries AG, with the Pierer-Group continuing to retain the controlling majority over KTM Industries AG.

""Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj will now evaluate the proposals in detail. The transaction decision is targeted to be made in the second quarter of 2019,"" Bajaj Auto said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.

At present, Pierer Industrie AG holds approximately 62 percent of the shares of KTM Industries AG. The listed company KTM Industries AG holds approximately 51.7 percent of the shares of KTM AG.

""If Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj decide to execute the transaction, KTM Industries AG will examine the legal and economic requirements and conditions of a capital increase by contribution in kind from the existing authorised capital of the company.

Inventory pile-up continues to remain a big overhang for the auto sector. Top two-wheeler companies are set to cut production as inventory levels are as high as 80 to 90 days. Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Auto; Sunil Bohra, CFO of Minda Industries and Arvind Kapur, CEO of Rico Auto, shared their views on the same.

""We are all aware that growth rates dropped off since October, the reality is that most people did not anticipate this or chose to ignore it and that is why inventory for some is in triple digits, a 100 days or more, they may or may not acknowledge that but that is a reality. In terms of production cuts, typically I hear some of the big makers affecting about a 20 percent cut then don’t be surprised if from April 1 or April 2 if you find out that some of the big ones have cut as much as 50-60 percent in March,"" Bajaj told CNBC-TV18.

""For Bajaj Auto, I can say very confidently that we are at a good position basically for three reasons - firstly, we did not crank up production and have got inventories as much as other did pre-festive. Secondly, we preferred to be safe than sorry and therefore we had a strong promotion lined up for the festive season, which kept our retail momentum very strong and that continues to be strong. Most importantly, we anticipated this scenario and had a very clever strategy in place to address three segments of price, entry and premium with three brands CT, Platina and the Pulsar and we worked on them on all four important aspects - product, price, promotion and distribution. As a result we are at 55 days of inventory right now and our retail this month is maybe 200,000 or a little more, the stock is 375,000 so that is about 55 days work and we have two choices because we are not happy with 55 days of stock, we can either reduce stock to 45 days by reducing the inventory or we can push up our retail and, I think, we are going to push up our retail, you will see it moving up. I am very confident that in the next two-three months to 250,000 or thereabouts and then we will be absolutely comfortable at 45 days of stock,"" he added.

In terms of demand and pick-up by the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), Bohra said, ""We all know that the second half of the current fiscal from October onwards has been under pressure but what we have been doing is adding more products and more and more premiumisation we have been able to withstand that pressure. From an industry perspective, while the second half has been broadly 8-10 percent lower, we have been able to maintain our revenue and going forward, we are all echoing what the customers are saying be in terms of four-wheelers or two-wheelers that up to June at least there are no signs of strong revival, we are tightening our belts. The focus is mostly on quality, delivery and development and we are continuously working to up our portfolio in terms of offering to the customers which are now we are adding sensor plant, recently we have acquired a seating company called Harita Seating Systems. So we have been trying to withstand this tough time.""

""We all know that the long-term story for the country is intact. We believe that four-wheelers may see more growth going forward as compared to two-wheelers but we are confident that both the businesses will grow,"" Bohra added.

Talking about production cuts, Kapur said, ""This all depends on the customers you are dealing with. If you are lucky to deal with a customer like Rajiv Bajaj then, of course, your fees are going to go up and if you are dealing with the other customers, there would be some impact. Having said that, we are in a fortunate situation that we are exporting and in the exports, the market is okay for us. In fact we should be growing by almost 25 percent as far as exports are concerned. In the domestic market, the push that has happened now is to get a larger share of the business and that is what most of the component makers are vying for.""

Bajaj Auto has given us yet another reason to love the Pulsar range of bike with addition of the Pulsar 180 Neon.

It is offered in only one colour option however which is very much like the neon edition of the Pulsar 150 that launched recently. The bike features a matte grey base paint with neon orange highlights including the Pulsar badge, and grab rails among others.

What really sets the bike apart however is its styling. It is identical to the Pulsar 220. It features the same fairing as the bigger bike with the stacked headlamp unit and LED DRLs on the side.

The bike is powered by the 178.6cc single cylinder air-cooled four-stroke engine. There are disc brakes at both ends but no ABS. This is surprising considering the deadline for the new safety norms are just around the corner.

The Pulsar 180 Neon is available at a price tag of Rs 87,450.",165,

The Bajaj Dominar probably falls into any number of categories. You could think of it as a naked bike, a sport bike, a sport tourer or maybe even as an everyday commuter. It is because of this that the Dominar has so many rivals out there. For now, however, we are pitting the Dominar against the KTM 390 Duke, BMW G 310 GS and Royal Enfield Classic 500

Getting down to design and styling first, the 390 Duke sports a naked bike design. While the Dominar too is technically 'naked', it doesn't look the part. The 310 GS is an adventure tourer with a tall stance and high clearance for touring off road too.

The Royal Enfield Classic, on the other hand, sports its legendary retro design with a long flat seat and tear drop fuel tank. Where the 390 Duke and the Dominar get all LED headlamps, the units on the BMW and the Royal Enfield are halogen affairs.

KTM probably has the most futuristic instrument console though with a full colour TFT dash. The consoles on the BMW and the Bajaj, are digital units. The Dominar does get a secondary display on the fuel tank too allowing for more information to be displayed. The Classic 500's instrument panel is true to its retro nature, completely analogue with a few warning lights.

Coming down to the engine, the Classic 500 has the biggest displacement with 499cc compared to the 373cc motors on the KTM and Bajaj and 313cc on the BMW. Despite this, the Classic's engine is the most under powered churning out 27 PS of peak power as against BMW's 34 PS, Dominar's 35 PS and 43.5 PS on the 390 Duke. In terms of torque though, the Royal Enfield takes the cake with 41 Nm, while the Dominar gets 35 Nm.

Suspension on the Dominar and 390 Duke comes via USD forks up front and a rear monoshock. The BMW and Royal Enfield get conventional telescopic front fork set-up though the 310 GS suspension is taller with more travel for off road use. Braking comes via disc brakes for all bikes, with ABS as standard thanks to the upcoming safety norms.

Where ride quality is concerned, each bike is vastly different. Where the Royal Enfield and Bajaj have a mostly upright riding position, the Dominar's footpegs are not as forward positioned as the Classic 500's. The KTM on the other hand has a slightly sportier tucked position along with rear-set footpegs for that more aggressive feel. The 310 GS is a specifically built for touring so a tall seat, high handlebars and forward footpegs gives it the most comfort on long journeys.

In the end, it's not even about which bike is better. Each of the bikes on this list serves a vastly different purpose. If you need some sporting capability to carve up mountainsides, opt for the 390 Duke. You need more retro in your life, you look for the Classic 500. You think you want to travel to the far reaches and may not see roads, you hop onto the 310 GS.

But if you think you want a whole of city riding, some sporting capability and good comfort on long journeys, the Dominar offers all of that in sufficient quantities.",548,0.7893483936786652

Bajaj has just unveiled the latest iteration of the Dominar 400 with a fair amount of changes to the bike, both in terms of mechanicals as well as electronics.

To start off with, the Dominar receives dual-channel ABS as standard and not optional as with the outgoing model. The bike receives a new 373.2cc DOHC engine capable of producing 40 PS of power and 35 Nm of peak torque. This is a whole 5 PS more than the outgoing 35 PS engine and while torque remains the same, it comes in at 7,000 rpm compared to the older 6,500 rpm.

Suspension receives changes too, with the front conventional telescopic fork being swapped out for better upside down forks. This will improve riding dynamics considerably. The exhaust end-can has also been updated to a new twin-exhaust setup.

The overall look of the bike hasn’t changed though but tech updates have been made. The instrument cluster has been updated and while it is the same dual unit, both feature more information on the screens.

All the new tech does add 2 kgs to the bike's weight resulting in a kerb weight of 184 kg. The new Dominar is also available in a new bright green colour scheme that Bajaj calls Auroral Green.

Prices have not been announced yet, but there is an expectation of a Rs 15,000-20,000 price hike. However, the Dominar 400 will still be cheaper than most of its 300-400cc rivals including the 390 Duke, Apache RR 310 and the BMW G 310 R.",256,0.9990072846412659

It even received the Bike of the Year Award in the 160cc category at the Bike India Awards 2020. Powering the bike is a 155cc engine that makes 18.5 PS and 13.9 Nm.

Yamaha is all geared up to launch the MT-15 in India come March 15 and while prices have not yet been announced, there is chatter that it will retail around Rs 1.25 lakh. At this price point, the MT-15 firmly goes up against the likes of the Bajaj Pulsar NS200 and the KTM 125 Duke.

In terms of styling, the MT-15 looks the most aggressive of the lot. The beefy tank and the split headlight set-up will definitely fetch the most attention on the streets. The NS on the other hand has a more subtle, flowy design theme to it, while the Duke borrows its design cues from the bigger 200 Duke and is angular and sharp.

Speaking of headlamps, the MT-15 will get a projector headlamp while the other two on our list get the old halogen lamps. Instrument clusters on the KTM and the Yamaha are fully digital dials, whereas the Pulsar gets a semi-digital console with an analogue tachometer.

Now in terms of power trains, the KTM has the smallest with a 124cc engine producing 14.75 PS and 12 Nm of torque. The MT-15 is powered by a 155cc motor and while it does churn out about 19 PS of maximum power, the torque figure falls almost in line with the KTM at 14.7 Nm. The NS200 on the other hand has the biggest engine here with a 199.5cc power plant producing 23.17 PS and 18.3 Nm of torque.

In terms of mechanicals, the KTM is the only one to get upside down forks at the front, while the Yamaha and the Bajaj get conventional telescopic front forks. On the ABS front, the Duke and the Pulsar get single-channel ABS, while the MT-15 is expected to get a dual-channel unit.

In terms of pricing, the MT-15 will be the most expensive with an expected price tag of around Rs 1.25 lakh. The KTM 125 Duke though does hold second place with a monstrous Rs 1.18 lakh price for a 125cc bike, while the Bajaj NS200 sits neatly at the Rs 1.12 lakh mark.",408,

Auto publication, Rushlane, has managed to get pictures of the bike from HyperRider.in, an exclusive Dominar Accessories store.

Getting to what we have already learned from spy pics, we already know that the 2019 Bajaj Dominar will get a new green scheme along with a white and red. For mechanicals, we also know the bike will receive upside down front suspension to replace the old conventional telescopic forks. The exhaust system also seems to be upgraded and features a twin canister set-up. The instrument console is also said to be upgraded to feature more information than the old gen bike.

The 2019 Dominar's 373cc single-cylinder now makes 39.9 PS of power at 8,650 rpm as compared to the old gen's 35 PS at 8,000 rpm.

According to Rushlane, the prices are set to be higher by about Rs 25,000-30,000 as compared to the earlier bike. The current gen Bajaj Dominar retails for a price of Rs 1.63 lakh. It goes up against the likes of the KTM 390 Duke, BMW G 310 series and the Royal Enfield bikes.",262,

Indian market witnessed a sell-off in the last two trading sessions of the week which pushed Nifty below psychological level of 11,000 on weak global cues.

During the week, the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group stocks saw their worst decline as most of the stocks hit their lifetime low during the week post Reliance Communications issue.

During the week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced interest rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent but with this surprise news, the market has shown profit booking from higher levels.

In January 2019, equity inflows declined 6.8 percent over the previous month to Rs 6,158 crore and its third straight monthly decline which is not good sign.

Nifty managed by some stocks but broader markets are in bear grip and most of stocks are available 40-60 percent lower from their recent peak. In this scenario, capital protection is the best strategy for investors. Try to invest only in quality stocks. Do not try to bottom fishing in bad stocks.

For next week, Nifty has strong support at 10,885-10,815 levels and resistance at 11,040-11,120 levels.

Here is the list of three stocks to buy in staggered manner for medium to long term:

Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto is the world's 3rd largest manufacturer of motorcycles and the largest manufacturer of three-wheelers.

First ten months of FY19 became golden period for company. During this period its motorcycles sales grew by 28 percent and commercial vehicles sales grew by 26 percent. Total sales grew by 28 percent. Its motorcycle sales grew by 21 percent during January 2019.

Due to higher raw material price, we have seen some pressure on margin front during nine-month of FY19 but we are expecting margin improvement in coming quarters. During Q3FY19, its sales grew by 16 percent YoY, while PAT increased by 15.7 percent to Rs 1,101.88 crore.

During nine-month of FY19, its sales grew by 21.11 percent YoY, while PAT increased by 15.63 percent to Rs 3,519.12 crore. At the CMP, the stock trades at a P/E of 17.5x. We are recommending a buy in staggered manner for medium to long term.

Siemens

Siemens focuses on the areas of electrification, automation and digitalization. The company has posted strong numbers for Q3FY18. Its net profit increased by 19.69 percent to Rs 228 crore from Rs 190.5 crore on 15.7 percent higher sales of Rs 2,734.2 crore.

New orders grew by 4.1 percent to Rs 3,391 crore, compared to Rs 3,257 crore in the quarter ended December 2018. Siemens trades at PE ratio of 39.4x. We are recommending a buy in staggered manner for medium to long term.

AstraZeneca Pharma

AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited a subsidiary of AstraZeneca PLC, is a bio-pharmaceutical company, manufactures, distributes, and markets pharmaceutical products. It has reported excellent results for Q3FY19.

Sales and PBDIT grew by 67.42 percent YoY and 476.9 percent YoY, respectively, while it has reported PAT of Rs 29.09 crore against loss of Rs 10.35 crore. During nine-month of FY19, its PAT grew 95.43 percent to Rs 44.62 crore on 27.71 percent higher sales of Rs 537.99 crore.

Technically stock has formed inverted head and shoulder pattern break out on daily chart which is bullish in its nature. We are recommending a buy in staggered manner for medium to long term.

The Egyptian government is building itself a new capital from scratch and strangely this is sending shockwaves around 5,000 kms away to Bajaj Auto, which supplies three-wheelers (3Ws) to that country.

Nearly a fourth of Bajaj Auto’s three-wheeler overseas shipments head to Egypt, making it the second largest market in the world for the Pune-based company after Sri Lanka.

But in late November 2018, Egypt Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouli called for a restriction on free imports of three-wheelers (locally called toktoks) into the country in a push to make its youth take up ‘serious jobs that can help develop and build the country’.

Rakesh Sharma, director, Bajaj Auto, said, “There was some discussion in the (Egyptian) government of curtailing the imports of three wheelers because of a really ludicrous logic of labour getting employed as 3W drivers and not being available for building the new Cairo (new capital)”.

During Q3 FY19, the maker of motorcycles such as Pulsar and Avenger exported 90,426 units of 3Ws from India, a year-on-year growth of 24 percent.

Though 3W export growth during the third quarter was in healthy double-digits, it was the slowest of the three quarters for the year led by Egypt. In Q1, Bajaj Auto 3W exports grew 69 percent, whereas in Q2 the segment clocked 49 percent over the corresponding quarter last year. This notable growth was a result of pre-buying by Bajaj Auto’s distributors in Egypt.

“As a preemptive step, our importer and distributor in Egypt decided to advance a lot of the purchases just in case the government takes some punitive action for one or two months. So, we will see a kicker in the international business purely on account of extra volumes from Egypt,” Sharma added.

While the Bajaj toktok has become a household name as it is the most preferred means of transport in Eqypt not just for locals but for millions of tourists visiting each year to see the pyramids, it has also invited the ire of government authorities.

As early as 2014, the Egypt Industry Ministry decided to stop imports of toktoks as it was found that the three-wheeled passenger carriers were used in committing crimes as well in terrorist attacks. Several of such vehicles were found to be invalid and driven by youths without driving license. However, subsequently the ban lifted and imports resumed.

Now as a means to appease to the government, Bajaj Auto has announced plans to set-up a factory in Egypt that would manufacture the toktoks.

“What will work in our favour is that since the last one-a-and-half year we have been localising a lot of our components. Around 30 percent of the value of 3Ws is put together in Egypt itself and there are plans for setting up a new factory in Egypt,” Sharma stated.",475,0.10142852365970612

Dolat Capital's research report on Bajaj Auto

BJAUT had volume growth of 26% YoY during the quarter but it failed to support revenue growth which grew at 16% YOY. Realization continues to remain under pressure due to aggressive pricing strategy and focus on the entry level segment. Gross margin declined on sequential as well as YoY basis. EBIDTA margin pressure is also likely to continue, considering the challenges seen at the industry level. Though management had indicated to focus on pricing, we believe that it will be a big challenge to improve margins in the current environment.

Outlook

With no presence in the fast-growing scooter segment, we believe that BJAUT will find it challenging to balance the volume and margin profile. We rollover valuations to FY21E. Reiterate Sell with target price of ` 2,502.

Highlights:

- Automobile companies announce a disappointing set of January sales across all segments

- Tight liquidity and non-availability of finance weigh on commercial vehicles

- Mandatory long-term insurance and higher interest rates impact passenger vehicle and two-wheeler sales --------------------------------------------------

Challenging times continue for automobile majors, with their monthly sales numbers on a decline. The latter is due to subdued consumer demand caused by slowing industrial output, tight liquidity, non-availability of retail finance, higher interest rates and moderate economic activity ahead of general elections in April-May.

Sales for the commercial vehicle (CV) segment were mixed. The segment continues to face challenges due to liquidity, non-availability of retail finance and delayed impact of new axle load norms.

The same for the tractor segment was also weak in January on lower-than-expected rabi crop sowing.

Three-wheeler (3W) sales were mixed due to a very high base of last year.

Volumes for two-wheeler (2W) space were also mixed.

Passenger vehicle (PV) sales continue to disappoint because of higher cost of ownership, high base of last year and adverse macro factors.

Commercial vehicle – Mixed set of numbersSubdued market sentiment, liquidity woes, financing issues, rising interest rates and slowdown in economic activity dampened demand for CVs. This was, further, marred by the lag impact of new axle load norms. The long-term outlook, however, continues to be positive due to the government's focus on construction and infrastructure and increase in mining activity.

Tata Motors saw a nine percent year-on-year (YoY) fall in CV volumes led by a 16.3 percent and and 4.2 percent decline in medium and heavy CV (M&HCV) and light CV (LCV) segments, respectively. Surprisingly, Ashok Leyland's monthly volume rose 12 percent driven by strong showing in both M&HCV and LCV segments. M&M too posted a growth of eight percent in the CV segment. However, Eicher Volvo saw a significant sales decline (12.1 percent).

Cars segment: Adverse macros weighIncrease in the total cost of ownership led by rising interest rates and mandatory long-term insurance dampened consumer sentiment. Hence, companies in this space have posted a muted/decline in PV volume for January.

Market leader, Maruti, posted a two percent volume decline for the month. M&M performed a tad better, announcing flat growth (0.8 percent).

Tata Motors’ passenger car segment grew a percent YoY. Its management expects strong months ahead on the back of launch of its new SUV -- Tata Harrier -- in January.

Two-wheeler (2W) segment: Bajaj Auto continues to do wellIn the two-wheeler space, Bajaj Auto leads the pack with a 24.7 percent growth, led by aggressive pricing actions undertaken by the management in the entry-level segment. The impact of this continues to be severe on Hero MotoCorp, the segment leader, which saw a 9.2 percent decline in monthly sales. Eicher Motors also continues to announce disappointing numbers, with January sales declining 6.6 percent. Monthly sales for TVS Motor Company grew two percent on higher bike sales (12.8 percent).

Three-wheeler (3W): Mixed showingTVS posted very strong growth (51.6 percent) and M&M grew 26.5 percent. Bajaj Auto, the leader in the space, saw its sales decline 28.1 percent due to higher base of last year.

Tractors: Gaining on positive rural sentimentMonthly sales for the tractor segment remained mixed with Escorts recording a YoY growth of 11.7 percent. The same for M&M declined 0.7 percent. The management said increased focus on agriculture and rural infrastructure will drive positive sentiment and future demand.

Exports: Mixed sentimentMaruti, Eicher and Tata Motors saw their sales decline, whereas M&M, Bajaj Auto, TVS, Eicher and Escorts witnessed a growth in January. Tata Motors’ management attributed this decline to the current liquidity crisis in Nepal, formation of a new government in Bangladesh and political uncertainty in Sri Lanka.

Pune-based automobile company Bajaj Auto, scheduled to announce earnings on January 30, is expected to report more than 10 percent growth in profit, driven by revenue growth in the quarter ended December 2018.

According to brokerages, revenue for the quarter may grow in the range of 16-20 percent against a year-ago period, largely led by volume growth.

""Bajaj Auto is expected to report a steady Q3FY19 performance wherein volume growth will outpace the margin pressure,"" said ICICI Securities which expects revenue to grow 16 percent.

Edelweiss Securities expects revenue growth of 20 percent YoY led by volume growth of around 26 percent YoY.

But the volume mix has not been very favourable with higher share of domestic motorcycles (CT100) and lower 3-wheeler.

Total 2-wheeler sales volume in Q3FY19 stood at 10.8 lakh units, up 32 percent YoY and 3-wheeler sales volume were at 1.8 lakh units, down 1 percent YoY.

Domestic volume growth was at 38 percent in the 2-wheeler segment and negative 17 percent in the 3-wheeler segment.

In Q3FY19, amidst price hike undertaken in October and decline in 3-wheeler's, ICICI Securities expects domestic average selling price (ASPs) to decline to Rs 57,437 per unit.

Edelweiss Securities also expects ASPs to fall about 5 percent YoY, as the company's strategy to focus on market share at the cost of pricing weighs on it.

Overall, brokerage houses expect EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to be flat YoY and there could be a contraction in margin for the quarter.

""Despite favourable currency movement (exports for Q3FY19 were around 42 percent of sales, up 170bps QoQ but down 80bps YoY), we expect margins to decline 270bps YoY / 20bps QoQ,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher that expects EBITDA to rise 6 percent YoY.

Edelweiss Securities, which expects EBITDA growth at 0.8 percent, said operating margin is expected to dip about 40bps as operating leverage benefits are likely to be offset by higher costs and unfavourable product mix (lower share of 3-wheeler, higher share of the entry-level products in the 2-wheeler segment).

Kotak expects EBITDA margin to decline 300 bps YoY (down 50 bps QoQ) largely due to an inferior product mix and increase in discounting in economy motorcycle segment.

Bajaj Auto has shown good growth in its motorcycles and three-wheelers through the first nine months of the fiscal. Following robust volume growth in the domestic two-wheeler market, the company has increased the prices of CT100 and Platina motorcycle models.

Bajaj Auto and Triumph Motorcycles UK have forged a non-equity partnership to manufacture mid-capacity motorcycles in India. Since the final agreement is to be signed this year, these bikes from Bajaj-Triumph partnership will not be seen any time in 2019.

For now, the company would bring KTM-owned 'Husqvarna' motorcycle brand to the Indian market this year with ""half-a-dozen"" products in the pipeline. 49 percent of KTM itself is owned by Bajaj Auto and its bikes are doing pretty well in the market.

With KTM and Husqvarna, Bajaj Auto's plant in Chakan near Pune may turn into a manufacturing and export base for the brand. In addition, the company plans to launch electric version of its quadricycle Qute along with electric 3W next year, even as it gears up to introduce the conventional engine version of the quadricycle around March after much delay. Bajaj has created a capacity of 60,000 units per year for the Qute at its manufacturing facility in Aurangabad.

The company has a challenging time ahead as new safety norms in the form of ABS and CBS become mandatory for higher capacity engines and BS VI emission norms becoming mandatory from April 2020.

At present, it looks attractive, hence we recommend to buy with price target of Rs 3,042 (estimated EPS of Rs 169 for FY 19 at PE of 18x).

The bikes were to be manufactured at Bajaj's facilities but sold and exported under the Triumph brand.

CarandBike recently spoke to Rajiv Bajaj, CEO, Bajaj Auto who said that the final agreement is to be signed this year. This also means that the mid-capacity bikes will not be seen any time this year.

""As far as Triumph is concerned, I have to be very conservative about what I say, because I have a partner there who watches everything what I say. All I can tell you is that we're very close to the partnership. The work on the products has started; we have seen the actual designs coming from Triumph which, in my view, are very sexy,"" he told Carandbike.

Rajiv Bajaj also added, ""I'm really excited, but since it's a little bit in the future, I will wait for a little bit before giving you more detail about it. This year we'll focus on Husqvarna, in the near future, we'll talk more about Triumph.""

For now, Bajaj Auto will focus more on the KTM owned Hurqvarna brand. 49 percent of KTM itself is owned by Bajaj Auto and its bikes are doing pretty well in our markets. Husqvarna intends to launch the Svartpilen 401 and Vitpilen 401 sometime this year. Both bikes are based on the KTM 390 Duke platform and feature a very retro-modern design language.

With the Bajaj-Triumph partnership, expect to see some premium 300-750cc motorcycles in India. With all of the engineering and manufacturing being handled by Bajaj, we can also expect some pretty competitive prices.",289,0.9990504781405131

For many industrialists run-up to the budget means time to present wish lists to the government. However, for Rajiv Bajaj, the managing director of Bajaj Auto, watching budget presentation itself is a waste of time, let alone wish for any favour from the government. Bajaj, who claims not to have watched budget presentations in the last 28 years, said Monday that he would rather spend time working on a product than waste four hours watching the budget.

In a candid admission at an event here, Bajaj even went a step further declaring that he won't be watching it in future as well, as there ""was nothing worthwhile"" in it.

""You will be surprised to know that in the last 28 years (that) I have been in Bajaj, I have not seen Budget even a single time,"" Bajaj said when asked about his expectations from the interim Budget which is due next month. The Union Budget is one of the most watched, discussed and followed annual exercise in India among industry players as well as common man as it sets out the government's fiscal policies.

Bajaj, however, has a different take.

""There is no benefit by watching the Budget because it does not have anything which is worthwhile and without seeing Budget it has not affected my company,"" he said, adding if there were any important policy changes there would be people who would informing him ""through Whatsapp"" about those changes any way.

""Rather than sit for four hours and burden your brain, it is better to go and make a product. Nor I have seen it and nor I will see it in the future, you can report that,"" he said to a full house of media and other company executives.

Bajaj, who is well known for speaking his mind over a range of issues whether political or business, also clarified his stand on the reduction in GST on two wheelers saying he supported the call not to treat two-wheelers as luxury items.

""I do concede that to call two-wheeler or a motorcycle in this country a luxury item doesn't have a logic. It is not a luxury item...If 28 percent tax is for luxury items and 18 percent is for normal items then logically it seems to me that 18 percent (for two-wheelers) make sense,"" Bajaj said.

He further said, ""My personal opinion is that any motorcycle up to 250 cc is a mass motorcycle and I would say all such bikes are being bought by people basically for commuting. It is not that you will be taking a 150 cc bike for racing.""

While expressing his difference of opinion with other two-wheeler makers who wanted a cut in GST rate on two-wheelers in the wake of decline in sales in the past three months, Bajaj said keeping in mind cost escalations due to implementation of safety norms and upcoming BS-VI, there was indeed a need to rationalise the rate.

""Since safety norms will be coming this year and emission norms next year and between these two the average 150 cc bike, we should expect the prices to go up by around Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000. So if there is going to be such a steep increase, we will have to pass it on, most of it, not all of it.

""So if the government were to take a kind view of this and mitigate some of the the cost increase by adjusting the GST at that time, to me that seems to me a logical thing,"" Bajaj said.",599,-0.9919131994247437

Coming in as the first entry from the company for the sport segment, here is a look at some of its rivals in the Indian market.

Yamaha R15 V3

Starting this list is the oldest contender, Yamaha's R15 has established a strong foothold in India. In its third generation now, it is the fastest and most technologically advanced R15 yet and by far, Aprilia's toughest competition in India.

Bajaj Pulsar RS 200

The RS 200 was a much-needed faired addition to the Pulsar lineage. Bajaj's Pulsar range is known for its sporty demeanour and the RS200 is sure hold off well against the RS 150.

Suzuki Gixxer SF

Suzuki’s Gixxer SF is the faired version of its naked sibling, the Gixxer 155. While the fairing adds an extra 4 kilos, the aerodynamic profile of the SF gives it a slight edge over the naked version.

KTM RC 200

KTM has produced benchmark-setting motorcycles across the 200-400cc segments; both naked and faired. The RC 200 is one of the most track-oriented and dedicated sportbikes in this list and will hold itself strongly in battle.",238,0.9990907311439514

On March 29, 2018, the SEBI-appointed Uday Kotak Committee had recommended splitting up the role of the chief executive officer, managing director and chairperson for the top 500 listed companies, from April 2020.

Several listed companies have merged the two posts and the regulator feels that holding of two posts by members of the same family will lead to an overlapping of the board and management and conflict of interest, the report suggests.

As per the report, marquee companies like Bajaj Auto, Godrej Industries, Apollo Enterprises, Adani Enterprises, Jaiprakash Associates and Jindal Stainless need to rejig their management and boardroom structures as family members occupy both positions.

SEBI is not in favour of concentrating power with one individual, especially when that individual is the promotor, a person familiar with the development told the newspaper. Apex industry bodies like the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) had opposed the move in their feedback to the regulator in December 2018. They feel that the norms could be onerous and would not guarantee board leadership.

The industry body feels the board is best placed to determine whether the chairman and MD should be the same person. However, it felt the move could help achieve a better and more balanced governance structure by enabling a more effective management supervision.",255,0.999992847442627

With safety norms all set to take effect from April, it will now be mandatory for motorcycles above 125cc to be equipped with ABS (anti-lock braking system) and those below 125cc to have CBS (Combination Braking System). Manufacturers have been updating their inventory to meet upcoming norms and the latest addition will be the Bajaj Pulsar 220F.

Bajaj Auto recently updated the Pulsar 220 with fresh graphics and addition of the single-channel ABS unit will make the bike safer as well. The system will be similar to the one seen on the RS200 and NS200.

Other mechanicals still remain the same with a 220cc single-cylinder engine that produces 20.9 hp and 18.5 Nm. The bike also remains largely unchanged since its launch in 2007 with semi-fairing, vertically staked twin headlamp design and sharp angular features.

The bike is expected to be priced at a slight premium of Rs 1.05 lakh and while none of the bikes have arrived at showrooms, deliveries are expected to begin shortly.

Bajaj Auto is also working on a 250cc variant of the Puslar, which is expected sometime around 2020. The next big release from the company however will be a Dominar upgraded to included upside down forks among various other changes. But expect the Dominar to also get more expensive upon launch.",227,

Kshitij Anand

The year 2018 was one when long-term investors got plenty of opportunities to buy their choice of stocks on declines. But 2019 will be very different as headwinds faced in some sectors have now become tailwinds.

Investors should now tilt their strategy to capitalise on the sectors that are likely to benefit the most in 2019. The action will be largely stock-specific this year with focus on private as well as public sector banks, consumption theme, autos, capital goods as well as export-oriented sectors such as IT and pharma.

Earnings will be a big talking point in 2019 because India Inc. failed to deliver last year. Currently, Nifty 50 is trading at 14.5 percent premium to its 10-year average price to equity (P/E) ratio after earnings downgrade from 20 percent to 14 percent in FY19, said a report.

Irrespective of a global or political setup on the domestic front, long-term investors should focus on companies with earnings visibility, and a high margin of safety with high corporate governance standards. Investors should use dips to buy into stocks of such companies on declines.

“The major event risk for Indian markets is on account of elections. Unlike in 2014, the political outcome appears unclear. If the elections lead to a formation of a stable, business-friendly government, Nifty may end the year 2019 at 14,000,” Vivek Ranjan Misra, Head of Fundamental Research at Karvy Stock Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Given this, we favour cyclical sectors, we prefer Banks, Capital Goods. Also, growth should boost Consumption Discretionary and Autos. State-owned banks could be a dark horse in 2019, on account of a peak in NPL cycle, recovery of NPL’s via IBC and low valuations. A broad-based economic recovery will be supportive,” he said.

Misra further added that in the coming quarters, large-caps are likely to do better. Mid and small-caps are likely to underperform until their valuations become attractive. “We believe that after mid-2019, with decent time correction, conditions may be favourable for mid and small caps to perform well,” he added.

In the year 2018, the Indian market was among the better performers with a 3 percent return in rupee terms and about negative 6 percent return in USD terms.

After a flat 2018, most experts feel that 2019 should give double-digit returns although the events which are lined up for the year could throw in surprise which investors might not be prepared for.

Well, volatility is good for investing as it provides multiple entry points to investors. But, stock selection will be something which will drive the bottom line for your portfolio.

“We have consistently focused on coming out with stock ideas regularly after undertaking a deep-dive analysis into business fundamentals, earnings outlook coupled with a margin of safety on valuations and corporate governance standards,” Centrum Broking said in a note.

“We believe that inherent high volatility in the markets keeps making risk-reward highly (and many times irrationally) favourable for some high-quality businesses that we have been tracking closely for long,” it added.

Keeping this market inefficiency in mind, we have collated top ten high-conviction ideas from different experts to highlight such favourable mispricing opportunities for our investors. These stocks could give 15-100 percent return with a holding period of about a year:

Brokerage Firm: Centrum Broking

Bajaj Auto: Buy| LTP: Rs 2,657| Target: 3,075| Upside 15%

We like Bajaj Auto as it is one of the leading 2-wheeler and -Wheeler players and the largest exporter of both 2-Ws and 3-Ws from India. On the export front, the company has a market share of over 40 percent in South Asia and the Middle East and 25 percent in Latin America.

In 21 countries, which contribute 85 percent of its export sales, Bajaj is among the top two players. In the era of premiumisation, a strong product portfolio entailing iconic brands like Pulsar, Avenger, and KTM augurs wells for the company.

Considering some pains (high cost of ownership, CV and tractor cycles may peak, BSVI implementation etc.) in the domestic auto market, Bajaj Auto is safely placed with 40 percent sales exposure to export markets.

State Bank of India: Buy| LTP: Rs 295| Target: Rs 350| Upside 18%

State Bank of India is best placed to capitalise on the growth opportunity following a) improved credit environment, b) favorable bond yield movement and c) recovery from NPA accounts.

Loan growth has been on the rise (Q2’19 domestic loans grew 11.1%) and we see traction therein to continue. The reduced slippages, loan growth acceleration, and a stable interest cost have seen margins inch higher.

We see net interest margins (NIMs) inching towards 2.7 percent by end-FY20E (vs. 2.5% for FY18). Slippages have been on a decline; trends are set to remain encouraging in H2’19 as well.

While we see credit cost remain high, the softening in G-sec yield (down ~55-60bps since Sept’18) will see investment provisions reverse and in turn lower the overall provisioning charge. We also see SBI report strong trading gains in Q3’19. Valuations continue to remain attractive.

Brokerage Firm: Karvy Stock Broking

HCL Technologies: Buy| LTP: Rs 939| Target: Rs 1,167| Upside 24%

Karvy Stock Broking remains positive on the stock given its relative underperformance, upside risks to core organic growth and its potential to increase Mode 2 and Mode 3 revenues. It reiterates our buy on HCLT and values it on a consensus FY20E PE of 14.5x with a target price of Rs. 1167.

Karvy believes regaining organic growth momentum and scaling up of products and platforms business are key catalysts for rerating of the earnings and subsequently the stock.

The ongoing large deal momentum and maturing of IBM’s IP partnerships are giving visibility for the same. In the coming year, the brokerage firm expects HCLT’s stock price to be re-rated given the rerating of earnings.

Hindustan Unilever: Buy| LTP: Rs 1784| Target: Rs 2,138| Upside 20%

HUL’s acquisition of GSK Consumer garners a valuation of the entity at Rs. 317 Bn. HUL implies a leadership in the domestic HFD (Health Food Drinks) business along with soaps and detergent category

Karvy believes that the HFD portfolio growth will accelerate, given its strong direct distribution and portfolio innovation. In addition, significant cost savings are expected in FY21E, after all, synergies from the deal factor in.

To consider all benefits of the acquisition, we have assigned HUL a P/E of 54x to arrive at a target of Rs. 2138.

ICICI Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 367| Target: Rs 440| Upside 20%

The performance continues to underlie the traction in recovery and stability in the core operating metrics. The headline asset quality ratios GNPA/NNPA/Coverage improved to 8.54%/3.65%/59.5% vs 8.81%/4.19%/54.8% in Q2FY19.

The retail slippages were at Rs. 8 bn vs ~Rs. 11 bn in Q2FY19, which continue to inspire confidence. Karvy Stock Broking maintains a buy recommendation on the stock with target price at Rs. 440 valuing subsidiaries at Rs. 101 per share and core banking book at 2.3x FY20E P/B.

Larsen & Toubro: Buy| LTP: Rs 1383| Target: Rs 1,700| Upside 23%

L&T’s diversified exposure to various sectors/geographies coupled with its excellent execution capabilities across sectors and its balance sheet strength compared to other peers in the sector has resulted in strong order book build up.

The consensus values the company at 23.5x for a target price of Rs. 1700, representing an upside potential of 18%. Delay in capex cycle recovery & order execution may pose threat to the call.

ONGC: Buy| LTP: Rs 147 | Target: Rs 210| Upside 42%

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation in FY18 recorded standalone revenue of Rs. 850041 Mn, up 9 percent over FY17 on the back of impressive production and sales performances

Synergies in ONGC’s upstream and downstream business with the acquisitions of HPCL and MRPL will prove to be valued unlocking and ensure not only retention of margin but also enhancement of the same for the company. Consensus valuation for the company is PE 8.2x of FY20E EPS for the target price of Rs. 210.

Tata Motors: Buy| LTP: Rs 175| Target: Rs 259 | Upside 48%

Despite the near-term pressure on margins due to a slowdown in luxury car demand, we think that the management’s focus on improving core profitability will help recover from the stress.

After the recent correction in the stock, the brokerage firm thinks that Tata Motors is available at a cheap valuation. Karvy expects a steady recovery in the JLR business and thinks that cost reduction measures being taken will work in favour of the company.

Tata Motors is valued on a SOTP basis based on consensus estimates for a target price of Rs. 259. However, uncertainties in the JLR business continue to be the downside risk to our call.

UPL: Buy| LTP: Rs 762| Target: Rs 1,004| Upside 31%

Growth in India and LATAM jointly contribute to ~66% of total sales. Products like Sweep Power, Avancer Glow and Delma received encouraging response from the farmers in India Business, despite erratic business.

Strong backward integration, consolidation in the agrochemical space with a boost to geographical/ segment/ product mix would give strong traction to the business and aid profitability.

Factoring in strong backward integration, consolidation in the agrochemical space with a boost to geographical/ segment/ product mix and strong traction in LATAM business, the stock is a buy.

Yes Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 186| Target: Rs 410| Upside 120%

The bank’s Q2FY19 performance disappointed on asset quality notwithstanding the healthy business momentum. The slippages were much higher than anticipated nevertheless the miss was led by concentrated exposure and the bank continues to see a good possibility of recovery.

Karvy rate a “buy” on the stock with a target price of Rs. 410 valuing the stock at 2.67x FY20E P/B. The brokerage house believes that uncertainties about its top management and asset-quality issues will remain a cloud on the stock price in the near term.

Nifty50 ended with a loss of over 1 percent and closed below crucial short as well as long-term moving averages for the week ended January 4.

Global turmoil weighed on market sentiment in the first week of January, but bulls managed to push the index back above 10,700 on closing bases. On weekly basis, Nifty formed a bearish engulfing pattern.

If Nifty manages to hold above 10,750 on a closing basis, then bulls have a fighting chance of pushing the index back above 10,800-10,850 levels. However, a slip below 10,600 levels could put bears back in control, suggest experts.

“The Nifty formed a Hammer candle on a daily scale followed by Bearish Engulfing Body on a weekly scale which indicates that bulls and bears both are having a tug of war. Formation of Hammer suggests a bounce back move while the formation of Bearish candle on weekly scale suggests multiple barriers at higher zones,” Chandan Taparia, Associate Vice President, Analyst-Derivatives, Motilal Oswal Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“It has been making lower highs - lower lows from last three trading sessions and needs to negate the same by holding above 10750-10777 zones to witness a short-term bounce towards 10850 and then 10929-10985 zones while on the downside immediate supports exists at 10650-10600 zones,” he said.

Taparia further added that the index has been forming alternative positive and negative weekly close from last eight weeks and got stuck in a broader trading range in between 10450 to 10985 zones so requires a decisive range breakout to commence the next leg of the rally.

Here is a list of top 10 short-term trading ideas that could give 3-12% return in the next 1 month:

Analyst: Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com

Escorts Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 724| Target: Rs. 759 | Stop-loss: Rs 680 | Upside: 5%

Escorts maintained an upward trajectory for over the past one month after a making a healthy consolidation from a higher price-band of 722-720 odd levels towards a low of 585 levels.

It took strong support at the rangebound level of 560-550 zone to reserve the trend into bullish trajectory where it managed to break out from its 100-days moving average level placed at 711 levels.

The scrip also witnessed a decent volume growth during the same period and formed a small bullish candlestick pattern on both weekly as well as daily price chart.

The momentum indicator outlined a positive divergence in price with its RSI at 63 levels, coupled with MACD managing to make a bullish crossover in past to trade above its Signal-Line.

We have a buy recommendation for Escorts which is currently trading at Rs. 722.20

Hindalco Industries: Sell| LTP: Rs 210| Target: Rs. 201 | Stop-loss: Rs. 228| Downside: 4%

Hindalco is trading in a negative trajectory during the entire week and slipped below its crucial level of 200-days moving average placed at 228 odd levels, and thus witnessed a sustained selloff throughout the week.

Although, it made a decent rally after forming low of 192 levels toward a high of 259 levels on its six-month price chart, but it failed to continue with momentum to trade in sideways direction mostly favoring bearish regime.

Despite its attempt to reverse the trend in the previous week, the scrip witnessed a selloff in last four sessions which signaled a bearish sentiment. It formed a long bearish candlestick pattern on weekly price chart coupled with small bearish on its daily chart.

Further, a weekly RSI stood at 41 odd levels indicating negative divergence, and MACD continues to trade below its Signal-Line. We have a sell recommendation for Hindalco which is currently trading at Rs. 209.20

Jindal Steel & Power: Sell| LTP: Rs 152| Target: Rs 142| Stop-loss: Rs. 155 | Downside: 6%

Jindal Steel & Power remained in a consolidation phase in last six-month falling from a higher level of 240 towards a low of 160 odd levels.

Although, it marginally rebounded towards 190 odd levels but it failed to sustain the momentum to further form a low of 140 levels, and subsequently it fell below its 200-days moving an average of 189 levels on closing basis.

The scrip currently trades below all the moving average levels which indicate ongoing selling pressure. The scrip formed a solid bearish candlestick pattern on weekly chart coupled with long bearish candlestick pattern on the daily price chart.

The momentum indicator continued to outline weak trend with its weekly RSI at 36 level which signals downward divergence in price coupled with MACD trading below its Signal-Line on the weekly chart. We have a sell recommendation for Jindal Steel which is currently trading at Rs. 146.50.

Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Vedanta: Buy| LTP: Rs 193| Target: Rs 203| Stop Loss: Rs 183| Upside 5%

After the recent fall, this counter made a bullish reversal formation as it registered a 'Piercing' pattern in the last session from around its critical support of Rs 190.

Hence, as long it trades above 187 kinds of levels, one should initiate long positions in this counter for a target of Rs 203 with a stop of Rs 185.

Bharti Infratel: Buy| LTP: Rs 284| Target: Rs 320| Stop Loss: Rs 270| Return 12%

This counter appears to have registered a consolidation breakout after a prolonged fall from the highs of 481. Besides, it decisively closed above its 100-days moving average (DMA) which in the past, suppressed its pullback attempts suggesting the possibility of a sustained short-term rally.

Hence, traders can adopt a two-pronged strategy and buy now and on declines around 275 for a target of 320 and a stop below 270 on a closing basis.

Bajaj Auto: Buy| LTP: Rs 2,734| Target: Rs 2,830| Stop Loss: Rs 2,690| Return 3%

Price patterns of Bajaj Auto are quite interesting as this counter has not participated in the recent fall and appears to have made a decent base around Rs 2700 levels.

On the pullback attempts from the said base, it can easily head towards Rs 2,830 kind of levels. Positional traders should buy into this counter for a target of 2,830 with a stop below 2690 on a closing basis.

Brokerage Firm: SMC Global Securities Ltd

DCB Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 173.80| Target: Rs 194| Stop Loss: Rs 158| Return 12%

The stock closed at Rs 173.80 on 4th January, 2019. It made a 52-week low at Rs 139.85 on 1st October 2018 and a 52-week high of Rs. 206.50 on 9th January 2018.

The 200 days Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) of the stock on the daily chart is currently at Rs 166.49

As we can see on the chart that stock was consolidated in the range of 140 to 174 levels for three months and formed a “Continuation Triangle” on weekly charts which is bullish in nature. Last week, the stock gained over 4 percent and has given the breakout of pattern and also managed to close above the same.

So buying momentum may continue for coming days. Therefore, one can buy in the range of 171-172 levels for the upside target of 190-194 levels with a stop loss below Rs 158.

Kajaria Ceramics: Buy| LTP: Rs 506| Target: Rs 550| Stop Loss: Rs 480| Return 8%

The stock closed at Rs 506.10 on 04th January, 2019. It made a 52-week low at Rs 310 on 25th October 2018 and a 52-week high of Rs. 764.90 on 10th January 2018. The 200-days Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) of the stock on the daily chart is currently at Rs 480.59.

The stock has recovered sharply from a yearly low of 310 and tested 500 levels in short span of time. Moreover, it was forming an “Inverted Head and Shoulder” pattern on weekly charts, which is considered to be bullish.

Last week, stock registered gains over 4 percent and has given the neckline breakout of pattern and also closed near week’s high along with the volumes, which indicates buying is more aggressive for the stock.

Therefore, one can buy in the range of 500-502 levels for the upside target of 540-550 levels with a stop loss below 480.

Brokerage Firm: Karvy Stock Broking

Apollo Hospitals: Buy| LTP: Rs 1291| Target: Rs 1355| Stop Loss: Rs 1220| Return 5%

Apollo Hospital Ltd has traded the week with a positive bias. The stock has closed the week with a positive return of more than 4 percent.

Adding to that, the stock is trading well above its major moving averages on daily charts with positive price structure, indicating positive momentum in the stock is likely to continue in the coming trading sessions as well.

On oscillator front, the 14-period RSI has given positive crossover with the 9-day signal line and poised with a bullish bias, indicating that stock is likely to continue its outperformance in the coming trading sessions as well.

The Parabolic SAR (Stop & Reverse) on the daily chart is trading below the price which reflects that buying will remain intact in the counter in the coming trading sessions.

From the above observation of price momentum, it seems the stock is likely to trade with positive bias in the coming trading sessions also.

Therefore, we recommend Smart Traders to initiate a Long position in the counter around 1275 levels with a stop loss placed below 1220 for the higher target of 1355 levels.

Container Corporation of India: Buy| LTP: Rs 678| Target: Rs 700| Stop Loss: Rs 658| Return 3%

The momentum indicators like 14 period RSI on the daily and weekly charts is trading above its signal line indicating a bullish bias in the near term.

On the derivative front, the stock has seen short closure post expiry of the December 2018 series, and some long addition was also witnessed in the last few trading session.

Hence, we recommend Smart Traders to initiate Long position near 675 levels for the higher target of 700 levels, keeping a stop loss below 658 levels.

A section of market participants considers Mr Modi as Virat Kohli of politics who can deliver for the economy in a better fashion than others, Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q) It looks like market started on a fairly muted note with the Nifty50 falling below its crucial long-term as well as short-term moving averages? Do you think it is time to go 'short' or wait for a breakdown below 10533-10500 levels?

A) At this juncture, the technical picture is looking somewhat mixed with both positive and negative signs. If you closely observe the data of the last two months then it seems that the market is roughly moving in a range of 10,950 on the upside and 10300 levels on the downside.

Last November was a good month which witnessed a strong up move from the lows of 10,341 – 10,923. Interestingly, December tested the lows of November but recouped all the intra month losses only to close near to its monthly high of 10,985.

This kind of range-bound price behaviour is only pointing towards a consolidation range thereby negating 'sell' signals which we are getting on the long-term charts that got generated in the month of last October.

Hence, there may not be a multi-week positional trading opportunity on the short side but short-term trade may remain on both sides.

Unless the market breaches 10,280 levels on the long-term charts there may not be a bigger cut below 10,000 kinds of levels.

Right now, it can be the indecisive nature rather nervousness of market participants ahead of the big political showdown which is creating this kind of trading large trading range.

Upsides look capped around 11,000 and once the said hurdle is conquered then we may see a slightly higher target of 11,400.

Recently, there was almost a consensus among analyst fraternity that market will go down towards 9,500 kinds of levels and seldom gets such consensus adhered to by the market.

Q) Do you think nervousness of market participants ahead of a political event like general elections is capping upsides? Can such worries be justified?

A) A section of market participants considers Mr Modi as Virat Kohli of politics who can deliver for the economy in a better fashion than others.

Hence, they fear that a coalition government without proper majority may derail reforms and hence stock market rally too. But, to some extent these fears may not be true as pointed out by historical data.

For instance, P Chidambaram's budget in 1997 under the coalition government headed by Deve Gowda won the accolades of the industry as Dream budget.

Similarly, best reforms were introduced by Dr Manmohan Singh under a minority government led by PV Narasimha Rao.

So these fears to some extent can’t be justified as a non-BJP government need not necessarily lead to gloom and doom kind of situation for the markets.

Yet times coalition governments may help the country by discovering new leaders or hidden talent as seasoned bureaucrat like Dr Manmohan Singh was transformed into an able political leader and went on to become Prime Minister for 10 years.

Q) Where is market heading in January ahead of events like Vote on Account?

A) Technically speaking, the markets shall remain range bound between 11,000 – 10,500 in the month of January unless a breakout or breakdown is witnessed going forward.

Events like Vote On Account may not majorly influence market direction as it mainly accounts for expenditure side of government for the next couple of months before the election without scope for announcing big-ticket reforms as priorities differ from one government to other.

Q) What are charts of Bank Nifty suggesting?

A) Surprisingly, Bank Nifty has shown a greater amount of resilience as it managed to sustain above its medium to long-term critical moving averages.

In fact this strength may be partly responsible for keeping Nifty too in a larger range without breaking down.

This kind of strength can be expected to continue in this index as long as RBI keeps some sort of carrot dangling in front of financials with all positive noises and we will not be surprised even if this index moves towards 28,000 kinds of levels before the political event. On the flips side, for time being, 26,000 looks like a worst in case of a normal correction.

Q) What is your call on the small & midcap? What does the trading behavior tell you?

A) Sense and sanity appear to be back in mid and small-cap space as their participation in recent times has improved on the back of positive chart formations.

They can remain market performers and selectively few can outperform going forward. Hence, long-term investment can be considered in quality names from this space as worst appears to be over.

Q) Top three trading strategies for the coming week with an investment horizon of 1 month?

A) Vedanta: Buy| LTP: Rs 193| Target: Rs 203| Stop Loss: Rs 183| Upside 5%

After the recent fall, this counter made a bullish reversal formation as it registered a 'Piercing' pattern in the last session from around its critical support of Rs 190.

Hence, as long it trades above 187 kinds of levels, one should initiate long positions in this counter for a target of Rs 203 with a stop of Rs 185.

Bharti Infratel: Buy| LTP: Rs 284| Target: Rs 320| Stop Loss: Rs 270| Return 12%

This counter appears to have registered a consolidation breakout after a prolonged fall from the highs of 481. Besides, it decisively closed above its 100-days moving average (DMA) which in the past, suppressed its pullback attempts suggesting the possibility of a sustained short-term rally.

Hence, traders can adopt a two-pronged strategy and buy now and on declines around 275 for a target of 320 and a stop below 270 on a closing basis.

Bajaj Auto: Buy| LTP: Rs 2,734| Target: Rs 2,830| Stop Loss: Rs 2,690| Return 3%

Price patterns of Bajaj Auto are quite interesting as this counter has not participated in the recent fall and appears to have made a decent base around Rs 2700 levels.

After a deep-dive analysis into business fundamentals, earnings outlook coupled with a margin of safety on valuations and corporate governance standards, Centrum Broking has come out with stock ideas with 1-year investment horizon.

The inherent high volatility in the markets keeps making risk-reward highly, and many times irrationally, favourable for some high-quality businesses. Keeping this market inefficiency in mind, the brokerage firm came out with their top five high conviction ideas, said a report by Centrum Broking.

These are sound businesses characterised by high operating and free cash flow generation coupled with good ROEs and high dividend payout ratios.

Here is a list of top five high-conviction picks from Centrum Broking that investors could look at in January for a time horizon of 1 year:

ACC: Buy| Target: Rs 1,820

We like ACC owing to its attractive valuations amid healthy cashflow generation and return ratios. The recent announcement for a major capacity increase after a long pause of almost a decade affirms the promoters focus on growing India business.

Rising industry utilisation should bolster pricing power, recent material supply agreement with Ambuja and sustenance of recent correction in diesel and petcoke prices should further provide profit tailwinds.

Bajaj Auto: Buy| Target: Rs 3,075

We like Bajaj Auto as it is one of the leading 2W and 3W players and the largest exporter of both 2Ws and 3Ws from India.

On the export front, the company has a market share of 40 percent+ in South Asia and the Middle East and 25 percent in Latin America. In 21 countries, which contribute 85 percent of its export sales, Bajaj is among the top two players.

In the era of premiumisation, a strong product portfolio entailing iconic brands like Pulsar, Avenger, and KTM augurs wells for the company.

Considering some pains (high cost of ownership, CV and tractor cycles may peak, BSVI implementation, etc.) in the domestic auto market, Bajaj Auto is safely placed with 40 percent sales exposure to export markets.

DCB Bank: Buy| Target: Rs 205

DCB Bank with is a well-defined product portfolio and customer segment stands to gain from the under-penetrated and under-served retail (self-employed) and SME segment, its key area of presence.

The recent past has seen loan growth accelerate and the momentum should continue. While H1FY19 have seen margins decline, we believe the same is set to inch upwards given 70-95 bps increase in MCLR rates since March 2018.

Our calculation suggests that the newly added branches have started to break-even. This is evident in reducing cost/asset ratio.

Capital position remains strong and supplements strong loan growth. We see DCB Bank report 1.1 percent RoA/14 percent RoE by end-FY20E.

State Bank of India: Buy| Target: Rs 350

State Bank of India is best placed to capitalise on the growth opportunity following a) improved credit environment, b) favourable bond yield movement and c) recovery from NPA accounts.

Loan growth has been on the rise (domestic loans grew 11.1 percent in Q2FY19 ) and we see traction therein to continue. The reduced slippages, loan growth acceleration, and a stable interest cost have seen margins inch higher. We see NIM inching towards 2.7 percent by end-FY20E (vs 2.5 percent for FY18).

Slippages have been on a decline, trends are set to remain encouraging in H2FY19 as well. While we see credit cost remain high, the softening in G-sec yield (down 55-60bps since September 2018) will see investment provisions reverse and in turn lower the overall provisioning charge.

We also see SBI report strong trading gains in Q3FY19, and valuations continue to remain attractive.

Tata Metaliks: Buy| Target: Rs 1,015

We like Tata Metaliks (TML) as its DI pipe business boasts of an industry-leading cost structure, solid demand drivers and strong entry barriers.

With commissioning of PCI project by Q4FY19E coupled with several other productivity improvement initiatives, TML is expected to continue delivering steady earnings growth over FY19-20E despite limited volume growth as its plants are running at 100 percent+ utilisations currently.

TML also has plans to expand its market share in the high margin DI pipes business from 11 percent currently to 18-20 percent range in 3-5 years and we expect management to announce expansion towards the same soon.

We see valuations attractive at FY19E P/E of 8.7x with reasonable scope for a re-rating given the strong balance sheet and attractive return ratios.

Bajaj Auto has just released another cosmetic update for the Pulsar 150 Classic. The base variant of the bike gets three new colour schemes as part of its Neon collection -- Neon Yellow, Neon Red and Neon Silver.

Priced at Rs 64,998 (ex-showroom, Delhi), the Neon Yellow also gets a matte grey paint, another first for a Bajaj Pulsar.

The neon accents are seen on the bike's badges, the grab rail, the mesh on the side cowl, a small insert in the headlamp unit and highlights on the alloy rims as well.

However, there are no other changes to the bike. It continues to use the 149 cc single-cylinder engine that produces 14 PS at 8,000 rpm and 13.4 Nm of peak torque at 6,000 rpm.

Suspension remains identical too and braking is taken care of by a 240 mm disc upfront and a 130 mm drum at the rear. The bike does not feature ABS.

""Pulsar has been the number one sports bike in India for the past 17 years.

Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj on Thursday described the launch of the 100-cc variant of the commuter bike Discover as the ""biggest blunder"" of his career as it stunted the company at the No 2 position.

He noted that the Discover was a differentiating product when it was launched in 125-cc format, ""offering mileage with a little fun,"" which was evident from the rising volumes.

However, Bajaj rued that the company is still the No. 2 player (in terms of bikes volumes) in the country because of the mistake it had made with the lower variant launch of the Discover and that things would have been different if it hadn't done so.

""Greed came in. Marketing people said if the 125-cc Discover sells so much then how many would a 100-cc Discover sell? We went ahead and made the 100-cc Discover. We lost our position and five years later we lost our performance too...

""We started off as a point of difference, with a different perception and a USP, but we ended up being a 'me too' product. Me too is bad in life and marketing,"" he said, speaking at an event in the city.

He, however, sounded upbeat about the prospects of the KTM, an Austrian racing brand that the company had invested in 2007.

He recalled that when Bajaj Auto invested in KTM in 2007, it was making only 65,000 motorcycles, and was still the second largest European motorcycle brand. On the other hand Harley Davidson was averaging 3.5 lakhs.

But the not any longer as Harley has been declining since the is estimated to finish at 2.4 lakh units this year, whiled KTM will finish with 2.7 lakh units, he said.

Bajaj Auto is also planning to enter the e-vehicle space next year, even though he lamented that the industry has been given a step-motherly treatment to e-vehicles, by launching cheap variants.

""We could have made a Tesla on two-wheels or a Tesla on three-wheels and created different news.... we will try and do that in 2019 now,"" he said.",354,-0.13357516527175903

Festival season 2018 that started in September was worst for auto companies in last three-four years. Demand sentiment took a hit due to increasing costs following a rise in insurance cost, fuel inflation and higher interest rates.

In a conference call hosted by Motilal Oswal, Ashish Kale, President, Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), said passenger vehicle (PV) and 2-wheeler retail demand declined 18-20 percent each YoY during the festive period (Navratri + Diwali) - the worst in the past 3-4 years.

He further said, ""2-wheeler retail declined 20-35 percent during Navratri festival. The combined decline (Navratri + Diwali) was lower at 18-20 percent as rural sales picked up during Diwali. Inquiries-to-conversion rate in 2-wheeler space was better than that in PVs (where demand continues to be muted). Post-Diwali inquiries, too, remained weak.""

These concerns also reflected in stock prices as auto and auto ancillaries stocks corrected up to 30 percent since the start of September.

Kale said the lower inquiries-to-conversion rate post the Diwali festival also led to high inventory levels of 40-55 days in PVs and 2-wheeler segments.

Despite this weak demand, the finance availability was normal across segments during festivals.

However, financiers are indicating that they would be stringent with disbursements going forward given the liquidity crunch, Motilal Oswal said.

It further said the likelihood of mandatory third-party insurance for commercial vehicle (CV) will be a concern as it accounts for around 70 percent of CV insurance cost.

Motilal Oswal said its top picks in autos are Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors and Motherson Sumi among largecaps, and Ashok Leyland and Exide Industries among midcaps. It also considers Mahindra & Mahindra as the best bet on a rural market recovery.

Here is the list of 11 auto and auto ancillary stocks which could give 7-40 percent return over a period of one year:

While higher fuel prices, insurance cost and interest rates will impact near-term demand, Motilal Oswal expects normalisation of sales, going forward.

""For second half of FY19, we are building in domestic 2-wheeler growth of 29.3 / 9.9 / 13.3 percent for Bajaj Auto / Hero MotoCorp / TVS Motor, respectively. For Maruti Suzuki, we expect 7.7 percent domestic PV growth,"" the research house said.

The brokerage prefers four-wheeler stocks over 2-wheeler and CVs due to their stronger volume growth and a stable competitive environment.

""While we expect 2-wheeler volumes to benefit from a rural recovery in the near term, competitive intensity remains high due to changing customer preferences,"" it reasoned.",425,-0.2567168799313632

Nalanda Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

The company’s 2nd quarter results were a marginal miss majorly due to lower margins. Its volumes grew higher by 25% YoY to 13.4L units in Q2FY19, but the realization declined by 2.7% YoY to Rs. 60,256, impacted due to inferior product mix and increase in the discounting. The volume sales were higher in the lower CC segment, where it has reported a 50% YoY growth during the quarter led by CT100 & Platina. The top-line grew well by 21.6% YoY to Rs. 8,071 crores in Q2FY19. On the operational front, the EBITDA Margin decelerated by 280bps YoY to 18.0% in Q2FY19, impacted as the company has shifted its focus on the domestic entry level bikes to gain the market share (which worked well). Additionally, increase in the commodity prices & slow start to the festivals increased the discounting in the market, which has added further pain. The bottom-line increased by 3.7% YoY to Rs. 1,152 crores in Q2FY19 was due to poor operational performance and higher effective tax rate, which increased by 350bps YoY to 30.3% for the quarter.

Outlook

The company has been trading at a forward P/E of 16.0x in the past few years and looking at the current domestic environment, we have reduced the earnings multiple to 13.6x plus KTM and Cash per Share takes the fair value to 2,978 per share, seeking an upside of 20.3% from the current levels.

LKP's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto posted a mixed bag of numbers in Q2 FY19, though volumes in the quarter grew by a handsome 25% yoy and 9.2% qoq to its highest ever quarterly volumes of 1.34 mn units. Despite such a strong show, the realizations dropped by 3% yoy and 1.3% qoq to Rs 58,470/unit. This was a result of adverse product mix where the company sold more volumes of CT 100 and Platina belonging to the mass/M1 segment. This was due to company’s strategy of gaining market share in the M1 segment by providing heavy discounts and subvention schemes. As a result of this, EBITDA margins touched lows of 16.8% also thanks to the RM price growth. RM costs as a % of sales grew up to 73.8% from 72.9% qoq and 70.7% yoy as metal prices have firmed up. On the back of muted operating profitability at the operating levels, despite higher other income, the bottomline has grown by 3.7% to Rs 11.5 mn.

Outlook

Higher base of last year may bring down the 3W growth in H2 and in FY 20E, while no clarity on further opening of permits will steal the upside in margins coming from this segment. Implementation of safety and emission norms in the next 1-2 years will create a dilemma over increasing price v/s discounting. Viewing these factors, we continue with our HOLD rating on the stock with a reduced estimates and target of Rs 2,676.

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto (BAL) reported muted performance in Q2FY19 primarily tracking change in product mix with skewness more towards entry level products (CT100 & platina) in the domestic and export markets Total volumes for Q2FY19 stood at 13.4 lakh units (up 25% YoY). Total 2W sales volume in Q2FY19 was at 11.3 lakh units, up 23% YoY while 3W sales volume were at 2.1 lakh units, up 39% YoY. Domestic volume growth was at 19% in the 2W segment & 32% in the 3W segment. Domestic realisations stood at Rs 61,194/unit in Q2FY19 vs. Rs 59,771/unit in Q1FY19 (up Rs 1423 on QoQ basis). Total Op. income in Q2FY19 stood at Rs 7987 crore (up 21.4% YoY). EBITDA in Q2FY19 stood at Rs 1343 crore with corresponding EBITDA margins at a new low of 16.8%, down 290 bps YoY. The reported PAT grew marginally 3.7% YoY to Rs 1152.5 crore.

Outlook

Chasing growth at the expense of profitability is a cause of concern and not structurally positive for BAL as it will tend to dent its return ratios. Incorporating the positive momentum witnessed on the volume front in H1FY19, we now expect total volume at BAL to grow at a CAGR of 17.3% over FY18-20E to 55 lakh units in FY20E. Consequent Sales, PAT CAGR is expected at 15.7%, 9.8% respectively over FY18-20E. We value BAL at Rs 2410 using SOTP (13.6x P/E on Standalone FY20E EPS of Rs 169.5 + Rs 106 as value of stake in KTM) and assign a HOLD rating on the stock.

Bajaj Auto’Q2 FY19 result was a mixed bag. Topline continues to witness strong growth while operating margin posted a significant decline. Operating margin was marred by adverse raw material (RM) prices and the price cut initiated by the management in the entry-level motorcycle segment. Export market has been doing phenomenally well for the company and saw strong volume growth. We continue to like the business, given the rupee depreciation, positive growth outlook in the export market, strong three-wheeler (3W) demand in India and reasonable valuations.

Quarter in numbers

On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, net operating revenue clocked 21.4 percent growth on very strong volume growth (25 percent). Average realisation, however, witnessed a YoY decline of 2.9 percent due to price action initiated by the management in the entry-level segment.

Volume: All segments are firing

In terms of volume performance, Bajaj Auto registered an overall volume growth of 25 percent, aided by a 20.3 percent growth in the domestic market and 32.8 percent growth in exports.

Within the domestic market, motorcycles and 3W segments registered a YoY growth of 18.6 percent and 31.6 percent, respectively. Motorcycle segment volumes grew on the back of price cuts in the entry-level segment and strong demand for mid-executive and premium bikes. The 3W segment, on the other hand, continues to perform well on the back of an end of the Permit Raj.

The company achieved the highest ever monthly export volume in September led by strong demand in Africa, South Asia and Middle East.

Operating performance marred by price cut and RM price riseIn line with the new strategy of gaining market share in the entry-level motorcycle segment, the management initiated a price cut in that segment. This, coupled with a rise in the raw material prices, have impacted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin negatively, down 291.8 basis points (100 bps = 1 percentage point) at 16.8 percent.

Factors that work in favour of the company:

Focus on market share in the domestic motorcycle segmentBajaj Auto has started gaining market share in the 2W segment. This is primarily on the back of aggressive pricing strategy adopted by the company. Despite subdued industry demand, the company registered an 18.6 percent volume growth in Q2 FY19. This led to a 170 bps expansion in overall domestic market share, which stood at 18.6 percent. The management has guided at achieving 20 percent market share in motorcycle segment by FY19-end and has a long term target of 24 percent.

Operating margin: Product mix, depreciating rupee to provide respiteEBITDA margin has come off from around 20 percent levels it achieved in the last few quarters owing to negative pricing actions taken by the company in the entry-level bike segment. The management said the negative pricing action exist only on 14 percent of total turnover and that could be offset by margin of its premium segment. In fact, the management mentioned that Platina is doing well in the entry-level segment and is profitable for the company. Also, strong traction in sports bikes and new launches in premium segment would aid margin.

Recent rupee depreciation is expected to aid margin. The management said they would be able to realise over Rs 70 per dollar in Q3 and Q4 and above Rs 73 per dollar starting from Q1 FY20 as compared to Rs 69.4 per dollar which it realised in Q2 FY19.

No permit regime for alternate fuelled 3Ws

The overall 3W market continues to gain strength after end of the Permit Raj in Maharashtra and new permits in Delhi. This has led the company to post strong volume growth in 3W segment. In fact, it registered a 32 percent volume growth in the 3W segment.

In a recent announcement, the government has abolished the permit regime for 3W, fuelled by alternate fuel. This is expected to augur well for the company, given its 86 percent market share in the space.

In light of strong demand expectations, the company has planned to expand 3W capacity to 1 million units from 0.85 million units.

Improving exportsExports seem to be stabilising and is expected to benefit Bajaj Auto as it generates more than 40 percent of its revenue from overseas. In Q2, it registered a 33 percent growth in export volumes. It currently has a 45 percent market share in Africa and that may rise to 50 percent in years to come.

The management said they would continue to focus on exports and new markets and has guided at exports of 2 million units in FY19, up from 1.6 million units sold in FY18.

Reasonable valuationAmid overall market volatility, the stock has corrected 29 percent making valuations reasonable. The company is currently trading at 15 times and 13 times FY19 and FY20 projected earnings, respectively.

Two-wheeler and three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto's second quarter (July-September) standalone profit grew by 3.65 percent YoY on weak operating margin performance and higher tax cost, but revenue clocked double digit growth.

Profit during the quarter increased to Rs 1,152.48 crore against Rs 1,111.9 crore in corresponding period last fiscal.

The company has registered a healthy 21.63 percent on year growth in second quarter revenue at Rs 7,986.8 crore with sales volume growth of 25 percent.

The company sold 13.39 lakh units, the highest ever, in the quarter ended September 2018 against 10.71 lakh units sold in same period last year.

About 39 percent YoY growth in the three-wheeler segment, 19 percent growth in domestic bike volumes led by strong growth in CT100, and 30 percent growth in two-wheeler export volumes (which contributed around 40 percent of total sales) boosted total sales volume of the company in Q2.

Bajaj Auto said overall share in the domestic motorcycle market increased to 18.6 percent as against 16.9 percent in Q2FY18. ""For September 2018, overall share in domestic motorcycle market was 20.1 percent.""

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased 3.4 percent on year to Rs 1,343 crore but margin contracted 296 basis points to 16.8 percent on inferior product mix and increase in discounting.

Two- and three-wheeler maker, Bajaj Auto, is expected to report healthy growth in revenue on strong volumes in Q2 but operational numbers could be hit due to inferior product mix and increase in discounts. The company will announce its earnings for the quarter ended September 2018 on October 24.

Overall, brokerage houses expect revenue growth of more than 20 percent year-on-year amid a depreciating rupee as sales volumes increased 25 percent YoY.

About 39 percent YoY growth in the three-wheeler segment, 19 percent growth in domestic bike volumes led by strong growth in CT100, and 30 percent growth in two-wheeler export volumes (which contributed around 40 percent of total sales) boosted total sales volume of the company in Q2. Total motorcycle volume increased 22.6 percent YoY.

Kotak expects revenues to increase 22 percent YoY as average selling prices (ASPs) likely to decline by about 2.3 percent YoY due to an inferior product mix.

Motilal Oswal expects realisation to fall 3 percent YoY (down 1.5 percent QoQ) led by deterioration in the product mix. Consequently, net sales are expected to increase by 21.3 percent YoY (up 7.6 percent QoQ), it said.

Realisations are expected to fall by 2 percent QoQ on account of adverse mix within motorcycles and higher incentives, Emkay Research said.

Profit

According to brokerage houses, profit is expected to be in range of 4 percent de-growth to 8 percent growth year-on-year due to weak operational performance.

ICICI Securities expects profit to increase by 5.4 percent YoY to Rs 1,172 crore, Prabhudas Lilladher expects 8.6 percent growth and Axis Capital 6 percent, but Motilal Oswal sees profit declining 4.2 percent YoY and 4.5 percent QoQ.

Operational Numbers

Overall brokerage houses expect operating profit margin to decline YoY due to discounts and weak product mix.

""We expect the EBITDA margin to decline by 250 bps YoY (flat QoQ) largely due to the inferior product mix and increase in discounting in the economy motorcycle segment,"" Kotak said.

Motilal Oswal expects EBITDA margin to contract by 290bps YoY (down 50bps QoQ) to 16.8 percent while Axis Capital feels margin may contract 286bps YoY on higher raw material costs along with higher share of CT100 (negative EBITDA margin).

A robust growth in volumes has pushed Bajaj Auto's market share to a four year high, aided by price drops in two key high volume models.

A fifth of the domestic motorcycle market is now controlled by the Pune-based manufacturer of Pulsar and Avenger. The company recorded a market share of 20.06 percent by September-end, the highest since October 2014 when it recorded a 20.25 percent share in the domestic motorcycle market.

The company had been striving hard to hit the 20 percent market share for the past several quarters. Despite multiple launches backed by relentless marketing efforts and sales promotion exercises, volume growth remained insignificant.

In June last year, its motorcycle market share fell to a record low of 11.21 percent after its ploy of multiple launches in the budget and commuter segment failed to yield desired results.

The Rajiv Bajaj-led company has seen a year-on-year jump of 27 percent in volumes during the first half of this fiscal to 1.28 million units.

This growth was double than the industry’s growth of 13.17 percent during the same six months at 7.37 million units as against 6.51 million units sold in the same period last year, according to data supplied by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).

In March, Bajaj Auto cut prices on the CT 100 by Rs 2,000 making it the cheapest geared two-wheeler on sale in Indiaat at a shade over Rs 30,000. The gap between the CT 100 and the HF Dawn, Hero MotoCorp’s most affordable bike, is more than Rs 5,000 as of today.

Bajaj Auto also reduced price of the entry variant of the Pulsar 150, christened Pulsar Classic, by Rs 2,500. Volumes of another entry bike Bajaj Platina has also seen a resultant spurt after the company added an electric start feature.

Though the price cut was met with surprise and disappointment by stakeholders and analysts, fearing profit margin and contraction, it did bring cheer to retail buyers and Bajaj dealers.

The CT 100 is very popular in the price sensitive entry-level bike segment. Buyers of this model are mostly from the rural and semi-rural markets for which maximum mileage is top priority. The CT 100 is the market leader in its segment and provides a rated mileage of nearly 90 km per litre.

The entry variant of the Pulsar 150 is popular in the urban space and was already the market leader in the premium bike segment. Following the price correction, the price gap between the entry Pulsar 150 and the next variant of the same model is Rs 10,000.

Hero MotoCorp remains the leader in the motorcycle segment with a market share of 51 percent. Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India, the second largest two-wheeler maker, trails third with a share of 15 percent.",477,0.40093151926994325

The stellar rise in Royal Enfield’s popularity and volumes will likely remain unchallenged for some more time as Honda is yet to finalise its product offensive in the same segment.

A senior official from Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI), the second largest two-wheeler maker, said though the niche segment controlled by Royal Enfield is ‘very important’ to the company, it is yet to have a challenger brand.

“That is one of the biggest challenges for us. We have been undertaking customer surveys and product development. As of today, I am sorry to say we don’t have anything concrete to say”, Minoru Kato, President and CEO, HMSI told Moneycontrol.

At present, Honda does not have a product in its global portfolio that could be a like-to-like challenger to the Royal Enfield range. Honda has the CB1100 that carries the 1970s styling, strapped with a four cylinder engine unit, along with the Rebel, a modern day cruiser.

PeersHonda has been most vocal about its ambitions in the segment that is otherwise dominated by Royal Enfield.

But others too have plans.

Classic Legends, the vertical of Mahindra & Mahindra’s two wheeler business, will bring back the Jawa brand to India with the launch of a 300cc bike on November 15. With a retro, modern classic look, the Jawa will compete against the 350cc models of Royal Enfield. This will be the first real attempt by any company to take on Royal Enfield’s product range.

Two years ago Pune-based Bajaj Auto did try to position its roadster called Dominar against Royal Enfield backed by an advertising and marketing campaign that mocked bikes of Royal Enfield. However, the Dominar, which is Bajaj’s most powerful bike sells just around 1,500-2,000 units a month.

New teamLast year, Honda formed a team that was tasked to hunt for solutions against the Royal Enfield range. This even included a bike that could be modelled around the Scrambler, a modern-day roadster from Volkswagen-owned Italian biking giant Ducati.

But Honda’s motorcycle range has not had a very fruitful run in the domestic market. More than half of Honda’s domestic volumes accrue from sale of scooters, even though its motorcycle offering of 11 models is more than twice the five models that the scooter segment sells.

At 1.1 million units, Honda’s sales grew 6.26 percent, less than half of the industry’s growth of 13.18 percent during the first half of the current financial year, according to data supplied by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).

Honda’s current motorcycle range have engines ranging between 110cc-250cc and are targeted at the commuter and budget performance segment. Royal Enfield’s smallest engine is a single cylinder 350cc and the biggest will be seen on the soon-to-be-launched twin cylinder 650cc.

In continuation of our weekly tactical call to guide investors to look at large cap investment opportunities amid market volatility, we have chosen Bajaj Auto as the pick for the week.

With subdued demand on the back of rising oil prices, increase in interest rates, higher compulsory long-term insurance prices, rainfall deficit, and delayed festive season, the share price of Bajaj Auto has witnessed 27 percent correction from its 52-week high. The fall makes the valuation very attractive (14.3 times FY20 projected earnings) for the company with strong fundamentals and quality management.

Factors at play for Bajaj Auto

Improving export markets: The overall export market seems to be stabilising and is expected to benefit Bajaj Auto as it generates more than 40 percent of its revenue from those markets. In Q2 FY19, the company registered a YoY export volume growth of 33 percent. Rupee depreciation is also expected to aid revenue growth from export markets.

The Bajaj Auto management has indicated that they would continue to focus on export and new markets and has guided to selling 2 million units in export market in FY19, up from 1.6 million units sold in FY18.

No permit regime for alternate fuel-run three-wheelers: The overall three-wheeler market continues to gain strength after end of “Raj Permit” in Maharashtra and new permits in Delhi. This has led company to post strong volume growth in the three-wheeler segment. In fact, it registered a strong 32 percent YoY volume growth in Q2 FY19 in the segment.

Further, in a recent announcement by the government to move to no permit regime for three-wheelers run on alternate fuel is expected to augur well for the company, given its 86 percent market share in the space.

In light of strong demand expectations, the company has planned to expand capacity to 1 million units from 0.8 million units.

Domestic motorcycle segment – Focus on market share: The company has started gaining market share across all two-wheeler segments. This is primarily on the back of aggressive pricing strategy adopted by the company. In fact, despite subdued industry demand, the company has registered 19 percent YoY volume growth in Q2 FY19. Bajaj Auto’s management has guided to achieving 20 percent market share in motorcycle segment by the end of this fiscal and has a long-term target of 24 percent.

Operating margin – depreciating rupee to give respite: In Q1 FY19, the company’s EBITDA margin has come off from around 20 percent levels it achieved in last a few quarters owing to negative pricing actions taken by the company in entry-level bike segment. However, the management has indicated that the negative pricing action impacts only 14 percent of the total turnover which could be offset by margin of its premium segment. Further, recent rupee depreciation is expected to provide aid to margins. Rupee has depreciated 5.5 percent in Q2 FY19 as compared to Q1 FY19 average levels and is expected to add 60-90bps in the margin.

Focus on 125cc and above segment: Bajaj Auto continues to focus on 125cc and above segment where customers are willing to pay some premium giving it some pricing power.

Risk factor to monitor: Rising input costs remain a key challenge to monitor that may hurt operating margin. However, rupee depreciation and recent price hikes in all segments except entry segment provide a cushion.

Centrum's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto has introduced an exciting new opportunity in form of 5-5-5 offer to buy Bajaj motorcycles in India. This offer commences from October 5, 2018 where customers get the benefit of five years of free own damage insurance cover, five free services and five years of free warranty on select Bajaj motorcycles (Platina, Discover, Pulsar and the V range of motorcycles) across all dealerships in India at no additional cost. Bajaj Auto is the first in the industry to introduce such an offer through the 5-5-5 scheme. One of the key benefits of this offer is five years of free own damage insurance cover for customers buying these bikes. We believe that these new customer centric schemes will help boost company sales this festive season. However, this will also hit the overall margin profile of the company. However, higher top-line growth should offset this negative impact on margin to large extent and there should not be meaningful change in earlier projected absolute profit numbers.

Outlook

We continue to maintain our Buy view on the stock of the company.

Auto majors hit a speed bump in the month of September 2018 and posted a mixed bag on numbers on the back multiple factors such as delayed festive season, floods in Kerala and increasing cost of total ownership on the back to rising interest rate, fuel prices and insurance cost.

What continues to do well is the commercial vehicle (CV) segment, on the back of improved rural sentiments, the government’s focus on infrastructure and increase in mining activities. Three-wheeler (3W) sales also continue to rise on the back of the government’s decision to end permit raj.

Tractors and two-wheeler sales, on the other hand, were hit by delayed festive season and deficit in rainfall. The outlook for these two continues to be positive on the back of the revival of rural economy and festive season which starts in October. Passenger vehicle (PV) sales also disappointed primarily because of Kerala flood, delayed festivity and high base of last year.

The improvement in global market is helping export sales for Indian auto majors.

Commercial Vehicle – Continues to be Robust

CV segment continues to post strong monthly sales volume and remained resilient. This was on the back of increasing demand from construction, focus on infrastructure, increase in mining activities and growth in Index of Industry production (IIP).

Notably, LCV (Light Commercial Vehicle) segment continues to post robust volume numbers, primarily, because of FMCG and E-commerce sectors and increasing demand coming from container and refrigerated trucks.

Tata Motors registered a 26 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in CV volume in the month of September 2018. It posted strong growth in LCV segment on the back of new Tata Ultra range of trucks which are gaining significant acceptance and contributing to volumes.

M&M posted a healthy growth on the back of its power brands and the range of commercial vehicles. The management expects the growth momentum to continue on the back of some recent refresh launches as well as the better performance of its product portfolio.

Eicher Volvo also witnessed a significant year-on-year (YoY) growth of 9.5 percent in the month. Ashok Leyland posted a strong YoY growth of 26 percent in September 2018.

Cars Segment – leader hit by floods and delayed festive season

Amid rising cost of total cost of ownership on the back of increasing fuel prices, rising interest rate and mandatory long-term insurance coupled with flood in Kerala (around 11 percent exposure), the leader, Maruti, posted a flat domestic volume for the month.

For Tata Motors, passenger car segment witnessed a growth of 7 percent (YoY). This was a significant growth given the industry witnessed de-growth in the month.

M&M posted de-growth of 15.8 percent. The management indicated that with the launch of the Marazzo, it hopes to see buoyancy in passenger vehicle numbers, going forward.

Two-wheeler (2W) segment: Bajaj is gaining momentumIn two-wheeler space, TVS posted a strong YoY growth of 17 percent in the month on the back of growth coming in from all three segments: bikes (15.7 percent), scooters (17.2 percent) and mopeds (19.1 percent).

Bajaj Auto also posted a heathly growth of 10.4 percent in the month while Eicher posted a meagre 1.7 percent YoY growth in its volume numbers, impacted by Kerala flood.

Hero, on the other hand, posted a growth of 6.7 percent, which is significant given the base it has.

Three-wheeler (3W): Steller show

The overall 3W market continues to be robust. Bajaj Auto, the leader in the space, posted a decent 12 percent (YoY) growth in the domestic 3W segment. TVS also posted a strong growth of 47.6 percent (YoY) in 3W volumes and M&M posted a YoY growth of 17.1 percent.

Tractors: gaining on positive rural sentiments

Delayed festive season and deficit in rainfall hurt tractors volumes for the month of September. However, the revival of the rural economy on the back of farm loan waivers and minimum support price (MSP) hikes would continue to augur well for the companies in the space. Escorts posted a YoY growth of 2.5 percent and M&M posted a YoY decline of 17.5 percent. The management of M&M expects positive momentum in the festive season, which starts in October.

Exports: Revival is onThe overall revival in global economy is getting reflected in the numbers of some of the leading automobile exporters. All auto majors barring Maruti and TVS posted strong YoY growth in the overseas market.

Bajaj Auto has recorded highest ever monthly sales in September and also beat analyst expectations on Monday.

The two-wheeler and three-wheeler maker sold 5.02 lakh units in month gone by, rising 17 percent compared to 4.28 lakh units sold in same month last year. The growth was driven not only by domestic but also exports.

IIFL Research

The sharp depreciation of the rupee versus US dollar and other currencies would impact earnings of auto companies. Net exporters namely Bajaj Auto, Bharat Forge and Balkrishna Industries would be beneficiaries, while net importers such as Maruti may lose out.

Users of global commodities such as lead and rubber would also be negatively impacted by rupee depreciation; however, the concurrent fall in dollar prices of these commodities would provide relief. Users of crude derivatives (tyre makers) would face a double whammy - of higher crude price and a weak rupee.

Balkrishna Industries

Revenue share of exports for Balkrishna (BIL) is the highest (at 85 percent) among all covered auto companies. Of this share, Europe contributes around 53 percent. However, net currency exposure for BIL is around 40 percent (mainly Euro), as raw material imports comprise 42-43 percent of revenues (USD-linked).

As per the FY18 Annual Report, the total value of hedges (in rupee terms) was around Rs 1,650 crore on March 31, 2018, which is equivalent to 36 percent of FY19 export revenue estimates and around 73 percent of the net exposure.

BIL uses fixed-rate forward contracts for hedging. As per management, more than 80 percent of FY19 net exposure is hedged at 81-82. Hence, the full benefit of the recent sharp appreciation in the EUR (versus Rupee) will flow through only in FY20.

Bharat Forge

Bharat Forge (BHFC)'s export revenue share is around 57 percent, of which 73 percent is USD-based. BHFC has the highest hedge ratio (percent of revenues covered) among all auto companies.

As per its FY18 Annual Report, BHFC's total outstanding hedges are equivalent to Rs 6,130 crore (all fixed-rate contracts), which is 172 percent of FY19 export forecast.

As a result, despite having a significant export contribution, the recent rally in USD (versus Rupee) will not benefit BHFC meaningfully for the whole of FY19 and a large part of FY20. The full benefit may be captured only in FY21.

Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto has material revenue contribution from exports (around 40 percent), most of which are USD-denominated. As per its FY18 Annual Report, outstanding hedges stood at Rs 10,510 crore (86 percent of FY19 estimate).

However, two-thirds of these hedging contracts are range-forwards (options), which provide some upside potential if spot rate moves above the contract rate. Also, only 18 percent of total hedges are beyond one year.

Hence, we expect Bajaj to realise the benefit of the rupee depreciation sooner than BIL and BHFC.

As per management, Bajaj has hedged around 80 percent for FY19. The key issue is whether USD appreciation would impact the purchasing power of Bajaj's export customers.

Maruti Suzuki

Maruti would be negatively impacted by sharp rupee depreciation (versus Japanese Yen) due to its high-cost exposure to imports (around 22 percent of revenues).

These are only partly offset by exports. Maruti hedges only a small portion of the net exposure. As a result, fluctuations in forex rates impact margins almost immediately.

In addition to around 5.5 percent royalty outgo (mainly JPY); it has 4-5 percent direct and around 12 percent indirect imports (half in JPY). Yen has appreciated sharply (up 5.4 percent from Q1FY19 average), which should negatively impact Maruti in coming quarters.

As a result, we are trimming FY20-21 EBITDA margin by 50-60bps, leading to EPS cut of around 4 percent. The cut in FY19 EPS is 2 percent, as impact would be felt only in second half of FY19.

Battery-makers: Rupee depreciation more than offset by fall in lead price

Lead being a global commodity, domestic prices are closely linked to import parity. The rupee depreciation would have hurt battery-makers, given that lead cost is equivalent to around 50 percent of revenues.

However, a sharp fall in the USD price of lead implies that battery-makers are actually better off. Lead price (in Rupee terms) is about 8 percent lower than the average price in Q4FY18.

Tyre-makers: Rubber benign, but crude would hurt

The rupee price of rubber has not moved up substantially, with the weak rupee partly offset by softness in the USD price of rubber. However, tyre makers also consume crude-linked commodities (synthetic rubber, carbon black, chemicals etc.), which have been impacted by the weak rupee as well as the rise in crude price.

Tyre-makers have announced price hikes across segments, which may help offset a part of the impact. However, the hikes may not suffice.

But with sales averaging 2,000 units a month, it barely managed to hurt Royal Enfield's sales volumes.

Now, Bajaj is set to launch an all-new variant of the Dominar, spy pics of which have emerged on Rushlane.

The most prominent of changes in the Dominar test mule are the beefier upside down forks just like the ones on the KTM Duke 390. Another change is to the exhaust which is now a twin canister and a new digital instrument cluster which probably shows more information.

In terms of mechanicals, the Dominar will receive the same engine as the before albeit probably refined for BSVI norms. It gets KTM's 373cc single cylinder that produces 35 PS of power at 8,000 rpm and 35 Nm at 6,500 rpm mated to a 6-speed gearbox.

The bike is also expected to get other upgrades from the Duke 390 like ride-by-wire, an updated slipper clutch and the DOHC system. The addition of these features will definitely enhance the Dominar's sports capabilities.

The Bajaj Dominar is expected to launch just before Diwali and could be priced about Rs 15,000-20,000 higher than the current ABS variant bringing the cost up to Rs 1.8 lakh (ex-showroom).",218,1.4901161193847656e-06

Automobile players posted a mixed set of sales for August on the back of delayed festive season and floods in Kerala. The commercial vehicle (CV) segment continues to remain strong on the back of a normal monsoon, improved rural sentiment and investment in infrastructure. Tractors and two-wheeler (2W) sales were hit by a delayed festive season. The outlook for the same continues to remain positive on the back of a revival in the rural economy and normal monsoon.

Three-wheeler (3W) sales continue to zoom given the government’s decision to end Permit Raj. There has also been a strong pick-up in exports on the back of an improving global climate.

Strong showing by CVsDespite uncertainty around the new axle load norms, CVs continue to remain buoyant given the government's increasing focus on infrastructure, construction demand and increase in mining activities.

The light commercial vehicle (LCV) segment, in particular, continues to show a strong uptrend in monthly numbers primarily because of increased thrust on agriculture, FMCG and e-commerce sectors and increasing demand accruing from container and refrigerated trucks.

Tata Motors registered a significant growth on the back of reasons stated above. The medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) segment continued its robust performance in the backdrop of strong GDP growth (8.2 percent) in the April-June quarter. Replacement buying and various infrastructure projects continue to lead to strong demand for higher tonnage trucks and tippers.

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) posted healthy growth thanks to its rural penetration. The management expects growth momentum to continue on the back of some recent refresh launches as well as the better performance by its product portfolio.

Eicher Volvo also witnessed significant year-on-year (YoY) growth of 32.8 percent in August. Ashok Leyland continued to deliver strong YoY growth at 28 percent.

Cars segment: Leader hit by floodsSegment leader, Maruti Suzuki, saw domestic volumes decline 2.8 percent due of its large exposure (around 11 percent) to Kerala. The new Ciaz is gaining traction and witnessed a growth of 8.4 percent.

For Tata Motors, its passenger (PV) and utility vehicle (UV) segments grew 28 percent and 122.8 percent, respectively, thanks to strong demand for Tiago, Tigor, Hexa and Nexon.

M&M posted flat volume growth. The management hopes to see buoyancy in PV sales with the launch of the Marazzo.

Bajaj Auto: Gaining momentum in the 2W spaceIn the 2W space, Bajaj Auto is the market leader in August, clocking a growth of 27.2 percent.

Eicher posted a meagre 2.1 percent YoY growth in volumes due to the Kerala floods. TVS Motor Company and Hero MotoCorp were impacted by a delayed festive season.

Steller showing by three-wheeler manufacturersThe overall three-wheeler (3W) market continues to gain strength after the end of the Permit Raj. Bajaj Auto, the leader in this space, posted a growth of 28.3 percent. The same for TVS and M&M stood at 56.1 percent and 35.4 percent, respectively.

Tractors gaining on positive rural sentimentDelayed festive season has impacted sales of tractors. However, revival of the rural economy and expectations of a normal monsoon would continue to augur well for companies in this space. Recent initiatives from the government to usher strength into rural India should continue to support demand for farm equipment like tractors.

Escorts and M&M posted a YoY growth of 9.4 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively.

Exports reviveAuto companies have been struggling in the export market for long. Overall revival in the global economy is finally reflecting in the numbers of some of the leading automobile exporters. All auto majors, barring Maruti and Escorts, posted strong YoY growth in the overseas market.

Automobile and pharmaceutical companies have emerged as big beneficiaries of the commerce ministry's export incentive scheme 'MEIS' as they have received the major portion of the disbursals.

Under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), the government provides duty benefits at different rates depending on product and country.

Rewards under the scheme are payable as percentage of realised free-on-board value and MEIS duty credit scrip can be transferred or used for payment of a number of duties including the basic customs duty.

The top 10 companies that have obtained maximum disbursals during 2017-18 under the scheme includes JSW Steel (Rs 301.5 crore), Ford India (Rs 272.8 crore), Bajaj Auto (Rs 246.5 crore), Dr Reddys Lab (Rs 240.6 crore), Aurobindo Pharma (Rs 211.3 crore), Mylan lab (Rs 192.9 crore), Hyundai Motor India (Rs 189.3 crore), Vedanta Ltd (Rs 180 crore), Lupin Ltd (Rs 155 crore), and Nissan Motor India (Rs 150 crore).

The other firms which have gained from the scheme include Tata Motors, Hindalco Industries, Hetero Labs, Maruti Suzuki India, Cipla Ltd, Reliance Industries, General Motors India and Shahi Exports.

Similarly in 2016-17 also, companies from automobile and pharmaceutical sectors topped the chart in getting the maximum benefit under the MEIS.

In 2017-18, the ministry disbursed about Rs 31,000 crore to exporters under the scheme, while it was over Rs 23,000 crore in the previous fiscal.

Going ahead, the government may have to change the scheme as it was challenged by the US in the World Trade Organisation's dispute settlement system.

The US had alleged that such incentive schemes were harming American companies and they are not in compliance with the global trade rules.

Government officials have earlier stated that they may look at reviewing the existing export incentive schemes to ensure that they comply with the WTO norms.

Bajaj Auto, on Monday, reported a 30 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in its August sales at 4.37 lakh units: its highest-ever monthly showing. The two-wheeler major had posted sales of 3.35 lakh units during the same period last year.

Exports grew 35 percent YoY to 1.81 lakh units. Domestic sales grew 27 percent at 2.55 lakh units.

The motorcycle and commercial vehicles maker reported a 28 percent rise in motorcycle sales at 3.62 lakh units. Three-wheeler sales grew 45 percent at 74,169 units.

The company was in the news recently for hiking prices of its motorcycles. The latter is likely to get dearer in September by at least Rs 3,000 due to raising of the minimum insurance term to five years by insurance regulator IRDAI.

This is in line with the Supreme Court decision that the third-party insurance cover for two-wheelers should mandatorily be for a period of five years. As a result, insurance cost on the Pulsar NS160 and Platina would rise Rs 8,000 and Rs 4,800, respectively.

On-road prices for new purchases will rise by at least Rs 3,000 due to the IRDA notice, which makes five-year third-party insurance mandatory as against the current coverage of one year, Bajaj Auto said in a statement.",216,0.9999998807907104

Auto players clocked strong sales volume in July 2018 with robust performance in all segments except the passenger car segment. Major OEMs, with the exception of Maruti, Eicher Motors, and Hero MotoCorp, reported double-digit growth.

Factors such as an expectation of good monsoons, improved rural sentiments and investment in infrastructure led to strong demand for commercial vehicle (CV) and tractors segments. The growth is coming despite hiccups like the new axle load norms that stand to improve the load carrying capacity of vehicles. Revival in three-wheeler sales is due to government’s decision to end permit raj. Export markets also continue to do well.

The CV and tractor segments should have a strong run going forward on the back of focus on the rural economy in an election year and the continued investment in infrastructure. The stronger numbers from two-wheeler is also a strong trend, which on the back of the revival of the rural economy may strengthen further.

Commercial Vehicle – Strong show

Despite the new axle load norms, the CV sector continues to be buoyant on the back of increasing focus on infrastructure, demand from construction and increase in mining activities. We believe the new axle load norms may lead to deferment of purchases. As per industry experts, the impact would not be substantial.

Notably, LCV (Light Commercial Vehicle) segment has also started showing a strong uptrend in monthly numbers primarily because of increased thrust on agriculture, an uptick in the FMCG and e-commerce sectors and increasing demand coming from containers and refrigerated trucks.

Tata Motors registered a significant growth on the back of the above-stated reasons. The M&HCV (Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicle) truck segment continued to be robust despite new axle load norms. It grew on the back of various infrastructure projects, road construction, a building of irrigation facilities and affordable housing projects across the country.

M&M posted a healthy growth thanks to rural penetration. The management expects the growth momentum to continue on the back of some recent refresh launches as well as the better performance of its product portfolio.

Eicher Volvo also witnessed a significant YoY growth of 36.7 percent in the month. Ashok Leyland continued to post strong YoY growth which came at 27 percent.

Cars segment – leader marches on

The leader, Maruti, posted an overall decline of 0.7 percent in PV (Passenger Vehicle) segment. The decline was primarily due to a higher base of last year and lower sales in the compact and mid-size segments. It was also affected due to the phasing out of Ciaz before new model launch.

As per the management of Tata Motors and M&M, the demand for PV was muted due to the impact of monsoon and the 8- day long transporters strike.

For Tata Motors, passenger car segment witnessed a de-growth of 5.7 percent (YoY) and its UV segment continued to witness significant growth (101.9 percent), thanks to the strong demand for its Tiago, Tigor, Hexa, and Nexon.

For M&M, PV segment de-grew by 6 percent YoY. The management indicated there has been an encouraging response to the recent launch - the Plush New XUV500.

Two-wheeler (2W) segment: Bajaj is gaining momentum

Bajaj Auto was the leader In two-wheeler space for the month, clocking a 22 percent YoY growth.

TVS also posted a healthy growth of 11 percent YoY in bikes and 28.8 percent YoY in scooters.

Hero, yet again, posted a significant growth of 9.1 percent YoY in the month. The management indicated that with the forecast of a normal monsoon this year and a strong pipeline of new products coming up, the company is confident of sustaining its growth momentum, going forward.

Eicher posted a modest 7 percent YoY growth in the month. The volume was impacted due to a transport strike and impact on registration in West Bengal due to mandatory licence requirement.

Three-wheeler (3W): Steller show

The overall three-wheeler market continues to gain strength after the end of “Raj Permit” in Maharashtra and new permits in Delhi. Bajaj Auto, the leader in the space, could capture the growth coming in this segment and posted a whopping 67.2 percent YoY growth in the domestic 3W segment. TVS also posted a strong growth of 70.0 percent YoY in 3W volumes and M&M posted a YoY growth of 46.7 percent.

Tractors: gaining on positive rural sentiments

Escorts posted a growth of 3.9 percent YoY whereas M&M posted a YoY decline of 19.6 percent in tractors segment.

The revival of the rural economy and expectations of normal monsoon continue to make the outlook positive for the tractor segment.

Exports: Revival is on

Auto companies had been struggling in the export markets for long. However, the overall revival in the global economy is finally getting reflected in the numbers of some of the leading automobile exporters. All auto majors barring Maruti posted strong YoY growth in the overseas market.",825,0.6537388614986254

Bajaj Auto reported healthy set of sales data for July, in line with Nomura's expectations. The two-and-three-wheeler maker sold 3.1 lakh units, a growth of 30 percent over the same period last year. The brokerage had estimated sales of around 3.97 lakh units for the month.

Domestic sales grew 27 percent year-on-year to 2.37 lakh units. Exports increased 34 percent to 1.63 lakh units, the company said in an exchange filing.

The motorcycle segment reported a 25 percent sales growth to 3.32 lakh units. The 3W division saw its highest ever monthly sales at 67,663 units, a growth of 59 percent over the year-ago month.

The company's year-to-date performance (FY19) also remained strong as total sales grew 36 percent to 16.26 lakh units, backed by domestic sales and export growth of 39 percent and 32 percent, respectively. Motorcycles sales increased 31 percent and 3W shot up 70 percent in the same period.

Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director at Bajaj Auto, feels August performance should be similar to July or could be tad better than June as the festival season kick-starts. ""We are looking at a growth of around 25 percent in the commuter space in August. Momentum for the 3W space would continue,"" Bajaj said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

He expects growth to pick-up from September for the next three months till November due to festive season demand. ""Monthly sales of 4 lakh looks sustainable but the demand push can take it to 4.5 lakh units per month.""

In the case of exports, he sees 35 percent growth in August, subject to production, Maratha morcha, etc.

Bajaj Auto increased prices in July and is looking to increase the same in September. ""We have been pushing prices. Recently, I heard news reports that Hero MotoCorp too is looking at raising prices. It looks like a price war but it is definitely not a war.""

Competition from Harley Davidson doesn't perturb Bajaj much and is not worried about competition rising in the 250cc segment.

He reiterated that Bajaj Auto is not going to change its strategy due to competition. ""The success of Bajaj Auto and KTM prompted TVS Motor to partner with BMW for bikes. So, we will stick to our strategy.""

At 11 am, the stock price was quoting Rs 2,736.25, up Rs 36.20, or 1.34 percent on the NSE.",403,0.9815209252493722

An Indian company and its domestic manufacturing hub may give the world a new leader in premium bikes. Two of five motorcycles sold by street bike specialist KTM AG this year will be made by Bajaj Auto’s Chakan facility, a strategy that the Rajiv Bajaj-led firm expects to help the Austrian company beat leader Harley-Davidson in the premium bikes segment globally.

“KTM hopes to end at 270,000 (units sales) and it will beat Harley-Davidson worldwide in premium motorcycles. And out of 270,000, about 100,000 motorcycles will be made at our Chakan plant,"" Rajiv Bajaj, managing director, Bajaj Auto said.

Harley-Davidson, whose sales have been flagging since 2013, is targeting sales of 231,000-236,000 during this year — an on-year drop of 2-4 percent. At 270,000 units sales, KTM will clock an on-year 13 percent growth.

Bajaj Auto-KTM rise

When Bajaj Auto acquired 14.5 percent in KTM AG in 2007, the European company clocked annual sales of 65,000 units. At that time Harley-Davidson’s annual sales stood slightly over 300,000 units. Over the last 10 years, Bajaj hiked its stake and by FY18 its stake in KTM stood at 48 percent through a Netherland-based subsidiary.

The Bajaj Auto-KTM combine does not want to stop. Both companies have charted out a growth plan for the next 10 years involving the Pune-based company becoming the biggest hub for premium bikes in the world. Apart from bikes made under Bajaj’s own brand and those under KTM, one new brand – Husqvarna– will also make its way through the Chakan facility serving the world markets.

“We are looking to build the second brand Husqvarna from Chakan and expect to roll them out before 2020. We have set an audacious target for ourselves that between Husqvarna and KTM we will strive to achieve a sale of 500,000 units in a not too distant future. This is an unbelievably historic figure to aim given that nobody has sold so many motorcycle at those price points,” added Bajaj.

Further, Bajaj said that the company will be formally signing a contract with Triumph over the next few weeks for designing and building bikes under the Triumph brand also possibly from Chakan. The contract will also have details of Bajaj establishing a foothold in those ASEAN and Latin American markets where Triumph is not present.

“(Triumph and Bajaj) have been in touch for over a year. We are still to sign any formal contract so I cannot share any details. But we are hopeful that in the next few weeks that we shall be able to conclude the contract. If that were to happen then it will be our goal to achieve a similar partnership with Triumph and similar results like KTM and hopefully with Husqvarna,” added Bajaj.

Last year, Bajaj and Triumph announced a non-equity partnership to develop mid-capacity motorcycles for not just India but global markets. This is after the British brand dropped plans to develop a 500cc motorcycle mainly targeted at the developing markets like India.

“Perhaps in a 5-10 year time frame, it is not impossible that there will be more premium motorcycles bearing the brand KTM, Husqvarna and Triumph rolling out of India from one facility than there would be from across the world from other facilities combined. So that is where we are trying to go in terms of that segment,” Bajaj said.",600,0.9760108143091202

Centrum's research report on Bajaj Auto

We maintain our Buy rating on Bajaj Auto with a downward revised TP of Rs3,188 as the company’s management has clearly highlighted that they are focusing on market share and their new price strategy, to offer few products at lower prices, will be continued till they achieve >20% market share. We expect pressure on margins will be continued on account of discount pricing strategy, higher RM costs and regulatory costs in coming years. Despite this, Bajaj Auto is expected to deliver near double digit earning growth over next two years aided by continued recovery in the export business and good volume growth in domestic bike business, well supported by new pricing strategy. Q1FY19 performance was below our estimates as good volume growth has not translated to good PAT growth as the company failed to meet our margin expectations.

Outlook

We value Bajaj Auto on our differentiated AOCF/EV methodology and arrive at a TP of Rs3,188 (18.4x FY20E core EPS, plus Rs117 for KTM investments), which implies 19.1x FY20E EPS. At CMP of Rs2,684, we see an upside of 18.8% and hence maintain our Buy rating. Key downside risk: Intensifying price war in 2W sector.

Bajaj Auto remained under pressure, falling another 2.7% to hit a fresh 52-week low of Rs 2,616 on Tuesday. The fall is addition to the over 5% loss seen in the previous session on likely pricing war after managing director Rajiv Bajaj's comments at the annual general meeting. Brokerage houses also turned cautious on the entire two-wheeler space, saying the competition is likely to intensify which could lead to price war.

Hero MotoCorp also hit a fresh 52-week low of Rs 3,037.10 with a fall of 4 percent in morning on top of 6 percent correction in the previous session, but recouped those losses by trading higher in the trade.

TVS Motor Company share price, too, lost 2 percent in the morning on top of 4 percent correction on Monday, but managed to turn positive and traded higher.

At 11:24 hours IST, the stock price of Bajaj Auto was quoting at Rs 2,670, down Rs 19.10, or 0.71 percent while Hero Motocorp was trading 0.19 percent higher at Rs 3,170 and TVS Motor Company was up 0.93 percent at Rs 545.30 on the BSE.

While addressing shareholders in the Annual General Meeting on July 20, two-wheeler and three-wheeler maker Bajaj Auto said it plans aggressive pricing tactics in the entry segment.

To clarify on the same topic, in an interview to CNBC-TV18, Bajaj reiterated that this already mentioned in the Annual Report FY18 a month ago and said that company will go after the market with whatever it takes in terms of product, price, promotion and people.

But the company has not changed its strategy related to sports segment in the domestic market, 3-wheeler, exports and spare parts. Bajaj Auto is getting higher volume at lower end through CT 100 ES model and at higher end through Pulsar 150cc. This pricing has been in place at least for last 12 months or may be 24 months, he said.

After this news brokerage houses turned cautious on 2-wheeler space and feel the competition is likely to intensify and the decision could lead to a price war in the mass market 2-wheeler.

Some brokerages downgraded Bajaj Auto as well as TVS Motor Company while some slashed their target prices on the stocks due to likely pressure on the margin going ahead.

Deutsche Bank on 2-wheeler space

The research house remained cautious on mass-market 2-wheelers sector as the competition is likely to intensify.

It has downgraded TVS Motor to Sell with reduced target price at Rs 485 from Rs 575 per share, saying the valuation premium should moderate as market share gains taper.

It has Hold rating on Hero MotoCorp with reduced target price at Rs 3,550 from Rs 3,900 earlier and also has Hold rating Bajaj Auto with reduced target price at Rs 2,900 from Rs 3,000 earlier.

According to Deutsche, cash flow yields could provide downside support to Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch on 2-wheelers

Bajaj Auto's aggressive pricing tactics in the entry segment could lead to a price-war and as a result, Hero & TVS will have to respond eventually.

Profitability for mass-market motorcycles will likely moved to lower level. It has cut margin & valuation multiples to reflect the increased pricing risk.

It has downgraded Bajaj Auto to Underperform with target price at Rs 2,800 per shre while it maintained Buy rating on Hero MotoCorp with a target price at Rs 3,800 per share and retained Underperform on TVS Motor Company with a target price at Rs 450 per share.

Nomura on Bajaj Auto

The research house has downgraded to Neutral with reduced target price at Rs 2,911 from Rs 3,395 per share as extent of margin miss surprised negatively.

Bajaj Auto may find tough to sustain aggressive pricing strategy. Nomura lowered margin estimate by 180 bps/130 bps to 17.7/18 percent for FY19/FY20.

Credit Suisse on Bajaj Auto

The research house has maintained Outperform with reduced target price at Rs 3,290 from Rs 3,360 per share as pricing-led strategy for market share gain is likely to continue for 2-3 years.

Margin will remain under pressure over the next three years. It has cut its FY19-21 EPS estimates by 3 percent on slightly higher volumes but lower margins.

Bajaj Auto is better placed than TVS & Hero owing to its strong export franchise. Market share improvements should drive re-rating.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Auto, reiterated that the company will go after the market with whatever it takes in terms of product, price, promotion and people.

Bajaj said he is not proud of the fact that the company is losing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) per unit of Rs 2,000. ""However, it is more than compensated by higher volumes. Volumes of Pulsar 150cc increased to 50,000 per month from 28,000 earlier after the pricing war.""

He added volumes of Pulsar 150 - The Quint have doubled to 18,000 units in the past two months. ""So, the per unit EBITDA loss of Rs 2,000 in Pulsar 150cc is offset by Quint sales.""

The company's third initiative - Pulsar 150 Classic, is priced around Rs 68,000 per unit, slightly lower priced than Honda's Unicorn. ""EBITDA has been sacrificed a bit, but pricing 5 percent lower does not qualify as a price war. Corporate addition like this is not uncommon in the market,"" he stated.

Commenting on the company's strategy, Bajaj said it has not changed its strategy for sports, 3-wheeler, exports and spare parts segments in the domestic market. ""We are moving aggressively in the commuter space and have unveiled three initiatives since March. Segmental market share has increased 250-300 basis points compared to others.""

Bajaj Auto is bagging higher volumes at the lower end through CT100 ES model and at higher end through Pulsar 150cc, he stated. ""This pricing has been in place at least for the last 12-24 months. We invested Rs 300 per unit for additional new features. As a result, volume of these models increased from 5,000 per month to 50,000 per month, which proved that people react to style of the model and not the price. We have already increased price of this model by Rs 500 per unit and have enough elbow room to increase price further.""",392,0.5988670706748962

Buoyed by strong performance in the first quarter of this fiscal, Bajaj Auto is planning to increase its share to 20 per cent in domestic motorcycle market in the next two quarters, according to a senior company official. Besides, with African markets on a rebound after witnessing downturn for nearly three years, the Pune-based firm expects to continue the momentum of high double-digit growth witnessed in the first quarter.

""In the domestic market our current market share is 16.3 per cent. Our target is that in the next two quarters it should be around 20 per cent,"" Bajaj Auto President (Business Development and Assurance) S Ravikumar told PTI.

The total industry sales of motorcycles during the quarter stood at 36,51,542 units, according to SIAM data.

""While base effect played a role in Q1, our growth has also been on the basis of our aggressive play in the entry-level segment with CT 100, which has been our price warrior, and targeted approach to increase our Pulsar numbers,"" he said.

The company's CT 100 model sold over 1.9 lakh units during, a growth of 76 percent over the year-ago period.

Going forward, Ravikumar said Bajaj Auto would continue the approach while taking ""product actions"" on other brands such as Platina, Avenger and V, without disclosing details.

On the export front, he said, ""Our performance in the first quarter gives us a good idea of what will happen in the time to come.""

Bajaj Auto had posted its highest ever quarterly exports of 5,37,976 units in Q1 this fiscal as against 4,09,525 units in the year-ago period, at a growth of 31 per cent.

""This is mainly Africa-led growth, although we have done well in the Philippines as well. Major markets like Nigeria and Egypt have rebounded with all macro-economic factors stabilised after nearly three years of downturn,"" he said.

In Nigeria the company's sales more than doubled to over 1.19 lakh units in Q1 from nearly 46,000 units in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.

Similarly, in exports to Egypt also stood at around 42,000 units, up from from about 19,000 units in the first quarter last fiscal.

Ravikumar said the company has also entered new market like Malaysia where it now sells Pulsar and Dominar brand of bikes.

Indian banks are unlikely to see a quick resolution to their 'terrible state' of being saddled by a huge overhang of NPAs despite the new bankruptcy process in the country, according to Bajaj Auto Chairman Rahul Bajaj.

The veteran industrialist also said the country is facing insufficient investments and the current share of gross fixed capital formation to GDP is not enough to support steady-state growth of 7.5 percent to 8 percent.

Addressing shareholders of the company in its Annual Report for 2017-18, Bajaj cited the insufficient investments and current state of the banks as two ""particularly important"" reasons for the slowdown in India's GDP growth.

The Indian economy on yearly basis grew at a four-year low of 6.7 percent in 2017-18, down from 7.1 percent in the previous fiscal. The previous low was recorded in 2013-14 at 6.4 percent.

Describing the present situation faced by many banks in India as a ""terrible state"", he said, ""Saddled by a huge overhang of bad loans or non-performing assets (NPAs) that have eroded their balance sheets and destroyed profits, most banks have neither the requisite financial strength nor the confidence to fund industrial growth.""

This is not only affecting the bigger players but, much more so, the medium and smaller scale corporate entities across India who are now hard-pressed to secure necessary working capital let aside term loans for investments, he added.

""Despite the benefits that ought to accrue from the new bankruptcy process in India, I do not see a quick resolution to this problem,"" Bajaj said.

Commenting on the impact of insufficient investment on GDP growth, he said, ""Our share of gross fixed capital formation to GDP has been declining over the last six years and now stands at 31 percent. This is insufficient to bring about a steady-state growth of 7.5 percent to 8 percent.""

On the company's performance, he said Bajaj Auto could have done even better had it not been affected by a decline in domestic motorcycle sales.

""This was not on account of the market as a whole nor due to an overall lack of demand for all types and makes of motorcycles... However, it could not perform adequately in the large 'commuter' segment and sold less than what was expected,"" he added.

The company continued to do well at the entry-level segment with models like CT 100, Platina and Discover 100/110 as well as in the sports and 'super-sports' segments through Pulsars, Avengers, the Dominar 400 and the KTMs, Bajaj said.

Describing the commuter segment as a ""critical"" one, he said, ""Hopefully, this gap will be taken care of in the next couple of years through existing and new products...and, as I understand, your managing director and his team are expending considerable effort at bridging this gap.""

In 2017-18, Bajaj Auto had sold 19,74,577 units of motorcycles in the domestic market, down 1.3 percent from the previous fiscal. The company's exports stood at 13,94,757, up 14.5 percent.",535,-0.5604797872630033

Next week will be quite important as monsoon will start in India and all weather agencies have forecast a normal monsoon this year. From market's point of view this is the biggest event this week.

Stock specific, Biocon will be closely watched as it will approach target action day (TAD) for the application of a biosimilar drug called Pegfilgrastim. Its result will come on June 4.

On the same day Weizmann Forex will consider a buyback and on June 6, RBI will come up with its policy rate results.

ADF Foods board of directors will discuss a buyback on June 5, while Sadbhav Infrastructure's board will consider the allotment of non-convertible debentures amounting to Rs 190 crore only on private placement basis and fund raising by issue of securities on June 6. South Indian Bank's board of directors will discuss fund raising on the same day.

Here is a list of three stocks to bet on for short term:

Firstsource Solutions (FSL)

FSL has posted revenue growth of 1.1 percent on a QoQ basis. EBITDA margins expanded by 170 bps QoQ aided by lower-than-expected employee expenses and lower other expenses. The board has recommended a dividend of Rs 1.5 per share for the first time and indicated at maintaining a payout ratio of around 35-40 percent of PAT, going ahead.

Management expects revenue growth to be at the top end of industry growth rates in constant currency in FY19 despite downward bias in the customer management division, driven by healthy deal pipelines, signing of contracts, and traction in mortgage business in BFSI.

With a healthy dividend payout and becoming net long term debt free company, we believe FSL could witness a massive upside going ahead. We are recommending a Buy.

Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto has posted strong earnings driven by good growth in 3-wheeler and export sales. Export markets like Nigeria have seen good improvement. Volumes in Nigeria improved to 33,000 units per month versus 26,000 in 2017.

Commodity prices are quite volatile but we are expecting management will maintain volume growth. Management is focusing on domestic business to strengthen its presence. Realisation has improved by 1.8 percent QoQ Rs 64,790 versus Rs 63,600 per unit due to higher 3-wheeler and export sales.

We are recommending a Buy due to expectations of higher realisation and better volume growth.

L&T Technology Services

L&T Technology Services (LTTS) is the third-largest pure play ER&D (engineering, research & development) services provider globally. Its broad based services portfolio, presence in underpenetrated market segments and deep rooted client footprint, 43 of the top 100 global ER&D spenders, places it well to address the opportunity emerging from the shifts in global ER&D spend.

Global spend on ER&D services ($680 billion in 2016; source: PwC Consulting) compares that on IT services. However, the outsourced component is lower and India has a relatively lower share of the global outsourcing market. This should improve with the growing shift in ER&D spending from products to software and services, and a rising preference for third-party players.

We believe LTTS is well set to tap this opportunity and its financials are quite superior compared to others. It has healthy cash conversion plus superior return ratios, 39 percent return on equity, are other positives. We recommend a Buy.

Bajaj Auto has registered a healthy 30 percent growth in sales for May 2018, driven by two-wheeler as well as three-wheeler sales.

The Pune-based auto company sold 4.07 lakh units in May 2018 compared to 3.14 lakh units sold in corresponding month last year.

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto reported Q4FY18 results that were above our estimates on the operational front. Net revenues were at Rs 6773 crore (up 38.3% YoY, 6.3%QoQ), almost in line with our estimate of Rs 6783 crore. The miss is attributable to lower than estimated export realisation. Domestic realisations were at ~Rs 68534 (vs. estimate of Rs 68027) while export realisation was at Rs 56,466 (vs. estimate of Rs 57328) Total volumes for Q4FY18 were at 1045378 units (up 33% YoY, 4.4% QoQ). Domestic volumes grew 34% YoY, 7.5% QoQ, on a low base, to 619816 units. Export volumes are showing signs of a revival; increasing 31% YoY, flat QoQ to 425562 units. In the export market, sales mix of new markets was at 14% in FY18 vs. 10% in FY17 Reported EBITDA was at Rs 1315.2 crore (up 45.2% YoY, 6.8% QoQ) vs. our estimate of Rs 1286.6 crore. Reported EBITDA margins were at 19.4% (up 92 bps YoY, 8 bps QoQ) against our estimate of 19% Reported PAT came in at Rs 1080 crore (up 34.7% YoY, 13.4% QoQ) vs. expectation of Rs 1077 crore The Board recommended a dividend of Rs 60 per share in FY18 (vs. Rs 55 per share last fiscal).

Outlook

With the first model of Triumph & Husqvarna expected in FY21, we see limited positives for the domestic 2-W business of BAL in the medium term. Non participation in the growing scooter segment and failure of recent launches remain a concern for us. We revise our target price downward to Rs 2900; ascribing 16x FY20E core EPS+ Rs 575 per share for value of KTM stake along with cash and cash equivalents. We have a HOLD recommendation on the stock.

JM Financial's research report on Bajaj Auto

During 4QFY18, Bajaj Auto (BJAUT) reported EBITDA margin of 19.4% (+90bps YoY, +10bps QoQ) due to positive operating leverage accruing from 33% volume growth (despite a 160bps YoY drop in gross margin). With the upswing witnessed in oil price and ramp-up in newly added markets, export volume witnessed second successive quarter of 25%+ YoY growth.

Outlook

We estimate 20% CAGR in BJAUT earnings over FY18-20E led by 11% volume CAGR. Maintain BUY with a target price of INR 3,450. INR appreciation and inability to expand domestic market share in motorcycle segment are key risks.

The Nifty is now trading above its crucial short-term moving averages and today’s intraday low of 10,524 will be of big importance in the coming week, suggest experts. A break below this level could again put further pressure on the index amid expiry week volatility.

On the upside, the next target for the index is placed at 10,733 levels but bulls will be able to take full control of the index if it surpasses 10,929 which was recorded on May 15, 2018.

The Nifty which opened at 10,533 slipped marginally to hit an intraday low of 10,524. Bulls took control of the index and pushed Nifty above 10,600 to hit an intraday high of 10,628 before closing the day at 10,605, up 91 points.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,543.47, followed by 10,481.73. If the index starts moving upward, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,647.47 and 10,689.73.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 26,273.6. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 26,094.8, followed by 25,916.0. On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 26,389.0, followed by 26,504.4.

Bajaj Auto is a strong play in on India’s two wheeler and three wheeler industry and is on the right track to tap the opportunity in a competitive market. We were happy with Bajaj Auto’s Q4FY18 performance which was marginally ahead of street estimates. On a low base and more than doubling of commercial vehicle volumes, the company posted a 38 percent growth in revenues for Q4. While overall volumes were up 33 percent, realisations were up over 4 percent, given the higher three-wheeler mix.

While domestic motorcycle sales were up over 20 percent, growth was a stronger 25 percent on the exports front. Recovery in African markets on the back of rising crude oil prices has helped improve the economy and demand in those countries. Among its motorcycles, CT and Platina models continued to do well during the quarter, while the recently launched Pulsar has shown good traction. The management has not given any guidance for the next year (FY19) owing to volatile macro-economic conditions.

The Pune-based company clocked total sales (both two wheelers and three wheelers) of 1.04 million units during the quarter ended March, 33 percent higher than the 787,468 units sold in the same quarter in 2016-17, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.

Domestic sales of two-wheelers grew 20 percent on year to 497,587 units, while two-wheeler exports rose 25 percent over the same period to 358,802 units. The share of two-wheeler exports in Bajaj Auto's total sales declined marginally to 34.3 percent in the quarter, as against 36.5 percent at the end of the corresponding quarter last year.

""We are expecting another 150 bps gain in market share in Q1 over and above the 150 bps we gained during Q4. We would like to end FY19 with a share of 26 percent. We are getting our act nice and firm in the motorcycle segment,"" S Ravikumar, Head - Business Development, Bajaj Auto

We believe the company led by product innovations, sustained growth in exports, three wheelers doing well and a revival in demand for motorcycles in the domestic market, the company would witness good growth in the near future.

At current market price of Rs 2,777 (Face Value: 10), the sock is valued at a P/E of 19x on FY18 EPS. We expect an upside of 13 percent with a target of Rs 3,135 by FY19 end (19x on FY19 EPS of Rs 165).",448,0.7500349134206772

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari today said his ministry has accorded permission to auto makers Bajaj and TVS for making vehicles that run using 100 per cent bio-ethanol made out of rice and wheat straw.

""I told the managements of Bajaj and TVS to make ethanol based bike and auto rickshaws. They made it. I am giving them permission and the auto rickshaws or bikes or scooters will run on 100 per cent bio-ethanol,"" he said.

The Road, Transport, Highways and Shipping Minister was speaking during the launching ceremony of 'Vijaya Kranti', a Telugu news daily here.

Gadkari suggested that institutions engaged in agricultural research take up topics such as biofuel to reduce dependency on oil imports. He said rice straw, as waste, is burnt in Punjab and Haryana, resulting in pollution in Delhi.

According to him, 280 litres of ethanol can be produced from one tonne of rice straw. ""We import Rs 40,000 crore worth of timber,Rs 4,000 crore worth of raw incense sticks, Rs 35,000 crore worth paper pulp and Rs 35,000 crore worth newsprint every year.

So a total of Rs one lakh crore worth of imports related to wood. He said the centre was encouraging farmers to cultivate bamboo so that imports are considerably reduced. The government has, for the first time, decided to declassify bamboo as tree, he said.

Expressing concern over 'political influence' of the media, Gadkari said people of the country want the media to be independent and impartial.

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee President Uttam Kumar Reddy alleged that the TRS government has been curtailing media freedom and journalists are working in fear and insecurity following 'threats' issued by the state government.

The Indian equity market continued to trade rangebound for the last couple of days. Decoupling of breadth and profit booking in index heavyweights are major concerns, while the April F&O expiry and downturn in volatility are factors to be considered.

The overall momentum though looks in favour of the bulls since the index is trading above its short-term moving averages. Immediate support are placed at 10,400-10,500 levels, which are well protected by moving averages like the 20 and 50 Days.

Another major point to look at is the reduction in breadth from 9,950 to 10,400. The overall major contributor like metals, banking, autos and financials are now seeing some profit booking at higher levels.

Revival in FMCG, IT, pharma and realty are playing the lead role. Above expected numbers posted by Tata Consultancy Services also bolstered momentum with IT stocks coming to party and adding 10-15 percent in the last couple of days

Related stories

A decline in volatility has further aided the momentum for bulls which shows the range to be intact with an upward bias since we have seen writing in strikes at 10,500-10,400 along with 10,700-10,800.

The upside can now be further seen only if there is some support from the Bank Nifty. We need to see if it sustains the 24,850-25,000 mark then an upward move to 25,500-25,600 cannot be ruled out.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give up to 7% return:

Reliance Industries: BUY | Target: Rs 1040 | Stop loss: Rs 930 | Return: 7%

The stock is coming out of a long consolidation on the back of higher volume while the momentum indicators also show a positive divergence in the stock suggesting that the upside may continue with a possible target of Rs 1040.

If the stocks manage to stay above Rs 1040 then the rally may extend to Rs 1090. Traders should place a stop loss below Rs 930 for all long positions.

Nifty rose for three consecutive weeks, surging 1.48 percent to close at 10,480.60. On a weekly time frame, the index has formed 'Three White Soldiers' which predicts reversal of a downtrend. It is likely to retest 10,650-10,670 levels on the upside: the Inner Trendline which might work as the immediate hurdle zone.

The Nifty Index Futures presented a pullback rally after testing the 200-DMA placed at 10,155. A sustained trade above the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement level of the recent correction (i.e. 10,640-10,155) placed at 10,455 can extend the rally to levels of 10,640-10,770.

However, failure to cross the immediate resistance of 10,455 can resume the choppy and volatile trading sessions dragging the index lower to levels of 10,155-10,095.

Moreover, RSI turned down from the neutral levels of 50 in the recent pullback, this time around a move above 50 will suggest that the current pullback rally can extend higher.

Intermediate pullbacks cannot be ruled out keeping in mind that most of the stocks are displaying positive divergences on the chart, however; following this pullback gradual corrections can also resume as chart structure on the monthly time frame suggest prolonged weakness.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give up to 17% return in the next 3-4 weeks:

On the weekly chart, Amara Raja Batteries Ltd. (AMARAJABAT) is on the verge of a breakout from a trend line resistance line placed at 818 (as indicated on chart).

On the daily chart, the stock is on the verge of a breakout from a channel pattern after taking support at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level suggesting a temporary bottom formation is in place.

Moreover, RSI has turned upwards after taking support at the 40 level indicating a shift in a range in favour of the bulls. The stock may be bought in the range of 810-815 for a target of 880-915, and a stop loss below 765.

Bajaj Auto Ltd: BUY| Target Rs3300| Stop Loss Rs2840| Return 12%

On the weekly chart, Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BAJAJ-AUTO) has turned upwards after testing the lower end of the channel suggests that the downtrend is weakening. A sustained trade above 3000 levels with healthy volumes can resume the up move.

Moreover, the stock has formed a bullish harmonic pattern suggesting bullishness in the coming trading sessions. RSI has turned upwards breaking out of the upper band of the Bollinger Bands suggesting higher levels in the coming trading sessions.

The stock may be bought in the range of 2940-2970 for targets of 3175-3300, keeping a stop loss below 2840.

PNC Infratech Ltd: BUY| Target Rs187| Stop Loss Rs147| Return 17%

ICICI Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

In 9MFY18, BAL domestic 2-W volumes have de-grown by 7% when the 2-W industry grew 12% (motorcycle industry growth- 10%). This is because the growth in premium segment (>150 cc) led by Pulsar is more than offset by the steep decline in V & Avenger twin models in 125-150cc. Going ahead, the management expects to end FY18 with 210000 units in March 2018 (Jan 18’-163111 units).

Outlook

With the first model of Triumph & Husqvarna expected in FY21, we see limited positives for the domestic 2-W business of BAL in the medium term. Non participation in the growing scooter segment and failure of recent launches like Avenger & V12/15 remains a concern for us. We value BAL on an SOTP basis, valuing the core business at 16x FY20E EPS and investment in KTM to arrive at a target price of Rs 3400. We have a HOLD recommendation on the stock.

Edelweiss Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s (BJAUT) Q3FY18 EBITDA, at INR12bn (up 18 YoY), came 7% below estimate due to commodity cost pressure. Domestic two-wheeler volume outlook remains positive driven by market share gains; however, we estimate subdued growth in three wheelers post a strong FY18 driven by new permits. Exports outlook is improving with traction in new/nascent markets as well as volume recovery in Nigeria (already clocked peak retail sales of ~35K).

Outlook

We estimate volume/EPS CAGR of 11%/14% over FY18-20. Despite weak volumes in the past two years, BJAUT has clocked ~20% margin, ~25% RoE and strong FCF. Key potential stock triggers are faster uptick in export markets and recently launched Discover gaining acceptance in domestic market. We maintain ‘HOLD/SU’ with TP of INR3,399. At CMP, the stock trades at 19.1x and 16.7x FY19E and FY20E EPS, respectively.For all recommendations report, click here

KR Choksey's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL) reported net sales of INR 63,693.40 Mn which grew by 25.7% y-o-y but declined marginally by 3.2% q-o-q. The top-line of the company was driven by increase in sales volumes (17.6% y-o-y) majorly led by robust growth witnessed in commercial vehicles (CVs) during Q3FY18 (78% y-o-y). BAL registered highest ever quarterly sales of commercial vehicles in domestic market (110,123 units). The overall domestic market share of the company in three wheelers stood at 62% in Q3FY18.

Outlook

We expect BAL to post healthy top-line growth of 14.9% CAGR over FY17 to FY20E, mainly driven by 12.1% CAGR volume growth. BAL’s portfolio of higher-end bikes are likely to register healthy growth. While company faces stiff competition in domestic market, we believe exports to revive gradually especially after strong demand witnessed in Nigeria, Sri-Lanka and Egypt. Also company plans to have a deeper penetration in ASEAN markets which will boost BAL’s exports. The robust growth in company’s three-wheelers is expected to continue in coming years on the back of new permits in domestic markets and increase in demand from overseas markets.

However the margins to are expected to remain under-pressure on account increase in commodity prices on back of rise in cost of steel and aluminum coupled with implementation of regulatory norms. At CMP of INR 3,173 BAL is trading at a P/E multiples of 17.2, we have assigned a P/E multiple of 19x on FY20E EPS of INR 184.4 to arrive at a target price of INR 3,504 displaying an upside of 10.4%. We therefore recommend an “Accumulate” rating on the stock.For all recommendations report, click here

Bajaj Auto said workers at its manufacturing plants at Akurdi and Chakan in Maharashtra have gone on an indefinite hunger strike.

Earlier this month, the company had received a notice from the workers union - Vishwa Kalyan Kamgar Sanghatana - for an indefinite hunger strike at the two plants from January 29.

In a regulatory filing, Bajaj Auto said the main reasons for the indefinite hunger strike as mentioned in the letter are the pending issue of eight workmen dismissed from the services for various acts of misconduct in 2013-14.

Moreover, the workers were demanding the reinstatement of six dismissed workers who according to the company ""did not report at the place of transfer/ deputation in spite of court orders"" and delay in conclusion of the wage review process which is due with effect from April 1, 2016.

""The matter is pending before the Industrial Court, Pune and High Court of Bombay,"" the two wheeler major said.

The company further said that ""inspite of considerable progress made in concluding the wage review process, the union has chosen to adopt tools of hunger strike etc for pursuingt heir unreasonable and unrealistic demand"".

Bajaj Auto claimed that production at both the plants continued to be normal.

Axis Direct's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto had a tough last 5-6 years due to weakness in exports and domestic 2Ws. Consequently, even after 7% volume growth in FY18 (to ~3.9 mn) its volumes are 8-10% below FY12/13 levels.

Outlook

We upgrade FY19E/20E earnings by 7% and rating to BUY. At 14.6x P/E and 9.6x EV/EBITDA (FY20E), we find risk-reward attractive. Our TP of Rs 3,905 values the stock at 12x FY20E EV/EBITDA (+Rs 132/sh for KTM) and provides an upside of 23%.

With less than three months to go for the financial year to end, Bajaj Auto has not changed its target market share and is confident of closing the year with a share of 24 percent in the motorcycle segment.

It will be an uphill task for the Pune-based bike maker to meet the target as its current market share, as on December 31, stood at just 16 percent.

Speaking to Moneycontrol News, Eric Vas, president (motorcycle business), Bajaj Auto said, ""Yes the target of 24 percent still holds, which is for March-exit"". The company makes motorcycles only, having exited the scooter business a few years ago.

Bajaj reported sale of 1.47 million units during the three quarters ended December 2017 in the domestic market. This was 7 percent lower than the 1.58 million units sold in the same period last year. However, the company witnessed an uptick in sales recently, selling 1.12 lakh units in December, 6 percent higher than the 1.06 lakh units sold in December 2016.

Bajaj's confidence of market share gain stems from the launch of its 2018 range of products, in which a majority of its models received upgrades. The country’s fourth largest two-wheeler maker on Wednesday launched an entire series of upgrades for its Discover, Pulsar, Platina, Avenger, Dominar and V brands.

The company re-launched the Discover in the economy bike segment, with a 110 cc engine, priced at Rs 50,496 (ex-showroom, Maharashtra). The bike will be positioned in the premium executive segment, above its entry-level models CT 100 and Platina. Bajaj also launched an upgraded Discover 125, which now features double LED DRL headlamps, and comes with a price tag of Rs 53,491.

Hero Motocorp is currently the market leader in the economy bike segment (100-110 cc) with models such as Splendor and HF Deluxe, while Honda Shine is the leader in the executive segment (125 cc). These new additions from Bajaj sit between the two competitors in terms of pricing.

Besides, Vas also said that there will be a sharp increase in prices from April 1, 2018, though he did not clarify the extent of the increase. This will be on account of addition of the anti-lock braking system (ABS) technology, which has been mandated by the government for all two-wheelers (CBS for some two-wheelers).

The difference between the prices of a model with ABS and one without it comes to around Rs 10,000 at present, which Vas hopes will reduce with mass consumption. However there is an expectation of a minimum increase of Rs 6,000 on every new model launched after April 1, 2018 (April 1, 2019 for existing two-wheelers).",448,0.5858627676963806

Bajaj Auto, India’s fourth largest two-wheeler manufacturer, will bring back the Discover brand in the economy segment with a launch scheduled on January 10.

The Pune-based motorcycle specialist will kick off the new year with the age-old brand to gain market share in the budget category where market leader Hero Motocorp is the strongest.

The Discover 110 is expected to be priced competitively at around Rs 46,000-48,000. Though the entry segment has seen a gradual fall in demand over the years, it still commands a share of 60 percent in the overall motorcycle market.

As per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), Delhi-based Hero Motocorp had a market share of 74 percent in the up to 110cc motorcycle segment followed by 13 percent of Bajaj and 8 percent of Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India.

The Discover 110 launch comes close on the heels of Hero Motocorp showcasing three motorcycles last month — Super Splendor 125, Passion Pro 110 and Passion Xpro 110 — that would be progressively launched this month.

Presently, Bajaj has only one model on sale under the Discover brand, which is powered by a 125cc engine and priced at Rs 53,000. Sources say that this model, too, will be given a facelift.

Little more than 14 months ago, Bajaj Auto had brought curtains on three Discover models, 100, 110M and 125M. Year before that the 125ST and more recently the 150F and 150S, all under the Discover brand were phased out.

Bajaj tried to position the Discover brand as a slightly premium alternative to the budget 100cc bikes where it has the Platina and CT100. Discover models have more aggressive styling than rivals but are marketed on the promise of greater fuel efficiency.

First introduced in 2004, the Discover was launched with a 125cc engine, complementing the powerful Pulsar 150 and Pulsar 180 at that time. The company phased out Discover completely following dwindling demand only to bring it back some years ago to pose a challenge to the Hero Splendor.

Platina and CT100 make up more than half of Bajaj’s sales every month while 14 other models make up the balance of sales including the Pulsar and Avenger series. Demand for a bulk of such budget models come from markets outside the cities especially from the Tier III markets.

Bajaj hopes to close the final quarter with a share of 24 percent in the total motorcycle segment riding high on a refreshed range of Pulsars and new variants on the Platina and CT100 models.",432,0.023792579770088196

Average monthly volumes in FY18YTD have improved to ~24.7k (v/s ~21.1k/month in FY17). Strong domestic demand coupled with recovery in 3W exports is leading to capacity constraints for BJAUT in the 3W business.

Austria's sports bike maker KTM plans to roll out Husqvarna brand in India by 2020 and production at partner Bajaj Auto's Chakan plan is expected to begin in late 2019. The company will use Bajaj Auto's Chakan plant to roll out the brand in the country. KTM already has an installed capacity to produce 1 lakh KTM bikes at Chakan.

It plans to add another capacity of 1 lakh units for Husqvarna brand, taking the total capacity to 2 lakh units per annum for both KTM and Husqvarna brands.

""It has been agreed upon and they (Husqvarna bikes) should be launched in India by 2020. That means by the end of 2019 the manufacturing should begin at Chakan,"" KTM CEO Stefan Pierer told PTI on the sidelines of EICMA 2017 here.

The company plans to roll out products from Husqvarna's White Arrow and Black Arrow brands from Chakan, he added. The company looks to bring the bikes with engine capacities ranging from 150 cc to 390 cc on platforms which are similar to that of KTM.

KTM currently manufactures Husqvarna bikes in Austria. When asked about manufacturing capacity at Chakan for both KTM and also Husqvarna brands, Pierer said: ""This year we are already touching 1 lakh units with KTM programme. With Husqvarna, we want to double it to 2 lakh units.""

KTM sold over 40,000 units last year in India and this year it is expecting to cross 50,000 units, thus overtaking the US market, the current leading market for the brand. Pierer said KTM is also in talks with Bajaj for distribution of bikes in new global markets.

""We are now talking for about some African countries from Ghana to Uganda, Ethiopia...also Iran...It can happen in a year's time,"" he said. The partners have already collaborated in various global markets including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Indonesia among others.

Bajaj Auto and KTM have completed a decade of strategic partnership under which the Austrian bike maker's models DUKE 125–390 and RC 125–390 are produced in Bajaj's Chakan plant and are distributed by the two partners globally. KTM had secured a long-term licence agreement from BMW in 2013 for the Husqvarna motorcycle, which was founded in 1903.

It now comes with anti-lock braking system (ABS) along with bigger disc brakes and perimeter frame to provide the highest level of stability and control for rider and ensure ultra-safe braking over any surface, the company said in a statement.

ABS prevents wheels from locking up, thus avoiding skidding during high-speed braking. On the new introduction, Bajaj Auto President (Motorcycles) Eric Vas said, ""We have received a large number of requests from our customers for ABS and hence, we are extending it to the NS200.""

He further said, ""The introduction of the ABS variant will enhance the bike's performance, appeal and strengthen our leadership in this performance segment."" The new variant is now introduced in all metros and will be progressively available across all dealerships in the country, the statement said.",179,0.9999983906745911

Kotak Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

BAL’s 2QFY18 results were operationally ahead of our expectation. Revenue for the quarter grew by 9% YoY, EBITDA margin declined YoY but improved QoQ and net profit was flat YoY. As against our estimates, EBITDA was 7% higher. Over the past many years, BAL has faced multiple volume growth headwind – both in the domestic and export market.

Outlook

However, we believe that the weak volume performance is behind us and we expect growth going ahead. Strong demand for three wheeler, improving demand in exports and low base in the domestic motorcycle segment will drive volume growth in the coming quarters. EBITDA margin is also expected to stay healthy over the medium term. We upgrade the stock to BUY with revised price target of Rs 3,631 (earlier 3,085).

ICICI Direct's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto reported its Q2FY18 results, which were above our estimates on the operational front. Revenues came in at Rs 6580 crore (up 8.7% YoY, 20.9%QoQ) against our estimate of Rs 6721 crore. The miss is attributable to lower than estimated realisation. Gross blended realisations declined 0.9% QoQ to ~Rs 64050 Total volumes for Q2FY18 were at 1071510 units (up 4% YoY, 21% QoQ). Domestic volumes grew 2% YoY, 40% QoQ to 668935 units. Export volumes rose 6% YoY, fell 2% QoQ to 402575 units. In export market, sales mix of new markets improved to 16% vs. 10% in FY17 Reported EBITDA was at Rs 1298 crore against our estimate of Rs 1304 crore. Reported EBITDA margins were at 19.7% (up 249 bps QoQ) against our estimate of 19.4%. The beat is mainly attributable to lower than estimated employee cost & other expenses Reported PAT was at Rs 1112 crore vs. our estimate of Rs 1108 crore.

Outlook

Although BAL’s performance has improved in volume terms, no participation in the growing scooter segment and failure of recent launches like Avenger & V12/15 remains a concern for us. We value BAL on an SOTP basis, valuing the core business at 17x FY19E EPS and investment in KTM to arrive at a target price of Rs 3170. We have a HOLD recommendation on the stock.For all recommendations report, click here

JM Financial's research report on Bajaj Auto

During 2QFY18, Bajaj Auto (BJAUT) reported robust EBITDA margin of 19.7%, +250bps QoQ, primarily aided by operating leverage and product mix. Exports are now on a strong growth trajectory aided by a) ramp-up in new markets and b) stabilization of key African markets such as Nigeria. BJAUT has increased its export guidance to 1.7mn vehicles from 1.6mn earlier on improved demand visibility. The Company has guided for 15% CAGR in exports over the next 3 years largely on expansion in new markets. Domestic motorcycle volumes are now on a recovery phase with recent refreshes and the company has indicated they would outperform the industry in 2HFY18 with steady market share gain. Domestic 3 wheelers are witnessing strong traction in key states such as Maharashtra, Delhi and Bangalore and the company is facing temporary capacity constraints to meet the robust momentum in domestic and export markets.

Outlook

We estimate 17% CAGR in BJAUT earnings over FY17-20E led by 12% volume CAGR; maintain BUY with a revised target price of INR 3,450. Weakness in export markets, INR appreciation and inability to expand domestic market share in motorcycle segment are key risks.For all recommendations report, click here

The automotive industry may look to ease some financial pressure in the final quarter of this year through some slight increase in prices despite the festive period not being as robust as expected.

Pune-based Bajaj Auto is contemplating a hike across its product range, which will perhaps come in January, to offset some of the input cost pressures suffered in the second and third quarters. Utility vehicle major Mahindra & Mahindra has already signaled that it too will revisit prices in the coming months.

Kevin D’Sa, Chief Financial Officer, Bajaj Auto, said, “There is an input cost pressure and it will be seen in Q3 and Q4 because steel [prices] have gone up a bit and aluminium has gone up substantially. The industry is in a position to absorb the price hike so at an appropriate time we will be able to take a call on the increase in price.”

Following the changeover to Bharat Stage IV (BS-4) from April 1, 2017 the two-wheeler industry has seen muted growth overall. According to data provided by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) two-wheeler sales grew 10 percent (motorcycle grew by 7 percent) during the six months ended September 2017.

Bajaj’s domestic sales fell 10 percent during the same period during which time it had to incur higher consumer acquisition expenses through discounts and promotional schemes.

Several potential buyers advanced their purchase to the final days of March to benefit from the fire sale held by all manufacturers. Two-wheeler makers were liquidating their BS-3 stock at a huge discount thereby creating a vacuum in the following months.

“Factoring higher customer acquisition costs in Q2 such as discounts on bikes and also factoring higher raw material costs, [there could probably be] a price hike in January; we will be able to maintain a margin of 21-22 percent in Q3 and Q4,” added D’Sa.

Further, Bajaj Auto is hoping for a reimbursement of some taxes from the Maharashtra government which rose due to the roll-out of Goods and Services Tax (GST) from July 1.

“The total amount of money lying with the government is Rs 1,500 crore. Rs 1000 crore is on account of value added tax for the state of Maharashtra. Of this, Rs 600 crore is for 2016-17, Rs 300 crore for Q1 2017-18. Transition arising out of GST is Rs 400 crore,” added D’Sa.

Bajaj is hoping for an increase in treasury income if the said amount is released by the government in the on-going second half of the current year.

“We only wish that the systems are much more simplified. Whatever the government has announced till now is for merchant traders; it is not for those who are into exports. I believe that by December a major part of this will be behind us. That should release cash flow. And that’s why my H2 will show better treasury income,” added D’Sa.",492,0.21007951668330602

Bajaj Auto, India’s fourth largest two-wheeler maker, is confident of closing the financial year with a market share of 24 percent on the back of the launch of a new model and a few upgrades.

On the basis of increased production for existing products and for new models, the Pune-based company will outperform the rest of the industry, a senior company official said.

Kevin D’Sa, Chief Financial Officer, Bajaj Auto said,”The Avenger will come with an upgrade - some new features – which will happen in the last quarter of this year. And we are looking to put a vehicle in the mid-commuter segment with a new brand where we have the V12”.

Bajaj launched the ‘V’ series of bikes starting with the V15 in March 2016. Subsequently, the company followed with the launch of V12 in January this year. Both bikes are targeted at the commuter segment for the urban and semi-urban buyer.

“In the second half we expect Bajaj Auto to outperform the industry on the basis of new products which have been very well accepted in the market. The industry should grow by 8-8.5 percent for the year”, added D’Sa.

Bajaj hopes that a new addition to this segment will revive its dwindling sales. From about 22,000-25,000 units a month coming from the V15 alone the ‘V’ family now generates only around 11,000-12,000 units a month.

With increased demand for the CT100 and Platina, refurbished Avenger series and hike in production of the Dominar, Bajaj hopes that it will attain the targeted market share by end of the year. However, there would be no change to the CT100, Platina, Pulsa and KTM family of bikes at least till March 2018.

“The electric start option in the CT and the Platina has given us a growth in the rural market. We should close the year with a market share of 24 percent from the 19.5 percent share that we have today,” added D’Sa.

Further, Bajaj Auto has lined up an investment of Rs 250-300 crore as capital expenditure for the coming financial year. These will be spent in preparing the production commencement of the Husqvarna range of bikes from next year and its own product development.

“In calendar year 2020 there will be the first launch by Bajaj-Triumph”, added D’Sa. Bajaj announced a partnership with UK’s Triumph a few months ago which will encompass a new range of products for Triumph that will be much cheaper than its current range which starts at Rs 6 lakh. The bikes will be made at the Chakan facility near Pune.

The Pune-based company said that retail volumes increased 25 percent during the festive days leading up to Diwali when compared to the same period last year. While domestic motorcycle volumes for September for the company increased 7 percent to 2.47 lakh units its six months volumes for the same period reported a decline of 10 percent to 10 lakh units.",499,0.4398765138217381

EBITDA came in flat YoY at INR 13b (in-line), implying EBITDA margin of 19.7% (-170bp YoY, +250bp QoQ; est. of 19.1%). Lower-than-estimated RM cost and lower staff cost boosted the operating performance. The impact of lower other income was diluted by a lower tax rate. Adj. PAT declined 1% YoY to INR 11.1b (est. of INR 11.2b).

Outlook

Valuations at 22.3x/18.5x FY18E/19E standalone EPS are attractive, considering the worst of volumes and margins is behind. We value BJAUT at INR 3,753 (21x Sep-19 core EPS, and add INR 526 cash/share and INR 256/share value of KTM stake), implying Sep-19 PE of 19.8x. Maintain Buy.

Sharekhan's research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto Limited’s (BAL) Q2FY2018 margin performance was better than our as well as street expectations. Topline grew by 9% YoY backed by 4% volume growth. Domestic market volumes grew by 2%, while export volumes grew by 7%, led by recovery in export markets and low base. Revenue was also boosted by realisations (up 5% YoY) attributable to price hikes undertaken by the company and a richer product mix (higher share of premium bikes and three wheelers). OPM at 19.7% contracted 170BPS YoY but was better than our expectations of 18.4%.

Outlook

Given the better-than-anticipated margin performance in Q2FY2018, we have raised our earnings estimates by 6% and 5% for FY2018 and FY2019, respectively. We maintain our Buy recommendation on the stock with a revised PT of Rs. 3,625 (earlier PT of Rs. 3,470).

HDFC Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s (BJAUT) 2Q EBITDA at Rs 13bn (flat YoY), and margin at 19.7% came in-line with estimates. Net revenue came in at Rs 65.8bn (+8% YoY), owing to an increase in volumes (+4% YoY). BJAUT made a comeback in 2Q (APAT +16% QoQ, margin +250bps QoQ), after three consecutive muted quarters (earnings were affected by BS-IV transition and GST uncertainty). The newly-launched CT 100 ES, and the new Platina and Pulsar NS200 are gaining traction. The company has been garnering share in PCs and cargo 3Ws. The abolition of permits in Maharashtra continues to boost sales (expecting monthly run rate at 50-55k in the next six months). The export market is also ramping up, led by volume stability in key markets like Nigeria and Egypt, and incremental volumes in Bangladesh, Nepal and Philippines. The company is targeting 1.7mn units of export volume in FY18E (implying 20% growth). BJAUT is also aggressively looking at a foray into EVs in the 2W and 3W space and planning roll-outs by FY20E.

Outlook

We have trimmed our FY18E by 3%, factoring in lower 1HFY18 volumes. Maintain BUY with a SOTP-based TP of Rs 3,598 (20x 19E Core EPS + cash + 30% discount for KTM stakeFor all recommendations report, click here

KR Choksey's research report on Bajaj Auto

Company’s Gross sales stood at INR 65,664 Mn which was up by 2.1% y-o-y and 12.2% q-o-q. Gross sales of the company came in line with our estimates of INR 65,453 Mn. Growth in Gross sales was driven by increase in volumes of motorcycles by 2% Y-o-Y, the company reported highest ever sales of Pulsar (112,075 units) in September 2017 on account of festive season. Also, Commercial vehicles segment of the company grew by 14% Y-o-Y (Domestic by 14% Y-o-Y and Exports 13% Y-o-Y).

Outlook

We expect BAL to post healthy top-line growth of 13.9% CAGR between FY17 to FY20E, mainly driven by 11.1% CAGR volume growth. However, going forward we expect the EBITDA margins to remain under-pressure on account increase in commodity prices on back of rise in cost of steel and aluminum coupled with implementation of regulatory norms. BAL’s portfolio of higher-end bikes are likely to register healthy growth. While company faces stiff competition in domestic market, we believe exports to revive gradually especially after stability being witnessed in Nigeria and other regional markets. While we expect the company to post a top-line growth of 13.9% CAGR, company’s profit growth (~9.4% CAGR between FY17 to FY20E) are un-likely to improve anytime soon. Hence, we have assigned a multiple of 19x on FY20E EPS of INR 185 and we have valued the stock on (PE+DCF) basis by allocating a 50-50 weight. Our DCF value stands at INR 3,452/share and PE target stands at INR 3,511/ share to arrive at a target price of INR 3481.3/share, indicating 7% upside from CMP of INR 3,241.

The festive days in the run-up to Diwali gave motorcycle-specialist Bajaj Auto a 25 percent bump-up in retail volumes. A chunk of it came from low-end, budget bikes like CT100 and Platina.

But for Bajaj Auto, which prides itself on the 20 percent EBITDA margin every quarter, both the bikes generate single-digit margin. In fact, the CT100 is EBITDA negative, according to the company’s chief financial officer.

So why does this Pune-based, India’s fourth largest two-wheeler maker, continue to produce a loss-making product?

“We have a negative EBIDTA on the CT100 and single digit margin on the Platina. But what is important to note is that when you have these sort of things the underutilization of capacity gets spread out,” said Kevin D’sa, Chief Financial Officer, Bajaj Auto.

According to D’Sa, continuous production, even of loss-making products, improves capacity utilization, bringing down unit costs overall making costs competitive.

“Therefore, in Q1 (April-June) the labour cost as a percentage of sale was 4.9 percent and in Q2 (July-September) it was 4 percent. The fall is primarily because of the higher number of CT and Platinas sold and my operating leverage came into play,” added D’Sa.

The CT100 is the lowest priced product by Bajaj at Rs 33,000 and is priced less than half compared to the Pulsar 150 (at Rs 76,000), the country’s largest-selling bike in the premium segment, which generates a margin of around 20 percent. Bajaj is expecting a further rise in demand for the CT100 given that an electric start version of the bike was launched two months ago.

“So with our declared margins of 20.8 percent (for Q2), I don’t see it declining at all significantly because the higher number of CT and Platinas that come into play are as a result of the underutilization of capacity being used,” added D’Sa.

Further, high margins on three-wheelers (mainly auto-rickshaws) will offset the loss on bikes and help the company post overall margins of 21-22 percent in the second half of the year. Three-wheelers are one of the most profitable products for the company generating as high as 25 percent margins.

With Maharashtra and Gujarat doing away with permits and Karnataka expected to follow suit, demand for passenger three-wheelers is expected to go up substantially in the coming months.

“There could be an incremental volume of 100,000 over the next 6-7 months. We have a capacity of 50,000-55,000 units a month but the actual demand is 60,000 units. In the near term (October-November) we can shift the export volumes to cater to domestic demand,” added D’Sa.

Bajaj may not increase its three-wheeler production capacity immediately but will reroute export production to cater to the domestic market. Much of the hike in production will have to be done at the vendor’s end.

“We should be able to do 570,000 three-wheelers this year. EBITDA margin is well over 25 percent on three-wheelers. With they hitting 320,000 in the domestic market we should be able to see margins in the region of 21-22 percent,” added D’Sa.

Bajaj Auto has a lion’s share of the domestic passenger three-wheeler segment. In the six months ended September the company clocked sales of 1.28 lakh units, having a share of 62 percent. Piaggio Vehicles is the second largest company with a share of 22 percent.",559,0.3222218288315667

Small in midcap stocks continue with their uptrend for the third straight day this week. The S&P BSE Smallcap index and the S&P BSE Midcap index were trading over 0.5 percent each.

Stocks hitting fresh 52-week high mostly belong to the broader market but experts advise an investor to turn cautious towards this space because valuations could be a concern.

“Valuations, at the end of the day, are determined by factors such as the quality of earnings, the predictability of those earnings and the staying power of companies,” Nitasha Shankar, Sr. Vice President and Head of Research, YES Securities (I) Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Instead of classifying stocks as mid, small or largecap in nature, one would do better to look at valuations in conjunction with quantitative & qualitative aspects like financial ratios, balance sheet strength, stance in industry, pricing power, the changing industry dynamics, competitive pressures, amongst others,” she said.

The Nifty50 rose above its crucial psychological resistance level of 10,050 led by gains in Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, Bajaj Auto, Aurobindo Pharma, Axis Bank, HPCL etc.

Tracking the momentum, as many as 107 stocks hit a fresh 52-week high on the NSE which include names like Gillette India, Bajaj Auto, APL Apollo Tube, Motilal Oswal, HIL, Mahanagar Gas, Birla Corp, MM Forging, Dilip Buildcon etc. among others.

The index is now just a little over 100 points away from hitting a fresh record high of 10,178 but analysts' do not see a breakout even if Nifty reclaims record high level.

After the Nifty clocked 10,000 for the first time in July, the index, along with the overall market, has witnessed a consolidation phase. JM Financial’s Gautam Shah believes that the market action in the past three months has been very confusing.

“But there is clarity on one aspect that this is clearly a battle between liquidity and valuations. At 9700-9800, liquidity support is seen, while around 10,100-odd levels, overseas investors come into play and restrict the upmove,” Shah, Associate Director and Technical Analyst at JM Financial told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.

This kind of a move, amid a positive environment, is discouraging as the Nifty has not made higher highs due to selling pressure. His sense is that the current recovery is a relief rally and a temporary one and it could end once the Nifty hovers around 10,100 levels.",542,0.33001480499903363

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday kept its key lending rate—the repo rate—unchanged at 6 percent, dashing hopes of lower borrowing costs for households and the companies ahead of the festival season.

The six member monetary policy committee (MPC), headed by RBI governor Urjit Patel, kept one eye firmly on the rising inflation that is perilously inching towards the RBI’s 4 percent threshold level.

The MPC reiterated that it is imperative to reinvigorate investment activity which, in turn, would revive the demand for bank credit by industry as existing capacities get utilised and the requirements of new capacity open up to be financed.

Recapitalising public sector banks adequately will ensure that credit flows to the productive sectors are not impeded and growth impulses not restrained.

In addition, the following measures could be undertaken to support growth and achieve a faster closure of the output gap: a concerted drive to close the severe infrastructure gap; restarting stalled investment projects, particularly in the public sector; enhancing ease of doing business, including by further simplification of the GST; and ensuring faster rollout of the affordable housing program with time-bound single-window clearances and rationalisation of excessively high stamp duties by states.

Interest rate sensitive stocks are almost trading flat. Among the big banking names, State Bank of India was up 0.64 percent at Rs 252.90 while ICICI Bank was in the red, down by 0.5 percent at Rs 277.05.

TVS Motor Company is in the process of developing electric two wheelers with plans to roll them out soon in the domestic market, said a senior company executive.

The Chennai-based company, with its prior experience in electric mobility, is developing models which it thinks would fulfil requirements of modern day customer.

""We are very keen on that (electric) space and as a major OEM in the two-wheeler space we believe that we will have a strong presence in electric segment as well,"" TVS Motor Company Vice President (Marketing) Commuter Motorcycles, Scooters and Corporate Brand Aniruddha Haldar told PTI. Pointing to the emergence of electric mobility in the country, he said this segment is going to be significant in future.

""We have been working on it for quite some time. In the past we had products (electric...) too. We continue to work on that and as technology has grown so has our capability,"" Haldar said.

With emerging technologies in the vertical, the company is now able to now build out an offering that would fulfil actual need of the customer on the ground, he added. When asked about the time frame to roll out such products, Halder said: ""We will be in the market soon.""

He did not elaborate on the timeline. Without confirming product details, he said that the company can introduce both -- a scooter and a bike. The Indian electric two-wheeler market has players like Hero Electric and Lohia which sell battery powered scooters.

Established conventional players like Hero MotoCorp, and Bajaj Auto have expressed interest to enter the segment. Despite efforts put in by the industry and government, sales of electric scooter remain abysmally low -- 15,000 to 20,000 units per year -- against whopping 1.7 crore petrol two-wheelers annually.

High price of lithium powered scooters, even after subsidy, is one of the main reasons for low sales. Currently, 99 per cent of the electric scooter sold are powered by low- speed lead batteries due to affordability factor.

TVS Motor Co has an overall market share of around 15 per cent in the domestic two-wheeler space, which is led by the likes of Hero MotoCorp and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI). TVS has moved up the ladder to take second spot in the scooter segment, behind HMSI.

Indian automobile giant Eicher Motors is preparing to make a binding offer to acquire Italian superbike maker Ducati for USD 1.8 billion- USD 2 billion, according to a report in The Economic Times.

The offer, if successful, will boost Eicher's portfolio giving them access to technology, brand equity and its global reach.

According to the report, Eicher is the only Asian company to have bid in the ongoing auction for Ducati. The company is also finalising financing and structuring terms with banks and consultants.

German auto giant Volkswagen Group (VW) who owns Ducati via its Audi division has been keen on selling it. Volkswagen has been working with the investment bank Evercore to sell the Ducati brand for around Euro 1.5 billion. The valuation is 14-15 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) which is around Euro 100 million.

The funds are expected to help Volkswagen's strategic overhaul following the 2015 emissions scandal.

According to reports in the media, several auto manufacturers including Harley Davidson, Suzuki, India's Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp Ltd were interested in buying Ducati along with private equity funds such as KKR and CVC Capital Partners.",204,0.9999998807907104

Exactly a decade ago, Bajaj Auto's Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj attempted to take over UK’s famed motorcycle brand Triumph.

Bajaj and John Bloor, owner of the privately-held Triumph, held extensive talks across 2007-08. Bloor had even visited Bajaj’s plant in Chakan near Pune as part of the due diligence process. However, the deal fell through.

Interestingly, Ducati was also up for sale during the same period (as it is now) and Bajaj had thrown its hat in the ring. But those plans did not work out either because of the high asking price. The Italian company was eventually sold to VW-controlled Audi five years later.

In the end, Bajaj bought a stake in little-known Austrian off-road bike specialist KTM.

Now, a decade on, the Bajaj and Triumph courtship has come full circle. Last week, the two companies announced a tie-up to build mid-capacity motorcycles together not just for the Indian market but for world markets as well. This non-equity partnership will address the growing demand for leisure riding, which has contributed to making Harley Davidson the leader in the segment.

“We hope to bring to bear upon global markets the individual strengths of the partners including brand position and perception, design and development technology, quality and cost competitiveness and worldwide distribution,” John’s son Nick Bloor and Bajaj said in a joint statement which promised to disclose more details in the future.

Premium bikes, premium price

Over the years, Bajaj Auto, the country’s fourth biggest two-wheeler maker, has rapidly moved from scooters to economy motorcycles to premium bikes. Today, the most powerful and most expensive two-wheeler in its line-up is the Dominar 400. The company aims to scale up further by building bikes that can have engines up to 800cc from the Chakan facility. To do that, it needs a leg up on complex technology that is vastly different from what is used in everyday commuter bikes.

And that's where Triumph comes in.

Triumph has an engine capacity range starting from 675cc going up to 2,300cc, the largest seen on any mass-production motorcycle in the world. Its bikes cost £9600- £14,100 (about Rs 8 lakh-11.7 lakh) in its home market, the UK. In comparison, Bajaj’s engine range starts at 100cc and goes up to 375cc. Its price starts at Rs 32,000 and peaks at Rs 1.55 lakh.

While Bajaj has steered clear of the rapidly growing segment of scooters, the company has managed to make the switch to premium bikes, a segment where its competition including Hero Motocorp, Honda and TVS Motors have failed to make a mark.

With flagships such as Pulsar, Avenger and now Dominar 400, Bajaj is the leader in the premium category of commuter bikes (loosely classified as those having engines above 150cc but under 350cc).

Lessons from KTM

When Bajaj bought an initial stake in KTM, the Austrian company’s annual sales hovered around 65,000 units. By the end of this year, year more than 2.5 lakh KTMs will be sold across the world, out of which 100,000 will be made by Bajaj at Chakan.

Like Triumph, the loss-making KTM too was into low volume, high engine capacity bikes targeted at the developed markets of Europe, Asia and North America. Bajaj and KTM then kick-started a number of projects addressing the needs of emerging markets including India, Thailand, Malaysia as well as the developed markets.

KTM did not have sporty, smaller capacity (125cc-375cc) street bikes in 2007 and was instead into off-road, dirt bikes and some big engine touring bikes.

The partnership with Bajaj resulted in the development of six new models under the Duke and RC brands, including a 125cc bike which is built in India but sold only in export markets.

All these models are priced in the range Rs 1.4 lakh -2.3 lakh, which was also a white space when they debuted a few years ago. This year, another brand Husqvarna (owned by KTM) will be added to the production lines at Chakan plant.

KTM and Triumph

The similarities between KTM and Triumph are uncanny. Back in 2007, Triumph Motorcycles clocked annual sales of around 37,000 units. Over the decade, this figure increased to just 65,000 while volumes of KTM jumped nearly four times during the same period.

Triumph tried its hand in the mid-capacity segment five years ago when it announced plans of downsizing its engines to around 300cc. This was done to address the needs of buzzing new markets like India where the consumer trend of moving to mid-capacity bikes was gathering pace.

However, it later abandoned those plans as entering a price-sensitive segment without a local partner carried a substantial risk on return on investment. The management at Triumph then decided to focus solely on superbikes.

Triumph strategy

The popularity of cruiser and touring bikes is on the rise not just in India but across emerging markets. Eicher Motors-owned Royal Enfield, which makes this class of motorcycles, has seen demand go through the roof. In just five years, the Delhi-headquartered company raised annual production five-fold to 8.25 lakh (2017-18) from 1.5 lakh (2012-13).

“KTM rides in a space which is sporty riding. There is also another world out there which is the world of easy riding, the world of Harley-Davidson, Triumph and Royal Enfield. This segment so far was the only missing piece in our puzzle”, Rajiv Bajaj had said at the 10th AGM of Bajaj Auto recently.

According to Bajaj, KTM and Husqvarna have a potential to do 500,000 units a year in sales jointly. Taking a cue from Royal Enfield sales, Bajaj is confident of clocking a similar number from Triumph as well.

“If KTM and Husqvarna can do half a million motorcycles a year believe me they can do a million motorcycles together (with Triumph),” said Bajaj.",969,0.7304815948009491

Two-wheeler manufacturer, Bajaj Auto, yesterday announced a partnership with UK’s Triumph Motorcycles to jointly make mid-capacity motorcycles for Indian and global markets. This non-equity partnership will look to address growing demand for leisure riding, something on the lines of products from Harley Davidson. However, with Bajaj’s low-cost expertise the partnership will address the budget segment buyers looking for bikes having engine capacity of 400cc-800cc.

Here's what top research and broking firms think about Bajaj Auto's prospects in the months to come:

Brokerage: Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 3,281 | upside 13%

Motilal Oswal has maintained a buy on 2-wheeler manufacturer Bajaj Auto with an upside potential of 13 percent for target price of Rs 3,281, after the company declared a partnership with UK’s Triumph Motorcycles aiming to develop a range of mid-capacity (250-750cc) motorcycles. The partnership will focus on entering new higher-volume market segments, especially in emerging markets. The size of the mid-capacity segment (250-750cc) is estimated at 1 million motorcycles annually. Since Bajaj Auto has limited presence in this segment, and thus, should benefit from Triumph’s association.

Bajaj Auto will sell its products in global markets like Africa and part of ASEAN/Latin American countries. Triumph is expected to sell products in other markets. The research firm believes that this partnership will leverage on strengths of both the players – Triumph’s brand position/perception and design & development technology, and Bajaj Auto's quality/cost competitiveness and worldwide distribution. Bajaj Auto will manufacture Triumph motorcycles at its Chakan facility (existing or new plant). It also indicated that a plant might have to be added for both Triumph and Husqvarna.

Motilal Oswal believes that worst of volumes and margins for Bajaj Auto is reflected in Q1 FY'18, with recovery expected in volumes in domestic and export markets from H2 FY'18.

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 2,590

Global research firm Credit Suisse has a neutral rating on Bajaj Auto with a target price of Rs 2,590. However, it has an underweight weight on the sector as a whole. Credit Suisse believes that the non-equity partnership of Bajaj Auto with Triumph Motorcycles for mid-capacity bikes is to make in India and sold globally with the idea to replicate the success that Bajaj has had with KTM. Bajaj has a good positioning on sports and street bikes. In Husqvarna, it has a tie-up in place for adventure bikes, it said.

The idea is to leverage the strength of the Triumph brand and low-cost engineering capabilities of Bajaj to produce mid-capacity bikes focused on emerging markets. The main focus area is India, but Bajaj will also be responsible for selling Triumph bikes in certain Latin America, African and ASEAN markets, the research firm said.",496,0.690067877372106

With a name to justify its loyalty, early Chetak owners had no idea that their beloved scooter will live to serve multiple generations of their family. With such a time-tested track record, it wouldn’t be wrong to expect the Chetak to hit the Indian roads once again. This was a list of iconic Indian motorcycles which should make a return to the Indian market. Whether our wishes come true, only time can tell. (Image credit: Wikimedia Commons)

Rajiv Bajaj is known to be candid. And he stayed true to form while addressing shareholders at Bajaj Auto’s tenth AGM last week. “I know at least two people who think that Bajaj should re-enter the scooter market,” the company’s managing director said. “One of them is the Vice Chairman, and the second one I don’t need to mention.”

Rajiv was referring to his father, Rahul Bajaj, the Chairman of the Bajaj Group. The last time Bajaj Auto made a scooter was in 2009. That’s probably a hard fact to digest for a man who ruled the scooter market for several years.

And it was one particular model that made him king.

First launched in 1972, the Bajaj Chetak was at one point the largest selling scooter in India. However, the Permit Raj of that period meant its production was capped. As a result, demand continued to shoot through the roof year after year. At one point, the two-wheeler had a 10-year waiting period. Even second-hand Chetaks were hard to come by and those that were available cost a bomb.

M Gabriel, a retired university professor from Chennai, fondly recalls his Bajaj Chetak. Bought in the 1980s, it was first his vehicle. “One of my daughters would sit in the front and the other would sit at the back,” he says.

That seating arrangement was the enduring image of Indian middle class families of the 70s and 80s.

The scooter became a status symbol. There were tales about marriages being delayed to coincide with the arrival of a Chetak, which was part of the dowry.

So 45 years on, what lies behind the enduring legacy of this two-wheeler?

For starters, the Chetak turned out to be the perfect fit for a family man’s needs and aspirations. Its generous uni-body design gave ample leg space to the driver and riding pillion was also a comfortable affair. The sizeable trunk space ensured that market supplies could be tucked underneath the seat or in between the driver’s legs on those rare spendthrift days.

Then there was the mileage. Gabriel says the last time he regularly used his Chetak in 2013, it gave 30-40 kilometres per litre on average as he dutifully serviced it twice a year. Like several other Chetak owners, he also accepted its little quirks, like how it occasionally needed to be tipped to one side for the petrol to reach the spark plug before starting and how the clutch wire and handle needed to be adjusted. The Chetak also needed to be “jump started” by pushing it before kickstarting the scooter as it rolled along.

“In those days, the scooter was the gentleman’s ride,” recalls Gabriel. “With its loud engine, the Enfield was seen as the choice of a rasher driver.”’

Hakeem K from Mallapuram in Kerala owns three vintage scooters, one of which is a prized 2005 model of the Chetak. “This was the first scooter I bought. I had my eyes on it since the 11th grade,” he said. “My friend sold it to me for Rs 15,000 and I haven’t looked back since.”

Hakeem even took a 700-kilometre trip on his Chetak to Thanjavur in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. ""There was no problem with the engine at any point,"" he said.

But the allure faded over time. The next generation, many of whom learnt to ride a two-wheeler on the Chetak, went on to choose motorbikes that were edgier, sturdier, faster and economical.

Bajaj finally exited the scooter segment because it failed to develop their models effectively, which led to their market share being eroded.

In the end, the iconic scooter was killed off in 2005 as Bajaj Auto felt the motorcycle market would be a better bet.

Today, the Chetak is a firm favourite among vintage scooter fans. On Facebook pages such as Bajaj Chetak Rocks, there is trading of both old models and modification ideas.Several American and European Chetak owners also proudly post videos and images of their famous rides

In 2015, Bajaj Auto re-registered the Chetak brand name, hinting that the window of returning to scooters is still open despite the company having invested all its energy in making motorcycles. However, it was evident at last week’s AGM that Rajiv Bajaj faces a dilemma.

His father, Rahul Bajaj, turned 79 last month. “Some of my colleagues told me that maybe he will retire if I make a scooter,” Rajiv said. “It is such a special occasion that we can’t make just another stupid 100cc scooter. I think we should make a Rolls-Royce on two wheels, an outstanding scooter which does not exist anywhere in the world.”

He then asked the shareholders two questions.

Rajiv: “Should we make such an outstanding scooter?”

Shareholders: “Yes”’

Rajiv: “And if we make such a scooter, should my father retire?”

Shareholders: “No”

Rajiv: “I knew that.”

KR Choksey's research report on Bajaj Auto

BAL reported Net sales of INR 58,542 Mn for Q1FY18 above our estimates of INR 55,628 Mn. Top-line of the company de-grew by 3.9% on Y-o-Y basis but showed a positive growth of 12.3% on Q-o-Q. Company’s top line was dragged down in volumes of domestic motorcycle by ~22% Y-o-Y (April- June) leading to overall volume de-growth of 10.7% Y-o-Y. EBITDA showed a marginal rise of 3.7% from INR 9,049 Mn in Q4FY17 to INR 9,382 Mn in Q1FY18, which was slightly below our estimates of INR 9,687 Mn. On Y-o-Y basis EBITDA declined by 20.3% from INR 11,763 Mn. EBITDA margins contracted from 19.3% in Q1FY17 to 17.2% in Q1FY18, which was 20bps less than our estimates of 17.4%. This was mainly due to increase in input (metal) cost which led increase in the cost of raw materials 280bps Y-o-Y and 220bps Q-o-Q. BAL reported Adj. PAT of INR 9,616 Mn which was above our estimates of INR 9,053 Mn. The company reported a 11.5% increase on Q-o-Q but declined 7.5% Y-o-Y. Sharp increase in “Other Income” led to growth of PAT which was further boosted by INR 470.5Mn dividend from KTM. The company reported Adj.PAT margins of 17.7% which declined by 40 bps Y-o-Y.

Outlook

We expect BAL to post healthy top-line growth of 13.7% CAGR between FY17 to FY19E, mainly driven by 11% CAGR volume growth. However, going forward we expect the EBITDA margins to remain under-pressure on account increase in commodity prices coupled with implementation of regulatory norms. BAL’s portfolio of higher-end bikes are likely to register healthy growth. However, slowness in passing the price hike and constant pressure of competition (HMSI and TVS Motors) are likely to limit market-share growth for Bajaj Auto. While company faces stiff competition in domestic market, we believe exports to revive gradually. While we expect the company to post a top-line growth of 13.7% CAGR, company’s profit growth (~7.5% CAGR between FY17 to FY19E) are un-likely to improve anytime soon. Hence, we have assigned a multiple of 19x on FY19E EPS of INR 163 and we have valued the stock on (PE+DCF) basis by allocating a 50-50 weight. Our DCF value stands at INR 2978/share and PE target stands at INR 3,260/ share to arrive at a target price of INR 3,120/share, indicating 11% upside from CMP of INR 2,813.

Nitin AgrawalMoneycontrol Research

Bajaj Auto continues to be on the slow lane as is evident from its weak first quarter numbers. The company reported significant decline in volumes, revenue and contraction in margins. While a part of the challenge came from GST, Bajaj Auto had minimal disruption due to implementation of BS-IV. However, the underlying trend still points to weakness. Exports, while providing some respite to its financials, are yet to limp back to the sustainable growth trajectory. We continue to be cautious and await positive cues from the domestic market and sustained performance from export markets to change our stance on the stock.

Quarter in Numbers

Operating revenue fell by 5.3 percent year-on-year (YoY). However, it was up 12.3 percent sequentially. The fall in revenue came on the back of lower volumes which fell by 11 percent that was partially offset by an increase of 6.5 percent in average realization. Average realisation increased on the back of better product mix and price hike taken after launching BS-IV compliant vehicles.

Domestic volume subdued, exports gave respite

On the volume front, total domestic volume fell by 23 percent. Fall in the volumes led to a contraction of 250 bps (YoY) in 2-wheeler domestic market share.

On the other hand, export volumes grew by 10.5 percent on the back of entry to various new geographies and reduced dependencies on traditional high-volume countries like Sri Lanka, Nigeria etc. The export realisation was higher in the first quarter of this fiscal year partly because of higher foreign exchange. The management is confident of selling close to 8 lakh units in the export markets in the first half of this fiscal year.

Raw material price dented operating performance

The increase in raw material price led to 279 bps (YoY) fall in the gross margin and 324 bps (YoY) fall in EBITDA margin. Close to 110 basis points contraction may be attributed to raw material price increase owing to contract renewal which took place in April; another 50 basis points was due to excise duty on the company’s Pantnagar facility. Additionally, sales and promotion activities carried out in the month of April and May had an impact on the operating margins. Usually, the company passes on any increase in material cost but that comes with a lag and hence, there is an impact on operating margins.

The moot question that investors want an answer for: Is the worst over for the company?

Loss of market share in two-wheelers

Investors have been worried over the company’s position in the domestic market and its significant loss of market share to 16.1 percent in first quarter of FY18 from 18.6 percent that it commanded in the year ago period. The management attributes this fall to BS-IV implementation and GST rollout. However, the company has been witnessing decline in volumes and loss of market share for long. With all the dust settling down in the automobile industry, the company should witness a revival in domestic market but it continues to face strong challenges from competition.

End of “Raj Permit” to boost 3-wheeler sales

The management is optimistic about the three-wheeler segment. It believes that the end of “Raj Permit” in Maharashtra, new 10,000 permits in Delhi, mandatory conversion from two stroke engines to four stroke and ban of diesel engine in Bangalore would boost its three-wheeler (3W) volume (where it is a leader). Should all this fall come to pass, the company would be able to clock 3-wheeler volumes around 20,000-21,000 units, going forward.

EBITDA guidance – not easy to achieve

The management guides to raw material cost as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 68.7-69 percent and EBITDA margin to be in the range of 19.5-20 percent for FY18. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that the management will have to achieve 20.3-20.9 percent margin over the next three quarter to achieve its target, which doesn’t look easy, given the company’s current position.

Marketing and promotions efforts – yet to get converted in numbers

Bajaj Auto is now focusing on mass communication to increase awareness of its various premium products. The management feels that its products are getting traction from a small section of bike enthusiasts and hence there is a need for awareness. The increase in volume in this category will ease the pressure on margins as these are high margin products. The result of this initiative is yet to translate to numbers.

Focus on Electric Vehicle (EV)

The company has started making efforts towards EVs and has made investments in R&D and manpower. It has yet not significantly incurred any capex as it is currently focusing on developing the technology. Management believes that they are ahead of the curve in three-wheeler electric vehicle segment. Though this would not add to earnings in a year or two, the segment is important for the company to focus on, given the government’s push towards EVs.

In sum, though the company’s effort in export market has started showing some positive signs one needs to wait for the sustainable performance over next one to two quarters. Additionally, the fall in domestic volume and strong competition will weigh on performance. We still remain cautious on Bajaj Auto, a view we had echoed in our earlier note as well.

From a valuations perspective, the company is currently trading at a multiple of 21 times trailing earnings and 20.7 times FY18 and 18.5 times FY19 projected earnings. At this valuation, caution is warranted unless the ground reality changes for the better or if the company surprises the market with a smart acquisition in the premium segment.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Bajaj Auto

Net sales declined 5.3% YoY (grew 11.1% QoQ) to INR54.4b (our estimate: INR52.3b), as volumes declined 10.7% YoY (grew 12.8% QoQ). In the domestic market, lower channel inventory and purchase postponement by customers due to GST impacted wholesale numbers. However, an unexpected ~6% YoY increase (1.5% QoQ decline) in realization to INR61,258/unit (our estimate: +2%) aided revenue. Export revenue grew 20.5% YoY to INR24.8b.

Outlook

We have lowered our EPS estimates by 3-4% for FY18/19 on lower margin assumptions. Valuations at 20.5x/17.2x FY18E/19E standalone EPS are attractive, considering worst of volumes and margins are behind us. We value BJAUT at 18x FY19E EPS and add INR214/share for its KTM stake to arrive at a TP of INR3,281. Maintain Buy.For all recommendations report, click here

Two-wheeler major Bajaj Auto plans to begin shipments of its bikes and three-wheelers to Thailand in next couple of months as part of its plans to consolidate its position in the Southeast Asian market.

The two-wheeler major currently exports to various markets in the region including the Philippines, Singapore and Myanmar.

The Pune-headquartered firm has also started exporting KTM bikes to the Malaysian market recently.

""South East Asia is a big market for two-wheelers. We are getting good response from Malaysia and now in couple of months will also start exporting to Thailand,"" Bajaj Auto President (Business Development and Assurance) S Ravikumar told PTI.

The company will be exporting both bikes and three- wheelers to the Thailand market, he added.

The company, which exports to various regions including Africa and Latin America, is witnessing robust growth in new markets like Malaysia where it recently started exporting units.

""Efforts on entering new markets have paid dividends and dependence of the company on traditional high volume countries like Sri Lanka, Nigeria, etc has reduced,"" Ravikumar said.

For the quarter ended June 30, the company sold 4,09,525 units in the export markets.

""It is after five quarters that we have crossed 4 lakh unit sales mark in export markets. New markets like Malaysia are maturing now and have given decent results,"" Ravikumar said.

Elaborating on various markets, he said that sales have picked up in Nigeria, a big market in African continent.

""Besides, Sri Lanka continues to be down, while in markets like Colombia and Philippines we are holding on,"" Ravikumar said.

The company remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about export markets going ahead, he added.

Commenting on the domestic sales, he said the market would continue to see ""turbulence"" in August with GST implementation going on and the market would only stabilise in September.

When asked about new launches, Ravikumar said the company's new product pipeline remained robust with plans to introduce many models in remaining quarters of the fiscal.

He, however, declined to share specific details about the new product launches.",348,0.253446564078331

Even before its official unveiling in early 2012, the four-wheeled, four-seater Qute developed by Bajaj Auto was embroiled in a web of controversy which continues to restrict its commercial launch in India.

A string of public interest litigation (PILs) filed in different courts of the country by autorickshaw union leaders, drivers and even lawyers prevented the launch, despite the government clearing the way for it.

While addressing shareholders, Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director of Bajaj Auto, said that the only reason why the Qute (formerly called RE60) could not be commercially launched in India was because of negative tactics used by the competition.

“It is well known that the only country where the Qute is not permitted is our country (and it is) only because of competition. They have used all kinds of nefarious techniques to create problems through political circles and through courts. I will say this very candidly that they have stooped to levels that we thought they never will. (But) If it means we have to live without one country (then) we will live without one country”, added Bajaj.

PILs were filed in the High Courts of Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Gujarat. In 2015, the Supreme Court bundled all the cases together and decided that the case will be heard at the apex court.

The Qute is a quadricyle created to replace the existing passenger three-wheelers. Loosely classified as a step-down version of the regular city cab, a quadricyle is a new segment creator under the four-wheeler segment. This class of vehicles already exists in the western markets.

The Qute can seat three passengers, can run 35-km per litre and can reach a top speed of 70kmph. Bajaj Auto has so far invested Rs 550 crore in developing the product.

Bajaj also clarified on Thursday that a capacity of 25,000 per year has been created for the Qute in Aurangabad and about a third of that goes for export. The rest is lying idle. “The Qute has been welcomed across continents Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa,” said Bajaj.

While uncertainty remains about the Qute’s commercial launch in India, Bajaj said that he is confident of launching the vehicle this year.

“Based on my interaction with the people in power (sic) I have reason to believe that within the next few months we may get permission to introduce this vehicle in this market,” added Bajaj.",414,-0.5122932195663452

Amit Gupta of ICICIdirect told CNBC-TV18, ""The underperforming stocks have started seeing the short closer in them. In the last few series, we were seeing that the short positions were getting rolled. Now particularly in NTPC and stocks like Bajaj Auto, we were seeing that these short positions were getting rolled. Now what we are observing is that the short closer has already started, could be because of this P-notes news which has recently come in and they have to unwind the positions possibly by the July expiry.""

""In NTPC, the Rs 155-160 range for the last five or six months, even though Nifty had seen some intermediate declines, remained in that range. I understand the fact that it did not move up but the delivery pickup recently around Rs 155-158 has been really encouraging and the Call writers so far which were very active, they have already started closing their positions. Now this activity was there at 160 Call. It has already closed above that level,"" he said.

""So, my sense is some momentum the stock can pick up and because the implied volatility (IV) is very low, that is where the premiums in NTPC Call options are still very low. So, it is an opportunity to buy the Call options of this stock for this particular series and that is why we are buying 165 Call options which is somewhere around Rs 1.8-2. So, you buy this, look for a target of Rs 6 in this particular expiry. So that is where we are buying the underperforming stocks by buying the Call options,"" he added.

""In the power space Power Grid is one stock which has remained near the life highs. However, now we have already seen that in 4-5 months Power Gird has remained near Rs 200-210 levels. The peculiar nature of the stock gives good volume setup and then it consolidates above that level. So, that happened at Rs 200 and that is now happening at Rs 210. My gut feeling is, the stock is likely to move towards Rs 224-226 kind of levels very soon.""

""Looking at the futures positions where at these levels people try to go short, now they are unwinding their positions. Already we have seen 25 percent of short closer in this when it moved from Rs 208 to Rs 211-212 levels. So, I think the particular closer of positions in future segment can give some momentum to this stock also and it can move higher.""",426,0.8232056498527527

India's GDP growth of 7.1 per cent achieved last fiscal is not as encouraging as it might seem despite the expansion rate being better than all developed countries, according to Bajaj Auto Chairman Rahul Bajaj.

Impact of lack of significant investments in the last 4-5 years; inability of private sector to put in fresh capital with availing of loans becoming an issue due to rising NPAs of banks, along with demonetisation were mainly responsible for dampening growth, he said.

""I thought of starting with encouraging news about India's economic growth in 2016-17. But as I started looking at the latest evidence, it didn't seem as encouraging as I believed it might be,"" Bajaj said in his address to shareholders in the company's Annual Report for 2016-17.

He said in its latest advance estimate, the Central Statistical Organisation has pegged India's real GDP growth for last financial year at 7.1 per cent.

""No doubt it is better than all developed countries and most emerging markets including China. However, it is not as good as the 7.9 per cent GDP growth achieved in FY2016,"" Bajaj said.

While the country has grown, the veteran industrialist said, ""we possibly have a longer way to go to attain a steady state annual growth rate between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent, which is what we need to create a launch-pad for greater employment, a more significant global economic presence and accelerated poverty reduction.""

Elaborating on three factors that have played a role in dampening growth, Bajaj said there has been a lack of significant investments over the last four to five years.

""Of late, there has been a serious effort at government investments in some key infrastructure areas. But that takes time to translate into additional income and employment. And truth be told, there is hardly any private sector investment worth the name,"" he said.

Underlining the impact of rising bad loans and its impact on private sector investments, he said the non-performing assets (NPAs) of 27 public sector banks were estimated at Rs 6,47,759 crore, or 88 per cent of the total recorded NPAs across all banks. This represents a 140 per cent increase over what it was two years earlier, and constitutes 12 per cent of total loans and advances, he added.

""With these banks being badly stressed, there seems to be no appetite for advancing term loans without which it is virtually impossible to envisage the kind of investment spends needed for getting us securely on to a higher growth path,"" Bajaj said.

The third factor, according to Bajaj was the ""shorter term aberration"" and ""temporary negative effects"" of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes announced on November 8 last year.

""Although the estimates for October-December 2016 show no appreciable dip in either real GDP or GVA, there seems to be enough evidence on the ground that removing over four-fifth of the value of currency in circulation almost overnight and substituting it with a much slower injection of the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes created constraints across various sectors of the economy,"" he claimed.

While it remains to be seen what the overall effect of this will be on growth for the first half of FY2018, Bajaj said: ""If at all, I hope it will be moderate."" Commenting on the company's performance, he said Bajaj Auto ""could have possibly done better, but given the circumstances, it has done reasonably well to be where it is.""

The company's net sales declined by 3.5 per cent to Rs 21,374 crore and profit after tax (PAT) also dipped by 2.6 per cent to Rs 3,828 crore in 2106-17, he said. He said the company was also affected even worse by ""external factors"" of poor economic conditions and severe foreign currency constraints in some of key importing countries in 2016-17 than 2015-16.

""Motorcycle exports de-grew by 16.5 per cent; and three- wheeler exports fell by 31.2 per cent,"" he said, adding that in terms of rupees Baja Auto's exports fell by over 19 per cent to Rs 7,880 crore while in US dollar terms they shrank by 23 per cent to USD 1.09 billion.",703,0.02996067702770233

Deutsche Bank expects a soft month for the 2-wheeler segment due to GST related de-stocking with the bulk of the weakness driven by a 36 percent Y-o-Y decline for Bajaj Auto. It sees a robust scooters volumes growth for June-2017 but with motorcycle weakness driven by Bajaj Auto.

Domestic two-wheeler volumes for June 2017 grew by an estimated 4 percent Y-o-Y driven by scooters (+13 percent Y-o-Y) while motorcycles continued to lag (+2 percent Y-o-Y). Year to day (YTD) volume growth for 2W industry at 8 percent Y-o-Y is currently running behind FY’18 growth forecast of 12.6 percent Y-o-Y, the research firm said.

It is also of the view that among the mass-market players, both Hero MotoCorp (+13 percent YoY) and TVS Motor Company (+11 percent Y-o-Y) outperformed industry volumes while Honda grew only 2 percent Y-o-Y. Eicher Motors continues to clock healthy growth (+26 percent Y-o-Y) in the high-end bike segment while on the other hand Hero and TVS had increased incentives to some extent to drive higher sales in June while Honda had resorted to higher local advertising and Bajaj Auto had passed on the GST-related benefits in June itself but that doesn't seem to have aided sales.

GST Explained In 30 Seconds

The research firm has maintained buy on Eicher Motors, a hold on Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto while it has a sell on TVS Motor Company.

According to Deutsche Bank, Hero Moto’s overall volumes for June 2017 was at 624,185 units (+13.6 percent Y-o-Y) with FY’18 volume growth forecast of 10.6 percent which implies a monthly run-rate (MRR) of 613,341 units over the next nine months versus YTD MRR of 616,458 units. Hero's YTD market share is at 37 percent (FY’17 at 37 percent).

Bajaj Auto’s overall (domestic + exports) 2-wheeler volumes for June 2017 was at 204,667 units (-25 percent Y-o-Y) and 3-wheeler were at 40,211 units (-8 percent Y-o-Y) with FY’18 2W/3W volume growth forecast of 12 percent/10 percent that implies a MRR of 313,226/41,207 units over the next nine months versus YTD MRR of 258,571/37,573 units. Bajaj's YTD 2W market share is at 8.7 percent (FY17 at 11.4 percent), it added.

Honda’s domestic volumes for June 2017 is at 416,498 units (+2 percent Y-o-Y). Scooters were at 271,017 units (+2 percent Y-o-Y) and motorcycles at 145,481 units (+2 percent YoY). Honda's market-share has been on an up-trend and its YTD 2W market share is 30 percent (versus 27 percent in FY’17).

TVS Motors’ overall (domestic + exports) 2W volumes for June 2017 was at 268,638 units (+12 percent Y-o-Y). Scooters were at 90,448 units (+34 percent Y-o-Y), motorcycles at 112,146 units (+18 percent Y-o-Y) while Mopeds were weaker at 66,044 units.",459,0.46547307074069977

U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson is lining up a takeover bid for Italian rival Ducati, potentially bringing together two of the most famous names in motorcycling in a deal that could be worth up to 1.5 billion euros ($1.67 billion), sources told Reuters.

Indian motorcycle maker Bajaj Auto and several buyout funds are also preparing bids for Ducati, which is being put up for sale by German carmaker Volkswagen.

A deal with Harley-Davidson would bring together the maker of touring bikes like the Electra Glide that are symbolic of America with a leading European maker whose high-performance bikes have a distinguished racing heritage.

Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson has hired Goldman Sachs to work on the deal, one source familiar with the matter said, adding tentative bids are expected in July.

Volkswagen, whose Audi division controls Ducati â€“ maker of the iconic Monster motorbike â€“ is working with investment boutique Evercore on the sale which will help it fund a strategic overhaul following its emissions scandal.

Based in the northern Italian city of Bologna, Ducati is on the wish list of private equity funds KKR, Bain Capital and Permira, which are all working on the deal, said the sources who declined to be identified as the process is private.

Ducati was launched in 1926 as a maker of vacuum tubes and radio components and its Bologna factory remained open in World War Two despite being the target of several bombings.

Ducati racers have won the Superbike world championship 14 times, with Carl Fogarty and Troy Bayliss its most successful riders.

Harley-Davidson, which commands about half the U.S. big-bike market, was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the start of the last century and was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the great depression.

Demand for Harley's motorcycles continues to be slow as its loyal baby boomer demographic ages and rivals such as the Indian brand bike maker Polaris Industries Inc and Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd offer discounts.

Bidding field

Evercore has sent out information packages to a number of potential suitors including Ducati's previous owner Investindustrial, sources with knowledge of the matter said.

Investindustrial bought a stake in Ducati before the financial crisis, subsequently taking control of the business before selling it to Audi in 2012.

It is now looking to compete with heavyweight private equity firms and large industry players to regain control.

Volkswagen, Audi, Harley-Davidson, KKR and Bain Capital declined to comment while Bajaj, Investindustrial and Permira were not immediately available.

VW, Europe's largest carmaker, is seeking to move beyond an emissions-cheating scandal that has tarnished its image and left it facing billions of euros in fines and settlements.

A successful deal for Ducati, which last year made revenues of 593 million euros, would show that VW boss Matthias Mueller is serious about reversing his predecessor's quest for size.

VW said last June it would review its portfolio of assets and brands, rekindling speculation among analysts that ""non-core"" businesses could be put up for sale.

VW hopes to raise between 1.4 and 1.5 billion euros from the sale of Ducati, valuing it at 14-15 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of about 100 million euros, the sources said.

The German car maker wants a valuation that reflects trading multiples of similar trophy assets in the automotive industry such as Italian car maker Ferrari which trades at almost 30 times its forward earnings.

Yet it may need to compromise on price as some of the bidders would struggle to pay as much as 1.5 billion euros for Ducati, several sources said.

Price expectations have already proved challenging for some industry players who recently decided against bidding.

Indian motorcycle firm Hero MotoCorp and its rival TVS Motor Company initially expressed interest in Ducati but were put off by its price tag and decided to walk away, the sources said.

German car marker BMW and Japanese motorcycle makers Honda and Suzuki have also decided against bidding for Ducati, sources close to the companies told Reuters.

A BMW spokesman confirmed the German firm is not interested in Ducati while Hero and TVS were not immediately available for comment.

Another source close to VW said the sale of Ducati may not be finalised before the annual EICMA motorcycle show in Milan in mid-November as VW wants to find the right buyer and the sales process may take time.

India’s third largest bike manufacturer Bajaj Auto has slashed prices of its motorcycles by upto Rs 4,500 with immediate effect.

It is the only motorcycle company in India, to pass on the GST price advantage to its customers well before the implementation date. The savings will be range upto Rs 4500 depending on the model and the state in which the motorcycle is purchased,"" the company said in a statement.

Eric Vas, President, Motorcycle Business, Bajaj Auto said: “With the GST implementation just around the corner, we felt that it would be appropriate to pass on this significant savings to customers. Bajaj Auto is proud to be the first and only motorcycle company in India, to offer post GST reduced prices to customers even before the implementation date.

HDFC Securities' research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s 4Q EBITDA at Rs 9.06bn (-21% YoY) and margin at 18.5% came in below estimates, owing to 187bps YoY fall in gross margin and higher ‘other expenses’. Net revenue came in at Rs 49bn (-8.6% YoY), owing to a fall in volumes (-9.7%YoY). However, this was marginally offset by ASP growth (4.5% QoQ and 1.2% YoY), driven by a better model mix (increase in mix of Pulsar and fall in Platina and CT100).

Outlook

We are positive on Bajaj Auto, based on 1) Strong product portfolio and increasing portion of premium segment models (KTM, Pulsar, Avenger, Dominar etc) in overall volumes 2) Revival in export volumes (management is confident of achieving double-digit growth in FY18, 3) 3W sales will be boosted by a pick-up in rural demand, and new permits (40000+ expected from Maharashtra and Delhi in the coming months) and 4) A strong margin profile. We maintain BUY with a SOTP-based TP to Rs 3,400 (15x 19E EPS + cash + 30% discount for KTM stake).

Edelweiss' research report on Bajaj Auto

Bajaj Auto’s (BJAUT) Q4FY17 EBITDA at INR9.06bn (down 21% YoY) came 7% below estimate. The variance was due to gross margin miss on early transitioning to BS-IV vehicles versus peers. Though management believes the demonetisation impact has normalised, its outlook is relatively cautious — 5-7% YoY industry growth in motor cycles (our estimate 9-10%).

Outlook

Key potential stock triggers are uptick in export market and recovery in 3-wheeler sales. We maintain ‘HOLD/SU’ with TP of INR 2,904 (16.5x FY19E core EPS, cash per share of INR 644 and INR 80 for KTM). At CMP, the stock trades at 16.5x FY19E EPS.

Bajaj Auto, the country’s third largest two-wheeler manufacturer, posted 13.45 percent drop in net profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 driven down by demonetization, poor exports and the Supreme Court ruling on BS 3 vehicles.

The Pune-based company clocked consolidated net profit of Rs 862 crore for the quarter as against Rs 996 crore posted in the year-ago period.

Stand-alone volumes dipped by nearly 10 percent to 787,627 units during the quarter as against 872,458 units. Despite the fall in volumes the company was able to maintain its EBITDA margin at 21.2 percent during the reporting quarter.

Major auto players will come out with their April sales numbers, which are likely to be mixed as passenger vehicle (PV) makers may report better sales, while commercial vehicles (CV) manufacturers could report decline in their April sales, according to a report by an analyst firm.

In the two-wheelers segment, TVS Motor may report 5.9 percent year on year increase in volumes, while Hero MotoCorp's sales are expected to decline 5.3 percent YoY, a report from Motilal Oswal indicates.

According to the report, PVs will continue its growth momentum and outperform the auto industry growth in April 2017. Meanwhile, 2-wheelers and commercial vehicles’ volume are expected to decline in April-17 YoY and MoM.

""Our channel check suggests, retail off-take in two-wheelers segment is expected to remain weak followed by pre-buy of BS-3 vehicles in the previous month,"" it added.

Key highlights from the report

Maruti Suzuki is expected to outperform the PV industry, while Ashok Leyland and TVS Motor could outperform CV and two-wheelers industry respectively.

PVs are likely to continue its growth trajectory and outperform auto industry growth led by Maruti Suzuki, which it expects to report 8 percent growth in its overall volumes in April. The growth in Maruti volumes will be led by strong demand of Baleno and Brezza. “Our channel check indicates these models still enjoys healthy waiting period of 5-7weeks,” it said in the report.

Tata Motors’ PV segment is expected to maintain strong growth momentum driven by Tiago and complimented by newly launched Tigor.

In the two-wheeler segment, it expects TVS to record a 5.9 percent YoY increase in volumes led by strong growth in its scooters and mopeds portfolio.

Hero MotoCorp's volumes are expected to decline 5.3 percent YoY, it expects Bajaj Auto’s volumes to decline sharply by 17.8 percent led by decline in domestic 2W and 3W volumes.

Retail off-take in two-wheeler volumes are expected to remain weak, followed by pre-buy of BS-3 vehicles in the previous month.

“We expect Royal Enfield volumes to grow at 25 percent YoY growth in April-17 at 60,000 units. Situation in two-wheelers are expected to improve on a MoM basis as demonetization impact wanes off, however as indicted by management of 2W OEM, situation is improving gradually,” the report added.

CV players are expected to record decline in sales due to pre buying effect on account of change in emission norms. “We expect Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland to report double digit decline in their CV volumes by 21 percent and 23 percent respectively,” it said.

We prefer four-wheelers over two-wheelers and CVs due to stronger volume growth and stable competitive environment. While we expect two-wheeler volumes to benefit from rural recovery in near term, competitive intensity remains high in segment witnessing changing customer preferences.

For CVs, we expect volumes to remain muted atleast for next 2-3 quarters due to pre-buying, GST implementation and cost inflation with relatively weak freight availability.

“Our top-picks are Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Amara Raja. We also like Mahindra and Mahindra as best bet on rural market recovery,” the brokerage house said in a report.",526,0.31605769793192545

Bajaj Auto, the country’s biggest two and three-wheeler exporter, is in advanced talks with a Malaysian company for setting up a dedicated assembly line in that country.

Bajaj Auto is holding discussions with Motosikal Dan Enjin Nasional (Modena) for producing its range of bikes, including the latest Dominar brand, in an attempt to reduce dependence on the troubled African markets.

Speaking to Moneycontrol Rajiv Bajaj, Managing Director, Bajaj Auto (BAL) said, ""It's true that we are discussing a partnership with them (Modena)…..it's very likely to happen"".

Nearly a fifth of the equity of Modena is controlled by Japanese giant Kawasaki, the erstwhile long-time partners of Bajaj Auto, which launched several bikes in India with the Pune-based company.

The Malaysian company presently does not have any motorcycles in its line-up. It produces and sells step-throughs (a clutch-free geared two-wheeler) mostly in Malaysia through its plant in Gurun, Kedah which as an annual capacity of 130,000 units.

In addition to the 400cc Dominar, Bajaj’s biggest bike presently on sale, the company would launch the Pulsar brand along with the Platina in the Malaysian market. Bajaj’s decade-old Austrian partner KTM is already present in that market.

The focus on Malaysia is part of Bajaj's efforts to capture a bigger pie of the Asean market, which is presently dominated by the expensive range from the Japanese companies.

In January this year the company reentered the Indonesian market but this time riding pillion with KTM. After a robust response for the India-made, European bikes, Bajaj believes that KTM can generate sales of 5,000-10,000 units a year in Indonesia.

Bajaj, India’s most profitable two-wheeler maker, had earlier entered Indonesia in 2005 but could not generate profits despite several attempts. In an earlier interview to Moneycontrol Bajaj said that going forward Malaysia and Thailand would become key markets for the company.

""We have also restarted promisingly in Indonesia, doing better than ever in Philippines, kicked off Myanmar and close to closing up in Thailand"", added Bajaj.

Nearly 40 percent of Bajaj’s total sales came from exports last financial year forming a crucial part of revenue and profit margin. The company clocked export sales of 1.21 million units last year from a total sales of 3.21 million units.

However, there was a drop of 16 percent in exports as against the total exports of 1.45 million units clocked last financial year which was mainly on account of a drop in volumes in Nigeria, Iran, Egypt, Sri Lanka and Columbia. As much as 45 percent of total exports by Bajaj Auto is to Africa alone.

Here is a more detailed plan of the company for the Asean countries

Philippines

BAL has an over 10 year collaboration with Kawasaki Motors Philippines (a subsidiary of Kawasaki Heavy Industries Japan) through which KMPC assembles, distributes and services Bajaj motorcycles across Philippines. The partnership has been highly successful and enjoys a clear No 2 position in the motorcycle segment. Beyond market share, the partnership has led the very development of personal motorcycling in Philippines. New products are being developed by Bajaj based on inputs by KMPC to expand its share and strengthen its competitive position there. The BAL –KMPC partnership is together targeting leadership position in Philippines.

Indonesia

In keeping with the opportunity BAL & KTM have decided to target the premium end of the motorcycle opportunity in Indonesia through the development of the KTM business there. In view of BAL’s previous experience in Indonesia, it has been agreed that BAL will develop the KTM business in Indonesia. Start of sales commenced in January 2017. Progressively BAL will build a dedicated network of exclusive KTM dealers and bring the high quality KTM experience to Indonesian customers. In due course a CKD based operation is proposed to be established.

Malaysia

BAL has appointed MODENAS of Malaysia as its Distributor for Bajaj range of motorcycles in Malaysia. MODENAS will import CKD kits, assemble, distribute and service premier Bajaj brands like Dominar, Pulsar and V. All approvals and operations are already in position and sales are expected to commence in May 2017. This partnership will not only build the Bajaj brand in Malaysia but is also exploring opportunities for localization to enable access to other ASEAN markets.

Thailand

BAL is in advanced stage of discussion with a local Thai organization for representing BAL in Thailand. With this partnership BAL will introduce its high end brands of Dominar and Pulsar in Thailand. It is expected to conclude the arrangements by May 2017 and commence sales in Thailand by October 2017.",763,0.500000923871994
