Investor sentiment seems to have turned favourable towards Ultratech Cement, with a couple of brokerages upgrading their ratings to ‘buy’ in the last one month, partly recovering a number of ratings cuts in the last one year.

The positive reversal in the outlook follows the cement company's robust Q2FY24 earnings performance, showcasing substantial increases in revenue, profit, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).

Brokerages attribute the positive sentiment on Ultratech Cement stock to a convergence of factors such as the company’s capacity expansion plans, coupled with its emphasis on green energy, successful price hikes, and positive long-term demand outlook.

This change in sentiment has been visible in Ultratech Cement share price as well, which has gained over 7 percent in the last one month to Rs 8,682.

Capacity expansion, focus on green energy to boost margins

Ultratech Cement's capacity expansion plans have played a significant role in driving optimism. Yes Securities said that the company's ongoing expansion strategies envision an increase in total cement capacity to reach 165 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) by FY25. The projected capacity growth rate of 8 percent CAGR is also expected to surpass the industry average of 5 percent.

Moreover, the company’s emphasis on green energy, with an aim to elevate its share to 60 percent by FY26, has attracted investor attention. Yes Securities said that Ultratech’s plans to improve its green energy share, incorporating renewable and Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS) capacities of 1.25 GW, will add to the margins in the long run.

B&K Securities said that after phase 2 capex, the company’s capacity share in the industry will increase to 24 percent. It added that newer additions will be more profitable in the medium term as they have “incremental efficiency parameters, state incentives as well as plans to structurally cut down lead distance”.

Successful implementation of cement price hike

Price hikes have proven to be a substantial contributor to Ultratech's favourable position in the market. ""The company remains optimistic about the strong demand environment during H2FY2024, while increased cement prices (up 5 percent, compared to the Q2FY2024 average) are expected to sustain, going ahead.""

ICICI Securities said that the price hikes across various regions in the cement industry are set to continue, based on their channel checks, further boosting operational profitability growth.

Ultratech Cement’s dominance in the industry is also likely to come to the company’s aid. Yes Securities said that Ultratech's position, as an industry leader, has enabled the company to be a price leader in the market. This dominance allows Ultratech Cement to command premium prices among its peers, ensuring strong net selling realisation (NSR) and thereby profitability.

Stock valuation favourable

Further, favourable valuations and future growth potential are key aspects drawing analysts’ favour. Sharekhan maintained a 'Buy' rating on Ultratech stock with a target price of Rs 9,500. ""At the CMP (Rs 8,515), the stock is trading at an EV/EBITDA of 15.6x/12.7x its FY2025E/FY2026E earnings, which we believe provides further room for upside,” it said.

Yes Securities also reiterated an 'Add' rating with a target price of Rs 9,572, valuing the stock at 16x EV/EBITDA on FY26E, highlighting its long-term growth potential.

However, some analysts, like Geojit, remain cautious. ""The current valuation of the stock is above the five-year average. Therefore, we cautiously reiterate our HOLD rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 8,900, based on 15x FY25E EV/EBITDA,"" said Geojit in a note.

This collective positive sentiment among analysts on Ultratech Cement is supported by a combination of strong financial performance, capacity expansion plans, price hikes, and the company’s leadership status.

ICICI Securities research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement (UTCEM) has announced phase-3 of its capex programme, which will fortify its leadership position. It has committed to add 21.9mtpa (from FY26 in phases), which will take its India capacity to a mammoth 181.6mtpa (187mtpa including overseas units) from 132.5mtpa currently. Much to the delight of investors (and similar to phase2), the latest capex (INR 130bn) comes at an optimal cost of just ~USD 72/t (versus replacement cost of ~USD 100/t). Though a few months ahead, the announcement is on expected lines (as guided by UTCEM).

Outlook

Hence, we keep our HOLD recommendation and TP of INR 8,742 intact. However, the announcement further amplifies our concern of aggressive industry-wide capacity additions (>100mtpa over FY25–FY26) and hence, a potential worry over the medium term.

Shares of UltraTech Cement edged higher on October 30, two days after the company announced a fresh investment of Rs 13,000 crore to add production capacity in the third phase of the growth. With this investment, the cement maker aims to increase its total to 182 million tonnes per annum (mpta) after completion.

The board of the Aditya Birla Group flagship firm ""approved the 3rd phase of growth with an investment of Rs 13,000 crore towards increasing the capacity by another 21.9 mpta with a mix of brownfield and greenfield projects,"" Ultratech Cement said in a statement. The company has an existing capacity of 132.45 mpta of domestic grey cement.

This increase in capacity will be achieved by setting up four greenfield and four brownfield plants along with four greenfield bulk terminals. Greenfield development is any kind of construction or development in previously undeveloped areas. In contrast, brownfield project involves development on sites previously used for industrial or commercial purposes.

""Commercial production from these new capacities is expected to go on stream in a phased manner from FY26 onwards and will catapult the company's cement capacity to 187 mpta globally,"" the company said.

At 9:33 am, Ultratech Cement shares were trading marginally higher amid market weakness at Rs 8,239.00 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Expansion plan

The announcement comes nearly three months after chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said UltraTech Cement will work towards achieving a production capacity of 200 mtpa. The company informed analysts earlier in October that it has nearly stitched up its next expansion plan and will present it to the board for approval, with the intention of revealing it by December.

With this latest phase of expansion, the Aditya Birla Group company will establish a 60 million tonne (mt) lead over Adani Cement’s envisaged capacities. Despite the significant ongoing expansion programme, analysts at Centrum Broking expect the company to be debt-free in FY24.

Brokerage firm InCred has an 'Add' rating on Ultratech Cement stock with a target price of Rs 9,500. Analysts believe that the capex announcement is in line with the company's long-term target of reaching 200 mtpa capacity before 2030.

Q2 update

Earlier this month, UltraTech Cement reported a 69.5 percent on-year rise in second quarter net profit at Rs 1,282 crore, for the financial year 2023-24 (FY24). Its revenue also grew 15.3 percent to Rs 16,012 crore. The company also posted a robust volume growth of 16 percent. Analysts expect the cement maker's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)/tonne to improve further in the coming quarters.

Should you buy?

Axis Securities has Ultratech Cement stock as its top pick of the week. According to the brokerage report, company's organic capacity expansion plan is progressing well. Its total grinding capacity will increase to 165 mtpa in phases over FY25E-FY26E, thereby aiding in its volume growth.

Ultratech's top-line and margins are expected to enhance on account of its superior positioning in most of the markets as it is the largest producer of cement in India. Axis Securities has a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 9,030 apiece.

Elara Securities reiterated its 'Accumulate' call on the stock after healthy Q2 earnings with an unchanged target price of Rs 9,098. However, considering a higher-than-expected operating cost in Q2 FY24, the domestic brokerage cut EBITDA estimate by 3-4 percent FY24, FY25 and FY26.

Meanwhile, Centrum Broking maintained an 'Add' rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 9,564 per share, up from Rs 9,340 earlier,"" it said.

In the previous session, Ultratech Cement shares closed half a percent higher at Rs 8,210.65 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). So far this year, the stock has rallied around 17 percent.

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

The company reported in-line standalone revenues for Q2FY2024, led by strong volume growth. Operational profitability marginally lagged due to higher than-estimated P&F costs and other expenses. We expect a strong demand environment for H2FY2024 while higher spot cement prices compared to Q2FY2024 average provide operational profitability growth tailwinds. Revised phase 2 expansion of 24.4 mtpa remains on track and is expected to go on stream in a phased manner by FY2025 and FY2026. The next phase of expansion will be announced before the calendar year’s end.

Outlook

We maintain a Buy on UltraTech with an unchanged PT of Rs. 9,500, considering its long-term growth potential and buoyant demand and pricing environment in the medium term.

Q2 Earnings Review: The bigger they are, the harder they stall?

One of the most crucial campaigns of Alexander the Great was the Battle of Hydaspes in 326 BC, when he went up against King Porus of Punjab. Porus’s mighty army relied heavily on its contingent of war elephants, which struck fear into the hearts of his enemies. However, on the day of the battle, the Macedonian phalanx managed to repulse the giant beasts, which turned around in panic and trampled many of their own soldiers to death.

The episode has played out multiple times in Indian history, and not just in warfare. Size might be a critical advantage in many situations, but it also risks being the biggest drag when the winds turn unfavourable.

Take the current Q2 earnings season, for example. Read more.

Brokerages bullish

CLSA has upgraded Ultratech to an ""outperform"" rating with a target price of Rs 9,450 a share. Capacity additions remain on track, with the possibility of a third phase announcement by December, the foreign broking firm said. It has forecast 11 percent three-year volume CAGR and an FY26 EBITDA/tonne of Rs 1,300.

The company's operating EBITDA/tonne in Q2 was at Rs 955, up 17.6 percent YoY. Operating margin came in at 15.95 percent against 13.43 percent in the year-ago period.

HSBC has stuck to its “buy” call with a target price of Rs 9,300.

""Recent price hikes and reduced fuel costs will contribute to margin expansion in the second half of the year. We also anticipate further margin growth due to fixed cost absorption,"" the brokerage said.

In a post-earnings call, Ultratech management said in September and October, the industry raised prices in most of the regions. Spot average price was 5-7 percent higher compared to June. Prices were holding on in most of the markets for now.

Capex on track

UltraTech said its expansion programme on schedule. The company has commissioned 5.5 mtpa capacity, so far, in FY24 against a total of 12.4 mtpa in FY23.

Its grey cement manufacturing capacity in India is now at 132.45 mtpa.

“Work on the second phase of growth of 22.6 mtpa is in full swing. As part of this project, we are adding another 1.8 mtpa of slag grinding capacity, taking phase 2 to 24.4 mtpa.

UltraTech Cement Ltd’s net profit rose 68.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) in the second quarter of 2023-24 to Rs 1,280 crore, driven by increased demand and an uptick in government spending on infrastructure ahead of elections.

The company experienced robust volume growth and its bottom line received a boost from reduced fuel and power costs, despite price increases during the quarter.

The subsidiary of Aditya Birla Group’s Grasim Industries reported revenue of Rs 16,179.26 crore in the quarter ended September 2023, up 15.3 percent YoY beating estimates. However, both revenue and net profit saw sequential declines reflecting the dip in construction work typically seen in the monsoon months.

The company's revenue was expected to increase up to 15 percent to Rs 15,769.40 crore, with a 60 percent surge in net profit to Rs 1,334 crore, according to estimates from 10 brokerages collated by Moneycontrol.

“UltraTech achieved capacity utilisation of 75 percent during the quarter on expanded capacity. Energy cost was lower by 10 percent YoY, while raw material cost rose 4 percent on account of increase in cost of flyash and slag,” the company said in a statement.

Going ahead, the company expects to benefit from robust demand.

“Demand revival is imminent, especially during the festive season and the January-March peak construction period. Demand will also be led by pre-election spending, continued government push on infrastructure development, and sustained real estate development. All of this augur well for the company,” the company said in a statement.

Stronger than Usual Q2

Despite the monsoon, most cement makers are expected to have clocked strong sales volumes as construction momentum remained strong.

In July-September, UltraTech Cement sales volume stood at 26.69 million tonnes, with a 15 percent YoY increase. Weaker monsoon and added capacity supported the growth.

Cement makers increased prices in the quarter, which helped improve the company’s Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) margin. EBIDTA margin improved to 16 percent in the September quarter from 14 percent a year ago.

Decline in Energy Cost

Declines in domestic and international petroleum coke prices aided growth in profits. While the price of imported coal and pet coke have risen in the quarter, they remain softer than their peaks in February until August.

Power and fuel costs together account for almost 30 percent of the total costs. Analysts expect the recent rise in prices to dent margins in the third quarter of the fiscal.

Capex On Track

UltraTech said its ongoing expansion program is progressing as per schedule. The company has commissioned 5.5 mtpa capacity so far in FY24 as against a total of 12.4 mtpa capacity added in FY23.

The company's total grey cement manufacturing capacity in India is now at 132.45 mtpa.

“Work on the second phase of growth of 22.6 mtpa is in full swing. As part of this project, we are adding another 1.8 mtpa of slag grinding capacity, taking phase 2 to 24.4 mtpa. Commercial production from all these new capacities is expected to go on stream in a phased manner by FY25/FY26,” the company said.

Ultratech also commissioned 30 megawatts (MW) of waste heat recovery systems (WHRS) based capacity, taking the total WHRS capacity to 262 MW. This, along with the company's renewable energy capacity of 429 MW together accounts for 22 percent of the total power requirement of the company.",588,0.6300595551729202

The UltraTech Cement shares edged up only by a tad on October 3 despite a 16 percent growth in consolidated sales volume and an ‘overweight’ rating from Morgan Stanley.

In a regulatory filing at the exchanges on October 2, the company reported consolidated sales volumes for the July-September quarter at 26.69 million tonnes, while total sales volume for the domestic market, which includes grey and white cement, were up 15 percent on a yearly basis at 25.66 million tonnes.

Morgan Stanley, seeing an upside potential for the stock from current price levels, has set the target price at Rs 9,300.

“The sales volume figures for Q2 implies an 18 percent year-on-year growth in domestic grey cement volumes in the first half of FY24. Considering the strong volume growth, it seems that the market share gains are uninterrupted for the company,” it said.

In its recent sectoral update for building materials, Jefferies has retained its ‘buy’ rating on the company’s stock.

The foreign brokerage observed that overall demand levels for cement in August were robust while the off-take in September was affected by rains. Overall, it expects a double-digit demand growth in the ongoing fiscal.

“Strong exit prices in the July-September quarter and more price hike announcements in the offing will negate energy cost inflation worry. Price hikes announced for October are in the range of Rs 10-50/bag (up to 15 percent) across regions. While cost increase is a concern, continuous price increase announcements have reduced risk of downgrades,” it added.

At 1pm on the NSE, the UltraTech Cement stock was quoting at Rs 8,293.90, up Rs 39.05, or 0.47 percent.

In a regulatory filing at the exchanges on October 3, the company also announced having signed a cooperation agreement through its wholly owned subsidiary Star Cement with Cemex, UAE.

""The partnership aims to recycle concrete waste in the construction industry as well as reduce carbon emissions and improve the overall environmental impact of construction projects,"" the company said.

In its results for the April-June quarter, the company reported a 17 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in revenue from operations at Rs 17,737.1 crore. Net profit for the quarter increased 6.8 percent YoY to Rs 1,690 crore. The operating profit margins for the quarter contracted by 300 basis points on a yearly basis to 17 percent.

N Srinivasan-led The India Cements Ltd (ICL) has inked a pact with UltraTech Cement Ltd for the sale of land measuring 73.75 acre for Rs 70 crore, as it continues efforts to shore up liquidity.

The land is located in Vizianagram district of Andhra Pradesh and the deal includes land measuring 14.53 acres to be procured.

The move is part of the exercise undertaken by ICL to monetise some of its non-core assets for improving liquidity and operating performance as well as meeting some of the minimum capital expenditure, the company said.

SMPL sale

India Cements had sold its limestone mining subsidiary Springway Mining (SMPL) to Parth Jindal–led JSW Cement for Rs 476.87 crore in October last year. SMPL owns limestone-bearing land in Madhya Pradesh, where it is setting up a cement plant. Limestone is an ingredient used in making cement. ICL had acquired SMPL in October 2018 for Rs 182.92 crore and its sale four years later was a reflection of the reality faced by the largest cement producer in south India.

The company has engaged FLSmith and ThyssenKrupp Industries to conduct a detailed study on the operating parameters of some of its plants for refurbishment/modernisation to bring them in line with state-of-the-art modern plants. The company has also engaged Boston Consulting Group to study the operations at 3 of its plants in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and suggest measures for improving efficiency in their operations.

The vintage nature of its plants has constrained the company in terms of production efficiency. The sale of non-core assets is seen as an attempt to beef up the cash position and fund the upgradation of plants.",288,-0.004001200199127197

UltraTech Cement chairman and industrialist Kumar Mangalam Birla believes that with the company now targeting an ambitious goal of achieving a production capacity of 200 million tons, it will reinforce its position as ""one of the largest cement companies in the world.""

In his speech at the 23rd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of UltraTech Cement on August 11, Birla added that work has already commenced on the next growth phase of 22.6 MTPA additional capacity. ""Completion of all the capacity expansion projects currently underway will take your company’s cement production capacity to 160+ MTPA,"" he said.

Further, KM Birla also added that UltraTech Cement is working to build a ""future-ready business"" encompassing economic growth and its environment, social, and governance (ESG) commitments.

Speaking on the sustainability agenda, Birla also reiterated that Ultratech Cement invests in low-carbon practices beyond compliance requirements and is committed to net zero by 2050.

Birla's speech in the AGM comes weeks after the cement manufacturer reported its first quarterly results for the financial year 2023-2024.

UltraTech Cement had reported a net profit of Rs 1,690 crore for the April-June quarter, up 6.8 percent YoY (year-on-year) from Rs 1,582 crore reported in Q1FY23. Sequentially as well, the net profit was up by 1.19 percent from Rs 1,670 crore reported in Q4FY23.

Revenue from operations for the quarter grew 17 percent YoY at Rs 17,737.1 crore as compared to Rs 15,163 crore in Q1FY23, the subsidiary of the Aditya Birla Group said in an exchange filing. However, the revenue declined by 4.95 percent QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) against Rs 18,662 crore reported in Q4FY23.

The cement major reported a total consolidated sales volume of 29.96 million tonnes, showing a 20 percent increase YoY from 25.04 million tonnes reported in Q1FY23.

On the dividend front, Birla said that the board of directors have recommended a dividend of Rs 38 per equity share for the year ended March 31, 2023, which entails a cash outgo of Rs 1,097 crore. The recommended dividend is in line with the company’s dividend policy.",360,0.7064807315667471

Two recently launched thematic new fund offerings(NFOs) — HDFC Transportation & Logistics and Quant Manufacturing — can give a boost to several stocks in the auto and auto-ancillary basket, Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research has said.

The HDFC Transport & Logistics NFO will close on August 11 and the Quant Manufacturing on August 8.

""After the closure, the funds will start deploying in the basket of stocks which meet the criteria. This anticipation of deployment (has) led to a lot of interest among the participants, which (will) start to reflect in stock prices,"" said Abhilash Pagaria, Head, Nuvama Alternative & Quantitative Research.

A classic example is HDFC Defence Fund launched in May 2023. The rally in defence stocks can partially be attributed to the NFO, he added. Two of the biggest holdings in the fund — Bharat Electronics and TD Power Systems — rallied 20 percent in May.

In transport & logistics funds, notable commonly held names across existing schemes include Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland, Bharat Forge and Endurance Tech. It is likely that the new NFO also picks some of these names.

Similarly in Manufacturing funds, the commonly held stocks are Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Samvardhana Motherson, Reliance Industries, BPCL, Ultratech Cement, Sun Pharmaceuticals, L&T and Bharat Electronics.

""It won't be surprising if both NFOs collectively raise Rs 2,000 crore or more in this buoyant market,"" Pagaria said.

According to HDFC Mutual Fund, the transportation & logistics scheme is a play on rising disposable income, the trend of premiumisation, the government's focus on manufacturing, on safety and decarbonisation and the emphasis on transport modernisation, etc.

The fund has been rated in the very high-risk category.

The quant manufacturing scheme looks to invest in companies with strong profit potential from production and exports, on the back of technology and automation, including those benefiting from the government’s ""Make in India"" and PLI incentives.

UltraTech Cement moved a writ petition in Delhi High Court on July 27 challenging the order of Competition Commission of India (CCI), which is said to allow Builders Association of India (BAI) to be made a party in the ongoing cement cartelisation case.

Justice Subramonium Prasad of Delhi High Court heard the case at length and reserved it for judgment. The judge informed the parties that an order in the case will be passed in the third week of August.

Appearing for cement major, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi argued that CCI permitted BAI to be made party to the proceedings without hearing their objections. He argued that the order does not give any reasons as to why BAI is a necessary party to the proceedings. According to Singhvi, BAI will get access to UltraTech's confidential documents without their consent if they are made a party to the proceedings.

CCI argued that BAI will not get any access to UltraTech's confidential documents as they are not in CCI's 'confidentiality ring' in the said proceedings. According to CCI, the court will have to look into two aspects before adjudicating on an issue like this, one whether BAI is a necessary party and second, whether there is public interest involved in the case.

Thus, CCI justified making BAI a party to the proceedings. Senior advocate Percival Billimoria appeared for BAI and argued that they were made a party since the case involves larger interest and they are an important stakeholder in the same.

The anti-trust watchdog had on a previous occasion rejected BAI's request to be made a party in the proceedings. BAI challenged this order at Delhi High Court, the HC in September 2022 directed it to file a fresh application at the CCI.

Another cement cartel case

CCI initiated investigation against cement companies in 2019 after it received information from multiple sources regarding abnormal increase of

cement prices in India. The parties alleged that the cement companies were colluding to artificially increase the price.

This is the second time CCI is investigating cartelisation among cement companies. In 2012, he CCI imposed a total penalty of $1.1 billion on several cement companies for colluding to under-use their plants and create an artificial shortage of cement. An appeal against that decision is still pending.",405,

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Ultratech Cement

UltraTech Cement’s consolidated EBITDA declined ~2% YoY/8% QoQ to Rs30.5bn in Q1FY24, coming in 8% below our estimates owing to higher than expected costs. Blended EBITDA/ton fell 18% YoY/3% QoQ to Rs1,018 (Emkay: Rs1,100). UltraTech is in the process of adding 4mt capacity in FY24 through debottlenecking and another 22.6mt capacity (under phase-II) by FY25/26 (vs current capacity of 131mt). Management expects cement prices to improve post the monsoons and input cost deflation to kick-in in coming quarters. We largely maintain our FY24-25 estimates.

Outlook

Given the company’s strong growth/capex plans, pan-India presence, focus on cost efficiencies and strong balance sheet, we raise our target EV/E to 16x (earlier 15x). We maintain BUY on the stock, with revised Jun-24E TP of Rs9,250/share, post the quarterly roll-over.

ICICI Securities research report on Kotak Mahindra Bank

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) reported healthy Q1FY24 PAT at INR 34.5bn (~5% beat, led by higher other income) with RoA at 2.8%. Deposit growth jumped sharply to 6% QoQ though entirely from term deposits (up 15% QoQ) while CASA declined. There was a substantial rise in slippages / credit costs, which was partly due to higher share of unsecured loans (now at 10.7% vs 7.9% YoY). For FY24E-FY25E, we maintain our loan growth estimates at ~18% CAGR and credit cost estimate at 50-60bps. However, we raise our FY24E/FY25E PAT by 2-3% on higher other income. We estimate ~2.2% / 1.9% RoAs for FY24E / FY25E respectively.

Outlook

Maintain HOLD with target price increased to INR 2,000 (vs INR 1,900) valuing the stock at ~2.9x FY25E core banking book (vs ~2.7x) and ~INR 500 per share (broadly unchanged) for subsidiaries. Upside risk is higher than expected growth and downside risk is sharp deterioration in asset quality.

ICICI Securities research report on UltraTech Cement

The 20% volume surge reported by UltraTech Cement in Q1FY24 failed to drive EBITDA growth (down 1.5% YoY). EBITDA/te dipped 3% QoQ (~7% below consensus and in line with our estimate) due to: a) realisation decline of 0.4% QoQ, b) variable cost/te being flat QoQ despite low fuel prices, and c) fixed cost/te rising 10% QoQ. The volume surge is driving ~5% upward revision to our FY24E EBITDA, but we see little merit in arguing for an upward revision to FY25E EBITDA given that volume growth can be at risk

Outlook

Given the underlying competitive intensity and historical precedence of fuel cost drop failing to drive up EBITDA/te, we see little scope for increasing our valuation multiple of 15x FY25E EV/EBITDA. Maintain REDUCE with a target price of INR 7,311 (earlier: INR 7,295).

Axis Securities report on UltraTech Cement

In Q1FY24 the company witnessed robust capacity utilization of 89% indicating robust Cement demand in the country and market share gain for the company. The company’ sorganic capacity expansion plan is progressing well. Its total grinding capacity will increase to 165 mtpa in FY25E-FY26E from the current 135.1 mtpa thereby aiding in its volume growth. We have increased the volume growth guidance from earlier 10% CAGR to 12% CAGR over FY23- 25E. Major Benefit of lower fuel prices would start reflecting in between Q2-Q4FY24 as there is always a lag between order booked and order available for consumption. Further higher blending ratio , increase in the sale of premium products and consumption of higher green energy will aid to higher EBITDA margins going forward. We expect the company to report an EBITDA/ tonne of Rs 1180 & Rs 1280 in FY24E/FY25E from Rs 1000/tonne in FY23 driven by higher volume, stable realization, and cost optimization initiatives. Cement prices were lower during the quarter but its heartening to note that prices have increased in the Northern and Western part of India by Rs3-Rs5/bag . The sustainability of higher prices remains a key monitor able. We believe that post Monsoon prices should trend little higher as observed traditionally.

Outlook

The stock is currently trading at 16.5x and 14x FY24E/FY25E EV/EBITDA. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a TP of Rs9520/share, implying an upside potential of 17% from the CMP.

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

UTCEM’s operating performance was below our estimates due to higherthan-estimated opex (freight and other expenses). EBITDA stood at INR30.5b (est. INR33b) and EBITDA/t came in at INR1,018 (est. INR1,101). Profit was at INR17b (in line), led by lower tax rates. Cement demand remains strong and industry volume growth should be in double digits in FY24. There have been some disruptions due to erratic monsoons recently. There was a marginal price increase in North and West markets in Jul’23, while prices in the South and East markets remained stable. Spot prices of pet coke will be reflected only after six months and a reduction in fuel prices should also benefit the industry going forward.

Outlook

We cut EPS estimates by 3% for FY24/FY25 (each) due to a miss in 1Q. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock, given its: a) leadership position in the industry, b) robust expansion plans without leveraging the balance sheet, and c) structural cost improvement measures.

In a drift from the consensus view, UBS has assumed coverage of India's cement sector with a negative outlook. They cited concerns over increasing competition and expensive valuations.

While strong earnings are expected in the next two quarters, thanks to robust demand and margin tailwinds, UBS analysts Nikunj Mandowara and Pramod Kumar have cautioned that any significant rise in stock prices may present an opportunity for profit-booking.

The anticipated slowdown in demand after the upcoming general elections in May 2024, coupled with a rapid increase in fresh capacity that could exceed medium-term demand, has raised concerns among industry observers. Approximately 110 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of new capacity is expected to come in the next 2.5 years, compared to incremental demand of 70 mtpa.

UBS predicts that cement players may resort to aggressive pricing strategies to protect their market share, particularly as Adani Group's entry into the sector intensifies competition.

""With valuations of 15x one-year forward EV/EBITDA and 30x FY25 PE for a sector tracking close to GDP growth rate, rising competition, low entry barriers and return profile of low double digits, we see little room for potential upside,"" the foreign broking firm said in a report.

In light of these concerns, UBS recommends selling the stocks on any rally rather than buying the dip. It has a 'buy' rating for ACC, 'neutral' for Ultratech, and 'sell' tags on Dalmia and Ambuja.

The firm has a target price of Rs 2,200 on ACC, Rs 440 on Ambuja, Rs 8,900 on Ultratech and Rs 2,190 on Dalmia Bharat. At 11am, ACC was quoting Rs 1,775.75 on the NSE, Ambuja at Rs 418, Ultratech at Rs 8,175.40 and Dalmia Bharat at Rs 2,060.

The potential for value-accretive mergers and acquisitions within the sector appears limited. This situation further exposes the sector to risks of overcapacity and expansion lagging behind guidance, factors that could contribute to a de-rating of an expensive sector trading in the 90th percentile of its five-year valuation range, UBS said.

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

The company announced a 20% y-o-y growth in domestic and consolidated sales volumes for Q1FY2024 indicating sustained strong demand environment and possibility of market share gains. RIL cuts domestic petcoke prices by 10% m-o-m for July 2023 while they are lower by 16% q-o-q in Q1FY2024. International petcoke and Australian coal prices too decline q-o-q. Pan-India average cement prices corrected by just 1.6% q-o-q partially retaining savings from P&F costs. Cement prices become key monitorable in the wake of sustained decline in power & fuel (P&F) costs post Q1FY2024.

Outlook

We maintain a Buy on UltraTech with a revised PT of Rs. 9,400, increasing our valuation multiple, amid strong demand and operational cost tailwinds.

Cement stocks ended higher in trade, rallying 2-5% in today’s trading session.

While the prevailing belief is that construction activities and infrastructure creation come to a standstill during the monsoon, Guarang Shah of Geojit Financial Service has a different perspective. In an exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol, he cited data from the last two years and pointed out that the industry has been on a consistent upward trajectory during the monsoon season, riding on growing demand.

Geojit’s confidence in defying conventional wisdom stems from the innovative products introduced by cement manufacturing companies. These new solutions, such as Portland Pozzolana Cement, Water Repellent cement have mitigated the impact of the monsoon season on construction, allowing projects to proceed at a steady pace.

The financial services company is optimistic that the sector will overcome the challenges it faced in the past. One of the factors that had previously pressured the sector is the increase in input costs, leading to a decline in operating margins. However, Shah noted that input costs have started to decrease, and operational efficiencies have resulted in healthier profit margins.

Overall, Shah remains highly positive about the sector's performance, especially considering the upcoming state and national elections, which will likely lead to project approvals being expedited, and government support.

He sees eight opportunities within space, five from the large-cap category and three from the mid-cap category. Among large-cap stocks, Shah favored , ACC, Ambuja, Shree Cement and Grasim. In the mid-cap segment, the top picks were Dalmia Bharat, Ramco Cement and JK Lakshmi Cement.

Shah’s comments were made in light of Investec Report’s cement dealer check suggested a pan-India price decline of Rs 4 per bag MoM in May.

View on banking and RBI monetary policy:

Geojit Financial Services has been positive on the banking and NBFC sectors for a while, seeing them as outperforming and undervalued.

Shah expects the RBI to maintain the status quo in its upcoming credit policy meeting due to uncertainties around the monsoon and potential inflationary pressures. He believes that private sector banks have outperformed, but it's time to look at government banks as well.

Geojit Financial Services favors State Bank of India, Canara Bank and Bank of Baroda in the PSU banks category, and HDFC, Axis, ICICI, Kotak, IndusInd Bank, Federal Bank, IDFC First Bank and Citi Union Bank in the private banks category.",400,0.6820440718105861

After June 2022 low of Rs 5,157, the stock has been in an uptrend making higher highs and higher lows on daily charts and decisively reclaimed the Rs 8,000 mark today. Now, it is around Rs 160 away from its all-time high of Rs 8,269 on November 8, 2021.

Further, UltraTech has given a healthy breakout of a long downward sloping resistance trendline adjoining highs of November 8, 2021, and May 30, 2023, with trading well above 50 as well as 200-day EMA, indicating an upbeat mood in the counter. Also, there was Bollinger band expansion with today's rally and the last five-day consolidation breakout on the chart.

Hence, considering the momentum in the counter, it can march towards record highs in coming sessions and surpassing an all-time high can take the rally further towards Rs 8,500, with support at around Rs 7,800, but avoid fresh longs, experts said.

""The stock is steadily moving upward with Higher Top, Higher Bottom formation on all the time frames like daily, weekly & monthly indicating a strong positive undertone of the stock. Today the stock gave consolidation breakout which has been forming for the last few days with high volume confirmation,"" Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital said.

Returns matter a lot, yet there are always scenarios where analysts and investors are at odds. Sometimes analysts are gung-ho over a stock despite investors dumping it; there are also occasions when investors lap up a stock that analysts seem to loathe.

With the Indian market climbing higher in the past one month, a cluster of stocks has stood out prominently where investors and analysts are at a variance.

Contrarian downgrades

Bajaj Auto, despite a rally in its share price, has stood out like a sore thumb when it comes to analyst views, with the ‘buy’ recommendations decreasing to 27 in April, from 33 in the previous month and 40 in the past one quarter.

The shares of the largest domestic three-wheeler original equipment maker have risen 17 percent over a month, 12 percent over a quarter and 16 percent in a year.

Post the recent rally, Kotak Institutional Equities believes most of the positives are already baked in the current market price of Bajaj Auto, prompting it to maintain its ‘reduce’ rating on the automobile stock with a hike in target price to Rs 4,000 from Rs 3,625 earlier.

Besides this, a cut in export volumes and market share loss faced by the second-largest motorcycle manufacturer has led to the downgrades.

Read more | Bajaj Auto gains on deal with Triumph; here's what brokerages say

“Concerns on the export volumes continue (around 50 percent of sales) with Bajaj Auto delaying the recovery timelines led by uncertainty on unavailability of USD and lower affordability. Also, lack of market share gains in the domestic motorcycles market over the last few years, and increase in competition could lead to further pricing actions,” said brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher.

Meanwhile, Jefferies slightly differed from the view. Even as the capital markets firm is concerned about Bajaj Auto's market share loss in premium bikes and exports, it sees multiple tailwinds—improving domestic demand, gradual export recovery, the launch of Triumph bikes, and the scale-up of EVs.

UltraTech Cement

Over the quarter, another stock that caught the eye was UltraTech Cement where ‘buy’ ratings dropped to 39 from 42 but the share price rose 12.5 percent during the same period.

Gains in the stock price were on the back of the cement manufacturer’s leadership position in the industry with a market share of around 26 percent in FY23, coupled with robust expansion plans without leveraging the balance sheet. Strong demand, cement prices likely remaining stable and power and fuel costs treading lower also supported the buying sentiment for the cement stock.

However, the only thing that seems to be ticking off analysts is the limited upside potential in the stock. Dolat Capital said that the current market price leaves limited upside.

At Rs 7,704 on the BSE, UltraTech Cement’s stock is about a percent away from scaling its 52-week high.

Coal India

Other stocks that analysts seem to dislike are Coal India and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.

For Coal India, 7 brokerage firms have downgraded their ratings on the state-owned mining company’s stock to 15 ‘buy’ recommendations from 22 over the past one year. This is in contrast to the coal major’s near 23 percent rally in the share price, which was largely due to attractive valuation and high dividend yield. The company’s board gave in-principle approval to divest a 25 percent stake in Bharat Coking Coal and some analysts believe a stake sale along with a potential listing could help unlock value, which also triggered the rally.

At Rs 237, the stock trades at an inexpensive valuation of 3.9 times FY24 EV/EBITDA, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Among other things that made analysts wary is a likely fall in e-auction realisations. CLSA believes e-auction realisations will fall further on a decline in global prices.

Lower-than-expected e-auction realisation of Rs 4,525 per tonne, down 10 percent QoQ, played a spoilsport during the March quarter. Sharekhan by BNP Paribas highlighted that lower realisations, especially for e-auction, could affect margins and earnings outlook.

Dr Reddy’s Labs

As for Dr Reddy’s, ‘buy’ ratings have slipped to 31 from 37 over a year. Analysts take it that the ongoing United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) plant inspections and a few companies being issued Form 483 with observations pointing at apparent regulatory concerns, may drag the performance of pharmaceutical players, prompting them to stay selective in the space.

Recently, Dr Reddy’s has been issued a Form 483 with one observation by the US FDA following an inspection of the company’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility in Bollaram, Hyderabad.

Sharekhan cautioned that increased scrutiny from the US FDA, leading to production delays, and rising guidance around research and development and promotion and marketing costs in the near term, could act as headwinds against a potentially strong operating performance for the drugmaker.

Despite the downgrades, the scrip of the pharmaceutical major has shot up 20 percent during the past one year given the superior product portfolio and strong product pipeline of Dr Reddy’s.

Dr Reddy’s has outperformed the Nifty Pharma index over the past one year. The pharma major’s scrip has climbed 26 percent higher in comparison with the 0.5 percent drop in the index.

Contrarian upgrades

On the other hand, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) was the only stock on Nifty50 where the share price declined for over a month, yet analysts upgraded their ratings on the scrip.

Volume growth for India’s largest FMCG company seemed to be a worry for investors, which triggered a small drop in the stock price over the past one month, but analysts paid heed to the upbeat management commentary. The HUL’s management believes overall volume growth will likely recover gradually as consumption comes with a lag. It also reiterated that the rural slowdown has bottomed out and the company should start seeing volume recovery provided the macro environment and raw material prices remain stable.

What analysts also like about HUL — that houses brands like Lux, Pond’s, Red Label, Bru, Dove, Fair & Lovely, Horlicks, Kissan, Pepsodent, Surf Excel, and Vaseline — is the company’s continued market share gains in a challenging consumption environment and its focus on driving premiumisation across categories.

The company’s premium portfolio continues to significantly outperform both the market and HUL’s overall growth, pointed out ICICI Securities.

Besides HUL, analysts also have a fondness for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro despite the negative stock trajectory over a quarter.

Tata Consultancy Services

Even as the stock price is down 6 percent, ‘buy’ calls on TCS shares have bumped up to 24 from 21.

The technology company reported robust deal Total Contract Value (TCV) wins with order book TCV of $10 billion as compared with $7.8 billion in Q3 FY23 and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 times recording an all-time high number of large deals, highlighted Sharekhan.

Meanwhile, PhillipCapital expects TCS to continue to command a valuation premium over its peers, on the back of its strong diversified profile, superior return profile (Return on Equity of 46 percent in FY23), management stability, strong margins and market leadership position.

Despite the strong deal pipeline, the TCS management indicated caution and uncertainty among clients in the near term, which could further impact revenues as well as slow down margin improvement.

Sharekhan has cautioned that the near-term outperformance would be restricted for TCS owing to uncertain earnings outlook, CEO transition and global macro headwinds.

Wipro

Meanwhile, Wipro has also seen an increase in upgrades over a quarter with ‘buy’ recommendations topping up to 13 from 11 despite a 3 percent drop in share price.

Besides, the pricey stock valuation, March quarter earnings had made investors cautious, yet the announcement of buying back shares worth Rs 12,000 crore looked like the saving grace.

“At 15X FY2025E EPS, the stock is not yet cheap enough to warrant a re-look. The stock may hold up in the short term courtesy of buyback,” said Kotak Institutional Equities.

Multiple analysts believe that the current stock valuation fairly captures the risk from the slowing macroeconomic environment that Wipro is facing along with lower-than-expected revenue growth. Wipro has guided for a sequential decline of 1-3 percent in revenue in 1Q FY24, essentially implying no growth in FY24.

Reliance Industries

Over a year, a contrarian upgrade that stole the show is Reliance Industries which saw brokerage firms stepping up their ‘buy’ calls to 33 from 26. Much of the optimism among analysts for RIL’s stock stems from the likelihood of Jio and retail business listings. However, the share price of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate has slumped 14 percent over a year.

CLSA explained that a lack of launches and growth areas has kept the stock subdued over the past 18 months. This, according to the foreign brokerage firm, could change in the second half of FY24 as it sees the Mukesh Ambani-led company start offering its portable 5G device (Jio Airfiber) to ramp up wireless broadband additions and launch its affordable 5G smartphone as it monetises its pan-India standalone 5G launch by end-2023. Further, recent brand launches (Independence, Campa Cola) suggest could ramp up Reliance’s FMCG foray in 2023.

Most importantly, CLSA highlighted in its research report in March that with three years having passed since the stake sale to PE investors, it sees a good chance of a Jio and/or retail IPO in the next 12 months.

Bajaj Finance

Another stock that put the others in the shade was Bajaj Finance. The financier’s stock saw ‘buy’ calls spiralling up to 24 from 19.

The management has guided for healthy loan growth going forward aided by healthy demand as well as new segments, while some fall in net interest margins will be compensated by operating efficiencies. Hence, according to Jefferies, earnings growth and ROA (Return On Asset) can stay high which will support the stock valuations.

“It is also awaiting RBI's approval to foray into credit cards, which we believe can add 5-10 percent to profit pool opportunity,” the global investment banking firm said.

Despite the liking, investors sold the stock over a year with the share price declining around 7 percent during the period. The stock had been consolidating for the last one year.

Some market participants have expressed concern that the lagged effect of rate hikes will likely temper margins. Besides, Kotak Institutional Equities believes the overall business outlook remains strong although rich valuations cap any upside in the stock.

A sharp downswing erased all the weekly gains last Friday and, as a result, the market closed flat on the NIfty50 but still held on to the psychological 18,000 mark that, according to experts, would be crucial for the road ahead.

The index closed at 18,069 on May 5, falling over a percent, while the weekly gains were at 4 points. The 18,200-18,250 range could be crucial on the higher side which can take the index above 18,500-18,600 levels, but falling below 18,000 levels can drag the index up to 17,800, while 17,500 would be a critical hurdle going ahead, experts said.

On the weekly basis, the Nifty50 continued its higher highs formation for sixth consecutive week, though we have seen shooting star kind of pattern which is generally a bearish reversal patter but requires confirmation in following sessions.

""We are of the opinion that if there is no aberration globally, we may see buying resuming at key supports,"" Sameet Chavan, Head Research - Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

As far as levels are concerned, he said 18,000, followed by 17,900 are to be seen as key supports, whereas on the flipside, the sturdy wall once again stands at 18,150–18,250.

Mitesh Karwa, research analyst at Bonanza Portfolio, feels the current week is of extreme importance as it will decide the trend for the next leg. ""The 18,000 levels are expected to act as a strong support zone and if held in the current week, Nifty will start moving towards 18,500 levels.""

On the indicator front, Karwa says the momentum indicator Relative Strength Index RSI (14) is showing a reading of 63 and Nifty is trading above its 200 EMA at 17,569 which indicates strength.

Sameet Chavan advised that traders should continue with a stock centric approach and should use declines to add longs with a near term perspective.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 5 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Grasim Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,752.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,680 | Target: Rs 1,840 | Return: 5 percent

On a daily and weekly basis, the stock is trending upward. On Friday, it closed above the level of Rs 1,740 which would send the stock into the higher trading zone, which is between Rs 1,700 and Rs 1,930.

Minor resistance exists at Rs 1,800 and Rs 1,840. The strategy should be to buy at Rs 1,750 and at Rs 1,710. Keep a stop-loss at Rs 1,680.

Hero MotoCorp: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,547 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,350 | Target: Rs 2,850 | Return: 12 percent

Since, March 2022, technically, a lot of things changed for the stock Hero MotoCorp. In the month of August 2022, the stock has made a higher high at Rs 2,938, which is a sign of bulls' victory above bears after a period of 18 months.

Later, on we saw a gradual decline along with the trend of the market to Rs 2,296; however, it has made a higher bottom as compared to Rs 2,146.

On a weekly basis, the stock has left a bullish breakaway gap at Rs 2,372. Based on the broader formation, traders should be buyers at current levels and more on dips at Rs 2,450. Keep stop-loss at Rs 2,350. On the higher side, the stock could move to Rs 2,650 (200-day SMA) and Rs 2,850 levels.

Bharat Forge: Sell | LTP: Rs 760.25 | Stop-Loss: Rs 825 | Target: Rs 660 | Return: 13 percent

The stock is forming a series of lower top and lower bottom. It is against the trend of the Auto sector and also underperforming on a weekly basis. However, it is currently at crucial support of Rs 740 and till the stock is not breaking it, we can expect rangebound activity between Rs 800 and Rs 740.

It is advisable to sell the stock at Rs 800 or below the level of Rs 740 for the target of Rs 660. However, stop-loss at Rs 825 or at Rs 765 is a must respectively.

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

Birla Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 980.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 925 | Target: Rs 1,060 | Return: 8 percent

After showing rangebound action in the last few weeks, the stock price (Birla Corporation) has witnessed a sharp upside breakout this week amidst a volatile broader market. The stock price has moved above the crucial resistance of down sloping trend line at Rs 930 levels and closed higher. Hence, there is a higher possibility of further extension of upside momentum in the coming week.

Volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price ahead.

Buying can be initiated in Birla Corporation at CMP (Rs 980.15), add more on dips down to Rs Rs 950. One can wait for the upside target of Rs 1,060 in the next 3-5 weeks, with a stop-loss of Rs 925.

RBL Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 148.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 159 | Tartget: Rs 136 | Return: 8.7 percent

After showing a sustainable upside bounce in the last five weeks, the stock price (RBL Bank) has witnessed sharp weakness in this week and closed lower.

Previous week’s swing high at Rs 163.30 levels could now be considered as a new lower top of bearish sequence. Hence, further weakness could be expected towards new lower bottom formation in the near term. Further weakness below Rs 144 is likely to be a downside breakout of crucial support of ascending trend line. Volume has started to expand during recent weakness and the weekly 14 period RSI shows negative indication.

One may look to go short in RBL Bank at CMP (Rs 148.95), add more on rise up to Rs 154 and wait for the downside target of Rs 136 in the next 3-5 weeks. Place a stoploss of Rs 159.

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement (UTCEM)’s 4QFY23 operating performance was in line with consolidated EBITDA at INR33.2b (v/s est. INR33b) and EBITDA/t at INR1,049 (v/s est. INR1,043). Adj. Profit was at INR16.7b (v/s est. INR17.5b). Lower-than-estimated opex/t helped offset lower realization.

Expansion plans of UTCEM are on track and phase-2 expansion of 22.6mtpa will be commissioned by 1HFY26E. We largely retain our FY24/FY25 estimates and reiterate our BUY rating on the stock, given its: a) leadership position in the industry (with a market share of ~26% in FY23), b) robust expansion plans without leveraging the balance sheet, and c) structural cost improvement.

Outlook

We value UTCEM at 15.5x FY25E EV/EBITDA to arrive at our revised TP of INR8,600 (implying EV/t of USD200).

Shares of UltraTech Cement Ltd shed over 1 percent on May 2, the first trading day since the company reported a 32.29 percent decline in consolidated net profit for the March quarter on Friday.

At 10.05am on Tuesday, the stock was trading at Rs 7466.40 on the BSE, down 1.17 percent from its previous close.

The company's consolidated net profit for the quarter under review stood at Rs 1,665.95 crore as against Rs 2,460.51 crore reported a year ago. The decline was primarily due to significantly higher tax expenses for the quarter, as compared to tax credits received during the corresponding period last year.

Despite this, the company's revenue from operations saw a growth of 18.36 percent, coming in at Rs 18,662.38 crore, up from Rs 15,767.28 crore in the year-ago quarter.

The company experienced a 17 percent on-year increase in energy costs, while there was a 4 percent decline in costs compared to the previous quarter. The prices of pet coke and coal jumped 18 percent on-year. In addition, raw material costs went up 9 percent year-on-year, primarily due to an increase in the cost of materials such as fly ash, slag, and gypsum. UltraTech Cement, however, delivered a robust 14 percent on-year or 23 percent on-quarter volume surge in Q4FY23.

""Factoring in better-than-expected volume growth, we are revising up FY25 EBITDA by 2 percent; maintain the ‘hold’ rating with a revised target price of Rs 7,339 (Rs 7,122 earlier) based on 14.5x EV/EBITDA,"" said Nuvama Research in a note to investors.

The demand for cement has continued to remain stable in April 2023, following a robust performance in the fourth quarter of FY23. UltraTech is aiming to outpace industry growth by 4-5 percentage points in the upcoming fiscal year FY24. Cement prices will remain steady in April 2023, the company said.

In Q4FY23, UltraTech Cement commissioned a 5.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) capacity, with an additional capacity of approximately 2.1 mtpa expected to be added in Q1FY24. This will bring the company's total capacity to 131mtpa. The second phase of expansion, which involves adding 22.6mtpa, is progressing well and expected to be completed by June 2025, bringing the total capacity to 154mtpa. The company aims to double its ready-mix concrete (RMC) plants from 231. It operates seven bulk cement terminals, and with the phase 2 expansion, two more terminals are expected to be commissioned.

Antique's analysis indicates that UltraTech experienced a notable increase in market share during the fourth quarter, and this trend is expected to persist in the medium-term due to the company's well-timed plans to expand its capacity.

UltraTech is expected to maintain its position as a leader in the industry in terms of profitability, with a diversified market mix, premium brand positioning, and improving cost efficiencies being key drivers of its success.

""We largely retain our FY24/FY25 estimates and reiterate our 'buy' rating on the stock, given its: (a) leadership position in the industry with a market share of 26 percent in FY23, (b) robust expansion plans without leveraging the balance sheet, and (c) structural cost improvement. We value UltraTech at 15.5x FY25 EV/EBITDA to arrive at our revised target price of Rs8,600 (implying EV/t of $200),"" said Motilal Oswal in its latest report.

According to Systematix Institutional Equities, margin expansion for UltraTech would be driven by increased volumes, improved cost efficiency, and operating leverage. Additionally, a reduction in costs and stronger volumes, along with a robust balance sheet, would be the key drivers of near-term margin expansion for the company.

Despite investing in annual capex of Rs 60-70 billion, UltraTech is expected to have net cash in its balance sheet, providing it with ample room to pursue expansion while also moderating its operating costs.

Meanwhile, the brokerage firm CLSA has downgraded UltraTech Cement to underperform from Outperform and kept its target price at Rs 7900 a share from its current market price.",661,0.38711954997136044

Ultratech Cement on April 28 reported a net consolidated profit of Rs 1,665.95 crore for the March quarter of the financial year 2022-23, registering a decline of 32.29 percent from Rs 2,460.51 crore recorded in the same quarter of the previous fiscal.

The numbers fell because of much higher tax outgo for the quarter against credit in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.

Revenue from operations came in at Rs 18,662.38 crore, up 18.36 percent from Rs 15,767.28 crore in the year-ago quarter, the company said in a regulatory filing.

UltraTech said it achieved 100 million tonnes of production, dispatches and sales in FY23. This was backed by an effective capacity utilisation of 95 percent during this quarter and 84 percent capacity utilisation for the year.

Volume growth was 15 percent.

The company saw an increase in energy cost by 17 percent YoY and 4 percent lower QoQ. Prices of pet coke and coal increased 18 percent YoY. Raw material cost was up 9 percent YoY on account of the increase in the cost of fly ash, slag and gypsum etc.

The Board of Directors at their meeting held today have recommended a dividend at the rate of Rs. 38 per equity share.

UltraTech's expansion programme is progressing as per schedule, it said in a release. During the year, the company commissioned 12.4 mtpa (million tonne per annum) additional capacity of grey cement. It has further commissioned a 2.2 mtpa brownfield cement capacity at Patliputra in April 2023.

Work on its next phase of growth of 22.6 mtpa has already commenced, it said. Civil work is in full swing at most sites. Commercial production from these new capacities is expected to go on stream in a phased manner by FY25/FY26. Upon completion of these expansions, the company's capacity will grow to 160.45 mtpa, reinforcing its position as the third largest cement company in the world, outside of China and the largest in India by far.",336,0.3469560245672862

Shares of UltraTech Cement gained in early trade on April 20 after the company increased its manufacturing capacity.

UltraTech Cement raised the capacity at its grinding unit at Patliputra, Bihar, to 4.7 mtpa with the successful commissioning of its 2.2 mtpa brownfield expansion.

This additional capacity will help the company service the fast-growing cement demand in the East and will also help to increase its blended cement ratio.

The total grey cement manufacturing capacity in India now stands at 129.15 mtpa, the company said.

Under the phase one expansion, the company had aimed to add 19.9 MT capacity taking the total to 131.25 MTPA. We expect 2.25 MT capacity to be added in Q1FY24E, said ICICIdirect.

In phase two of the expansion, the company would take its overall capacity to 154 MT by FY25E. These new organic capacities are being added at lower capital costs (US$60/t for phase I, $76/tonne for phase II), which will boost return ratios, going forward, it added.

2023-03-29 19:03:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/no-import-india-to-start-exporting-coal-from-2025-26-coal-minister-pralhad-joshi-10332831.html,"Representative image.

India will start exporting coal from 2025-26, Union Minister for Coal, Mines and Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi said on March 29 in New Delhi, while asserting that importing coal for thermal power generation will cease in about two years from now.

Joshi was speaking at the launch of the seventh round of commercial coal mines auction and signing of agreements with successful bidders of the sixth round of auctions. The event had Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh as the chief guest.

Joshi stated that with a 14 percent increase, coal production is expected to touch the record figure of 880 million tons (MT) this fiscal and offtake is likely to touch 900 MT. He also said coal production exclusively from captive and commercial mines has crossed 100 MT.

Later, talking to reporters on the sidelines of the event, Joshi said his announcement was for non-coking coal only. India's cumulative total estimated coal reserve is about 3.61 lakh million tons.

""From a net importer of coal, India is moving towards becoming a net exporter of non-coking coal. India's imports of substitutable coal were 90 MT, which will be stopped by 2025-26 as the country will start exporting dry fuel. We will stop the import of thermal coal, except the import of coking coal,"" Joshi said.

The minister explained that there will not be a blanket ban on coal imports as there are imported coal-based power plants that are designed in a certain way. He, however, assured that if such imported coal-based power plants make the required changes in their technology, they too would be allocated domestic coal by the government.

With the launch of the seventh round of auction for commercial coal mines, a total of 106 coal blocks are now on offer. Out of 106 coal mines, five coal mines are being offered under a second attempt for the sixth tranche as only single bid were received for these mines. Of the remaining 101 coal mines being offered under seventh tranche, 32 are new coal mines and 69 mines are being rolled over from earlier tranches.

The mines being auctioned are spread across coal and lignite bearing states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Bihar.

On March 29, the coal ministry also signed agreements for 29 coal mines which were auctioned under the sixth round of commercial coal mines auction. Some companies who won the bids include JSW Steel Limited, JSW Cement Limited, Ultratech Cement Limited, Shree Cement Limited, Assam Mineral Development Corporation Limited, Jindal Power Limited, Dalmia Cement (Bharat) Limited, Rungta Sons Private Limited, Ambuja Cements Limited and Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation Ltd.

The cumulative peak rated capacity (PRC) of 29 coal mines is 74 MTPA. These mines upon operationalisation are expected to generate an annual revenue of Rs. 14,497 crores calculated at PRC of these coal mines and will provide employment to about one lakh people, the ministry said in a statement.

Talking about meeting India's growing power demand, Joshi said his ministry will ensure there is enough coal at thermal power plants not just during the summers, but also during monsoons. In April, the power ministry has projected the peak electricity demand to touch 230 gigawatts (GW).

Coal secretary Amrit Lal Meena said 87 coal mines have been successfully auctioned across various tranches of commercial coal mine auctions so far.

Commercial coal mining was introduced in order to enhance domestic coal production and pave the way for energy security. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the first tranche of auction of coal mines for commercial use on June 18, 2020. This was a landmark step for the Indian coal sector, as for the first time, coal was allowed to be mined commercially by all companies and without any restriction on end use. Also, with a view to have a market linked approach to coal pricing, the National Coal Index was launched in the country.

""Since 2019, we have also operationalised about 27 mines to produce coal. This includes coal mines owned by the government, various PSUs and the private sector. Coal production from commercial coal mines is expected to reach more than 1 billion MT in FY 2023-24,"" M Nagaraju, additional secretary and nominated authority of coal auctioning, told Moneycontrol.

For the first time in history, the captive and commercial coal mines together have breached the 112 MT, he said.

Data from the coal ministry showed that from about 50 auctioned coal mines under the private sector since February 2020, at least three have become operational. ""This in itself is commendable as earlier it used to take up to 10 years to operationalise a new coal mine. Now we have simplified the processes so much and are offering 50 percent incentive for those who get their coal mines ready early, which is why we are seeing new coal mines getting ready in record 2.5 years in India,"" Meena told Moneycontrol.

Joshi said coal would remain important for India's economy, especially the power sector till about 2040 at least.",842,0.958160012960434

“The Indian cement sector is likely to be a big beneficiary of declining global energy costs (petcoke/coal are down 35-60 percent YoY) with benefit starting in 4QFY23 and accelerating into FY24, if trends sustain,” Jefferies said in a note to clients. The brokerage firm likes companies that have the potential to outperform the industry on a volume basis.

The benefit of falling spot energy costs was none or marginal for most cement players till the December quarter due to high-cost fuel inventory position, and will start reflecting from the March quarter, and accelerate into FY24, it said.

Cement manufacturers have seen earnings cut in the past few quarters as price hikes lagged cost increases. Based on the pricing trend in the past few months, Jefferies sees cement players focusing on volumes instead of prices in the near term.

Some analysts have pointed out that cement price hikes could not hold up with companies rushing to fulfil their year-end volume targets, and cost optimisation or savings are keys to better performances.

Jefferies said demand is strong due to pre-election-led infrastructure spending by various state or central governments, and companies are using this opportunity to boost volume growth as there is spare capacity in the system even though utilisation has improved.

“We have seen similar instances in the past where producers focused on volume when demand is high and have not resorted to price increases despite improvement in utilisation,” the brokerage said. Jefferies expects earnings of UltraTech Cement, Dalmia Bharat and JK Cement—which are its preferred picks in the cement sector—to outperform the industry given the strong capacity addition line-up.

What CLSA says

Meanwhile, UltraTech Cement and Dalmia Bharat are also preferred bets for CLSA in the cement space. The brokerage sees several catalysts for the cement sector over the next few quarters and does not see a rollback of recent price hikes as negative. However, the current valuations leave limited room for further re-ratings, the brokerage firm cautioned.

As per a report by Crisil, demand is expected to outpace supply, which is expected to grow at 6-7 percent compounded annually, keeping utilisation levels at more than 70 percent at pan-India levels.

Capacity addition

Cement companies are expected to add 145-155 million tonne (MT) of capacity in FY23-27, from the current 570 MT, translating to a compounded annual growth rate of 4-5 percent, the credit ratings agency said. ICICI Direct Research expects an addition of about 30 MT of new capacity annually taking the total capacity to 650 MT by FY25.

The majority of the capacity addition was done by UltraTech Cement (approximately 40 percent of new addition), the domestic brokerage firm said.

“Top five players (UltraTech, Shree, ACC, Ambuja and Dalmia) are expected to accelerate at a faster pace (around 9 percent CAGR) leading to higher consolidation, which would drive efficiency and discipline in the sector,” it said.

Nifty50 opened the session on March 2 on a tepid note and witnessed selling pressure throughout the session to close the weekly expiry around the day's lows. However, the index had rebounded strongly on Wednesday, post forming, the red candles for consecutive nine sessions in a row. The reversal was witnessed after hitting the potential reversal zone (PRZ) of the AB=CD Harmonic pattern which stands around the 17,300-17,250 zone.

Hence, going ahead till the index manages to protect 17,200 mark, index is expected to perceive an oversold bounce towards 17,630, followed by 17,800.

Failure to hold 17,200 would invalidate the Harmonic pattern and shall signal the continuation of the down-move. In this case, the decline shall extend towards 17,030-16,880 levels.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 week:

Torrent Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 516 | Stop-Loss: Rs 490 | Target: Rs 565 | Return: 10 percent

The stock saw a tremendous rally in 2021, where price rallied from Rs 296 to Rs 606, which is an outstanding move. Post hitting an all-time high of Rs 606, price turned into a hibernation mode, trading in a broad range of Rs 600-430 levels.

This year, in late January, price rebounded higher finding support around lower band of the mentioned range with supportive momentum and volumes. Price trading above all key moving averages (20, 50, 100, 200-day) highlights strength in trend.

This week price resolved higher breaking the downsloping resistance trendline indicates bullish momentum to continue ahead. RSI (relative strength index) has surpassed above 50 levels and has registered a breakout from resistance trendline compliments bullish bias on price.

Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,834 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,700 | Target: Rs 3,100 | Return: 9 percent

Since August 2022, prices have remained under pressure and plummeted nearly 25 percent. After the round of selloff, now prices are showing some sign of bullish price action with favourable risk to reward opportunity.

On the higher timeframe chart, stock has dropped to the confluence of support which includes rising trendline, AB=CD Harmonic pattern and 88.6 percent retracement line of its prior advance from Rs 2,560 to Rs 3,583.

RSI has dropped to historical support readings. Furthermore, relative strength line against Nifty50 have rebounded higher from the lower end of the range indicates improvement in trend strength.

UltraTech Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 7,289 | Stop-Loss: Rs 7,038 | Target: Rs 7,800 | Return: 7 percent

After an intense tug-of-war throughout the week ended February 17, the Nifty settled around 17,950 levels, procuring nearly half a percent from the previous week's closure.

The lack of follow-up buying nullified the breakout attempt, and we fell back in the same zone from where we had started. However, the recent price action could be seen as constructive development for our markets as the index is hovering above the sloping trendline and has also attempted to transcend the sturdy hurdle of the 18,000 mark after two weeks of consolidation.

As far as levels are concerned, we remain hopeful till the sacrosanct support of 17,800-17,700 is firmly withheld. On the flip side, sustenance above 18.000 could only bring the cheer back in the market, while on the higher end 18,200 is likely to be the sturdy wall in a comparable period.

We remain sanguine with the up trend and would advise the traders to utilise the dips to add long position in the index.

Here is one buy call and one sell call for short term:

UltraTech Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 7,297.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 7,170 | Target: Rs 7,600 | Return: 4 percent

Only handful of ‘cement’ stocks have been performing well in last few months and UltraTech is certainly one of them. The stock did not participate in the recent destruction, in fact, remained sideways by maintaining its sturdy structure.

Now, on Friday, the stock prices finally burst through its consolidation phase to confirm a breakout from the ‘Bullish Flag’ pattern on the daily chart.

The volumes have been gargantuan to support this strong up move. We recommend buying for a trading target of Rs 7,400. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 7,170.

Manappuram Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 108.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 111.2 | Target: Rs 105.5 | Return: 3 percent

This stock has been undergoing a corrective phase since last many months now. Recently, we observed prices stalling around its key short-term moving average for nearly three weeks.

On Friday, the consolidation range finally got broken on the lower side. This not only confirmed a breakdown from multiple supports but also resulted in resuming its higher degree downtrend.

The stock is now likely to continue its slide towards the ‘200-day SMA (simple moving average - Rs 104.4)’. Traders can short this counter for a short-term target of Rs 105.50. The strict stop-loss can be placed at Rs 111.20.

""A growing housing sector, which typically accounts for 60-65 percent of India's cement consumption, will remain a key demand driver. Also, continued large investments in roads and infrastructure projects will fuel cement demand,"" Moody's said.

The company has commissioned 1.30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) brownfield cement capacity at Hirmi in Chhattisgarh and 2.80 mtpa greenfield grinding capacity at Cuttack in Odisha.

The industry had been going through a difficult period over the past year as it tried to deal with high input prices resulting in slim operating margins, which are improving now as costs have fallen in the last couple of quarters. Along with that, prices have also firmed up, resulting in better realisation.

According to analysts at Motilal Oswal, “…energy cost peaked out in 2QFY23, and we expect reduction in energy costs 3QFY23 onwards (reduction of Rs 200 / tonne over 3QFY23-1QFY24E based on current coal / petcoke prices).”

While UltraTech has benefited from the revival of the industry and general optimism towards the sector, company specific initiatives focusing on cost efficiencies, reduced leverage, and capacity addition have also helped it maintain its leadership position.

On the capacity front, the company has projected a growth of 8.2 percent to 131 metric tonne / year (Mt/year) by 31 March 2023, and expects it to grow by 22 percent to 160 Mt / year by FY26. In its latest Q3FY23 results, the company mentioned that the second phase of its capacity expansion plan of 22.6 MTPA (million tonnes per annum) announced during Q1 has already commenced.

Per analysts at Sharekhan, “It continues to remain on track with respect to its capacity expansion plans owing to strong demand outlook in infrastructure, and rural housing, and urban housing segments.”

The company also took initiatives to achieve a better cost structure. For example, it commissioned solar power plants to increase green power usage, and aims to meet 36 percent of its requirement through green power by 2025, along with optimisation of logistics costs.

“We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock, given the robust expansion plans, structural cost improvement (increasing green energy share and logistics cost optimisation), and strong balance-sheet (net cash positive in FY25E),” added Motilal Oswal.

The company has worked on reducing its leverage, with net debt declining to Rs 7,720 crore as of December from Rs 8,360 crore in September. The quarter ended with a net negative working capital of Rs 125 core, which the company expects to further improve in 4QFY23, the brokerage said.",432,0.992469933297899

Cement company stocks gained in early trading after a report that the finance minister would examine the possibility of reducing the 28 percent goods and services tax rate for the sector.

The minister hinted at the reduction in the GST rate on cement at a post-budget meeting with Confederation of Indian Industry leaders and indicated that it would be considered for reference to the GST fitment committee if necessary, the Financial Express reported.

However, most cement stocks came off their day’s high in later trading. ACC down 1.25 percent, Ambuja up 0.66 percent, Ultratech Cement up 1.8 percent and Shree Cement down 1.2 percent.

Rakesh Arora, managing partner of Go India Advisors, said a reduction of the GST rate on cement would be positive for the sector. However, he was sceptical about cement companies passing on the benefit to consumers, saying they may retain a part of it to boost margins.

Most cement companies did not report positive results for the quarter ended December. UltraTech Cement said on its earnings call that it doesn't anticipate significant changes in cement prices. The company indicated that it doesn't expect pet coke prices to decrease significantly and energy prices will remain volatile.

The cement and steel sectors are expected to gain from the 33 percent increase in capital investment outlay to Rs 10 lakh crore in the budget for FY24. Additionally, there was a proposal for a 66 percent higher outlay for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, the affordable housing project for the poor, at over Rs 79,000 crore.",279,-0.18828942775726318

Share prices of Ultratech Cement, Ambuja Cements, JK Cements, Ramco Cements gained between 1-2 per cent on February 8, a day after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman indicated that the government could be open to considering a reduction in the goods and services tax (GST) on cement.

At a session with members of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in New Delhi, she assured that she would have the fitment committee look into the existing 28 percent GST rate on cement.

According to foreign brokerage firm Jefferies, a GST cut from 28 percent to 18 percent would imply 7-8 percent cut in customer pricing. It will provide minor fillip to volumes and is positive for pricing in medium term, it noted.

Cement companies took a hit to their bottomline on account of higher fuel costs in 2022, but that is expected to change this year, believe analysts.

Cement demand is expected to improve over next few quarters on account of robust Union Budget as well as upcoming elections, they added.

Dolat Capital Market's research report on UltraTech Cement

UTCEM reported revenue and volume in line, however realization/tn, EBITDA, EBITDA/tn and APAT below estimates. UTCEM posted +19.5% YoY growth in revenue to Rs155.2 bn led by +11.8% YoY in volume to 25.9 mt (+11.9% QoQ) coupled with +6.9% YoY in realization/tn to Rs6,002 (-0.2% QoQ). EBITDA/ APAT down by 3.5%/ 9.7% YoY to Rs23.4 bn/ Rs10.6 bn due to higher opex. We broadly maintain our revenue estimates for FY23E/ FY24E/ FY25E. However, we decrease our EBITDA estimates by 7.8%/ 4.8%/ 6.0% for FY23E/ FY24E/ FY25E factoring 9MFY23. Accordingly, we decrease our APAT estimates by 11.1%/ 6.6%/ 7.8% for FY23E/ FY24E/ FY25E. We expect 12.1%/ 8.6%/ 12.0% Revenue/ EBITDA/ APAT CAGR over FY22-25E led by 9.8%/ 10.1%/ 8.4% volume growth and 7.6%/ 0.0%/ 0.0% realization growth in FY23E/ FY24E/ FY25E.

Outlook

UTCEM, being the largest player in Indian cement industry is its biggest advantage. However, CMP leaves limited upside, thus we downgrade to Accumulate with a revised TP of Rs7,643 based on 15x consolidated FY25E EV/EBITDA.

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

Q3FY2023 standalone revenues were better than estimates, while operational and net profitability came in a tad lower than estimate on account of lower-than-expected blended realisations. It would revert to four digit EBITDA/tonne in Q4 expecting strong demand, lower power & fuel costs and stable pricing environment. It commissioned 6.8mtpa cement capacities during 9MFY2023 while it would be commissioning ~10 mtpa in next few months. Petcoke are prices expected to remain rangebound, while cement prices to be firm with upward bias.

Outlook

We maintain Buy on UltraTech with a revised PT of Rs. 8,100, factoring downwardly revised estimates and long-term growth potential and reasonable valuation.

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

UTCEM reported consolidated EBITDA of INR23.4b (estimated INR24.2b) and EBITDA/t of INR903 (estimated INR945). Adjusted PAT stood at INR10.6b (down 10% YoY; 5% below our estimate). Lower-than-estimated realization increase and unexpected increase in variable costs resulted in an earnings disappointment. The management expects a strong demand environment and utilization levels at 95-100% in 4Q (92% in Dec’22). We had highlighted in our sector update that industry clinker utilization levels should be at 89% in 4Q, which ideally should drive up profits improvement for the industry. We cut our FY24/FY25 EPS estimate by 5% (each). We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock, given robust expansion plans, structural cost improvement (increasing green energy share and logistics cost optimization) and strong balance-sheet (net-cash positive in FY25E).

Outlook

The stock trades at 15.5x/13.4x FY24E/FY25E EV/EBITDA (v/s its 10-year average one-year forward EV/EBITDA of 15.7x). We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock by valuing it at 15.5x FY25E EV/EBITDA (v/s Sep’24 earlier). Our TP of INR7,875 (v/s INR7,770 earlier) offers a 15% upside potential.

Global research firm CLSA has an ""outperform"" rating on the stock with the target at Rs 7,800 a share, an upside of over 11 percent from the current level.

It is of the view that Q3 EBITDA was largely in-line with estimates while it believes that the results were largely mixed. Outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond would the key, it said.

""Volume growth was encouraging, while flat realisation disappointed. Increase in profitability was led by benefits of operating leverage on higher volume,"" it said.

Jefferies has a ""buy"" rating with the target at Rs 8,300 a share, an upside of more than 18 percent from the current market price. The global brokerage firm believes that consolidated EBITDA was near expectations.

""Sales volume growth was broad-based, while realisation growth was lower than estimates. Cost growth was moderately higher against estimates. Cost growth likely reflects high cost inventory remaining even as spot fuel costs are sliding,"" it said.

Morgan Stanley has an “overweight” call with the target at Rs 8,500 per share, an upside of 21 percent from the current level.

It is of the view that EBITDA was in-line with consensus, with the key positives being volumes and realisations, partially offset by higher operating expenses. It prefers the company based on multi-year demand upcycle expectations and return ratios.

UltraTech achieved capacity utilisation of 83 percent as against 75 percent during Q3FY22, it said.

During the quarter, Ultra Tech commissioned a total 5.5 metric tonne per annum (mtpa) new capacity.

India’s largest grey cement manufacturer UltraTech Cement is expected to report better volumes and a recovery in sales but profit is expected to dip when it reports its December quarter numbers on January 21.

UltraTech Cement's consolidated revenue is likely to rise by 19.5 percent year on year (YoY) and 11.7 percent quarter on quarter (QoQ) to Rs 15,191.5 crore, according to a brokerage poll conducted by Moneycontrol.

Net profit is expected to grow 46.2 percent QoQ to Rs 1,105.2 crore but is seen declining 5.7 percent YoY.

After witnessing a sharp dip in profitability in the second quarter of FY23 because of escalated operating costs and a fall in cement prices, manufacturers are likely to report an earnings recovery in Q3FY23 on the back of better volumes, an uptick in realisation and partial cost relief, said Elara Securities.

It, however, warned that the overall cement demand was hampered due to the festival season in October, limited availability of labour and regional issues such as construction ban in northern pockets, elections in Gujarat, muted sand availability in Punjab and the rise in agricultural activities in rural areas.

UltraTech Cement will report a volume of 23.8 million tons, up 11 percent YoY and 7.5 percent QoQ, factoring in seasonal recovery and a low base, Kotak Institutional Equities said.

It estimates blended realisations increased by 1.3 percent QoQ and 6.4 percent YoY, led by front-ended price hikes during the quarter.

In the December quarter, cement prices increased around 2 percent sequentially across India, HDFC Securities said.

The increase was approximately 4-6 percent QoQ in the east and south regions, 1-2 percent in the west, while the north was flattish. In the central region, prices corrected by a percent from the September quarter, the brokerage said.

Channel checks indicate that all-India average cement prices are likely to rise about 3 percent YoY and around 2 percent QoQ in Q3 of FY23, Elara Securities said.

Kotak Institutional Equities estimated that costs per ton would decline sequentially, down 1.2 percent QoQ, led by operating leverage and marginally by lower power-fuel cost.

“We estimate cement EBITDA/ton to recover sequentially to Rs 957/ton (-10.3 percent yoy, +17.2 percent QoQ), led by a combination of higher realizations and lower costs.”

The operating margins of cement companies have contracted sharply over the past year due to elevated fuel prices, of pet coke as well as imported coal. Fuel prices have started to cool off and have corrected approximately 21-41 percent from their peaks.

“We believe energy cost peaked out in 2QFY23 and expect a reduction in energy costs from 3QFY23 onwards (reduction of INR200/t over 3QFY23-1QFY24E based on current coal/petcoke prices),” said Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

The market rebounded from a week-long correction and closed a volatile week on January 13 with half a percent gains on the back of easing inflation and good set of earnings by IT companies.

The Nifty50 has formed Long-Legged Doji kind of pattern on the weekly scale, indicating lack of direction among bulls and bears, but the index has defended the 17,800 level quite smoothly several times during the week and eventually closed above the 17,900 mark. On the daily charts, the index has seen support-based buying in the last couple of sessions, indicating the possibility of further uptrend. It has taken support at 100 DEMA (day exponential moving average - 17,883)

On the higher side, 18,000-18,200 are the key levels to watch out for as a rise beyond this level decisively may take the index towards 18,500, whereas a crucial support is expected at 17,750 as a breach of which could pull the index down to the 17,600-17,500 zone, experts said.

""For the coming week, the 18,150 mark, which is almost the high of Doji, would be a trigger point for positive momentum, whereas a close below 17,775 would drag the index further,"" Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi, said.

As of now there seems to be a possibility of Budget relief rally but even that would get confirmed above 18,150, he feels.

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, continues to remain hopeful and expects some positivity to trigger in the coming days.

Traders should keep focusing on stock-specific moves and should ideally remain light on positions till the time key indices consolidate in the recent congestion zone, advised Chavan.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the January 13 closing prices:

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

BEML: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,527 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,420 | Target: Rs 1,675 | Return: 10 percent

After a sharp upside bounce in December 2022, the stock price (BEML) has shifted into a rangebound movement in the last couple of weeks. The stock price is now in an attempt of break above the said range and also a resistance of down sloping trend line at Rs 1,530 level.

Hence, a sustainable upside from here is likely to be a sharp positive impact for the stock price ahead. The stock price has started to move up from near the cluster support of 10 and 20-day EMA (exponential moving average) and also 200-day EMA around Rs 1,485-1,500 levels. Volume has started to expand with up-move in the stock price and daily RSI (relative strength index) shows positive indication.

Buying can be initiated in BEML at CMP (Rs 1,527), add more on dips down to Rs 1,465, wait for the upside target of Rs 1,675 in the next 3-5 weeks with a a stop-loss of Rs 1,420.

Rain Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 183.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 171 | Target: Rs 202 | Return: 10 percent

The weekly timeframe chart of the stock price indicates a sustainable upside bounce in last week. The stock price is in an attempt of upside breakout of the resistance of descending trend line around Rs 185 level.

Hence, further sustainable move from here could be considered as a significant upside breakout and the stock price could move up sharply. Volume has started to rise during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly RSI shows positive indication.

After scaling new highs, the Indian equity market had a spell of volatility in December. Positive cues from China reopening clashed with the fear of rising COVID-19 cases, and cheer from US Fed’s step down to a 50-basis point rate hike was met with apprehension of central banks holding peak rates for a longer period of time. Both the Nifty and Sensex declined close to 3 percent over the month.

The quantum of rating upgrades/downgrades also remained muted for December as there were no big stock-specific cues. Bajaj Finance, Wipro and Tata Motors were the big names that saw some divergence between price action and analyst action over the month.

Bajaj Finance declined over 3.5 percent for the month but the stock saw ‘buy’ calls increase from 19 to 20 and ‘hold’ calls came down to five from six. Analysts continue to be optimistic about the company’s digital transformation and consistent financial performance. Meanwhile, investors kept away from the scrip due to rich valuation of 40x price-to-earnings ratio and fear of the company’s moat being challenged by entry of Jio Financial Services.

In Q2FY23, Bajaj Finance’s net profit grew 88 percent year-on-year, driven by robust customer additions and new loan acquisitions, aided by its omni-channel strategy. The company aims to go fully digital across all products and services by March 2023.

“The fintech story is embedded in this business, valuations should stay at a premium. We raise PAT estimates for FY23E and FY24E by 13 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively,” said ICICI Direct.

For the year to December too, Bajaj Finance topped the list of contrarian upgrades. ‘Buy’ calls increased from 16 to 20, as the stock price fell 6 percent.

Another stock that faced scepticism from Dalal Street but found a bit of favour with analysts was Wipro. The counter, along with other IT stocks, is being shunned by investors as they anticipate an earnings cut from the anticipated recession in the US and Europe. It has 13 ‘buy’ calls, 12 ‘hold’ calls and 20 ‘sell’ calls. A month ago, ‘buy’ calls stood at 12.

While pessimism regarding the stock is high, a sliver of optimism comes from the fact that it has been the worst performer among the IT pack in the year gone by. “Valuations now look attractive and weak organic earnings growth is more than priced-in into current valuations,” analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note. The stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 19.12x.

Among contrarian downgrades in the past one month, Divi’s Laboratories stands out. The stock saw its ‘sell’ calls go up from nine to ten, while the counter gained 4 percent in the month. The run-up in share price was largely on the back of a new COVID-19 variant spooking markets, which investors believed could mark a turnaround in pharma fortunes. Fundamentally, no significant development has been reported by the company.

In Q2FY23, its net profit dropped 18.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 493.6 crore, and revenue was 6.7 percent lower. “Reduced traction in custom synthesis, coupled with lower operating leverage, resulted in an earnings decline for the first time after 12 quarters of a strong performance,” Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a note.

Year-on-year changes

Apart from Bajaj Finance, other stocks that saw their ‘buy’ calls increase over the last one year despite decline in share price are HDFC Life, Apollo Hospitals and UltraTech Cement. Life Insurance Corporation of India’s D-Street debut along with its muted performance rubbed off on the stock performance of other life insurers in the past year. HDFC Life’s stock declined 11 percent in this period.

However, ‘buy’ calls on the stock went up from 28 to 32, largely on the back of its Exide Life acquisition and its ability to maintain market share and leadership among its peers.

Share price of Apollo Hospitals dropped in the last one year as COVID-19 cases waned and hospitalisations decreased. But analyst optimism on the stock increased with ‘buy’ calls rising from 22 to 25.

UBS believes that Apollo Hospitals is executing new initiatives well and that the market is not pricing in an early success of its digital strategy. ""Accelerated expansion in physical pharmacy and the diagnostics business is aiding market share gains for the company,” it added. The firm has a Rs 5,600 target price on the stock.

Meanwhile, UltraTech Cement’s fall in share price came on the back of weak quarterly earnings impacted by rising pet coke prices. The Adani Group’s acquisition of rivals ACC and Ambuja Cements, making it the second largest player in the industry, also soured the mood for UltraTech. However, ‘buy’ ratings on the stock increased from 38 to 42 in the past one year as the company expands capacity and raw material prices cool off, hinting at a margin expansion this year.

Coming to contrarian downgrades, the stock of state-owned Coal India advanced 52 percent in 2022 but analysts’ optimism reduced. ‘Buy’ calls on the stock went down from 21 to 17. JM Financial, which has a ‘hold’ rating on the scrip, expects e-auction premiums will gradually cool off with easing power demand and moderation in international coal prices.

“E-auction premiums have shot up almost 4x since the introduction of unified e-auction. While near term e-auction prices look strong, we expect the same to soften going into FY24, which will likely put a cap on incremental benefits,” the firm said. It added that pending wage hike negotiations with the employees unions is another key monitorable.

Bajaj Auto was another stock that saw a gain in share price but ‘buy’ calls falling from 39 to 31 in the past one year. According to CLSA, the company’s exports remain under pressure. “Lower export volume assumptions lead to 6-9 percent cuts in FY23-24 earnings. Post-festive season demand and rural recovery are key factors to look out for,” its analysts wrote in a note.

Quarter-on-quarter changes

On a QoQ basis, there was no significant divergence between price action and analyst action. Bharti Airtel saw its ‘buy’ calls reduce to 28 from 30, while the stock gained over 6 percent. Analysts at ICICI Securities feared depleting free cash flow generation on 5G capex and lower likelihood of a tariff hike. This changed quickly as the company has begun hiking its entry-level tariff—beginning from Haryana and Odisha—by as much as 57 percent.

Bharat Petroleum has seen its downgrades increase, from three ‘sell’ calls to six, as analysts believe weaker marketing profitability will likely impact earnings in the near term. Emkay Global has a ‘hold’ call on the counter as it finds the stock expensive on a price-to-book value basis.

Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities

The Nifty made a new all-time high during the day on November 30 as the Nifty bulls remained at the helm during the day. Unlike the preceding two sessions, Nifty moved up smartly on Wednesday's trading.

The momentum oscillator RSI (relative strength index) has given a falling trend line breakout. The crucial short-term moving averages are sitting below the index value, confirming the positive trend.

The trend is likely to remain bullish as long as it remains above 18,600 as the support level shifts higher. On the higher end, resistance is visible at 18,800-19,000.

The Bank Nifty index continued to trade in a narrow range between 43,000 and 43,500 where both the bulls and the bears are sitting on the lines. The undertone remains bullish and one should keep a buy-on-dip approach as long as it maintains the support of 42,800 on the downside.

The index on the upside to resume the momentum must surpass the hurdle of 43,500 on a closing basis.

Here are three buy calls for short term:

Colgate-Palmolive: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,632 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,580 | Target: Rs 1,690-1,710 | Return: 5 percent

Colgate-Palmolive has given a breakout on the daily chart from a falling trend line with a sharp surge in volumes. The MACD (moving average convergence and divergence) indicator has also given a buy crossover on the zero line confirming the buy signal.

After the burden of high energy prices and lower realisations, most major cement companies reported multi-year low margins, in terms of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) per tonne, in the quarter ended September.

Except for ACC, the margin for all cement companies shrank to triple digits per tonne from four figures previously as demand for the building material waned, prices fell, and the cost of inputs including fuel and power climbed. ACC reported a double-digit margin.

The squeeze on margins has been evident over the past few quarters, and the question that analysts are asking is if the worst is now behind for the sector.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

September quarter earnings

The September quarter was a washout for cement companies on all counts even though volume growth may have improved. Most companies reported multi-quarter low margins, muted realisations and escalated cost pressures.

ACC, now part of the Adani Group, reported a 98 percent year-on-year dip in EBITDA/tonne due to higher power and fuel costs and a 2 percent increase in realisations.

Ambuja Cement’s EBITDA/tonne declined 62 percent YoY and 53 percent sequentially.

Shree Cement succumbed to pressure, while Ultratech Cement fared relatively better than its peers.

Dalmia Bharat put up a relatively decent show as far as volumes and realisations were concerned, but reported a decline in unitary EBITDA performance.

Indian cement industry had been expected to report an eight-year low EBITDA/tonne, with the year-on-year decline being the steepest in 10 years, according to a report by Jefferies dated October 7. The actual numbers turned out to be more or less in line with the estimates, except for ACC and Ambuja.

A post-earnings note by Jefferies said EBITDA/tonne was the lowest in almost two decades for ACC and an 18-year low for Ambuja Cement. The margin was a seven-year low for Dalmia Bharat, a six-year low for Shree Cement, and a three-year low for Ultratech Cement, Jefferies said.

Higher energy costs

The cement companies were hurt by the increase in input costs. A sharp rise in prices of pet coke, a by-product of oil refining that is used in cement kilns, and freight costs that escalated due to higher diesel prices weighed on the financials of most cement companies.

Pet coke prices rose as much as 57.8 percent from a year earlier, while diesel prices climbed 1.1 percent, according to a presentation by UltraTech Cement. Sequentially, both diesel and pet coke prices declined.

“We have had significant cost pressures in the recent past due to steep fuel price rise. However, the recent cooling off in energy costs will impact us positively in the coming quarters,” B Sridhar, CEO of ACC, said in its earnings statement.

Peaked out?

Most cement companies expect the second half of FY23 to be better as demand picks up from November as construction resumes after the monsoon and the industry increases prices to ward off cost pressures.

“The July-September quarter was the peak cost and we should start seeing a marginal reduction in our consumption costs in the next two quarters,” Atul Daga, chief financial officer of UltraTech Cement, said on an earnings call. A price hike due to margin pressure is also expected.

“In the next six months, as volumes go up and as the cost of purchase of fuel stabilises, the company’s working capital will go back into the negative working capital zone, before the end of this fiscal year,” Daga added. “There is no reason why the industry will not take prices up since margins are continuously under pressure.”

However, the key question is whether the worst is really behind the industry, which has faced continuous margin erosion.

“Overall operational profitability is set to see a marginal improvement on a sequential basis in the next two quarters on the back of recent price hikes taken over September and October,” Hetal Gandhi, director of research at CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics, told Moneycontrol. “Prices are likely to increase in the near term on the back of a demand uptick post the festive season, along with increased cost pressure.”

However, Gandhi said this would not be enough to cover the increase in power and fuel costs, as thermal coal prices remain high, with International Coal (FOB Australia) crossing $430/tonne in October.

Domestic pet coke prices increased by 15-20 percent in October after cooling in August and September, he said. Thus, although margins are expected to recover marginally on a sequential basis, they are likely to remain well below fiscal 2022 levels, shrinking overall margins by 300-400 basis points for fiscal 2023, he added.

Jefferies, in a report dated November 1, suggested that cement prices increased 2 percent in October on a month-on-month basis, above the Q2 average. Pet coke prices were stable compared to the previous month, it said. South Africa coal prices still remain elevated on a year-on-year basis.

Valuation levels

Even as the Q2 financials of Ambuja Cements and ACC, the two Holcim group companies that Adani acquired, disappointed analysts, both companies commanded a premium over their five-year valuation average.

The premium was the highest for Ambuja Cement, followed by ACC. The valuation premium for Shree Cement disappeared, while UltraTech Cement is at a discount.

Following the acquisitions of ACC and Ambuja, Adani became India’s second-largest cement manufacturer with their combined capacity of 67.5 million tonnes per annum.

“The new combined entity is best placed to play industry fundamentals given its scale and growth optionality along with cost curve placement, which has led to the premium of these cement majors,” said Ritesh Shah, a research head mid-market coverage at Investec Capital Services (India).

Shree Cement’s valuations narrowed due to its declining RoE even as its UAE venture remains a drag. For UltraTech Cement, the multiples stand explained by the reset on lower growth multiple with the entry of Adani in the marketplace, he said.

Investec downgraded Shree Cement to a ‘sell’ rating and prefers large caps – Ambuja Cement and Ultratech Cement – that are aligned with long-term themes of consolidation, sustainability and ESG (environmental, social and governance) norms.",1298,-0.19859041690826415

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

UTCEM reported consol. EBITDA of INR18.7b v/s estimated INR16.8b and EBITDA/t of INR808 v/s estimated INR723, driven by higher ‘other operating income’ (up INR65/t QoQ). Profit was at INR7.6b v/s estimated INR5.9b. The management expects demand to recover post the festive season. Though energy cost has peaked out in 2Q, petcoke price remains volatile and has increased to USD205/t, after declining to USD165-170/t in Aug/Sep’22. UTCEM remains best placed to benefit from demand recovery, helped by its consistent capacity additions plans. Cost-savings initiatives (higher green energy; scope for reducing lead distance, etc.) should help structural cost improvement. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.

Outlook

The stock trades at 14.2x/12.4x FY24E/FY25E EV/EBITDA (v/s its 10-year average one-year forward EV/EBITDA of 15.4x). We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock by valuing it at 15.5x Sep’24E EV/EBITDA (v/s Jun’24 earlier). Our TP of INR7,510 offers an upside of 17% from CMP.

YES Securities' research report on UltraTech Cement

Ultratech Cement (UTCEM) volume dipped sequentially by 8% to 23.1MT (+7% y/y; 24.4MT YSEC est.) while reported strong NSR of Rs6014/te (-1% q/q & +8% y/y) translates in revenue of Rs138.9bn declined by 8% q/q (+16% y/y) in Q2FY23. For the quarter, UTCEM reported lower EBITDA/te of Rs808 due to alleviated cost/te of Rs5206 (+8% q/q & +21% y/y) while strong NSR partially offset it. EBITDA/PAT of Rs18.6/7.5bn in Q2FY23, declined by 40/52% q/q and 31/43% y/y due to alleviated cost coupled muted volumes due to monsoon. H1FY23 EBITDA declined to Rs1,031/te (26% y/y) on account of surge in power cost by +51% y/y causing total cost to go up by +21% y/y. So, we have trimmed our EBITDA & PAT estimate by 13% & 23% for FY23E. In Q2FY23, the company commissioned 1.3MTPA of integrated unit at Dalla (UP) taking the total capacity to ~116MTPA and expected to reach at 154MTPA by FY25E (excl. 5.4MTPA of overseas capacities). Phase-I (remaining 15.4MTPA) & newly announced (22.6MTPA) expansion will aid UTCEM to grow at ~9% CAGR (v/s industry 6% CAGR) over FY23-25E. Additionally, UTCEM is committed to increase its green energy share to 36% (WHRS 28% & RE 8%) by FY25E v/s 19.5% in Q2FY23. As UTCEM to increase its WHRS/RE capacity aggressively in Phase-I expansion to 675MW (302MW WHRS & 373MW RE) by FY24E will improve its efficiency. Further in Phase-II, UTCEM plans to add incremental 50- 60MW to reduce the thermal power dependency to 50% by FY25E v/s 65% in FY22. We expect healthy FCF generation of Rs61bn post CAPEX outlay of Rs132bn over FY23-24E allows further deleveraging.

Outlook

We maintain BUY rating with a TP of Rs8,453, valuing the stock at 16.5x EV/EBITDA on the FY24 estimates.

It is time for rural demand to make a comeback, believes global financial services firm Morgan Stanley. Wider reopening, improving labour market conditions and enhancing terms of trade for the rural sector will aid this recovery, according to the firm.

In a report by Upasana Chachra and Bani Gambhir, the duo note, “Government spending slowing down from peak levels, dislocation of livelihoods due to pandemic disruption, and pick-up in non-food inflation led to a sluggish trend in rural demand.”

Also Read: Soaps are cheaper after price cuts. But what does it say about demand?

However, data now suggests that overall economic activity has been normalising over the past three months after remaining sluggish in the trailing 12 months. “Our consolidated rural activity tracker shows a pickup in YoY terms over the last three to four months,” the research report added.

The improvement has been led by a lower unemployment rate in rural areas, recovering two-wheeler sales, and increasing growth of credit to the agriculture sector.

Morgan Stanley believes not only the cyclical outlook, but also the structural outlook for the rural economy, is constructive.

“Policymakers are taking steps to diversify livelihoods, improve access to basic amenities and improve productivity across the agriculture sector. Progress has already been made in physical infrastructure, connectivity and digital infrastructure,” says the report.

The firm has identified the following stocks as likely to gain from the pick-up in rural growth:

- Bajaj Electricals: Equal-weight

- Mahindra & Mahindra: Overweight

- Maruti Suzuki: Overweight

- Dabur: Equal-weight

- AU Small Finance Bank: Overweight

- Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services: Overweight

2022-10-11 19:49:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/adani-on-the-lookout-for-more-cement-assets-with-an-eye-on-the-no-1-slot-9311981.html,"Billionaire Gautam Adani’s Adani Group is in advanced talks to buy cement units owned by debt-laden Jaiprakash Power Ventures, a media report suggested, potentially heralding another wave of consolidation in the sector.

The deal includes a cement grinding unit and other smaller assets from Jaiprakash Power Ventures Ltd. and Jaiprakash Associates Ltd., for value of around $606 million, or Rs. 5,000 crore, according to a Bloomberg article dated October 10, 2022.

JP Associates’ cement grinding facility in Nigrie, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, began operations in 2014.

The deal, if it goes through, would strengthen Adani Group’s presence in the cement sector. In May, the group acquired Ambuja Cements Ltd. and ACC Ltd. from Switzerland’s Holcim Ltd., becoming India’s second-largest cement maker virtually overnight with an installed production capacity of 67.5 MTPA.

On October 10, Jaypee Group’s listed companies—Jaiprakash Associates and Jaiprakash Power Ventures--informed the stock exchanges that they will divest the cement business.

The companies did not disclose the name of the potential buyer, and the size or value of the stake they plan to divest.

Adani Group and JP Group did not respond to queries from Moneycontrol. This story will be updated as and when they respond.

JP Associates’ assets, valuations

According to the annual report of Jaiprakash Associates, Jaypee Group (including Jaiprakash Power Ventures) at present has an installed cement capacity of 10.55 million tonnes per annum and 339MW of captive power.

More than 50% of Jaypee Group’s cement capacity is located in the central Indian market. Of the total cement capacity, 1.2 MTPA (in South India) is under expansion, although it has been on hold for some time.

This isn’t the first time that Jaiprakash Associates is selling a cement plant. In 2016, Jaypee Cement sold a 21.2 MTPA plant to Ultratech Cement for an Enterprise Value/Tonne (EV/T) of $115.

On the face of it, the deal value of Rs 5,000 crore looks fairly decent if the company’s debt has been taken into consideration, said Ravi Sodah, analyst and senior vice president of Elara Securities.

This would take the EV/T of the deal to $58 per tonne – which is way cheaper than the ACC- Ambuja transaction. Having said that, it remains to be seen if all assets are part of the deal.

Of the total 10.5 MTPA capacity, JP Associates has 1.2 MTPA in Karnataka and 2.2 MTPA in Bhilai, which is a joint venture with Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), and the remaining capacity elsewhere in Central India, Sodah said.​

Adani Group bought the stake in Holcim group companies at an EV/T of $162.7 per tonne.

It would potentially reinforce Adani Group’s exposure to the cement sector in central India in a big way and would not just lead to savings, but also growth.

Ritesh Shah, research analyst at Investec, said: “Acquisition of JP Associates would increase Adani’s exposure from the present 8 percent to 22-23 percent; it would add to company’s capacity in a high yielding market ... and would lead to great savings for the company. Further, if the deal were to fructify, this could also come with growth optionality and tax benefits given the plant of a debt-ridden company would have accumulated losses.”

Adani versus Ultratech Cement

Adani plans to double its cement capacity to 140 million tonnes over the next five years, i.e. by 2027, and become the country's largest cement maker by 2030. It recently completed the acquisition of Holcim's India business to become the second-largest producer in the Indian cement market.

The $10.5 billion Holcim deal put Adani, which has an acquired cement capacity of 67.5 million MTPA, just behind UltraTech in size.

Ultratech Cement has a cement production capacity of about 120 MTPA and is in the midst of an expansion plan that shall be completed by FY23. With a newly announced expansion of 22 million tonnes by FY25, the total capacity is expected to rise to 160 MTPA.

From the above expansion plans, it is clear that even if Adani aims to become the country’s largest cement maker, Ultratech Cement would continue to remain the top producer with 160 MTPA until FY2025, even in absence of any inorganic expansion.

A research analyst at Antique Stock Broking said that merger and acquisition news flow is expected to continue and may even intensify after Ambuja got shareholders’ approval to raise funds worth Rs.20,000 crore.

Cement manufacturers typically keep cash in hand when they are aggressively looking out for acquiring assets. With reports of Adani Group emerging as the potential suitor for Jaiprakash Associates’ assets, the key to its ambition is whether a deal is reached and how soon.

In the high-profile WhatsApp case, Sebi has dismissed insider trading charges against individuals, who circulated alleged unpublished price-sensitive information about the financial results of certain companies, including TCS and Ultratech Cement.

Those individuals are — Shailendra Mehta, Aditya Omprakash Gaggar, Shruti Vishal Vora and Neeraj Kumar Agarwal, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in five separate orders. The latest orders came after the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) had set aside Sebi’s insider trading charges against certain individuals in the WhatsApp leak case in March 2021 and the same was upheld by the Supreme Court on September 26 this year.

The case pertains to the circulation of Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) in various private WhatsApp groups about five companies — Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Ultratech Cement, Bata India, Tata Chemicals and Mindtree — ahead of their official announcements to the stock exchanges.

It was alleged that Mehta circulated UPSI-related financial earnings of Bata India, Ultratech Cement and Mindtree to others through Whatsapp messages. Also, Gaggar and Agarwal were accused of similar violations in the case of Tata Chemicals and TCS, respectively. In addition, Vora allegedly communicated the financial earnings of TCS and Ultratech Cement to others.

It was alleged that these four persons violated Sebi’s regulations that prohibit insider trading activities. Now, in its orders passed on Thursday, Sebi has disposed of insider trading charges against the four individuals.

Dismissing the charges against these four persons, Sebi said the instant case is a replica of the case that was decided by SAT in March 2021 and upheld by the Supreme Court its order passed on September 26, 2022, with the only difference that the circulation of WhatsApp messages pertain to different scrips.

In its order, SAT had noted the definitions of unpublished price sensitive information and insider information and had said that generally, available information would not be a UPSI. It further, said that the information can be branded as a UPSI only when the person getting the information had knowledge that it was a UPSI.

In 2017, some news reports referred to the circulation of UPSI in various private WhatsApp groups about certain companies ahead of their official announcements to the respective stock exchanges.

Against that backdrop, Sebi had initiated a preliminary examination in the matter during which search and seizure operations against 26 entities of a WhatsApp group were conducted, and about 190 devices and records, among others, were seized.

WhatsApp chats extracted from the seized devices were examined further and it was found that earnings data and other financial information of around 12 companies were leaked through WhatsApp messages.",436,-0.9338285028934479

Shree Cement and UltraTech Cement were the top two gainers in the Nifty. Ambuja Cement was among the top five active shares on the NSE with volumes of 25,706,401.

Experts remain of the view that the sector is poised for a re-rating after Adani group’s acquisition of Holcim’s stake in ACC, Ambuja. Morgan Stanley Asia on September 2 bought 9.4 lakh shares of ACC for over Rs 215 crore through an open market transaction. According to bulk deal data available with the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Morgan Stanley Asia (Singapore) Pte purchased 9,41,557 shares of the company.

Reports suggest that cement companies have hiked prices up to Rs 20 per bag in west/east regions for September 2022. The recent price hike comes after fall in cement prices by approximately Rs 40 to 60 per bag since May 2022. It is noteworthy to mention here that domestic petcoke prices have fallen 25% from their peak.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Aditya Saraogi of Birla Corp said, “We have increased prices by Rs 15-20/bag this month and we believe demand will remain robust.” The company is aiming for volume growth of 15% in FY23.

The stocks continue to gain shuddering off the pressure from CCI scanner on cement cartelisation. Investigation conducted by Competition Commission of India has found as many as 20 companies engaged in anti-competitive agreements and price-fixing in the eastern and southern regions of the country.

Sources have told CNBC TV-18 that ACC Limited, UltraTech Cement, Dalmia Cement, Shree Cement, NUVOCO Vistas Corp and Ambuja, along with manufacturers' association have sought more time from CCI to file their reply on alleged cartelisation.

“When elephants fight, the grass gets trampled,” goes the African proverb. That could well describe what is shaping up to be a bruising battle in corporate India. The opening salvo came from first-generation entrepreneur Gautam Adani-led Adani group, which made an open offer to acquire a stake in ACC and Ambuja Cements. This prompted the Kumar Mangalam Birla-led UltraTech Cement, part of one of India’s oldest conglomerates, the Aditya Birla Group, to announce an aggressive expansion plan. As the two industry majors gird for the fight, Shree Cement, currently the third largest player in the market, is planning its strategy on the side-lines to fight for its turf.

Shree Cement managing director HM Bangur, in an interview with Moneycontrol after reporting earnings on July 29, said, that the company wouldn’t change its strategy “for a new entrant and other companies’ expansion plans but is open for inorganic expansion and could take over a capacity of around 10 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) with a cash pile of Rs 5,000 crore and acquire some debt on books”.

This would be a break from the past, at least as far as the company’s record in India is concerned.

Rakesh Arora, managing partner, Go India Advisors, said, “Though Shree Cement has acquired a company in UAE, inorganic expansion isn’t in the company’s DNA, and with the current situation it (the company) would have a hard time clinching any asset which is available for acquisition as its race would be against the Adanis and Birlas.”

In a July 29 report, Macquarie Research said that it expects Shree Cements to see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6-7 percent in its capacity over FY22-25E to 56 mt even as the company targets to increase capacity to 80 mt by FY30.

Geography for likely acquisition:Shree Cement is a north India-focused company. Bangur told Moneycontrol that he would prefer new capacity in central and south India. He added that the company will look more aggressively at central India due to major expansions and challenges in the south. It pegged the replacement cost or the enterprise value (EV) per tonne at $120 for potential acquisition in central India. EV/tonne is how cement companies are conventionally valued. This suggests roughly how much it would take for someone to set up a tonne of cement capacity.

Though the managing director declined to name potential candidates, saying the hunt for a target is still at an early stage, he added that “substantial” progress has been made. Going by his criteria, Moneycontrol has curated a list of capacities available in central and south India with a capacity of more or around 10 mtpa.

Can India Cements be a potential candidate?

Media reports have suggested Chennai-based India Cements as the potential takeover candidate, but Bangur in an interview to CNBC TV18 on August 4 denied the possibility of any hostile takeover. Despite his denial at this stage, experts tracking the sector are still evaluating a potential takeover.

Moneycontrol reached out to both Shree Cement and India Cements for a response through an email query. Shree Cement declined to talk specifically about any company, while India Cements denied speculations over a potential takeover.

Then why is the market still speculating on a possibility of India Cement emerging as a potential acquisition target?

India Cements, headed by former International Cricket Council chairman N. Srinivasan, has a capacity of over 15 mt. It has eight integrated cement plants in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan, and two grinding units, one each in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, according to the company’s website.

There has been speculation about India Cements being a takeover target for close to two years, which has been denied by the management. A Bloomberg report dated June 17, 2020, suggested the possibility of billionaire Radhakishnan Damani considering an acquisition of a controlling stake in India Cements. Subsequently, Damani increased his stake in India Cements, adding fuel to fire. (Add hyperlink: https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rk-damani-increases-stake-in-india-cements-to-22-76-7850821.html)

If Shree Cement were to acquire India Cements, this would lead to geographical diversification given that the former has a predominant presence in the north and India Cements is essentially a south-focused company.

According to an analyst, who asked not to be identified, this move may lead to further consolidation in the industry as a big player will integrate a small player. It will be a win-win situation for both since India Cements’ profits have been the lowest in the industry for the last three quarters, which can be improved drastically, while Shree Cement will have access to southern markers and would be able to fight for market share. The analyst added that Shree Cement has enough cash on its books to take over India Cements’ debt but may refrain from outbidding peers for acquisition.

Cement sector buzzing with M&A activity

UltraTech Cement thus far has been a torchbearer in terms of inorganic expansion. But the biggest acquisition in terms of capacity so far has been done by the Adani group, which has disrupted the dynamic of the entire industry and triggered a market share war among the top players.

UltraTech Cement's capacity will grow to 159 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), post the completion of the latest round of expansion, Kumar Mangalam Birla said on August 17.

UltraTech's fresh capital expenditure plan is backed by a strong conviction on India’s growth potential as well as a deep and nuanced understanding of the market dynamics of the cement industry, Birla said, in his keynote address at the company's annual general meeting.

Notably, the company has grown significantly increased capacity over the last five years from 69.6 mtpa to 119.9 mtpa and is the one cement company to mark Rs 50, 000 crore revenue milestone.

""Upon completion of the latest round of expansion, the company’s capacity will grow to 159.25 mtpa, reinforcing its position as the third largest cement company in the world, outside of China"", he said.

View on Economic Recovery In India:

Birla also noted that the economic recovery cycle in India ""remains firmly in place"", due to the significant progress in vaccination and the upswing in public capital expenditure.

Pointing towards the surge in inflation globally, the veteran industrialist said that the situation is not as adverse in India as in some of the other leading economies.

While India’s inflation rate has been above the RBI’s tolerance range for the past seven months, ""the overshoot has not been as severe as in many other countries"", the Aditya Birla Group chairperson said.

Dynamism in India’s digital ecosystem, diversification of global supply chains away from China and greater emphasis of investors on sustainable finance offer new opportunities for India, Birla added.

Addresses Concerns Around Cost Inflation:

Mangalam Birla highlighted that businesses will need to remain on guard regarding financial market volatility and cost pressures this year. Acknowledging the macro situation, he said, “There have been two major fallouts of the current global crisis. One is the tightness in energy markets and concerns around the energy security of some regions which has had indirect implications for many economies. Secondly, elevated energy prices have spurred a chain reaction, fuelling the existing inflationary impulses. This has triggered central banks to normalise monetary policy faster than anticipated, denting consumer confidence and dampening risk sentiment in the financial markets”, he added.",372,0.5000296011567116

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement (UTCEM) is the largest cement manufacturer in India with domestic grey cement capacity of 114.6mtpa (consolidated grey cement capacity of 120mtpa) as of FY22. It is also engaged in white cement, wall care putty and RMC business segments. In this note, we analyze UTCEM’s FY22 Annual Report (AR). The key highlights are as follows: a) commissioned grey cement capacity of 3.2mtpa in Central and East India in FY22, as a part of its phase I expansion plan of 19.5mtpa (to be completed by FY23-end); b) announced phase II expansion plan of 22.6mtpa at an estimated capex of INR129b; c) scaled up investments in renewable energy; and d) prepared sustainability strategy and targets. The management highlighted that Indian cement industry will add 80- 100mtpa capacity by FY25E, driven by increased spending on housing and infrastructure. Given the company’s large scale, UTCEM is well positioned to meet the growing cement demand in the country.

Outlook

UTCEM trades at 18.1x/14.9x FY23/24E EV/EBITDA and EV/t of USD186/USD183 in FY23/24E, respectively. The stock has traded at an average 1-year forward EV/EBITDA of 15.4x in the last 10/five years. We value it at 16x Jun’24E EV/EBITDA (v/s Mar’24 earlier) to arrive at our TP of INR7,515 and maintain our Buy rating on the stock.

Swiss giant Holcim's India units and more than a dozen other cement manufacturers colluded to raise prices and restrict supplies for years, which included regularly inspecting one another to ensure there was no breach of the agreements, according to a federal antitrust probe.

The investigations arm of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has held top leadership – CEOs or Managing Directors – of Holcim units ACC and Ambuja, market leader UltraTech and 17 other firms such as Shree Cement and Dalmia Cement liable for antitrust violations.

The investigation report, issued last month and seen by Reuters, is the penultimate but most significant stage of the CCI probe that started in 2019. The report, which is not public, will now be reviewed by CCI's top three officials who have powers to impose fines and will give companies a last chance to defend themselves.

Potentially, the cement giants could be fined millions of dollars. Together, the 20 companies control more than three-quarters of the over 500 million tonne installed cement capacity in India, the world's second-largest producer after China.

The report said executives of the companies discussed coordinated price hikes in Zoom calls and in-person meetings at company guest houses, with some officials using personal mail to communicate with rivals. WhatsApp messaging was also extensively used.

One company official's WhatsApp message cited in the report said a ""forum"" of companies had agreed to gradually raise cement prices in some regions by 5-10 rupees (6-12 U.S. cents). Senior executives, including from Holcim's ACC and UltraTech, were assigned as the ""coordinator"" for various states.

""Price will go up in each week by equal amount,"" the message said.

The message did not give details but typically, cement is sold in 50 kg (110 lb) bags to retail consumers, and the cost is between 350-450 rupees ($4-$6) per bag depending on the location and grade of cement.

CCI did not respond to a request for comment.

Holcim said in a statement that ""the Indian companies are managing this matter responsibly and we expect them to continue to do so accordingly.""

ACC, Ambuja and UltraTech Cement declined to comment, while Shree Cement and Dalmia Cement did not respond.

India's Adani Group, which entered into a proposed $10.5 billion deal with Holcim in May to acquire its India businesses, also did not respond.

SYSTEMATIC 'CARTELISATION'

Cement production is a lucrative business in India's booming economy, with high demand especially from rural housing and infrastructure firms.

An official at the Pavers and Blocks Manufacturers Association, whose members sell concrete paving blocks, told Reuters price hikes by cement companies in recent years were coordinated, leaving no scope for cutting costs by switching suppliers.

""We sometimes pass the higher cost to consumers,"" said the official, who declined to be named since he does business with the cement companies amounting to 50,000 bags a month and was concerned about reprisals.

Overall, the CCI investigation report concluded the cement companies colluded in 13 states in eastern and southern India, with more than 50 industry executives involved in ""cartelisation"" activities in an ""extremely organised manner"".

The CCI report said the Cement Manufacturers Association, an industry body, ""facilitated and penetrated the anti-competitive conduct in the cartel"" by collating and sharing pricing details among companies. The group did not respond to Reuters queries.

Cement companies have been accused of price-fixing for over a decade. In 2016, the CCI imposed a $800 million fine on 10 companies for fixing prices, including the Holcim units and UltraTech, but the decision has been challenged since then at the Supreme Court.

In the 2016 ruling, the CCI had said the manufacturers association helped companies collude, and ordered it to ""disengage and disassociate itself from collecting"" prices or production-related details.

Although cement prices vary across India, CCI's report showed they moved in the same direction.

In Kolkata and Patna in eastern India, for example, cement bag rates fell for several months until January 2021 to reach 300 rupees and 350 rupees, respectively. Then, they rose in tandem over four months to touch 360 rupees in Kolkata and 390 rupees in Patna, before easing again, CCI said.

'KILN CLOSURE' SYSTEM

In southern India, UltraTech and many other smaller companies controlled cement output and supplies through informal ""kiln closure"" agreements in a mutually agreed schedule, the report said.

The aim, CCI said, was to coordinate output, restrict cement supplies and increase prices.

To ensure compliance with the informal arrangement, a verification system was designed, the report said. Investigators found a sheet listing company names and their plant locations, and assigning a rival firm to visit and verify production halts, it said.

The sheet noted that the visiting ""guest"" company's team should be provided with a four-wheeled vehicle and a driver during inspections, which must be held at least twice a week.

The ""host"" company – the one being inspected – should ""provide in person access to all guests to all kiln platforms"", the sheet stated.

""The evidence reaffirms the fact that an elaborate mechanism was developed by the cartel to verify and report 'kiln' running/closure…as per the understanding reached,"" the CCI report said.

'CLEAR EVIDENCE'

The CCI report said cement executives decided on price increase plans down to the district level of each state, splitting companies into categories like ""Group A"" for large firms, and recommending lower prices for ""Group B"" smaller peers.

The report contained a price chart which it said was shared in January 2020 by Holcim unit ACC's Shailesh Ambastha, a sales and marketing director. It detailed current and target ""Group B"" prices for 42 districts in the eastern state of Bihar.

The report said ""charts having agreed state-wise prices were circulated by Ambastha to competitors and meetings were held to guide the officials in its implementation.""

CCI said Ambastha wrote in one message: ""Try to be 10 plus from your current level. This is what all are attempting"".

In another, he wrote: ""Why are you supplying in non-trade (segment) at 220 when all are supplying at 230.""

Presented with evidence, the CCI report said Ambastha ""submitted evasive replies"" by saying he did not recall the communication. Ambastha did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters.

Some executives like Anil Kaushik, a joint vice president for marketing at Shree Cement ""confessed"", according to the report, admitting during questioning to sharing pricing data with a rival for ""mutual benefit."" Kaushik declined to comment to Reuters.

But the report said he told investigators: ""In the cement sector, no company can increase the prices in isolation and survive.""",1088,0.017044156789779663

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

UTCEM beat the street and our EBITDA estimate, led by higher sales volumes and better cost management (standalone variable cost increased by INR135/t v/s our estimate of INR210/t). Consolidated EBITDA stood at INR31b (v/s Bloomberg/our estimate of INR25.7-28b/INR28b). OPM stood at 20.4% (est. 19.2%). Adjusted PAT stood at INR16b (est. INR14b). Given the better demand scenario, the management remained optimistic about the industry’s long-term growth prospects. Though there could be a fall in margin in 2Q due to lower cement prices (Jun-exit price down 3-5% v/s 1QFY23 average) and cost inflation (full impact of higher energy prices), we expect margin to gradually recover from 3QFY23. We raise our FY23/FY24 EBITDA/EPS estimate by 6-7%/8-9%. The management aims to achieve a capacity of 200mtpa by FY29-30 (v/s its earlier plans of achieving a capacity of 160mtpa by FY23E). We maintain our Buy rating on the stock.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating, valuing the stock at 16x FY24E EV/EBITDA (v/s 15x earlier). We raise our FY23/FY24 EPS by 8%/9% given its strong 1QFY23 performance. Our TP of INR7,210 offers an upside of 12% from its CMP.

YES Securities' research report on UltraTech Cement

Ultratech cement (UTCEM) reported EBITDA/te of Rs1236, beat YSEC est. by +14% driven by the All-time high NSR of Rs6056/te (+10% y/y & +6% q/q) mitigated the inflated total cost/te of Rs4820 (+22% y/y & 5% q/q) in Q1FY23. Console volume softened sequentially by 10% q/q to 25MT (+16% y/y) v/s YSEC est. of 26.5MT translates in revenues of Rs151.6bn declined by 4% q/q (+28% y/y). UTCEM’s EBITDA stood flat sequentially (-6% y/y), while PAT decline by 36% q/q (-7% y/y) as reported higher PAT in Q4FY22 due to tax reversal. Historically in last 5years, UTCEM outgrown at ~12% CAGR (v/s industry at ~5% CAGR) and considering the ongoing (19.9MTPA) & newly announced (22.6MTPA) expansion, UTCEM will continue to outgrow at ~9% CAGR (v/s the industry ~6% CAGR) over next 3years. Additionally, UTCEM is committed to increase its green energy share to 36% (WHRS 28% & RE 8%) by FY25E v/s 18% in FY22. Given that UTCEM rigorously increasing its WHRS/RE capacity to 675MW (302MW WHRS & 373MW RE) by FY24E will improve its efficiency. Furthermore, UTCEM plans to add additional 50- 60MW in upcoming phase-II expansion to reduce the thermal power dependency to 50% by FY25E v/s 65% in FY22. Over healthy operating profit, we expect a free cash flow generation of Rs73bn post CAPEX outlay of Rs132bn over FY23-24E tends to deleverage the B/S further. At CMP stock trades at 17/13x of EV/EBITDA on FY23/24E.

Outlook

We retain our BUY recommendation with a TP of Rs8,495 (earlier Rs8670), valuing the stock at 16.5x EV/EBITDA on the FY24E.

More importantly, margins exhibited resilience in a challenging cost environment.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

UTCEM reported Q1FY23 earnings in line with our estimates. However, it came significantly ahead of consensus estimates (CE) by 16%. EBITDA declined 8% YoY (flat QoQ) to Rs30.1bn (PLe: Rs30.1bn). In line with fall in EBITDA, PAT declined 7% YoY to Rs15.6bn (PLe: Rs15.5bn) Undoubtedly, competition intensity would intensify with entry of Adani group through acquisition of Ambuja cement as it would aggressively focus on adding capacity and exploit levers for expanding profitability. Market is overly concerned about the sector as a result of aggressive line-up of capacity addition by UTCEM, ignoring the expensive valuations paid by Adani and the industry’s highly competitive operations. UTCEM’s consistent industry leading performance on both volume growth and margins vindicates its strong business model.

Outlook

Led by market leading position (20%+ market share), strong B/S (Net debt/EBITDA at 0.5x) and efficient operations, we maintain ACCUMULATE rating with TP of Rs7,180 with EV/EBITDA of 15.0x FY24e.

“After a strong end to FY22, cement demand was impacted by overall inflationary trends and lower labour availability in May 2022, however, cement demand picked up in June 2022 on pre-monsoon construction activity”, the company said in its earnings release.

“While headwinds arising out of rising cost pressure could put some pressure on the profitability of cement companies, the strong momentum in housing and given the governments thrust on infrastructure and industrial development, the cement industry in India is set to see an upswing in demand in FY23,” the company said in its earnings release.

Here's how global brokerages reacted post the Q1 earnings:

Goldman Sachs

The research firm has a buy call on the stock with target at Rs 7,040 per share, an upside of 12 percent from current market price. The research firm is of the view that the results highlight its dominant market position adding that capacity expansion plans provide comfort on its ability to maintain market share.

CLSA

The global research firm has downgraded the stock to outperform from buy with target at Rs 7,365 per share, an upside of 17 percent from current market price. The research firm believes that Q1 was above estimates, with capex plans on the track adding that profitability rose contrary to expectations. It expects portability to soften meaningfully in Q2 and forecasts FY23/FY24 EBITDA per tonne of Rs 1,055/ Rs 1,403.

Jefferies

The brokerage firm has a buy call on the stock with target at Rs 6,760 per share, an upside of around 7 percent from current level. ""The cement maker reported EBITDA beat for Q1, driven by better realisation and higher revenue management cycle. FY23 expansions remain on track with quarter performance and expansion outlook reinforcing its market position,"" it said.

Citi

Citi has a buy rating on UltraTech with target at Rs 7,100 per share. ""Q1 surprised positively on prices while industry pricing trends should remain muted. Strong volumes, EBITDA focus augur well,"" it said.

UBS

The brokerage firm has a buy call with target at Rs 8,145 per share, an upside of over 29 percent from current market price. ""The outlook on demand growth remains positive while cost environment continues to remain challenging,"" it said.

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

Earnings for UTCEM as well as the Cement sector is expected to remain under pressure in 1HFY23 and lower than our earlier estimate due to: 1) sustained cost pressures (we expect a INR300-350/t increase in energy costs in 1HFY23), 2) recent decline in Cement prices, which came under pressure in Jun'22, 3) lower than our estimated growth in Cement demand in 1QFY23, and 4) tendency to increase capacities by different players (UTCEM and SRCM recently announced capacity expansions). Earnings recovery for UTCEM in FY21 and 1HY22 was driven by fixed cost controls as well as a better pricing scenario. Improvement in the pricing scenario in FY20/FY21 was led by lower industry clinker capacity additions over FY16-22 (a CAGR of 2.9% v/s 7.7% CAGR over FY10-16). Going forward, clinker capacity addition is estimated to be at 5% CAGR till FY25E, with higher capacities expected in Central and East India. This may put pressure on pricing power and profitability for the industry. Apart from the announced capacity additions, few other players may tend to announce new capacities. We understand through media articles that the Adani group, the new entrant (after the acquisition of Holcim's stake in ACC/ACEM gets completed) in the industry, aims at achieving a capacity of 140mtpa over the next five years (v/s its current capacity of 68mtpa).



Outlook

The stock trades at 16.3x/13.6x FY23E/FY24E EV/EBITDA (v/s its 10-years' one-year average EV/EBITDA of 15x). We have revised our TP to INR6,450 per share (from INR7,825 earlier), based on 15x FY24E EV/EBITDA. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock.

nse live Volume Todays L/H More ×

India's biggest cement producer, UltraTech Cement, is importing a cargo of Russian coal and paying using Chinese yuan, according to an Indian customs document reviewed by Reuters, a rare payment method that traders say could become more common.

UltraTech is bringing in 157,000 tonnes of coal from Russian producer SUEK that loaded on the bulk carrier MV Mangas from the Russian Far East port of Vanino, the document showed. It cites an invoice dated June 5 that values the cargo at 172,652,900 yuan ($25.81 million).

Two trade sources familiar with the matter said the cargo's sale was arranged by SUEK's Dubai-based unit, adding that other companies have also placed orders for Russian coal using yuan payments.

The increasing use of the yuan to settle payments could help insulate Moscow from the effects of western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and bolster Beijing's push to further internationalise the currency and chip away at the dominance of the U.S. dollar in global trade.

The sources declined to be identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media. UltraTech and SUEK did not respond to a request seeking comment.

""This move is significant. I have never heard any Indian entity paying in yuan for international trade in the last 25 years of my career. This is basically circumventing the USD (U.S. dollar),"" a Singapore-based currency trader said.

The sale highlights how India has maintained trade ties with Russia for commodities such as oil and coal despite the western sanctions. India has longstanding political and security ties with Russia and has refrained from condemning the attack in Ukraine, which Russia says is a ""special military operation"".

It was not immediately clear which bank opened a letter of credit for UltraTech and how the transaction with SUEK was executed. SUEK did not respond to a request seeking comment.

The Mangas is currently at anchor near the Indian port of Kandla, according to ship-tracking data on Refinitiv Eikon.

INDIA-CHINA-RUSSIA TRADE

India has explored setting up a rupee payment mechanism for trade with Russia, but that has not materialized. Chinese businesses have used the yuan in trade settlements with Russia for years.

For Indian trade settlements using the yuan, lenders would potentially have to send dollars to branches in China or Hong Kong, or Chinese banks they have tie-ups with, in exchange for yuan to settle the trade, two senior Indian bankers said.

""If the rupee-yuan-rouble route turns out to be favourable, the businesses have every reason and incentive to switch over. This is likely to happen more,"" said Subash Chandra Garg, a former economic affairs secretary at India's finance ministry.

India's bilateral trade with China, for which companies largely pay in dollars, has flourished even after a deadly military clash between the two in 2020, though New Delhi has increased scrutiny on Chinese investments and imports, and banned some mobile apps over security concerns.

An Indian government official familiar with the matter said the government was aware of payments in yuan.

""The use of the yuan to settle payments for imports from countries other than China was rare until now, and could increase due to sanctions on Russia,"" the official said.

India's energy imports from Russia have spiked in the recent weeks as traders have offered steep discounts, Reuters reported this month. New Delhi defends its purchases of Russian goods saying a sudden halt would inflate prices and hurt consumers.

Business units of Russian coal traders in Dubai have become active hubs for facilitating deals with India in the recent weeks, as Singapore has grown wary of provoking western nations that invoked sanctions against Russia, said multiple coal traders based in Russia, Singapore, India and Dubai.

Soon after billionaire Gautam Adani announced his $10.6- billion acquisition of India’s second-biggest cement business from Holcim Group of Swizerland last month, UltraTech Cement announced a mega investment plan to scale up capacity and signalled that it will aggressively protect its market leadership.

The entry of an aggressive new player will not just put pressure on small cement manufacturers, but will also turn up the heat on the big boys as they seek to protect their market share. As a new order emerges, the scale ambitions of the bigger players could potentially lead to price wars and put pressure on margins over the next two-three years as new capacities become operational.

Cement makers could be in a tricky situation because if they aspire for stable pricing and healthy margins, they may lose market share or be forced to revisit growth plans.

“Adani has acquired an established business so an immediate price war is unlikely. However, the larger players will aggressively add capacity over the next few years,” Snehdeep Bohra, Director of Corporate Ratings, Fitch Ratings, told Moneycontrol.

“This will have two implications, one the consolidation in the industry will rise further and that means the smaller players will be at a disadvantage. Secondly, as the top five add capacity, they would fight for volume which could have an impact on their pricing power and margin,” he added.

Game on

The Aditya Birla group lost the race to acquire Holcim’s Indian cement business to the Adani Group but it soon announced that its flagship UltraTech Cement will spend Rs 12,866 crore in adding 22.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of capacity to its current capacity of 119.95 mtpa. This comes on the back of an expansion drive that saw UltraTech double its capacity in the last five years.

The Adani Group too is gearing up to double the newly acquired capacity of Ambuja-ACC from Holcim to 140 million tonnes over 5 years.

JSW Cement, which was also a suitor for Holcim’s India assets, also aims to increase its capacity to 25 mtpa over the next two years from 14 mtpa.

Others too are scaling up, hoping to tap the opportunity arising out of the government’s infrastructure push and a pick-up in housing construction. Dalmia Bharat aims to scale up capacity to 48.5 mtpa by 2024 and to 130 mtpa by 2030, from 35.9 mtpa now.

Shree Cement is in the process of expanding to 80 mtpa by 2030 from around 50 mtpa now.

Analysts tracking the sector say the capacity addition may lead to a glut as its hinges on hopes of accelerated growth in construction. Around 70-80% of the additional capacity in the next 3-5 years will be by the top five cement makers, putting the smaller and marginal players at a disadvantage.

The bigger entities will have more pricing power and may be able to leverage on their brands better, analysts said.

“The risk of incumbents announcing aggressive capacity addition plans to maintain their capacity share would eventually weigh on sector profitability and return ratios…In the near term (over FY22-24), we expect the pace of capacity additions to equate the demand growth (at around 8%) and thus see no pressure on industry utilisation (around 65%); however, capacity additions can outpace demand growth post FY24,” Devesh Agarwal of IIFL Securities wrote in a note.

In the past, when industry capacity utilisation declined from nearly 100% in FY08 to 64% in FY17, the return on equity declined from highs of 20-25% to 8-10%. Investors’ concern is evident in the correction of cement stocks.

Price challenge

Even if the cement heavyweights just want to maintain market share by scaling up, they may have to take a hit on prices What will make it more challenging is that they have not been able to increase prices to absorb inflationary pressure from higher input costs.

Rating agency ICRA said in a note on June 15 that while cement production in FY2022 was higher by 21% year-on-year and by 8% over the pre-COVID level of FY2020, the high input costs resulted in a decline in operating margins by around 390 basis points in FY2022.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Global securities firm Investec has turned bearish on almost the entire cement block, barring a couple of exceptions. The brokerage conducted pan-India cement dealer checks for May and concluded that cement mills attempted a price increase in the first week of May 2022 but were compelled to roll it back on slack demand.

In fact, the persistent weak demand into the month led to the mills rolling back price hikes initiated in April 2022, with prices declining upto Rs35/bag month-on-month. To factor in the sticky cost inflation and inadequate price hikes, Investec trimmed earning expectations and reduced target prices across its coverage universe by up to 38 percent.

“Most new capacity addition over the next 3-4 years is likely to be back-loaded, and that’s when there could be a potential glut. It remains to be seen if the demand will rise at a rate that it absorbs this capacity. My view is that there will be a mid- to high single-digit kind of demand growth,” Bohra of Fitch said.

The operating margins declined by around 390 bps to 20.8% in FY2022, noted Anupama Reddy, Vice President and Sector Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.

“The input costs are likely to remain elevated in the near term, and are expected to exert pressure on operating margins, resulting in a further decline by 440-490 basis points in FY2023,” said Anupama Reddy, Vice President and Sector Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA.",968,-0.28891149163246155

The Adani Group’s entry has fundamentally altered the cement industry structure. After the global financial crisis, building material companies were saddled with high debt on balance sheets. Their subsidiaries, including in India, had only one mandate—large dividends that could be deployed by the parent companies to reduce debt. This capital allocation decision led to market share loss over the past decade for multinational cement companies in India.

The combined market share of Ambuja, ACC and Heidelberg dropped from 24 percent in FY07 to 17 percent in FY22. Domestic players like Jaypee, UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement and a few other regional players capitalised on this, growing capacities/volumes faster than the industry.

After UltraTech's acquisition of Jaypee’s assets, the industry will undergo yet another tectonic shift following the sale of Holcim India assets to billionaire Gautam Adani’s group.

Optically while the change of hands will see one over-leveraged player making way for another, we believe it's unlikely Adani would cede market share to UltraTech and Shree Cement.

Cement industry valuations were factoring > 40 percent combined share for UltraTech and Shree Cement over the next 10 years, this appears to be a tough task for the two.

Adani will take market share, not just from smaller players, but also from UltraTech and Shree. The group's position in logistics (ports, railways and containers), power and fly ash could prove to be a competitive advantage. There is a risk for the industry that the Adani group passes cost savings to customers to capture market share.

Capacity growth expanding

UltraTech's 22-23 million tonnes (MT) capacity expansion shouldn't come as surprise. It was reaching a net-cash balance sheet and we believe there were no viable capital deployment alternatives.

This capex will lower UltraTech’s expected return on capital employed (ROCE) trajectory by 100bps through FY24. UltraTech is growing capacity at 10 percent CAGR through FY25, above industry volume growth.

The expansion will limit industry clinker utilisation to 70 percent through FY25. We are already seeing cement capacity increasing at 6 percent CAGR through FY25, against a 5 percent CAGR in the last three, excluding capacity expansions outlined by Adani. In addition to Adani, other players, too, may announce expansion plans as well.

Will elevated energy prices keep EBITDA lower?

The energy sector has de-coupled from the larger commodities universe in this commodity downturn. Despite Chinese lockdowns and a stronger US dollar index, energy prices have remained elevated—supported by supply disruptions.

Larger commodities universe, including energy, saw muted capex over the past few years as companies allocated incremental capital towards capital returns, not capacity expansions. That stance hasn't changed despite record-high energy prices sustaining for some quarters now.

Would a global recession trigger an oil price collapse like the one in the 1980s? That's a possibility. But higher supplies from the Commonwealth of Independent States as well as West Asia and global energy conservation (similar to the 1980s) will be required, in addition to a global recession, to engineer a significant moderation in energy prices.

Even if there is a cyclical correction in energy prices, underinvestment could ensure structurally energy prices remain elevated versus historical levels.

Despite supposed price inelasticity for cement and its relatively low share in overall construction cost, companies have had to absorb some of the fuel cost increase.

The government's stance on inflation control has also limited the industry's ability to pass on the entire fuel cost increase and so has the steep increase in rebar prices (also supported by energy).

Even if energy prices moderate, would cement companies be able to retain some of that margin support given the government’s stance on inflation? Elevated energy and rebar prices could also be a structural headwind for cement margins.

The de-rating argument

Cyclically, cement company valuations have bottomed out at near current levels in the past six-seven years but there is no visibility for cement margins to improve in the near term.

Normally lower profitability, especially in the face of an increase in capital cost, leads to industry capital discipline, which ultimately triggers margin recovery later but that’s not what we are seeing today.

Shree and UltraTech Cement are unlikely to replicate what they achieved over the past decade, which itself calls for de-rating. The only plausible way these stocks can avoid de-rating is if margins structurally increase upon Adani's entry—the industry becomes an oligopoly—but that appears unlikely at this point.

Joining the bandwagon is global brokerage Investec which has turned bearish on almost the entire cement block, barring a couple of exceptions.

“Similar to economics’ impossible trinity, capital allocation in the cement sector also confronts a trilemma on market share, profitability, and valuation chase (read: EV/t),” Ritesh Shah of Investec said in a note earlier this week.

He referred to the recent acquisition of Holcim India’s assets by Adani Group, UltraTech Cement’s expansion plans and inadequate price hikes by cement companies given sharp rise in input costs.

Investec downgraded Ramco Cement, Shree Cement, Prism Johnson, Star Cement, JK Lakshmi Cement, JK Cement to ‘sell’ and HeidelbergCement to ‘hold’. The broker has trimmed FY23/24 EBITDA estimates by up to 40 percent.

It added that it favours large caps Ambuja Cements and Ultratech Cement – preferring the former to the latter – as they align to long-term themes of consolidation, sustainability and ESG (environmental, social and governance).

Shah sees some insanity in the cement sector, punctuated by some sensible decisions.

“With Adani’s cement venture (well placed on cost, growth optionality), their past track record on market share versus industry margins offers hope for sanity on industry pricing/margins; however, reflecting on scale ambitions of peer set, we see this as a low probability event,” he said.

“Alternatively, assuming industry pricing/margins stay healthy, it would imply several mills would need to cede market share or promoters would need to recalibrate their growth aspirations, a Catch-22 situation in our view.”

Facing the above dilemma, investors have kept themselves away from the cement sector in recent months. In the current calendar year, cement stocks have fallen up to 45 per cent with the biggest losers being Andhra Cement, Nuvoco Vistas, Ramco Cements, JK Cement, and Sagar Cement.

Interestingly, in the same period, lesser known names like Barak Valley Cements, Shiva Cement, and Shri Keshav Cements & Infra are up to 73 per cent. ACC and Ambuja Cement are flat with a negative tilt.

Shah, cutting earnings estimates and target multiples, said he expects the Street to follow and cut estimates as well. Many other analysts have also started taking a cautious view on cement but some see a beacon of light amid the chaos.

For instance, earlier this week, ICICI Securities released an extremely bullish commentary on JK Cement envisioning a nearly 50 per cent potential upside.",403,-0.4248811517442976

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

Ultratech announced a capex of Rs. 12,886 crore to add 22.6 mtpa by FY2025 in addition to its ongoing expansion of 16.3 mtpa additions by FY2023. It is likely to increase its capacity share led by expedited capacity additions. Similar aggression seen in terms of capacity additions by other three large players may lead to lower operational profitability for industry if demand is unable to keep pace with supply and energy costs do not normalize materially. UltraTech’s strengthened balance sheet is unlikely to get stretched although its target of achieving net surplus position would get delayed to post FY2025.



Outlook

We maintain a Buy on UltraTech with a revised PT of Rs. 7,100, given a downward revision in valuation multiples to factor in the risk on operational profitability led by aggressive expansions by large players including UltraTech.

The Adani Group said on May 15 that it has entered into definitive agreements to acquire Swiss cement major Holcim Ltd.’s businesses in India - Ambuja Cements and ACC Ltd, in a deal that propels the infrastructure conglomerate helmed by billionaire Gautam Adani as the second-largest cement maker in the country.

The deal, which will take place through an offshore special purpose vehicle, values the Holcim stake and open offer consideration for Ambuja Cements and ACC at about $10.5 billion, making this the largest ever acquisition by Adani, and India’s largest ever M&A transaction in the infrastructure and materials space, according to a company statement.

With this, Adani now becomes India’s second largest cement manufacturer with a capacity of about 70 Metric Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA), the statement added.

Holcim, through its subsidiaries, holds 63.19 percent in Ambuja Cements and 54.53 percent in ACC (of which 50.05 percent is held through Ambuja Cements).

The open offer price per share for Ambuja Cements will be Rs 385 while that of ACC will be at Rs 2,300, according to a stock exchange filing.

Earlier today, Moneycontrol reported citing multiple sources familiar with the situation, that the board of Holcim, the world’s largest cement maker, is likely to soon take a final call on the sale of its India business, in a mega transaction which would mark one of the biggest exits by an MNC in India. Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Group and Aditya Birla Group, which owns India’s largest cement company UltraTech, were also among potential bidders, according to recent media reports.

""Our move into the cement business is yet another validation of our belief in our nation's growth story,” Adani Group’s Chairman Gautam Adani said in the statement. ""Not only is India expected to remain one of the world's largest demand-driven economies for several decades, India also continues to be the world's second largest cement market and yet has less than half of the global average per capita cement consumption. In statistical comparison, China’s cement consumption is over 7x that of India’s. When these factors are combined with the several adjacencies of our existing businesses that include the Adani Group's ports and logistics business, energy business, and real estate business, we believe that we will be able to build a uniquely integrated and differentiated business model and set ourselves up for significant capacity expansion.”



Our belief in the India story is unshakeable. Combining @Holcim's cement assets in India with our green energy and logistics will make us the world's greenest cement company. Jan Jenisch has been terrific to work with. We welcome the @AmbujaCementACL & @ACCLimited teams. pic.twitter.com/iThyLp92iV

Ambuja Cements and ACC are two of the strongest brands recognized across India, the chairman added.

“When augmented with our renewable power generation footprint, we gain a big headstart in the decarbonization journey that is a must for cement production. This combination of all our capabilities makes me confident that we will be able to establish the cleanest and most sustainable cement manufacturing processes that will meet or exceed global benchmarks,” he said.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Ultratech Cement

Consolidated EBITDA declined 17% YoY/increased 27% QoQ to Rs30.7bn in Q4FY22, broadly in line with our and consensus estimates, as marginally higher-than-expected cost/ton was offset by better realizations. Blended EBITDA/ton fell 17% YoY/ increased 6% QoQ to Rs1,110, and came in above our estimate of Rs1,083. Management has indicated that cement prices rose by Rs30/bag (~8%) in Apr'22 compared with the average price in Q4FY22. In our view, if such price hikes are sustained, they will reduce the risk of margin erosion sequentially. The gradual completion of the ongoing clinker (11.4mt) and cement (16.3mt) capacity expansion projects in FY23 should propel volume growth. In addition, Ultratech's extensive pan-India market presence, premium brand positioning and focus on cost efficiency makes it better-positioned to improve its margins in the medium term.

Outlook

We broadly maintain our FY23-24 estimates and increase our Mar'23E TP marginally to Rs7,300 from Rs7,230. Our DCF-based TP (11.25% WACC, 8% FCFF growth post FY26) implies a 1-year forward EV/EBITDA of 14x vs. current multiple of 16.4x. Maintain Buy.

UTCEM reported Q4FY22 earnings marginally above our estimates on back of better than expected realisations. EBITDA/t fell 16% YoY to Rs1,138 (PLe: Rs1,080). Street attributes the slide in margins over last couple of quarters to abnormal increase in costs and erratic recovery in prices coupled with demand impacted by unseasonal rains, sand shortage, etc. However, we believe that scope for improvement in margins is very limited as sector is generating strong cash flows with continuous capacity addition. We continue to like UTCEM given its market leading position (20%+ market share), strong B/S (Net debt/EBITDA at 0.5x) and efficient operations.

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

In Q4FY2022, UltraTech reported broadly in-line performance as marginally lower-than-expected volumes were offset by higher realisation. Consolidated net debt reduced sequentially by ~Rs. 2,400 crore. Management expects healthy demand environment to sustain, led by infrastructure, rural housing, and urban housing. Price hikes undertaken during April cover increased key input costs. White cement expansion plans have been put to rest with RAKWCT’s acquisition. Balance grey cement capacity expansion of 16.3 mtpa remains on track, while another round of expansion is to be announced by FY2023-end.

Outlook

We maintain Buy on UltraTech with a revised PT of Rs. 8,600, factoring downward revision in estimates.

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

Average cement prices during Jan-Feb 2022 are up 6% y-o-y led by sharp price increase in South and East regions during February 2022. Cement transported through rail rise 4% y-o-y and 13% m-o-m during January 2022 despite Omicron impact in first half. We expect the company to register y-o-y growth for Q4FY2022. International and domestic pet coke prices eased during Jan-Feb 2022 compared to Q3FY2022. However, the recent hike in crude price would warrant price hike in case pet coke price move northwards.

The market extended losses amid volatility for the second consecutive week ended February 18 but a close observation reveals that the benchmark indices have remained rangebound for nearly four weeks now, looking for strong direction on either side.

The Nifty50 fell nearly 100 points during the week to settle at 17,276 on Friday, around the same level it closed on January 25. The trend indicated that the index has strong support at 17,000-16,800; if the same levels get breached decisively there could be sharp correction. However, the crucial hurdle remains at 17,500-17,600 levels, with all eyes on global cues including Ukraine-Russia tensions, experts feel.

""Till the time this war kind of scenario does not subside completely, uncertainty is likely to loom over markets across the globe. So in such times, it's advisable not to trade aggressively and avoid carrying positions overnight,"" said Sameet Chavan, chief analyst, technical and derivatives, Angel One.

As far as levels are concerned, he said, ""We witnessed some nervousness around 17,450-17,500. So, if bulls have to regain any strength, they need to surpass these levels with some authority.""

On the flipside, ""17,000 followed by 16,800 is to be seen as make or break levels. In case of any aberration on the global front, the market will have to face challenging times after sliding below this sacrosanct support,"" he added.

Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three to four weeks. Returns are based on February 18 closing prices:

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst at HDFC Securities

Coal India: Buy | LTP: Rs 167.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 155 | Target: Rs 184 | Return: 10 percent

After showing an upside bounce in the early-mid part of January, the stock has witnessed rangebound action in the last few weeks. It has recovered from intra-week lows last week and is currently placed at the upper area of the sideways range at Rs 169-170 levels.

The current sideways range indicates uptrend continuation pattern. Volume has started to expand during upmove in the stock and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock.

Buying can be initiated in Coal India at CMP (Rs 167.30), add more on dips down to Rs 160, wait for the upside target of Rs 184 in the next three to four weeks. Place a stoploss of Rs 155.

Hitachi Energy India: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,105.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,910 | Target: Rs 3,440 | Return: 11 percent

The stock price has been in an intermediate uptrend over the last few months, as we observe upside movement as per the bullish sequence of higher tops and bottoms.

After showing a recent higher bottom reversal around Rs 2,700 levels in the mid of February, the stock witnessed a sustainable upside bounce on Friday, which indicates chances of further upmove. Volume and daily 14 period RSI show positive indication.

One may look to buy Hitachi Energy at CMP (Rs 3,105), add more on dips down to Rs 3,025 and wait for the upside target of Rs 3,440 in the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 2,910.

Aster DM Healthcare: Buy | LTP: Rs 189.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 176 | Target: Rs 210 | Return: 11 percent

After showing minor weakness from highs in the last couple of weeks, the stock has witnessed a sustainable upside bounce in this week. It is now making an attempt to stage an upside breakout of consolidation movement (type of triangle pattern) around Rs 192-194 levels.

Hence, a sustainable upmove above the hurdle is likely to open a sharp upside momentum for the stock. The volume has started to expand on Friday with an upmove in the stock and weekly 14 period RSI indicates chances of further strengthening of upside momentum for the stock.

One may look to buy Aster DM Healthcare at CMP (Rs 189.85), add more on dips down to Rs 182 and wait for the upside target of Rs 210 in the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 176.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, lead research at 5paisa.com

Voltas: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,252.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,213 | Target: Rs 1,320 | Return: 5.4 percent

In the recent corrective phase, prices have managed to form a support around 200-day EMA (exponential moving average) and have given some buying interest in last few sessions. During the last week, we witnessed price upmove with increasing volumes and the stock has also closed above its swing high which is a positive sign.

This price-volume breakout could lead to further strength in the stock in the short term. The RSI oscillator is also indicating positive momentum and hence short term traders can look for a buying opportunity in the stock.

Traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 1,252-1,240 for potential targets of Rs 1,292 and Rs 1,320 in the near term. Traders can place a stop-loss below Rs 1,213 on long positions.

Varun Beverages: Buy | LTP: Rs 953.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 925 | Target: Rs 1,021 | Return: 7 percent

After some price-wise correction in the months of November and December, the stock has recovered gradually from its support and had formed 'Higher Top Higher Bottom' structure on short term charts. The price-volume structure indicates that the volumes are good on price upmove while corrections are backed with lower volumes.

Recently, the stock faced resistance in the range of Rs 950-960 a couple of times and a breakout above the higher end could lead to a resumption of the uptrend.

Hence, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy the stock on breakout above Rs 960 for potential targets of Rs 997 and Rs 1,021 in the near term. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 925 on long positions.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, head of equity research (retail) at Kotak Securities

Punjab National Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 37.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 39 | Target: Rs 33 | Return: 12.6 percent

It is largely underperforming other PSU banks, which will put the stock under selling pressure if the market is weak. Secondly, the stock is in a broad trading range between Rs 45 and Rs 33.

It is currently in a downtrend and may drop to Rs 33 again. Sell at current levels and place stop-loss at Rs 39.

IRB Infrastructure: Buy | LTP: Rs 256.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 225 | Target: Rs 325 | Return: 27 percent

The stock completed an upward movement when it touched the Rs 300 level. Currently, it is correcting the previous upmove. Based on the retracement and extension, it looks like the stock could drop to Rs 252 or Rs 245 in the worst-case scenario.

Since the primary trend is positive, we should buy between Rs 252 and Rs 245 with a medium to long-term outlook. Traders need to place a stop loss at Rs 225. After the completion of the correction, we are expecting the stock to retest its immediate high at Rs 303 and, in the best-case scenario, it may even go up to Rs 325, which was its final target. We think this can make the consolidation formation of the cup with handle.

UltraTech Cement: Sell | LTP: Rs 6,916.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 7,100 | Target: Rs 6,500 | Return: 6 percent

For the first time since July 2021, the stock closed comfortably below the crucial support of Rs 7,000. It has been an equilibrium level for the stock since March 2021. Also, it was the lower limit of the broader trading range that the stock had set between the levels Rs 7,750 and Rs 7,000 for the last seven months.

It is a technical breakdown and the stock will validate it if it trades below last week's low, which was Rs 6,900. The stock may drop to Rs 6,600 or Rs 6,500 in the near future.

Sell with a trading view below the level of Rs 6,900 with a tight stop-loss at Rs 7,100.

Expert: Sameet Chavan, chief analyst-technical and derivatives, Angel One

Voltas: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,252.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,212 | Target: Rs 1,310 | Return: 4.6 percent

This stock has seen a smart surge in last 3-4 trading sessions despite the broader market sulking a bit. With Friday's upmove, the stock has confirmed a bullish breakout from the V pattern. This pattern has a bullish implication when accompanied with higher-than-average volumes.

All these requirements do meet here and hence we recommend buying this stock on a small decline towards Rs 1,240-1,235 for a trading target of Rs 1,310. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 1,212.

Eveready Industries: Buy | Rs 359.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 318 | Target: Rs 392 | Return: 9 percent

In last three trading sessions, all of a sudden, the tide turned upwards for this stock. Before anyone could even realise, the prices have soared more than 20 percent in such a short span.

More importantly, if we take a glance at the volume activity, we can see some abnormal volumes in this counter, which is an indication of immense buying interest.

Since the stock has moved quite a lot, we recommend buying this stock on a decline towards Rs 345-340 for a near term target of Rs 392. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 318.

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

UTCEM’s 3QFY22 performance was impacted by cost inflation, primarily energy and other costs, leading to a 6.7pp YoY fall in EBITDA margin and 19% YoY fall in EBITDA/t. EBITDA fell 22% YoY, despite higher other operating income (up 2.3x YoY). Adjusted for tax write-backs, profit fell 26% YoY. The industry has seen peak of the fuel cost inflation and imported/domestic petcoke prices have declined 38%/33% from its peak in Nov-21. This should help cost moderate from 1QFY23. UTCEM is expected to benefit from capacity expansions (19.6mtpa over FY21-23E) and cost saving initiatives (increase in WHRS/solar power capacities). We expect 9% sales volume CAGR over FY21-24E. We raise our FY22-24E EPS estimate by 3-4% on higher other operating income and lower energy costs. We factor in 21% EPS CAGR over FY22-24E after a lower growth in FY22 (growth of 5% YoY).

Outlook

The stock trades at 16.3x/13.9x FY23E/FY24E EV/EBITDA (v/s its 10-year average one-year forward EV/EBITDA of 15.1x). We value UTCEM at 16x FY24E EV/EBITDA to arrive at our TP of INR9,080. We reiterate our Buy rating.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Ultratech Cement

Consolidated EBITDA declined 22% YoY/11% QoQ to Rs24bn in Q3FY22, broadly in line with our estimate, as marginally higher-than-expected cost/ton was offset by better other operating income. Blended EBITDA/ton fell 20% YoY/17% QoQ to Rs1,046. With its large pan-India diversified market presence, premium brand positioning and focus on cost efficiency, UTCEM is better placed to improve margins in the medium term. Besides, the company’s RoIC is expected to increase to a sustainable level of 20%+ within 4-5 years (vs. 12% in the past decade). Factoring in higher opex/ton due to input cost inflation and recent weakness in demand, we cut our FY22/FY23 EBITDA estimates by 8%/3%, while we broadly maintain FY24 estimates.

Outlook

We roll over to Mar’23 from Dec’22 and increase our TP by 3% to Rs8,750. Our DCFbased TP (11.25% WACC, 8% FCFF growth post FY26) implies a 1-year forward EV/EBITDA of 15x (vs. current multiple of 16.5x). Maintain Buy.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

UTCEM reported Q3FY22 earnings below our/consensus estimates (CE) by 9%/10%, largely due to steeper than expected increase in cost and in-line realisations. EBITDA/t fell 20% YoY/20% QoQ to Rs1,062 (PLe: Rs1,160). Street attributes the slide in margins over last couple of quarters to abnormal increase in costs and erratic recovery in prices coupled with demand impacted by unseasonal rains, sand shortage, etc. However, we believe that scope for improvement in margins is very limited as sector is generating strong cash flows with continuous capacity addition. This could potentially be the key driver for earnings downgrade by street. We continue to like UTCEM given its market leading position (20%+ market share), strong B/S (Net debt/EBITDA at 0.5x) and efficient operations.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company:

Credit Suisse

Research firm has kept outperform rating on the stock on the back of strong underlying sector dynamics on pricing & demand.

The firm has kept target at Rs 9,250 on the back of strong positive outlook on housing and infrastructure investment cycle.

It revised earnings by -20%/-9%/-6% for FY22/23/24 on cost impact.

Citi

Broking house has kept buy rating and raised the target price to Rs 9,100 from Rs 8,500.

The cost pressures are likely peaked in Q3 and pace of price acceleration should slow in FY23 given supply expectations.

Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs has maintained buy call on the stock and raised the target price to Rs 9,000 from Rs 8,800 as the company remains the top pick in the sector, given its capacity expansion plans.

The results were in-line with mixed near-term outlook; however structural thesis are intact.

It is a top pick in the sector on scale, pricing premium & rising green power share.

Jefferies

Brokerage house Jefferies has retained hold rating with a target at Rs 8,100. Its EBITDA misses on higher cost, while cement price hike is the key to regain lost ground.

The management has indicated that costs are likely to remain elevated in Q4. The cement prices have started improving in a few regions and expect price hikes in other regions as well in the next 2-3 months.

Jefferies has cut FY22-FY24 EBITDA estimates by 7-9% to reflect cost pressure.

CLSA

Research house CLSA has maintained buy call with a target at Rs 9,175 per share as it expect stock may outperform with likely price hikes in Q4 & strong demand and expect company to be a key beneficiary of a demand upcycle.

Its Q3 EBITDA was slightly above & costs likely to have peaked.

Company expects power costs to remain at current elevated levels in Q4 and reduction in spot prices to be reflected in FY23.

Prabhudas Lilladher

We continue to like UltraTech given its market leading position (20%+ market share), strong B/S (Net debt/EBITDA at 0.5x) and efficient operations.

However, high expectation with 2-year volume CAGR of 12%, EBITDA/t of Rs 1,300 and rich valuations of EV/EBITDA of 14.2x and P/E of 24.6x FY24e leaves limited upside with potential risk of earnings downgrade.

We downgrade stock to accumulate with revised target price of Rs 8,535 (earlier Rs 8,650) EV/EBITDA of 15.5x FY24e.

Sharekhan

UltraTech is expected to benefit from expected healthy cement demand over the long term, driven by its timely capacity expansion plans. The demand environment is expected to be strong from segments such as infrastructure, rural housing, and urban housing.

Easing of power and fuel costs along with expectation of price hikes is likely to maintain healthy operational profitability.

We believe the company’s capacity expansion coupled with de-leveraging of balance sheet over the next three years is expected to drive earnings over FY2022-FY2024. We continue to maintain our buy rating on the stock with a revised price target of Rs 9,200.

Motilal Oswal

Cement demand is expected to remain strong, led by the government’s thrust on Infrastructure development and recent improvement in housing demand. UltraTech Cement is in a strong position to gain market share, led by its strong distribution network.

Its capacity expansion plans and scope for improvement in utilization of existing capacities offers strong growth visibility.

We estimate consolidated EBITDA/adjusted PAT CAGR of 16%/21% over FY22-24E, driven by 9% volume CAGR, decline in energy costs, and lower interest expense.

We value UltraTech at 16x FY24E EV/EBITDA to arrive at our target price of Rs 9,080. We reiterate our buy rating.

At 09:22 hrs UltraTech Cement was quoting at Rs 7,718, down Rs 149.90, or 1.91 percent on the BSE.

The share touched a 52-week high of Rs 8,267 and a 52-week low Rs 5,261.80 on 08 November, 2021 and 01 February, 2021, respectively.

Currently, it is trading 6.64 percent below its 52-week high and 46.68 percent above its 52-week low.

The capacity expansion will help Birla White strengthen its presence in the growing white cement market, reducing its dependence on high-cost imports, it added. Moreover, UltraTech has also commenced operations from its bulk terminal at Kalamboli, Navi Mumbai, during the quarter. This is the seventh bulk terminal of the company.

""With a capacity to handle 1.2 MTPA (million tonnes per annum) cement and considering the large infrastructure development projects in and around Mumbai, the bulk terminal will strengthen the company to further increase its sales of bulk cement,"" the company said. Cement will be brought in bulk rakes to this terminal from its various manufacturing units.

""This will effectively help in reducing freight cost, with the increase in the usage of rail transportation. This is one more step of the company in reducing carbon emissions and driving sustainable growth,"" it said. The company commissioned Line-II of the Bara Grinding Unit in Uttar Pradesh, having a cement production capacity of 2 MTPA.

""With this expansion, during the financial year 2021-22, the company has commissioned 3.2 MTPA new cement capacity, as planned, taking its total cement manufacturing capacity in India to 114.55 MTPA,"" it said.

UltraTech Cement share traded in the green on December 28 quoting at Rs 7,445.45, up Rs 40.25 or 0.54 percent at 11:59 hours. It touched an intraday high of Rs 7,456.20 and an intraday low of Rs 7,350.

Research and broking firm ICICI Securities in its report has maintained ""buy"" on the stock with a target of Rs 8,850 per share.

The research firm expects UltraTech to continue to post industry-leading growth and profitability over FY21-24 backed by low-cost brownfield expansions and increased cost efficiencies. The company's diversified pan-India market mix, premium brand positioning, strong distribution and large presence in the non-trade segment allow it to weather current demand uncertainties much better than peers.

""Cost saving initiatives may result in benefits of Rs 100 per tonne by FY24 and RoCE or return on capital employed (post-tax) may expand over 400 basis points over FY22-24 to 17%. Dividend payout ratio has increased from 10% in FY20 to 20% in FY21 which may rise further as UltraTech is likely to generate Rs 20,000 crore free cash flow over FY21-24,"" the research firm added.

ICICI Securities has maintained ""buy"" on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 8,850 per share (15x Dec’23E EV/E). The stock is one of its top picks.

Market share gains likely to continue

UltraTech's plan to add 20 mnte capacities (18% of domestic capacities) over the next two to three years in high-growth/utilisation markets of East, Central and North India would likely ensure faster ramp-up and higher volume growth. Given over 70% of these expansions are brownfield with an average capex of less than $60 per tonne, the research firm expects these assets to enjoy healthy RoCE of over 15% (versus 11.5% in FY20) led by better profitability.

The company also has large non-trade exposure (33%) and stands to benefit from a likely pickup in infrastructure spend and better urban housing demand, especially in Tier-II and Tier-III cities.

UltraTech to be debt-free by H1FY23

The company is likely to generate over Rs 34,000 crore operating cash flow over FY21-24. This may allow the company to accelerate its growth via both organic/inorganic routes. Besides current 20 mnte expansion, UltraTech has scope to undertake additional 30 mnte low-cost brownfield expansion. Historically, acquisitions have been integral to the company's growth story with the firm enjoying a strong track record in turning around acquisitions.

The company is expected to be debt-free by the first half of FY23. Meanwhile, the dividend payout ratio has increased from 10% in FY20 to 20% in FY21 which may rise further (up to 25% as per current dividend payout policy) as the firm is likely to generate a strong free cash flow of Rs 20,000 crore over FY21-24.

Mighty bulls in the market pushed the Nifty50 to reclaim its crucial 18,000 mark on November 8, continuing an uptrend for the second consecutive session with participation from all sectors, barring private banks and pharma.

The Nifty Metal, IT, FMCG, Financial Services and PSU Bank indices are prominent gainers, rising 1-2 percent. The broader markets, too, stayed strong as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 1.2 percent and 1.08 percent.

The Nifty50 rallied more than 150 points to close above 18,050, and the BSE Sensex climbed 478 points to top 60,500.

Stocks that were in focus include UltraTech Cement, which was the fourth biggest gainer in the Nifty50, hitting a record high of Rs 8,269 and closed with 4.23 percent gains at Rs 8,214.05.

Chalet Hotels hit a fresh 52-week high, before closing 6.52 percent higher at Rs 263.20, and Muthoot Finance was also in the limelight, rising 8.5 percent to Rs 1,659.40.

Here's what Vikas Jain of Reliance Securities, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

UltraTech Cement

The stock has scaled an all-time high with strong volumes aided with positive price action across the sector over the past few days.

It is holding its 20-week average and making a new top every three months and the current move can scale to Rs 8,600 levels over the next few weeks.

The RSI (relative strength index) is hovering on the higher band and still has scope for improvement, indicating further up move. We advise to hold with a target of Rs 8,600.

Chalet Hotels

The stock has witnessed a upward breakout from its one year of consolidation of W pattern and outperformed the broader markets. It has moved up swiftly to the higher range so some consolidation at current levels cannot be ruled out over the next few weeks.

We believe it can test Rs 320 levels over the next few months and recoup the loss from where the major fall has being witnessed in March 2020. We advised to hold the stock with a target of Rs 320.

Muthoot Finance

The stock has crossed its previous high of Rs 1,638 levels on back of its strong results and has closed 8.5 percent higher on the previous trading day.

We believe that after a sharp outperformance over the past few weeks one should wait for some corrective action.

RSI is at the higher end and delivery volumes are low over the past two days, indicating some pause, and one should book profit at current levels.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Ultratech Cement

Consolidated EBITDA was flat YoY at Rs27bn (down 18% QoQ) in Q2FY22, in line with our estimate, as higher-than-expected cost/ton was offset by better blended realization (led by white cement and RMC business) and higher other operating income. Accordingly, blended EBITDA/ton declined 7% YoY/18% QoQ to Rs1,254. We expect UTCEM's RoIC to increase to a sustainable level of 20%+ within 4-5 years (vs. 12% in the past decade), driven by rising utilization levels and improving margins. Factoring in higher opex/ton due to input cost inflation, we cut our FY22-24 EBITDA estimates by 3-4%.

Outlook

We roll over to Dec'22 from Sep'22 and maintain our TP at Rs8,500. Our DCF-based TP (11.25% WACC, 8% FCFF growth post FY26) implies a 1-year forward EV/EBITDA of 15x (vs. 15.6x earlier). Maintain Buy.

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

UTCEM reported an 8%/7% YoY growth in volume/blended realization. EBITDA margin declined by 339bp YoY to 22.6% due to energy cost inflation, which was further accentuated by higher maintenance and employee costs. EBITDA remained largely flat YoY at INR27.1b (-18% QoQ). Market share gains should continue, aided by the ongoing 20mtpa expansion program (1.2mtpa commissioned in Oct'21), which should drive a 10% volume CAGR over FY21-24E. We largely maintain our FY22-24E EPS estimates and expect 19% EPS CAGR over FY21-24E.



Outlook

The stock trades at 14.9x/12.6x FY23E/FY24E EV/EBITDA (v/s its 10-year average one-year forward EV/EBITDA of 14.3x). We value UTCEM at 16x Sep'23E EV/EBITDA to arrive at our TP of INR8,700. We reiterate our Buy rating.

YES Securities' research report on UltraTech Cement

UTCEM’s upcoming capacities of 19.5MTPA would help to encash the strong prolonged cement demand and boost the volume growth over FY23‐24E. Thus, we believe UTCEM volume to grow at 10%CAGR over FY22‐23E. However, the inflating fuel/diesel cost is the major point of concern, but it is likely to pass on further in supply‐ chain with a potential price hikes. Additionally, the increasing WHRS/green power and the higher blending ratio and improving efficiency would further aid to maintain the strong EBITDA/te of +Rs1,400/te in FY22/23E. Thus, over strong operating profit we expect a robust free cash flow generation of Rs150bn over FY22‐23E despite the ongoing CAPEX.

Outlook

The Net Debt/EBITDA continue to remain at a bottom low of 0.47x in Q2FY22 v/s 0.44x in last quarter. At the CMP stock trades at 17/14.9x of EBITDA on FY22E/FY23E. Thus, we retain our BUY recommendation with a TP of Rs8,600 (unchanged), valuing the stock at 16x EV/EBITDA (unchanged) on FY23E on the back of strong realization, robust demand scenario, UTCEM’s ability to pass on inflating cost and capacity addition.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

UTCEM reported Q2FY22 earnings in line with our estimates, largely due to one-time income in other operating income segment. While, costs came significantly above our estimates due to higher other expenses. EBITDA/t (Incl other operating income) fell 4.5% YoY (↓17% QoQ) to Rs1,320 (PLe: Rs1,355). Ex of other operating income, EBITDA/t fell 10% YoY/22% QoQ to Rs1,182 (PLe: Rs1,285) Backed by sound B/S (Net debt/EBITDA at 0.5x) and steady cash flows, UTCEM is expanding capacity by 17.5% or 19.5mnt over next couple of years along with sizeable investment in high payback and environment friendly renewable power (WHR + Solar) to increase its share to 34% by FY24 from current 14% of overall power requirement. Led by its dominant size (22% market share) and highly efficient operations, we believe that UTCEM stands out as the best candidate to play the sector.

Outlook

However, we expect near term weakness in the sector due to headwinds on margins coupled with unabated increase in energy cost. Reiterate BUY with TP of Rs8,600, EV/EBITDA of 17.0x FY23e.

UltraTech Cement share price fell in the early trade on October 19, a day it reported a consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 1,313.53 crore for the September quarter, which was 23 percent lower from Rs 1,702.63 crore in the previous quarter on account of higher costs .

On a year-on-year (YOY) basis, there was an increase of 13 percent from the adjusted net profit of Rs 1,166 crore.

UltraTech Cement’s consolidated revenue came in at Rs 12,017 crore, up 1.6 percent from Rs 11,830 crore in June 2021 quarter. On a YoY basis, the revenue was higher by 15.7 percent from Rs. 10,387 crore.

Catch all the market action on our live blog

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after the September quarter earnings:

CLSA

CLSA has maintained “outperform"" rating as Q2 EBITDA was largely in-line and the company is confident of passing on cost inflation.

The broking house remains positive on its demand outlook.

Citi

The research house has kept the “buy” rating with a target at Rs 8,500 and tweaked FY22-23 EBITDA by 3 percent/-1 percent, incorporating higher realisations and costs.

JPMorgan

JPMorgan has kept a “neutral” rating with a target at Rs 6,890 as it was a weak quarter for the company, driven by pricing declines and higher costs.

The costs could increase sharply from here and it expects cement price increase to offset most of the cost pressure.

The earnings upgrade cycle for company has likely come to an end for now.

Jefferies

Jefferies has maintained “hold” call with the target at Rs 7,200 after the company reported an in-line Q2 with a marginal growth in EBITDA.

The company intends to pass on the cost inflation through price hikes. The research firm expects the stock to remain range-bound until margin visibility improves.

Motilal Oswal

We estimate the company to record an 11.6 percent/18.6 percent CAGR in consolidated EBITDA/adjusted PAT over FY21-24E, driven by higher sales volume/realization and lower interest expenses.

The company’s improved earnings/RoE and improving leverage warrants higher multiples for the stock, which trades at 14.9x/12.6x FY23E/FY24E EV/EBITDA (average one-year forward EV/EBITDA of 14.3x for the last 10 years).

We value the stock at 16x Sep’23E EV/EBITDA to arrive at our target price of Rs 8,700. We reiterate our buy rating.

Sharekhan

UltraTech is likely to benefit from expected healthy cement demand over the long term, driven by timely capacity expansion plans.

The company would also be passing on increased input costs through cement price hikes to consumers, shielding its operational profitability.

We believe the company’s capacity expansion, coupled with de-leveraging of the balance sheet over the next three years, will drive earnings over FY2022-FY2024. We continue to maintain our buy rating on the stock, with an unchanged price target of Rs 8,800.

Prabhudas Lilladher

The company reported Q2FY22 earnings in line with our estimates, largely due to one-time income in other operating income segment. Costs were significantly higher from our estimates due to higher other expenses.

Led by its dominant size (22 percent market share) and highly efficient operations, we believe that company stands out as the best candidate to play the sector. However, we expect near term weakness in the sector due to headwinds on margins coupled with unabated increase in energy cost. Reiterate “buy” with the target price of Rs 8,600, EV/EBITDA of 17.0x FY23e.

At 0920 hours, UltraTech Cement was quoting at Rs 7,313.30, down Rs 84.40, or 1.14 percent on the BSE.

UltraTech Cement Limited, the world’s third-largest cement manufacturer (excluding China) and largest in India, has reported consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 1,313.53 crore for the quarter ended September 2021, decreasing by about 23 percent from Rs 1,702.63 crore reported in the previous quarter on account of higher costs. On a year-on-year (YOY) basis, there was an increase of 13 percent from the adjusted net profit of Rs 1,166 crore.

Revenue

Consolidated revenue came in at Rs 12,017 crore, higher by 1.6 percent compared to Rs 11,830 crore in June 2021 quarter. On a YOY basis, the revenue was higher by 15.7 percent from Rs. 10,387 crore.

Volumes

The total consolidated volumes for the company stood at 21.64 million tonnes, a growth of 8 percent. Volumes for grey cement have grown on a YOY basis by 8 percent to 19.9 million tonnes. The company added 43 new Ready-mix concrete (RMC) plants during the quarter, taking the total of RMC plants to 148. White cement volumes grew by 17 percent YOY to 0.34 million tonnes. There was a reduction in exports and others due to COVID restrictions of about 45 percent which came in at 0.21 million tonnes. Overseas grey cement volumes were stagnant at 1.21 million tonnes.

Overall, the company witnessed a growth in volumes across regions except central India where demand was more or less stagnant, and eastern India where the volumes went down due to rains and COVID restrictions. Strong demand growth was witnessed in Western India, especially Maharashtra & Gujarat where demand was pushed both by urban and rural demand as well as housing and infrastructure segment.

Costs

Raw material, logistics, and energy costs for the company witnessed an upward trajectory during the quarter. Raw materials costs (slag, gypsum, and HSD) which constitute 13 percent of total costs, were higher by 3 percent on a YOY / 2 percent on a QOQ basis and clocked Rs 518/tonne. The rise in diesel prices also impacted the input costs.

Energy costs which constitute 28 percent of the total costs were highly impacted due to rising coal and petcoke prices. Energy costs were higher by 17 percent YOY / 8 percent on a sequential basis and touched Rs 1099/tonne. This was despite the fact that the company consumed 4 percent less power and built-in operational efficiencies. Green power fulfilled 13.7 percent of the total power requirement.

To reduce dependence on higher-priced coal purchases, the company expects to commence mining operations at its Bicharpur coal block in Madhya Pradesh during Q3FY22.

Logistics costs (contributing 31 percent to total costs) were higher by 7 percent YOY / 3 percent QOQ to Rs 1,219/tonne due to rising oil prices which increased by 21 percent YOY. The company was able to partially mitigate the inflated fuel prices with improved efficiencies.

Packing cost was also higher by 25 percent YOY and 20 percent from the previous quarter.

As a result, the company’s total costs as a percentage of total revenue witnessed an increase of 3 percent on a YOY basis and of 5 percent from the previous quarter.

Margins

Higher costs adversely impacted the operating and net margins. Operating margins were down 370 bps on a sequential basis and by 130 bps on a YOY basis. Similarly, net margins were down 350 bps sequentially and by 30 bps on a YOY basis.

New Capacity Additions

The company commissioned a new capacity of 1.2 mtpa in the month of Oct’21. 0.6 mtpa was commissioned at Patliputra Cement Works in Bihar and 0.6 mtpa at Dankuni Cement Works in West Bengal, which is the first phase of its capacity expansion plans of 19.5 mtpa that were announced in December of last year. These additions will help meet the growing demand in the eastern region.

The total cement manufacturing capacity in India for the company now stands at 112.55 mtpa.

Green Initiatives

In the last two years, the company has scaled up its renewable energy capacity by 2.5 times and expects it to fulfill 34 percent of its power requirement by 2024 from the current levels of 13 percent. The company has set a target to move to completely (100 percent) switch to renewable energy by 2050.

Recovery in rural and urban demand in both housing and infrastructure sectors across regions is expected to be challenged by the increase in input and energy costs. However, the company hopes to mitigate the same by building sustainable efficiencies across the chain and bypassing some costs to the consumers by increasing the prices.

In the press release, the company said, “UltraTech is confident of weathering the storm of increase in prices of coal, diesel, and other inputs, with its sustainable efficiency improvement programs, accompanied by an increase in selling prices to absorb the increase in costs.”

The stock closed at Rs. 7,399 today, up Rs. 3.80 from its previous day’s close. It has generated returns of about 65 percent over a period of 1 year, 39.92 percent in this financial year, and 1 percent over the past 3 months.

The country’s leading cement maker UltraTech Cement said it has joined the RE100 initiative and targets 100 percent renewable energy usage by 2050.

The Aditya Birla group firm has announced its commitment to Climate Group’s RE100 initiative at Climate Week NYC 2021.

RE100 is a global group of influential businesses committed to using 100 percent renewable electricity. Its purpose is to accelerate change towards zero-carbon grids at scale.

“As part of this commitment, UltraTech targets to meet 100 percent of its electricity requirement through renewables sources by 2050,” the company said in a statement.

In the last two years, UltraTech has scaled up its contracted renewable energy capacity by 2.5 times.

The company has already set a target to scale up its green energy mix to 34 percent of its total power requirement by 2024, from the current levels of 13 percent.

UltraTech Cement Managing Director Kailash Jhanwar said the company has made tremendous progress in scaling up the use of green energy in operations.

“With us now joining the RE100 group, UltraTech will become part of a high-profile global campaign that advocates for a strong business case in transitioning to renewable energy sources in building a decarbonised economy,” he said.

UltraTech is the largest manufacturer of grey cement, ready mix concrete (RMC) and white cement in India.

With a consolidated grey cement capacity of 116.75 MTPA, it is the third-largest cement producer in the world, excluding China.",248,0.9999987483024597

Shares of UltraTech Cement, the country's largest cement producer, more than doubled in the last one year, sharply outperforming the benchmark BSE Sensex, which rallied 52 per cent in the same period. In fact, it outpaced its closest peers, Shree Cement and ACC, also in the same period.

The cement major gained 109 percent in the last 12 months and hit a fresh high of Rs 8,070.60 on September 8, while Shree Cement and ACC rallied 58.8 percent and 87 percent, respectively. However, it marginally underperformed Ambuja Cements, which gained 111 percent.

The rally is largely attributed to its strong market share with a healthy balance sheet and the government's increased focus on infrastructure segment, with improved outlook and reopening of economic activities.

""UltraTech is the largest cement producer in India and has a strong market position, with a healthy balance sheet. The stock has surged more than 100 percent in the last one year due to the improvement in operational performance, capex and improved future outlook for its business performance. The government's support for infrastructure activities has further improved the future outlook on domestic cement companies,"" said Ankit Pareek, Research Analyst, Choice Broking.

Capacity expansion key trigger

The key triggers for the stock are the capacity expansion to target eastern regions while becoming net debt-free by FY23, and sustainability of operational margins.

Amidst the severe cost pressure and rising competitive intensity, Prabhudas Lilladher preferred UltraTech Cement, along with Ambuja Cements, given their diversified presence, ample levers for cost reduction (waste heat recovery, strong logistics network), and high share of trade volumes.

The brokerage believes that UltraTech stands out as the best play in the sector, led by its dominant size (22 percent market share) and highly efficient operations.

The company, in July, had prepaid its long-term loans amounting to Rs 5,000 crore through free cash flows.

In the quarter ended June 2021, UltraTech reported a 54 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in revenue at Rs 11,698 crore and profit grew by 114 percent to Rs 1,703 crore, partly on a low base, as Q1FY21 was hit by COVID-led nationwide lockdown.

At the operating level, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) surged 49 percent to Rs 3,512 crore, compared to the year-ago quarter.

The company has a total capacity of 116.75 million tonnes, as of FY21, which will be increased to 136.25 million tonnes by FY23. ""COVID did cause some delays due to labour shortages and lockdowns. However, the company expects to commission all the projects as per the original schedule,"" said UltraTech.

Technical experts feel the stock can rally up to the Rs 8,500 levels in the short term, considering the current momentum despite intermittent correction and consolidation. On the monthly chart, it has formed a sizeable bullish candle pattern in last three straight months.

""On the monthly chart, UltraTech had given a breakout of Rs 4,904.95 levels in December 2020. After that, we witnessed a one-way rally, and it has gained more than 60 percent since December. Overall, the stock is in bullish territory with good momentum, and, in the recent trade, it has made a high at the Rs 8,073.30 levels,"" said Sachin Gupta, AVP, Research, Choice Broking.

Full support from most technical indicators

He believes all technical key indicators like RSI (14), Stochastic & MACD are indicating bullish strength for the long term. ""On a weekly time frame, the stock has shifted above the immediate resistance of Rs 7,911 levels, which suggests continued strength in the counter.""

At present, the stock has immediate support at the Rs 7,730 levels while the upside potential is around Rs 8,300-8,500 levels, he said.

Jay Thakkar, Vice President and Head of Equity Research, Marwadi Shares and Finance, feels UltraTech seems to have completed its five waves rising structure on the weekly and monthly charts. This means the upside potential is less from the current levels, compared to the downside risk.

""Momentum indicator MACD is well into the buy mode at all the degrees, i.e., from daily to monthly charts. However, it’s trading below its previous swing high. So, if there is a sell crossover from hereon, anytime soon, it will form a negative divergence which will be negative for the stock,"" he said.

""The 38.2 percent retracement of the entire rise from March 2020 comes to the Rs 6,100 levels, which is nearly 22 percent from the highs. Hence the risk to reward is not in favour of fresh longs hereon,"" he added.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech mentioned key elements of its growth strategy in the FY21 annual report: 1) focus on cost optimization and efficiency improvements; 2) low-cost expansion largely through the brownfield route; 3) enhance balance sheet strength and return ratios. In terms of cost optimization and de-risking efforts, we estimate sustainable cost savings of Rs90-100/ton by FY24E from the growing share of green power, improving blended ratio, lower lead distance, and better operating leverage. Ultratech would be adding ~20mt capacities in a staggered way by FY23E at capex of Rs65bn (<US$60/ton, 75% brownfield). The proposed expansion will help to gain market share (140bps to 23% by FY23E), and boost profitability and return ratios. With strong FCF generation of Rs82bn p.a. over FY22-24E, we expect Ultratech to become net cash positive by FY23E. Capital is likely to be allocated for growth opportunities and the surplus would be paid as dividends.



Outlook

We have a Buy rating on the stock with a DCF-based TP of Rs8,500 (Sep'22E), implying a 15x forward EV/EBITDA (vs. current multiple of 16x).

Ultratech reported sales growth of 54.2% YoY at INR 1,18,298 mn, mostly in line (0.7% below) with our estimate. However, on QoQ basis revenue declined by 17.9%. Cement sales volume saw a growth of 47% YoY to 21.5 MT against 14.7 MT in Q1FY21, driven by higher utilization, robust demand and low base effect. In Q1FY22 capacity utilization stood at 73% against 46% in Q1FY21. Blended realization improved by 5.4% YoY to INR 5,495/t (vs INR 5,211/t in Q1FY21). EBITDA increased by 59.2% YoY to INR 33,075 mn, while EBITDA margin expanded by 87 bps YoY/ 234 bps QoQ to 28%. EBITDA/t stood at INR 1,536 in Q1FY22, a rise of 8.4% YoY.

Outlook

The stock price of Ultratech has rallied ~10% since our last update and is currently trading at FY22E/FY23E EV/EBITDA of 17.7/16.3x. We are optimistic about the company’s growth prospects and apply an EV/EBITDA multiple of 17.5x to FY23E EBITDA, which yields a target price of INR 8,128 per share (earlier INR 7,415 per share); a potential upside of 8.5% over the CMP. Accordingly, we reiterate an ACCUMULATE rating on the shares of UltraTech Cement Ltd.

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement (UTCEM) continued to improve its costs and margins in 1QFY22; it reported the highest ever EBITDA/unit of INR1,536/t (+8% YoY) during the quarter. Coupled with volume growth of 47% YoY, this led to 59% YoY growth in EBITDA. Net debt fell INR7b QoQ to INR59.8b (0.44x TTM EBITDA).

Demand for cement in India is expected to increase in the near future on the back of government policies and enhanced investment in infrastructure, UltraTech Cement Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said.

“Government spending on infrastructure projects and affordable housing schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana with enhanced budgetary allocations remain the primary drivers of growth for the cement industry,” Birla said in a note to shareholders in the company’s annual report for 2020-21.

Birla said the cement industry shrank 10-12 percent due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown from late March to end-April 2020 was a huge challenge for all manufacturing industries.

“However, with the central and state governments taking measured steps towards unlocking the economy, some encouraging trends were seen from the latter part of May 2020,” Birla said. “Since then, the industry has been on a volume growth path, driven mainly by the government’s ‘Housing for All by 2022’ mission and large infrastructure projects.”

UltraTech recorded net revenue of $5.95 billion (Rs 44,239 crore) and an EBITDA of $1.66 billion (Rs 12,302 crore) during FY21, according to the annual report.

The domestic cement industry is poised for a surge in volumes after allocations in the Union Budget for FY22 for infrastructure, affordable housing and road projects to fuel the economy.

India is the second-largest cement producer in the world and accounted for over 7 percent of the global installed capacity, according to India Brand Equity Foundation, a trust set up by the Department of Commerce. India’s cement production capacity was almost 545 million tonnes in FY20, of which 98 percent was with private companies.

Demand for cement is expected to reach 550-600 million tonnes per annum by 2025, according to IBEF.

Birla said the UltraTech board of directors had approved fresh capital expenditure of Rs 5,477 crore towards increasing capacity by 12.8 million tonnes per annum with a mix of brownfield and greenfield expansion.

“The additional capacity will be created in the fast-growing markets of the east, central, and northern regions of the country,” Birla said.

This expansion will be in addition to the 6.7 million tonnes per annum capacity that the company is currently building in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal. These new capacities are expected to go on stream in phases during FY22 and FY23.

“This significant investment in a core infrastructure sector will accelerate the wheels of economic activity and aid the kickstart of the private investment cycle. Our capex ambition is fortified both by the strength of UltraTech’s balance sheet and our conviction on India’s inherent growth potential,” Birla said.

When the latest round of expansion is completed, UltraTech’s capacity will increase to 136.25 million tonnes per annum, reinforcing its position as the third-largest cement company in the world outside of China, the company chairman said.",489,0.7139768515314374

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after the June quarter earnings:

Macquarie | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 8,542

Macquarie has maintained outperform rating on the stock, as expansion projects are on track and expect industry-leading growth over FY21-24.

Sustained cost improvement and balance sheet deleveraging will support earnings and valuation.

JPMorgan | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 6,890

The broking house remains neutral on the stock as the cost pressures are building up despite Q1 beat. The H2 needs large hikes for a positive surprise.

CLSA | Rating: Outperform | Target: Raised to Rs 8,000 from Rs 7,735

CLSA kept outperform rating on the stock as the Q1 EBITDA of 15 percent was above estimate but cost inflation will impact earnings.

The EBITDA/tonne increased 17 percent QoQ, which was above our estimate on lower costs.

CLSA expects profitability to taper down but the company is likely to turn net cash positive by FY24. Risk-reward seems fair at current valuation.

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 8,600

The company reported a strong set of Q4FY21 earnings with a 12 percent beat on our/consensus EBITDA estimates. Led by higher realisations and better control on freight cost, we increase our EBITDA/EPS estimates for FY22e and FY23e by 8.3 percent/12.8 percent and 7.0 percent /9.9 percent.

Led by its dominant size (22 percent market share) and highly efficient operations, we believe that UltraTech stands out as the best candidate to play the sector.

Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 8,800

UltraTech has been able to report strong volume growth which has been driven organically and in the wake of the COVID impact. The healthy pricing discipline and contained input costs have been improving its operational profitability, which is expected to improve going ahead.

Barring the near-term impact of the second wave of Covid, it has been one of the key beneficiaries of strong rural demand, pick up in urban real estate and large government infrastructure projects.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 8,770

We estimate a 15 percent/26 percent CAGR in consolidated EBITDA/PAT over FY21–23E, driven by a 13 percent volume CAGR, better realisations, lower operating costs and lower interest costs.

At 0917 hours, UltraTech Cement was quoting at Rs 7,554.90, up Rs 95.05, or 1.27 percent on the BSE.

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

Recommendation

Buy UltraTech Cement in range of Rs 6775-6875; Target: Rs 7770; Stop Loss: Rs 6318; Time frame: Three months.

Derivatives & Quantitative Outlook

Broader markets have started outperforming along with the Nifty. Select stocks from the infrastructure sector may witness renewed momentum amid a sustained broader market recovery. Cement stocks like UltraTech Cement are likely to perform better in the coming trading sessions along with the ongoing recovery in sectoral peers like Ambuja Cement and ACC.

Since May 2021, UltraTech has taken support near Rs 6600-6700 levels on multiple instances. Also, looking at the significant delivery volume activity in May 2021 and then in mid-June 2021, these levels seem very crucial. In such a scenario, the positive bias may continue in the stock till these levels are held.

UltraTech Cement share price fell 1 percent in early trade on May 10 after the company reported its March quarter numbers.

The country's largest cement manufacturer on May 7 registered a 45.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in consolidated profit at Rs 1,775.23 crore for the quarter ended March 2021. But the adjusted profit grew by 57 percent, compared to Rs 1,129 crore in the year-ago quarter.

Also Read - UltraTech Cement Q4 profit falls 45%; revenue, operating numbers beat estimates

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after March earnings:

Nomura | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 7,650

It was a good Q4 with a beat on all counts. The EBITDA was ahead on stronger volume, while profit was impacted by lower other income.

The key downside risks include extended lockdowns impacting cement demand, while lower cement prices & a sharp increase in operating costs are also risks.

CLSA | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 7,500

Consolidated EBITDA of 12% was above our estimate & debt reduction is on track. The blended realisation was higher-than-expected while costs were largely in line.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 8,050

While it is ramping up its under-utilized acquired capacities, it also has a strong pipeline of expansion projects that offers strong growth visibility.

We estimate 11%/19% CAGR in consolidated EBITDA/PAT over FY21-23E, driven by 11% CAGR in volumes, lower operating costs, and lower interest costs.

At 09:36 hrs, UltraTech Cement was quoting at Rs 6,407.25, down Rs 77.55, or 1.20 percent on the BSE.

The share touched a 52-week high of Rs 7,050 and a 52-week low of Rs 3,235 on 09 April, 2021 and 07 May, 2020, respectively.

Currently, it is trading 9.12 percent below its 52-week high and 98.06 percent above its 52-week low.

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

Cement industry in general and Ultratech in particular are expected to see weak demand in April as key states have imposed a lockdown as COVID-19 cases rise. Cement price hikes in early April have withstood in the Southern and Eastern regions while there has been Rs. 10-20 per bag correction in a few micro-markets in North and West. The company’s 19.5 mtpa expansion plan at a cost of Rs. 6,527 crore (without affecting de-leveraging plan) to ensure industry outperformance over the next 4-5 years.



Outlook

We maintain a Buy on Ultra Tech Cement (Ultra Tech) with an unchanged PT of Rs. 8,000 as we envisage that the COVID-led impact on volumes would be short-lived; structural growth drivers for a bounce back are intact.

The Supreme Court has sought response from the Centre on an appeal challenging a National Green Tribunal order that dismissed a plea against grant of environmental clearance (EC) for a limestone mining project of UltraTech Cement in Bhavnagar district in Gujarat.

A bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah issued notices to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Gujarat Pollution Control Board, UltraTech Cement, Uncha Kotda Gram Panchayat and others.

""Issue notice. Counter affidavit be filed within a period of four weeks. Rejoinder affidavit, if any, be filed within a period of four weeks thereafter. List the Civil Appeal after eight weeks,"" the bench said.

The NGT had on September 24, 2020 dismissed the plea filed by the petitioners noting that the project proponent has explained with reference to the documents that the public notice was duly issued through the concerned statutory authorities and the Panchayats in the area supported the project.

As regards fresh public hearing after revising of the Mining Plan, the Expert Appraisal Committee held that such fresh public hearing was not required as the mining area was reduced by less than 5 per cent and concerns of all the stakeholders had already been duly addressed, the NGT had noted.

Senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, appearing for the petitioner, told the top court that the order of the National Green Tribunal demonstrates that there was no independent application of mind or reasoning in regard to the objections which were raised by the appellants to the grant of the environment clearance certificate.

The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by Gabhabhai Devabhai Chauhan and others against grant of EC by the Ministry of Environment and Forests for the project Limestone Mine"" of M/s UltraTech Cement with production capacity of 2.074 million tonnes per annum located at Villages-Kalsar, Dayal & Kotda, in Bhavnagar.

The petitioners claim to be residents of the three villages where limestone mining will be undertaken.

According to the petitioners, the grant of EC was mechanical, without a meaningful public hearing and ignoring several vital aspects.",353,

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech (UTCEM)’s 3QFY21 result was impressive on multiple counts. While volume growth was above industry at 14% YoY, it did not come at the cost of margins, with EBITDA/unit strong at INR1,296/t (+29% YoY). Moreover, net debt fell INR27.0b QoQ to INR94.4b (0.84x TTM EBITDA). n We raise our above-consensus FY21–22E PAT by 4–5% for FY21–22 and TP to INR6,650 on strong volumes. It remains our top large-cap pick in the sector.

Outlook

We value UTCEM at 14x Dec’22E EV/EBITDA to arrive at TP of INR6,650. Reiterate Buy.

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

Cement demand remained buoyant in Q3FY21 also with east region operating almost at 100% capacity utilisation. Rest all other regions barring south operated at over 80% leading to average capacity utilisation of 80% for the company in Q3. Better asset utilisations and use of low cost fuel inventory kept cost of production down 5% YoY on a per tonne basis that helped the company to achieve better margins. The full impact of higher petcoke prices would get reflected in numbers from Q1FY22 onwards. EBITDA/t for the quarter was at Rs 1,290/t (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 1,155/t). PAT growth of 141% YoY to Rs 1,550 crore is mainly attributable to improved sales volumes along with reduced costs. On the M&A front, the 14.6 MT cement plants acquired during the previous financial year have been well integrated and operating with capacity utilisations of over 80%. On the leverage front, the company has successfully reduced its net debt/EBITDA ratio to 0.73x from 1.74x last year and 1.1x last quarter. On the recent announcement of entering into paint business by promoter Grasim Industries, the company has clarified it will continue to focus on the cement business only. However, there could be a possibility of cross selling opportunities depending upon the situation.

Outlook

We maintain BUY rating with a revised TP of Rs 6300/share (i.e. 13.5x FY23E EV/EBITDA).

UltraTech Cement share price touched 52-week high of Rs 5,831.80, adding 5 percent in the early trade on January 25 after the company announced its December quarter earnings.

The company in the quarter-ended December 2020 posted consolidated net profit at Rs 1,584 crore versus Rs 711 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.

Revenue of the company was up 17.4% at Rs 12,254.1 crore versus Rs 10,439.3 crore.

Here are brokerage views on the stock and on the company post the December quarter numbers:

CLSA

Research house has kept outperform call and raised target to Rs 6,230 from Rs 6,000. The Q3 meaningfully ahead of estimates but cost pressure looms, while it was a strong Q3 results on higher volume & better profitability.

The rise in fuel costs is likely to weaken profitability. Company is our top pick among large cap cement companies. It has a limited upside due to near-term margin pressure & fair valuation, reported CNBC-TV18.

Prabhudas Lilladher

Company reported strong set of Q3FY21 earnings with 11% beat on our EBITDA estimates. Company successfully integrated acquired operations of Century cement (14.6mnt), JP associate (22.4mnt) and Binani cement (6.3mnt) within guided timeline and profitability. Backed by sound B/S (Net debt/EBITDA at 0.7x) and steady cash flows, company embarks on next round of growth with 19.5mnt of new capacities along with sizeable investment in high payback and environment friendly renewable power (WHR) to increase its share to 34% by FY24 from current 13% of overall power requirement.

Led by its dominant size (22% market share) and highly efficient operations, we believe that company stands out as the best candidate to play recovery in the sector. We reiterate buy with target price of Rs 6,100, EV/EBITDA of 14x FY23e.

Motilal Oswal

Company’s strong pan-India distribution network and preferred supplier status for key infrastructure projects places it well to tap into expected growth in both retail and institutional (non-trade) cement demand in India. While it is ramping up its under-utilized acquired capacities, it also has a strong pipeline of expansion projects that offers strong growth visibility.

We estimate a 14%/28% CAGR in consolidated EBITDA/PAT over FY20–23E, driven by a 7% volume CAGR and lower operating/interest cost. The valuation is reasonable at 13.4x FY22E EV/EBITDA, a ~ 20% discount to peer Shree. We value stock at 14x Dec’22E EV/EBITDA to arrive at target price of Rs 6,650. Reiterate buy.

Further, demand outlook is expected to remain strong for FY2022 and FY2023, with demand expected to outstrip incremental capacity addition.

Improving demand and limited capacity additions are also expected to maintain healthy pricing discipline in the sector going ahead. We have increased our estimates for FY2021-FY2023E, factoring higher volume offtake considering strong pick up in cement demand to sustain going ahead. We continue to maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a revised price target of Rs 6,700.

Company will continue to witness healthy operating cash flow (average Rs 93.5 bn/year) and free cash flow (average Rs66.8 bn/year) leading to further deleveraging (Net D:E of 0.01x in FY23E vs. 0.42x FY20). UTCEM, being the largest player in Indian cement industry is its biggest advantage coupled with 19.5 mtpa expansion augurs well for growth.

Thus, we maintain buy with an upward revised target price of Rs 6,724 based on 15x (in line with 5-year average) consolidated FY23E EV/EBITDA.

Aditya Birla group firm UltraTech Cement on Saturday reported over two-fold jump in consolidated net profit to Rs 1,584.58 crore in the December quarter. The leading cement producer had posted a net profit of Rs 711.17 crore in the October-December quarter a year ago, UltraTech Cement said in a BSE filing.

Its revenue from operations stood at Rs 12,254.12 crore, up 17.38 per cent, during the quarter under review as against Rs 10,439.34 crore in the corresponding period of the last fiscal. UltraTech Cement's total expenses were at Rs 10,190.03 crore in the third quarter of the financial year 2020-21, as against Rs 9,611.08 crore, down 6.29 per cent.

During the quarter, it had a volume growth of 14 per cent to 22.82 million tonne, it said. ""Recovery from the COVID-19 led to the disruption of the economy. This has been fuelled by quicker demand stabilisation, supply-side restoration and greater cost efficiencies,"" UltraTech Cement said in a post earning statement.

While rural and semi-urban housing continues to drive growth, pick-up in the government-led infrastructure aided incremental cement demand. ""Pent-up urban demand is expected to improve with the gradual return of the migrant workforce,"" it added.

Though fuel prices have increased in recent months, operational efficiencies and tight control over costs are reflected in the company's 26 per cent operating margin. ""Focus on reducing debt continues. Net debt reduction during Q3FY21 was Rs 2,696 crore and year-to-date, it was Rs 7,424 crore,"" it said.

During the quarter, UltraTech's Board approved Capex of Rs 5,477 crore towards increasing capacity by 12.8 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) with a mix of – brownfield and greenfield expansion – in the fast-growing markets of the east, central and north regions of the country. ""This expansion is in addition to the company's 6.7 mtpa capacity addition that is currently underway in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal, which has picked up the pace and is expected to get commissioned by financial year 2022, in a phased manner,"" it said.

After completion, UltraTech's capacity will grow to 136.25 mtpa, reinforcing its position as the third-largest cement company in the world, outside of China. Over the outlook, the company said: With strong rural growth, revival in manufacturing sentiment, buoyancy in GST and tax collections, UltraTech expects demand to grow on the back of the government's push on infrastructure projects.""",402,0.6581239998340607

How the sector performed in 2020?

For the cement sector, 2020 was a remarkable year. With imposition of lockdown in March, the initial expectation was an industry de-growth of 15-20 percent YoY for FY21. However, a buoyant demand scenario in the rural and individual house builder (IHB) segment combined with the support from off-take in the government infrastructure projects provided a fillip to the industry, with the current revised expectation of flattish growth for FY21.

Among regions, eastern and central markets spearheaded the demand growth for the industry followed by north. The demand scenario in the south and west remained soft as these regions were hit hard hit by COVID-19 spread.

On the pricing side, cement prices post relaxation of lockdown have maintained a sturdy trajectory, with the southern region optically witnessing the sharpest increase (primarily by low base). On the costs front, though there was a sharp surge in diesel prices, pet-coke consumption cost remained soft for the most part of the year before increasing from Q4CY20 onwards. Cumulatively, these factors led to lifetime high profitability and lifetime high quarterly EBITDA for the majority of cement companies during Q2-Q3CY20.

Which stocks performed/underperformed in 2020?

Related stories Kunal Shah Analyst - Institutional Equities|Yes Securities

Led by 4 MTPA capex commissioning of JK Cement, it clearly outperformed in the cement pack followed by other midcap stocks like India Cements, Ramco Cement and Birla Corporation.

Expectations from 2021?

We expect the demand scenario to remain healthy with a higher contribution from infrastructure and real estate segment in 2021. Among regions, we expect the eastern market to continue to outperform followed by the west and south (low base) and sustainable demand scenario in northern and central markets. We expect profitability for the sector to have peaked in Q3CY20 as the industry may witness pricing pressure and the pinch of higher input costs from 2021. We expect pricing in the east to be under severe pressure as the total capacity of around 8 MTPA is expected to be commissioned in 2021. Further, we estimate pricing discipline to be perturbed in the south.

Which stock(s) will do well in 2021?

We expect stocks like Birla Corporation in midcaps to outperform as it commissions around 4 MTPA greenfield capacity in 2021, while we prefer UltraTech Cement in largecaps post its recent capex announcement.

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

Against the backdrop of weak sentiments due to the pandemic, UltraTech’s operating performance in H1FY21 improved sharply led by strong demand from rural segment, better pricing environment and benign costs. The improved outlook also led to reinstatement of capex plans by the company that were halted earlier post imposition of lockdown in April 2020. Utilisation also crossed 80% during October-November 2020 vs. 69% in Q2FY21 with plant utilisation in eastern and central region remaining even higher supported by strong demand. To cope with the issue of capacity constraint in future, the company has announced 12.8 MT new capacity addition. This involves capex of Rs 5477 crore i.e. capex of <$60/t, which is below industry replacement cost of $100/t as 72% of capacity is brownfield. The expected IRR on these new capacities is ~15% vs. current RoCE of 11.4% due to lower capex per tonne. With these expansions, UltraTech’s total capacity would reach ~131 MT by FY23E with long term plan to be at 160 MT. We believe these new capacities would not only improve its reach and network but also aid in reduction in lead distance as well. Further, deployment of strong operating cash towards capacity expansion in an efficient manner along with deleveraging would improve return ratios. Hence, we continue to remain positive on the company from a long term perspective.

Outlook

Given the positive outlook, the newly announced capex targeting central and east region would address the issue of capacity constraint post FY24E. Furthermore, organic expansion at lower capital costs (US$60/t) will boost return ratios (new capacity to generate 15%+ IRR). With a target to become net debt free by FY23E and 27% earnings CAGR in FY20-23E, we believe valuations of 10.6x FY23E EV/EBITDA and US$156 EV/t are attractive.

HDFC Securities' research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech (UTCEM) has charted out its expansion plans for the next three years, whereby it will increase its grey cement/ clinker capacity in India by 19.5/11.4mn MT respectively, entailing a total Capex of Rs 65.3bn. Post this, its cement capacity in India will increase to 130mn MT by end FY23E/early FY24E. These should support its volume growth visibility FY24E onwards. The Capex rate is low, owing to ~50% brownfield expansions and lower clinker expansion needs. Multiple split GUs and WHRS additions will also help control operating cost, supporting its strong margins. We continue to like UTCEM for its robust margin outlook and debt reduction.

Outlook

We maintain BUY with an unchanged TP of Rs 5,670/share (15x Sep’22E consolidated EBITDA).

UTCEM has announced capacity expansion program to expand its India cement capacity by 19.5 mtpa to 130.9 mtpa (FY23) from 111.4 mtpa (FY20). This expansion consists of 6.7 mtpa ongoing expansion and 12.8 mtpa proposed expansion with a capex of Rs10.5 bn and Rs54.8 bn respectively totaling to Rs65.3 bn. UTCEM plans to commission 2.0/ 4.7/ 12.8 mtpa capacity in FY21/ FY22/ FY23. This capex is spread across East and Central and minor in North/ West region. The average cost of these projects is less than $60/ tn thus strengthening overall ROCE. UTCEM is also planning to add 11.4 mtpa clinker capacity, out of which 2.3 mtpa (Dalla) to be commissioned by FY22 and rest 9.1 mtpa in FY23. We expect 5.6%/ 9.1%/ 17.1% revenue/ EBITDA/ APAT CAGR over FY20-23E led by -1.5%/ 8.0%/ 7.0% volume growth and 1.3%/ 1.0%/ 1.0% realization growth in FY21E/ FY22E/ FY23E. We broadly maintain our estimates for FY21E/ FY22E/ FY23E as we previously factored 5.6 mtpa capacity addition in FY22E vs. 6.7 mtpa now and proposed expansion of 12.8 mtpa to contribute marginally in FY23E volume as it will commence from Q3FY23 (4.1 mtpa) and Q4FY23 (8.7 mtpa).

Motilal Oswa's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech (UTCEM)’s announcement today of organic expansion of 19.5mtpa (19%) by FY23 is positive on multiple counts – 1) it provides visibility on above-industry volumes at a 10% CAGR over FY21–24E, 2) it is incrementally positive for ROCE as expansion is at a cost of only ~USD55/t, implying ROCE of ~14% (v/s 10% currently), and 3) it addresses capital allocation concerns as cash flows over the next two years are deployed in the core business. Despite the expansion, we estimate UTCEM to turn net cash by 1HFY23. Reiterate Buy and the top-pick status in the Cement sector.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech (UTCEM) approved new capacity expansion of 12.8mtpa. It would incur total capital outlay of Rs54.8bn with attractive capex cost of USD58/t, significantly below standard cost of USD75-80/t. This expansion is over and above the ongoing expansion of 6.7mnt. Nearly 52% of its new capacity would come in East region, which is already facing sharp surge in supplies. Intense competition pushed margins to new lows of Rs850-900/t in the region. However, lower margins were compensated by strong volume growth. We believe that strong fundamentals of the region and near bottomed out margins augur well for the expansion with aided advantage of low capex cost and superior logistics. Rest of the expansion is dedicated in attractive markets of North and Central India. Ultratech (UTCEM) enjoys one of the best earnings quality in the cement sector, led by high trade share and efficient operations.

Outlook

We reiterate BUY on UTCEM with TP of Rs5,400, EV/EBITDA of 15x FY22e.

UltraTech Cement, the country's largest cement maker, on December 3 announced a Rs 5,477-crore investment to add 12.8 million tonnes (MT) capacity, taking its overall output to over 136 MT per annum.

In a statement, the company said its board in a meeting approved capacity expansion to the tune of 12.8 MT per annum with a mix of brown-field and green-field expansion. Upon completion of the latest round of expansion, Ultratech's capacity will grow to 136.25 MT per annum, reinforcing its position as the third-largest cement company in the world, outside of China.

""The additional capacity will be created in the fast-growing markets of the eastern, central and northern regions,"" the company said. This expansion includes the existing approval for cement plant at Pali in Rajasthan, in addition to the existing 6.7 MT per annum capacity expansion currently underway in UP, Odisha, Bihar and Bengal.

The expansion will get commissioned by FY22, in a phased manner, the company added. ""The capital outlay, given the current economic backdrop, is a marker of UltraTech's ascent from being the country's No.1 cement player to a national champion,"" Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla was quoted as saying in the statement.

The cement industry has been witnessing healthy volumes after the relaxation in lockdowns, on the back of the government's thrust on infrastructure, underlying demand from the rural economy and individual home builders, he added. ""Given our pan-India presence which will be further strengthened by the capacity expansion, we will be well positioned to support the rising demand for cement in the country,"" Birla said.

Commercial production from the new capacities is expected to go on stream in a phased manner by the final quarter of FY23, Birla said, adding that the capacity addition will not impact the ongoing deleveraging programme to make UltraTech debt free by the time the expansion programme is completed.",321,0.8838018178939819

Sharekhan's research repor on UltraTech Cement

In Q2FY2021, UltraTech displayed outstanding performance led by higher than expected volume growth, rise in OPM and reduction in net debt. Rise in pet coke prices is expected to get replicated with cheaper imported coal limiting the impact on profitability going ahead. FY2022 expected to be a strong year in terms of volume growth which along with limited capacity addition is expected to maintain a healthy pricing discipline trend in the industry benefitting UltraTech.



Outlook

We maintain Buy on UltraTech Cement (UltraTech) with a revised PT of Rs. 5,500, expecting strong rural demand to sustain, expected pick up in infrastructure execution and healthy pricing discipline.

Recommendation

Buy UltraTech Cement in range of Rs 3910-3970, Target: Rs 4550, Stop Loss: Rs 3645

Time frame: Three months

Derivatives & Quantitative Outlook

Broader markets have started outperforming along with the Nifty. Select stocks from the infrastructure sector may witness renewed momentum amid a sustained broader market recovery. Cement stocks like UltraTech Cement are likely to perform better in the coming trading sessions along with the ongoing recovery seen in sectoral peers like Ramco Cement and ACC. Since 2017, UltraTech has taken support near Rs 3800 levels on multiple instances. Also, looking at the significant delivery volume activity in March 2020 and then in mid-May 2020, these levels seem very crucial. In such a scenario, the positive bias may continue in the stock till these levels are held.

ICICI Securities research report on UltraTech Cement

UTCEM is likely to be the key beneficiary of expected demand recovery post monsoon, given its low utilisation vs larger peers especially in North / Central regions and expected demand improvement in South / West regions from H2FY21E. Acquired assets of Binani and Century may see gradual ramp-up after operating at 60-65% utilisation in FY20. UTCEM’s strong profitability would further increase with 10% fixed costs reduction (Rs5bn p.a or Rs60/te.), improving profitability of Century’s assets, better cost efficiencies and operating leverage. With better profitability and minimal organic capex plan, UTCEM is likely to turn debt free by FY23E.

Outlook

We maintain our FY21E-FY22E EBITDA (~15% ahead of consensus) with unchanged target price at Rs5,100/share (13x Mar’22E EV/E). Valuation at 10xFY22E EV/E is attractive, in our view. Maintain BUY.

Largest cement manufacturer Ultratech Cement has lined up investment of Rs 1,500 crore in FY21 in multiple initiatives, its chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said on Wednesday.

The company is also targeting to increase its annual capacity to 118 million tonnes from 114.8 million tonnes currently, he informed the company's shareholders during its virtual annual general meeting.

Birla, who heads the diversified conglomerate Aditya Birla Group, said periods of turmoil create champions, adding that Ultratech has the capacity, leadership across markets and a strong balance sheet to emerge as one.

""Your company has planned total capex cash outlay of Rs 1,500 crore for a range of key initiatives,"" he informed the shareholders.

This will include spends on installing 66 MW of waste heat recovery systems (WHRS), 1.2 million tonnes per annum brownfield cement capacity addition in West Bengal and Bihar, pending work for phase 2 of Bara grinding unit in Uttar Pradesh, coal block development in Madhya Pradesh, new ready mix concrete plants and other plant upkeep capex, he said.

The consolidated cement capacity will stand augmented to 118 million tonnes per annum, and green power capacity will increase to 185 MW for WHRS and over 350 MW for solar and wind power, he said.

Birla said the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdowns had resulted in temporary halting of operations of the company, across locations, as per government directives, but started back soon with a set of standard operating protocols designed in-house.

He said urban areas have suffered a severe impact of the pandemic, while the economic disruption in rural economy appears to be less severe.

The ongoing FY21 will be a ""challenging year"", but growth will come back in the next fiscal, he said, exuding confidence of attaining a growth rate between 6-8 percent in FY22.

Birla said the company was able to reduce costs by 21 percent in the June quarter as compared to the same period a year-ago and also reduced its net debt by Rs 2,209 crore during the April-June period on the back of working capital management and control on cash flows.",354,0.1436408587864467

Leading cement maker UltraTech Cement expects a ""subdued performance"" in the wake of weak real estate and overall slowdown in the economy coupled with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, according the company's annual report for 2019-20.

The nationwide lockdown, amid the coronavirus outbreak, will have a significant near-term impact on the cement industry, however, the Aditya Birla Group firm is ""confident of its ability to weather the storm"" and come out stronger given its healthy credit profile.

Besides, the company also expects ""significant near-term impact"" on the cement industry on account of the nationwide lockdown, amid the coronavirus outbreak, which disrupted the production, market and supply chain.

""Increase in government spends on health and public welfare; weak real estate and an overall slowdown in the economy is expected to reflect in a subdued performance of your company in the current financial year.

“Nonetheless, given your company's healthy credit profile, it is confident of its ability to weather the storm and come out stronger,” said UltraTech Cement in the ‘Directors' Report and Management Discussion and Analysis'.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

According to the company - with anticipated pick-up in private investment, financial sector reforms, resolution of stressed assets under IBC and positive interventions by the government, the “outlook for fiscal 2020-21 was seen to remain largely positive”. However, the world was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and India was no exception, where the government had imposed lockdown from March 25 to curb the spread of the virus. The industry was allowed to operate only from April 20.

This had brought cement dispatches of UltratTech to a complete halt and as a result, volumes were negligible during the last week of March 2020 and the whole of April 2020.

""The nationwide lockdown, amid the coronavirus outbreak, will have a significant near-term impact on the cement industry. While the sector witnessed robust demand prior to the lockdown, the event led to the closure of all major cement plants, including those of your Company, and cessation of construction activities at the sites,"" it said.

While talking about the cement industry, UltraTech said after witnessing a healthy demand growth of around 13 percent in FY19, it exhibited a decline in growth in FY20 as demand was sluggish in the first half.

The demand for construction material is fundamentally driven by the economic growth in the country and an economic slowdown and subdued infrastructural development might lead to a slowdown in construction projects, leading to a reduction in cement consumption in the country, it said.

According to UltraTech, growth in construction activity in the country has been slow over the last few years, impacting cement demand.

""In a scenario where incremental cement demand exceeds incremental capacity addition, the government's push on infrastructure and housing will aid the growth in cement consumption and reduce the overcapacity gap,"" it said.

UltraTech's consolidated net turnover in FY2020 was at Rs 41,476 crore, in which the domestic market had contributed Rs 39,588 crore and Rs 1,888 crore from exports.

After acquisition of the cement business of Century Textiles and Industries Ltd, UltraTech has a consolidated capacity of 114.8 million tons per annum (MTPA) and is the only company outside of China to have 100 MTPA plus capacity in a single country.

Its cement production in FY2020 was at 76.57 million tonnes, lower by 2 percent as compared to 77.87 million tonnes in the previous year.

“This is mainly attributable to the de-growth in the cement industry, witnessed after 20 years. Consequently, capacity utilisation was also lower at 69 percent as compared to 76 percent last year,” it said.",882,-0.3659277637799581

Arihant Capital 's research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech witnessed slowdown in Q1FY20 with the advent of Corona virus and nation-wide lockdown. Consolidated revenue stood at Rs 7,634 Cr, a decline of 33.2% YoY/29.0% QoQ, EBITDA stood at Rs 2,075 Cr, shrinking by 29.7% YoY/15.1% QoQ and PAT at Rs 797.4 Cr decreasing by 37.8% YoY/75.4% QoQ. The sharp decline in revenue could be attributed to the Covid-19 induced lockdown which saw sales volume decline by 22% (17.86 million tonne in Q1FY20 to 13.94 million tonne). The net debt fell down to Rs 14,651 Cr in Q1FY21 from Rs 16,680 Cr in Q1FY20. The cement major is on the right track to integrate the acquired assets over last financial year into its internal brand and units.

Outlook

Hence, we upgrade upwards our exit EV/EBITDA multiple 17.0x of its FY22E estimates, which yields a revised target price of Rs 4,660 and maintain ACCUMULATE rating.

HDFC Securities' research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech reported strong earnings beat in 1QFY21, driven by robust fixed cost reduction. Consolidated revenue/EBITDA/APAT fell 33/30/30% YoY to Rs 76.33/20.75/9.03bn. Volume fell 32% YoY, on sharper volume decline across the south and Maharashtra. UltraTech also reported robust fixed cost control in 1Q, which cushioned the earnings impact. Strong margins and working capital reduction continues to help UltraTech reduce leverage. As retail sales remain less impacted and as non-trade expected to pick up in 2HFY21E, we expect slower volume decline of 16% in FY21 and 21% rebound in FY22E.

Outlook

We expect stable realisation YoY, subdued energy cost outlook, and healthy cost controls to drive 5% EBITDA CAGR (FY20-23E), despite a 13% decline in FY21E. We maintain BUY with a target price of Rs 4,915.

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement reported a better than estimated Q1FY21 performance. Cement demand improved and remained buoyant since lifting of lockdown. The company ended Q1FY21 with 46% capacity utilisation. East and central plants operated at healthy capacity utilisation while demand in western regions remained weak. Bulk of cement has come from IHB segment in rural and semi urban areas while demand in urban areas remained weak due to labour migration and localised lockdowns. Realisations across all regions stayed healthy. On the cost front, UltraTech reduced fixed overheads by 21% in the quarter. This and higher realisations, led to a sharp rebound in margins in the quarter. On a sustainable basis, the company is targeting a reduction of fixed overheads by 10% leading to annual saving of ~Rs 500 crore. Currently, plants are running at 60-65% utilisation on companywide capacity. With improved liquidity position (led by reduced w/cap need, demand recovery), the company has now revised its capex guidance upwards to Rs 1500 crore for FY21E vs. earlier guidance of Rs 1000 crore.

Outlook

UltraTech has sailed through tough times in the past and also managed to protect its B/S despite making large acquisitions. The management focus on gaining retail share, cost optimisation and better integration of acquired assets has improved overall performance in this challenging environment. Its pan-India presence, combined with management pedigree and B/S strength also augur well for long-term growth. Thus, we maintain our BUY rating with a revised target price of Rs 4,850 (i.e. at 13.5x FY22E EV/EBITDA).

Emkay Global Financial's report on Ultratech Cement

UTCEM’s Q1 results beat estimates, boosted by higher grey cement realization (up 9.2% qoq vs. estimated 6.8%) and lower opex. Consolidated EBITDA came in at Rs20.7bn vs. estimated Rs16.9bn, while EBITDA/ton stood at Rs1,416 vs. estimated Rs1,159. Key positives: 1) 21% yoy fall in fixed costs; 2) Rs22.1bn reduction in net debt, and net debt/EBITDA of 1.44x vs. 1.55x in Q4FY20; 3) 4% yoy/2.4% qoq decline in Opex/ton; and 4) record high EBITDA/ton of Rs1,416 (up 2.8% yoy). Key negative was a 40% yoy decline in white cement segment’s volume and 73% yoy decline in RMC revenues. Management believes that the 10% reduction in overheads is sustainable. The utilization of its plants is at 60-65% vs. 64% in July’19. Capex guidance has been increased to Rs15bn vs. Rs10bn earlier (to be spent on WHRS, etc.) as the outlook has improved.



Outlook

We raise EBITDA estimates by 30.7%/16.2%/15.9% for FY21/22/23 on higher realization and cost savings. UTCEM will benefit from cost reduction initiatives. Debt reduction will help in improving the balance sheet further. UltraTech remains our preferred large-cap pick with a Buy rating and OW in sector EAP.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

UTCEM posted strong set of Q1FY21 earnings on the back of lower fixed costs. EBITDA fell 30% YoY at Rs19.6bn, above our/consensus estimates by 22%/18%. EBITDA/t rose 6% YoY at Rs1,400 (PLe:Rs1,170) on the back of 3% YoY reduction in cost and 2.5% increase in realisations. Cement demand positively surprised us as well as the street with decline of 12% YoY in May (against street expectation/PLe of 40%/15% drop) and growth of 1% YoY in June (against street estimate/PLe of 15%/5% drop). Based on our channel checks, demand remained stable in July despite early monsoons and local lockdowns. On prices front, we remain confident on sustainability of tight discipline given the demand uncertainty and delay in ongoing capacity expansions. The major positive surprise came on the cost reduction and its sustainability going forward. Sustainable reduction of 10% in fixed overheads, higher operating leverage and lower coal costs would help keep costs under control. Hence, we upgrade EBITDA estimates by 10%/8% for FY21e/FY22e to factor in higher realisations and lower costs.



Outlook

We remain bullish on UTCEM due to its dominant size (with capacity of 112mnt and market share of 22%) and highly efficient operations. We reiterate BUY with revised TP of Rs4,675, EV/EBITDA of 14x FY22E.

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

In Q1FY2021, UltraTech reported strong beat on operational performance, largely driven by reduction in key input costs. Reduction in net debt was aided by reduction in working capital requirements. The company has increased capex for FY2021 by Rs. 500 crore to Rs. 1,500 crore, highlighting confidence in improving demand environment going ahead. Expect rural demand to sustain on back of good monsoon while labourers returning to project sites and the government kickstarting infrastructure investments to aid in revising non-trade demand from Q3FY2021.



Outlook

We maintain Buy on UltraTech Cement (UltraTech) with a revised PT of Rs. 5,000, factoring revision in earnings estimates for FY2021E-FY2022E and marginally revising upwards our valuation multiple.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement (UTCEM)’s result highlights the execution of its planned cost rationalization and de-leveraging roadmap. Despite negative operating leverage (volumes down 32% YoY), the company reported the highest ever EBITDA/t of INR1,416, led by cost reduction across heads of expenditure. Net debt also declined by INR22b (13%) QoQ to INR147b (1.7x EBITDA). We raise our consolidated PAT estimate by 23%/11% for FY21/FY22 after factoring lower operating costs as well as lower finance cost (on account of faster de-leveraging). Besides strong FCF, non-core asset sales should further aid de-leveraging. Reiterate Buy.

Outlook

The stock is also trading 35% cheaper than peer Shree Cement v/s the historical average of 10%. We value UTCEM at 13x FY22E EV/EBITDA to arrive at TP of INR4,830. Reiterate Buy.

Owing to a complete halt in construction activity during lockdown, the demand for cement saw a steep fall in the June quarter which will be reflected in the Q1FY21 cement sales volume of UltraTech Cement.

The company will release its June quarter numbers on July 28 in which management commentary on the outlook of cement volume is likely to be in focus.

Brokerage firm IDBI Capital Markets & Securities (a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDBI Bank) expects UltraTech to report a 43 percent year-on-year (YoY) volume decline and 4 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) increase in realisation.

""Led by operating leverage, we expect opex to increase 15 percent QoQ to Rs 4,657/t and EBITDA / t to decline to Rs 789 against Rs 1,190 QoQ,"" IDBI Capital said.

The brokerage expects UltraTech's revenue to see a 44.6 percent YoY and 41.2 percent QoQ fall while net profit may plunge 109.8 percent YoY or 103.9 percent QoQ.

The estimates of Motilal Oswal Financial Services show that UltraTech's cement volumes may show a decline of 34 percent YoY while realisations is expected to increase 5.6 percent QoQ.

Net sales may fall 33.1 percent YoY while adjusted PAT may drop 59.3 percent YoY.

Kotak Institutional Equities estimates UltraTech's volumes of 13.3 mn tons (35 percent down YoY and 35 percent down QoQ) for the India operations in Q1FY21, factoring the impact of COVID-19.

""We expect blended realisations to increase by 4.9 percent QoQ, led by sharp price hikes in all key markets in May 2020, followed by a partial roll-back in June 2020,"" Kotak said.

Kotak expects energy cost to decline sequentially on consumption basis due to a fall in petcoke prices in the previous quarter.

""We estimate cement EBITDA/ton to increase to Rs 1,179/ton (up 2 percent QoQ, down 8 percent YoY) led by the higher realisation and lower variable costs offset by higher fixed cost with lower volumes.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Arihant Capital 's research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech witnessed slowdown in Q4FY20 with the advent of Corona virus and nation-wide lockdown. Consolidated revenue stood at Rs 10,746 Cr, a decline of 13.1% YoY/up 3.8% QoQ, EBITDA stood at Rs 2,443 Cr, shrinking by 3.9% YoY/increasing by 23.8% QoQ and PAT at Rs 3,243 Cr increasing significantly because of deferred tax accounted for the adoption of new corporate tax rates. The sharp decline in revenue could be attributed to the overall macro slowdown and an ultimate nation-wide lockdown brought upon by Covid-19 pandemic. The consolidated sales of cement by volume decreased to 21.44 million tonnes for Q4 FY20, a fall of 16% over Q4FY19, while annual sales volumes also fell to 82.33 million tonnes, a 4% fall over last year. The cement major was on the right track to reduce its long term debt levels and very healthy level of reserves to overcome the Covid crisis stronger than most other cement players.

Outlook

However, We continue to value the stock at 15.0x EV/EBITDA multiple of its FY22E estimates, which yields a revised target price of Rs 4,007 and downgrade to ACCUMULATE rating.

YES Securities' research report on UltraTech Cement

Total volumes for Q4FY20 stood at 21.4 MT (est. of 21.7 MT), down by 15.7% y/y due to lockdown measures. Sharp jump in utilization level of Century assets to ~83% during the quarter came in as a positive surprise. EBITDA was Rs 24.43 bn (-3.9% y/y) – in line with our estimates of Rs 24.4 bn. EBITDA/te stood at Rs 1,139, improving by 14% y/y led by stable pricing scenario and reduction in clinker production cost (which declined by 13.7% y/y). EBITDA/te for Century assets (ex-one time cost) was Rs 575 (flat y/y) vis-à-vis our estimates of Rs 595. Notwithstanding the fact that current utilization level of 60-70% for UTCEM is encouraging, we believe that there is limited room for further improvement of utilization level in the medium term as labour migration and arrival of monsoon would drag demand growth.



Outlook

Going ahead, we estimate volume/EBITDA CAGR of 5%/2.7% over FY20-FY22 respectively. Currently UTCEM is trading at EV/EBITDA at ~11.4x and EV/te of $134 on FY22E. Taking an average of EV/EBITDA and DCF derived values, we have a target of Rs 4,413/share (implied EV/EBITDA multiple of 14x on FY22E). We maintain our BUY rating on the stock.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

UTCEM reported Q4FY20 earnings in line with our and consensus estimates. It underperformed industry with sharper fall in volumes. However, we believe that it was calculated move to sacrifice volumes in order to expand realisations of Century cement through gradual migration to Ultratech brand. Century cement's realisations improved by Rs160/t with shift to Ultratech brand. Management expects Century cement's margins to increase to Rs800-900/t from current Rs575/t (+2.2x QoQ) with targeted 85% shift of volumes to Ultratech brand and lower operational costs.



Outlook

We remain bullish on UTCEM due to its well-diversified regional presence, dominant size (with capacity of 117mnt and market share of 22%) and highly efficient operations. Tight price discipline and lower costs would significantly lessen the impact of tepid demand due to Covid-19 outbreak. We reiterate BUY with TP of Rs4,350, EV/EBITDA of 14x FY22E.

Consolidated net debt reduced by Rs. 5,251 crore, leading to drop in net debt/EBITDA to 1.55x from 2.83x in FY2019. UltraTech is expected to delay new capacity addition, considering near-term impact of COVID-19 pandemic, while focus for FY2021 to be on cash conservation.



Outlook

We maintain Buy on UltraTech Cement (UltraTech) with a revised PT of Rs. 3,980,as we expect UltraTech to benefit from cement demand bounce back in FY2022 from government infrastructure spend and affordable housing.

HDFC Securities' research report on UltraTech Cement

We maintain BUY rating on UltraTech Cement with a TP of Rs 4,720 (15x FY22 consol EBITDA). In FY20, UltraTech’s profits surged, and it also reduced its working capital and debt on books. In FY21E, we expect falling energy costs to moderate the impact of an expected sharp 16% vol decline. However, we build in 21% vol recovery in FY22E (owing to its robust distribution) as demand normalises to drive earnings rebound in FY22E. In Q4FY20, amid sharp 16% vol fall (covid impact), falling energy costs and increased fixed cost controls boosted op margin to Rs 1,139/MT (+14% YoY).



Outlook

We maintain BUY with a TP of Rs 4,720 (15x FY22 consol EBITDA). We continue to ascribe it premium valuations (10% higher vs its 10yr avg) for its capacity & cost leadership and balance sheet discipline.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement (UTCEM)’s result instills confidence in its planned cost-rationalization and deleveraging roadmap. Despite lower operating leverage (volumes down 16% YoY), operating cost per ton increased only 1% YoY (-2% QoQ) which coupled with better realization drove a 14% YoY (and 13% QoQ) increase in EBITDA/t to INR1,138. Strong FCF helped the company reduce net debt sharply to INR169b (implying 1.55x net debt/EBITDA). - Our FY21/FY22 estimates are broadly unchanged, and we reiterate Buy. We expect net debt to decline further even in FY21 as the company has curtailed capex for the year and seeks to reduce cost as well. UTCEM remains our top pick in the sector.



Outlook

The stock is also trading 30% cheaper than peer Shree Cement v/s the historical average of 10%. We value UTCEM at a 13x FY22E EV/EBITDA to arrive at a target price of INR4,305. Reiterate Buy.

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement reported a better than estimated performance for Q4FY20. Sales dipped 13.5% YoY to Rs 10,360 crore (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 9,364 crore). The drop in revenue was driven by 16.4% YoY decline in volumes to 20.5 MT (vs. I-direct estimate: 17.8 MT), partly offset by 3.5% increase in realisations YoY to Rs 5,049/t (vs. I-direct estimate: Rs 5,260/t). On the profitability front, EBITDA margins expanded 163 bps YoY to 21.8% (vs. I-direct estimate of 23.3%) while absolute EBITDA declined 6.6% YoY to Rs 2,262 crore (vs. I-direct estimate: Rs 2,178 crore). EBITDA/t saw an increase of 11% YoY to Rs 1,103/t (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 1,223/t) driven by higher realisations. Net profit increased sharply YoY by 175% due to a reversal of deferred tax liability of Rs 1803 crore. Further, the company has restricted its total estimated capex outlay for FY21E at Rs 1000 crore citing increasing focus towards debt reduction and cash conservation.



Outlook

UltraTech has sailed through tough times in the past and also managed to protect its B/S despite making large acquisitions. Its pan-India presence, combined with management pedigree and B/S strength, should augur well in future as well. Unlike in the past where UltraTech traded in the range of $150-200 on an EV/t basis, it is hovering around $120 on FY22E EV. Also, on the EV/EBITDA front, it is trading at ~30% discount to its eight year average multiple. Thus, we maintain our BUY rating with a target price of Rs 4,200.For all recommendations report, click here

UltraTech Cement will release its December quarter numbers on January 24 and most brokerages are expecting a healthy PAT by softer volume growth due to weak sales in October and November 2019.

Other than the numbers, brokerages say an update on acquisitions and expansion will be the key things to watch out for.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services is of the view that UltraTech may report an 86.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in PAT while EBITDA margins may come at 20.2 percent.

However, Motilal expects net to be tepid, with a rise of 3.1 percent YoY, and flat grey cement volumes. Realisations may decline 3.8 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), it said.

Brokerage firm Kotak Securities expects a 2 percent volume growth led by stronger sales in December, partly offset by weaker sales in October and November.

Besides, the brokerage expects blended realisations to decline by 3 percent QoQ, led by sharp price declines in East and South during the quarter.

Kotak's estimates show the net sales of UltraTech Cement for Q3FY20 may have jumped 27.1 percent YoY and 15.4 percent QoQ.

""EBITDA is expected to see a 61.9 percent YoY jump and EBITDA margin will see a rise of 530 bps YoY. Reported PAT may see a sharp rise of 104.1 percent YoY or 43.4 percent QoQ,"" Kotak said.

Kotak expects cement EBITDA/ton to decline to Rs 1,125/ton (up 4 percent QoQ and 45 percent YoY) with weak realisations partly offset by lower costs.

Similarly, brokerage firm Emkay Global expects a 17.5 percent YoY rise in UltraTech's net sales for December quarter, while EBITDA and EBITDA margin are likely to see a 43 percent and 343 bps YoY jump, respectively.

Emkay estimates show a 70.1 percent YoY jump in PAT and a 14 percent YoY volume growth due to additional volume from cement plants of Century Textiles.

""We expect a 3 percent YoY growth for grey cement realization (down 3 percent QoQ). Opex/ton is expected to decline 1 percent YoY. EBITDA/ton is expected to be at Rs 969 against Rs 772 in Q3FY19,"" Emkay said.

We expect personal tax cuts in the Budget 2020, and we also expect the government to focus more on growth revival and take a more liberal approach on the fiscal deficit front, said Gautam Duggad, Head – Institutional Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q) What is your outlook for the year 2020? The year 2019 ended with gains of 10 percent, do you think we could do better in 2020?

A) I expect 2020 to be a story of two halves. The first half will be dominated by growth slowdown and concerns around fiscal stress.

The second half can see some recovery in macro growth and pick-up in corporate earnings. As far as the index level is concerned, we believe the Nifty50 can trade in a range of 11,000 – 13,500.

We also expect the market divergence/polarisation to improve and markets to get more broad-based in the second half.

Q) What are your expectations from the Budget? Do you think we could see a personal tax cut in the coming year? If yes, will it be a major booster for equity markets?

A) We expect personal tax cuts in the Budget 2020. We also expect the government to focus more on growth revival and take a more liberal approach on the fiscal deficit front.

We also expect the government to provide some relief on LTGC/DD. Yes, personal income tax cuts can revive market sentiment and provide a boost for markets.

Q) What are the sectors which are likely to hog limelight in the year 2020 and why?

A) Banking: Market share gains for private banks from PSU banks and NBFC to continue. The asset quality cycle turned around and can drive write-backs.

Telecom: Repairing of balance sheets of telecom players as a consequence of easing competitive intensity in the sector.

Automobiles: BS6 transition and rebound in Auto monthly numbers.

Q) Any top 5 stocks which you think are available at attractive valuations and can still be considered a buy on dips?

A) Here is a list of top 5 stocks which we think are trading at attractive valuations:

ICICI Bank:

ICICI Bank appears firmly positioned to deliver healthy sustainable growth supported by continued investments in technology and expansion in its digital offerings.

The bank has navigated well through the challenging macro environment with limited exposure to newly surfaced stressed names.

It has in fact built one of the highest provisioning coverage in the banking sector. ICICI Bank remains one of our top ideas in the BFSI space, and we estimate RoA/RoE to improve to 1.6 percent/15.7 percent in FY21.

State Bank of India:

SBI is well poised for an earnings recovery, led by its steady operating performance at the PPoP level (15 percent CAGR over FY19-21), recoveries from large NCLT resolutions, and normalization in credit cost to 2.2 percent/1.3 percent in FY20/21 (v/s average of 3.0 percent over FY16-19).

SBI inarguably has one of the best liability franchise (Its CASA mix: 45.1 percent). This puts it in a better position to manage yield pressure due to linking of loans to external benchmark.

SBI is aiming for 0.9 percent-1 percent RoA by FY21, while we conservatively expect RoA/RoE to improve to 0.7 percent/13.0 percent by FY21. Adjusted for subsidiaries, the standalone bank trades at 0.9x FY21E ABV.

UltraTech:

Since FY17, UltraTech Cement has grown its capacity by 65 percent to 109.4mmtpa, accounting for 23 percent of its all-India capacity. The company also has one of the highest exposures to the north and central regions, which have the best utilization and pricing outlook.

We expect OCF to be strong at >Rs 80 billion annually. At the same time, capex should be limited to ~ Rs 20 billion each in FY20 and FY21, driving strong FCF generation of > Rs 60 billion per annum (5 percent yield).

As a result, net debt is expected to reduce from Rs 191 billion in FY19 to Rs 135 billion in FY21. We forecast a CAGR of 30 percent in EBITDA and 42 percent in EPS over FY19-21, driven by a 14 percent CAGR in volumes and better margins. The stock trades at a reasonable valuations of 11x EV/EBITDA.

Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals:

It is the largest player in the fans and the residential pumps market. We expect rising premiumization in its existing portfolio. Crompton has been able to generate a healthy free cash flow of over Rs 8.2 billion from FY16 to FY19 v/s adj. PAT of Rs 9.8 billion over the same period, indicating FCF/PAT conversion at 0.8.

With strong profitability and an asset-light business model, return ratios are healthy – RoE/RoCE of 40 percent/28 percent in FY19. We expect the return ratios to remain at these levels going ahead.

We like the company for its strong product portfolio, established brand, market leadership, wide distribution network, robust RoE/RoCE profile and healthy free cash flow generating business model.

Ashok Leyland:

We expect cycles within cycles for commercial vehicles (CVs), with good growth during H2 CY19 and weak H1 CY20, though scrappage policy can boost volumes in FY21.

Unlike in the previous cycles, AL is on very strong footing (as it has a lean cost structure and net cash balance sheet) and is focused on adding new revenue/profit pools.

We believe that the worst is over for the CV industry though volumes will remain volatile due to upcoming BS6 transition. Valuations at ~22.7x FY21 EPS and ~11.5x EV/EBITDA are reasonable in view of early recovery cycle earnings.

Q) What should be the investment philosophy for investors in the year 2020?

A) Stick to leaders in categories where the growth horizon is not under threat. Focus on earnings visibility, management quality and yet do not overpay for the same.

Q) Do you think growth has bottomed out in the September quarter? And, the likely outperformers could be the small & midcaps in 2020 compared to largecaps?

A) We expect growth to have bottomed out at 4.5 percent for GDP in the September quarter. However, we believe the recovery will be very gradual. We expect Mid-caps to do better vs. Large-caps in 2020 as growth revives and earnings improve.

Q) Do you think earnings growth will start looking up from FY21?

A) Yes, we do expect the earnings to start looking up from FY21 led by low base of financials and pick-up in automobiles after 3 years of tepid performance. Our Nifty EPS estimates for FY20/21 are at Rs 538/683.

Q) What are your key takeaways or lessons for investors for the year 2019?

A) Markets and the economy can remain divergent in the short term.

During periods of a growth slowdown, valuations for select stocks can defy gravity if their growth and balance sheet is intact.

Management quality makes a huge difference to returns.

The bright side for equities is our long-term bearish outlook for oil and commodities, low core inflation and a good monsoon. I will, therefore, advocate at least a 65% asset allocation to equities if you have three-four years time horizon, Amar Ambani, Senior President and Head of Research–Institutional Equities, YES Securities, says in an interview to Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q) What is your outlook for 2020? The year 2019 is ending with gains of 10%, do you think the new year will be better?

A) The Nifty crossed the 12,000-mark on the back of a handful of names that are witnessing high investor interest. Large businesses are gaining at the expense of the rest, with consolidation in their industries due to regulatory changes, debt issues faced by many, DeMon (demonetisation) and GST disruption.

The benchmark indices are also higher on the hope that the government has swung into action and more measures like corporate tax cuts will come through.

Q) Do you have a Sensex or Nifty target for 2020? What is the basis of your assessment?

A) In the present context, our Nifty target for the year 2020 is 12,900, but with the rising risk of a sudden deep correction. Having said that, 2020 will be a year to firm up positions in equities as we believe that 2021 will bring a start to a secular rally.

Q) What are your expectations from the budget? Will we see a personal tax cut and will it boost equity markets?

A) The benchmark indices are also higher on hopes that the government has swung into action and more measures like corporate tax cuts will come through.

Many even expect refreshing changes in personal income tax slabs in the upcoming budget. The government has also shown intent by being firm on large-scale disinvestments.

We believe a global risk-on rally has also resumed with the quantum of negative-yielding bonds reducing and the trade war cooling off. In the case of India, the earnings yield of equities is a very attractive vis-a-vis fixed income.

Q) Which are the sectors likely to hog the limelight 2020 and why? Top 5 stocks which you think are available at attractive valuations and can still be considered a buy on dips?

A) We remain sanguine about banking and insurance from a sectoral overweight perspective. Stock specific, we like Reliance Industries, which is the cheapest growth stock among largecaps and will benefit from rising EBITDA in consumer-facing businesses and rising ROCE over the next two years.

We also like Ultratech, which is the price leader in cement and will benefit disproportionately from industry consolidation.

HDFC Bank is another one that will continue to gain market share in loans at the cost of weak public sector banks and NBFCs.

Q) What should be the investment philosophy in 2020?

A) The bright side for equities is our long-term bearish outlook for oil and commodities in general, low core inflation and a good monsoon. Things are also looking up for bad asset resolutions after the Essar settlement in NCLT recently.

I would, therefore, advocate at least a 65% asset allocation to equities if you have a three-four years time horizon.

Q) Do you think growth bottomed out in the September quarter? Will small and midcaps outperform largecaps in 2020?

A) Paradoxically though, the broader market (read mid and smallcaps) has been in a consolidation phase since the start of 2018.

The midcap rally that ended in 2018, will likely further consolidate in 2020 and recovery may coincide with the economy gaining steam.

For now, even as consumption has slowed, private investments are unlikely to gain momentum as capacity utilisation levels still hover around 74 percent.

Corporate tax incentives will only help in the medium to long term. Likewise, exports are unlikely to see a meaningful surge given the sticky infrastructure and credit challenges.

Shares of UltraTech Cement gained over a percent intraday on December 13 after Motilal Oswal said it is a high conviction idea, citing strong free cash flow.

""Given limited capex needs, strong free cash flow generation of more than Rs 7,500 crore per annum (7 percent yield) from FY20 should drive deleveraging and stock price appreciation,"" it said in a report.

Hence, net debt/EBITDA ratio is expected to reduce to 1.1x by March 2021 from 2.2x now and return on equity (RoE) is expected to rise by more than 550bp to 13.8 percent over FY19-21, driven by strong EBITDA growth (26 percent CAGR) and lower interest costs from deleveraging, the brokerage feels.

Motilal Oswal said the company's expanded capacity has provided it significant pricing power, particularly in Central/West India where it now has around 40 percent market share. ""North/Central are structurally the preferred regional markets for us, where UltraTech has highest exposure.""

It feels UltraTech is trading at around 35 percent discount to peer Shree Cement –10 years average: 15 percent.

""The stock is not ascribing any value to its more than 20 MMTPA low-cost brownfield expansion, wherein long-term growth visibility is good. We value UltraTech at 14x FY21E EV/EBITDA to arrive at a target price of Rs 5,050,"" the brokerage said while maintaining buy call on the stock.

Increase in domestic petcoke prices which is one of its key raw material is the only risk to its high conviction idea.

The stock was quoting at Rs 4,026.60, up Rs 35.60, or 0.89 percent on the BSE at 1032 hours IST.

UltraTech is the largest manufacturer of grey cement, ready mix concrete (RMC) and white cement in India with an installed capacity of 95 million tonnes (MT). The acquisition of Century’s cement asset and Binani increased its capacity to 109.4mt and took its pan-India market share to 24 percent.

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

Pan-India cement prices have fallen 3.1% q-o-q in Q3FY2020 (till date), although they are up 5.8% y-o-y as against -1.3% to +2.4% price variations seen in Q3 of the past five years. Sales volumes may get hit in Q3FY2020 due to weak government infrastructure spend, state elections, uncertainties arising due to change of state government and construction ban in Delhi-NCR. Higher cement prices and declining costs of key inputs costs to lend support in the wake of weak demand for Q3FY2020.

Outlook

We reiterate our Buy rating on UltraTech with an unchanged PT of Rs. 5,000, as we view recent correction in stock price owing to demand headwinds as an opportunity to invest, with structural growth triggers staying intact.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement (UTCEM) has underperformed the Sensex by 10% over the past three months due to weak cement demand and the dismal performance of the acquired Century Cement assets in 2QFY20. In this note, we present (a) the premise for our expectation of an improvement in profitability of Century and (b) the case studies on the turnaround of the other two acquisitions – JPA and Binani. With limited capex needs going forward, strong FCF generation (~7% yield) will likely drive deleveraging and 550bps improvement in RoE over the next two years. Against this promising backdrop, we maintain our positive stance on UTCEM – our top pick in the sector.

Outlook

The stock is not ascribing any value to its >20 MMTPA low-cost brownfield expansion wherein long-term growth visibility is good. We value UTCEM at 14x FY21E EV/EBITDA to arrive at a target price of INR5,050 (implied EV/t of USD185/t on FY21 capacity). Maintain Buy.

Or should we wait before putting fresh money into markets? Well, these questions are running in your mind, rest assured, you are not alone.

Investors are caught between FOMO which is fear of missing out the rally and fear as the market could witness profit taking at higher levels which could take the index lower.

The S&P BSE Sensex hit a fresh record high of 40,483 on Monday while the Nifty50 is still about 200 points away from hitting its record high above 12,103.

Well, the good news is that the rally is here to stay and experts see the momentum continue and take Nifty50 towards 12,700-13,000 in the next 12 months. Hence, we are in a good buy on dips market.

“We have a one-year forward target of 12,700 for Nifty 50 post-Q1 result, which we are maintaining. The outlook for the equity market has improved post the cut in corporate tax and interest rate, as well as, the reduction in the cost of raw material. All these factors have contributed to better than expected Q2 results,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“Earnings from H2FY20 is likely to better on account of good monsoon and stimulus from the government. A further interest rate cut from the RBI & Fed may improve the liquidity in the medium-term,” he said.

The latest corporate tax cuts are a structural move, and it would improve the corporate earnings estimates by around 7-10 percent thus giving a northwards inflection, which would further continue backed by investments and subsequently consumption-driven demand, suggest experts.

“Over the long term, say 3-5 years, markets are poised for a move northwards backed by solid domestic corporate earnings growth supported by domestic consumption-led demand,” Pankaj Bobade, Head of Fundamental Research at Axis Securities told Moneycontrol.

“The earnings performance of corporates over the last couple of quarters has been picking up though not in a secular manner; the texture, quality of earnings is improving. The impact of corporate tax cuts could be seen from H2FY20 onwards; the impact of any other reforms would be seen 6 months down the line,” he said.

We have collated a list of top 13 fundamentally strong stocks by different experts for your portfolio which could turn out to be big wealth creators in the next 2-3 years:

Expert: D K Agarwal Chairman & MD, SMC Investments and Advisors Limited

Marico

The company will continue to drive sustained profitable volume-led growth over the medium term, through its focus on strengthening the franchise in the core categories and driving the new engines of growth towards gaining critical mass.

Over the medium term, the company retains the target of 8-10 percent volume growth and healthy market share gains in the India business.

The company aims to build Healthy Foods, Premium Hair Nourishment and Male Grooming into growth engines of the future and expects to deliver value growth at 20 percent plus CAGR over the medium term in these portfolios.

On the international front, the company expects to clock organic broad-based double-digit constant currency growth over the medium term.

Larsen & Toubro

The company looks forward to a period of increased investment momentum and continued growth. Initiatives towards improved productivity, cost efficiencies derived from leveraging digital technology, capacity utilisation, and capability enhancement are expected to help the company maximise its shareholder returns (RoE) on a sustainable basis.

Consolidated order book of the group stood at Rs 29,4014 crore as of June 30, 2019, with international order book constituting 21 percent of the total. The company successfully won new orders worth Rs 38,700 crore at the group level during the quarter ended June 30, 2019, registering a growth of 11 percent.

International orders during the year at Rs 9,005 crore constituted 23 percent of the total order inflow. Order wins in Infrastructure and Power segments were the major contributors to the order inflow during the quarter.

UltraTech Cement

The Government's firm commitment to revive the economy and the thrust on infrastructure spending augurs well for the growth of cement demand. The company with its presence across all the zones in the country is the best positioned to take advantage of the revival in cement demand.

As seen in the earlier acquisitions, the management’s ability to turn around the acquired assets provides confidence in the company and the management expects similar performance even in the newly acquired Century assets. UltraTech completed the acquisition of Century's cement business recently.

ITC

Despite an extremely challenging operating environment, the company has consolidated its leadership position in the industry and continued to improve its standing in key competitive markets across the country.

This demonstrates the resilience of the company's portfolio of brands, superior consumer insights and its relentless focus on value creation.

According to the management of the company, the company is focusing on growth of its FMCG business by entering newer segments and tapping the opportunity in the foods segment. This would be a catalyst for topline growth in the long run.

ICICI Bank

The bank is focusing on growing the core operating profit in a risk calibrated manner instead of loan growth. The bank aims to improve the share of profitable market opportunities by making delivery to the customers more seamless and frictionless through digitisation and process improvements.

Business performance of the bank such as domestic loan growth, overall corporate advances, retail loan growth, CASA ratio is continuously improving. The business of the bank increased at an accelerated pace of 18 percent YoY to Rs 12,53,147 crore at the end of June 2019, supported by loan growth improving by 15 percent at Rs 5,92,415 crore.

Meanwhile, the deposits growth galloped to 21 percent at Rs 6,60,732 crore at the end of June 2019. The bank had indicated that credit cost in FY2020 is expected to reduce significantly compared to FY2019.

Expert: Pankaj Bobade, Head of Fundamental Research at Axis Securities

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB)

The net interest margins (NIMs) of KMB are amongst the best in the industry and have been in the range of 4-4.6 percent over the last 3 years. The management expects better pricing power in certain high yielding segments which will help in sustaining NIMs.

KMB has maintained benign asset quality with limited exposure to stressed sectors and conservative lending practices. Further improvement in asset quality since FY18 was seen with G/NNPAs at 2.2/0.7 percent in Q1FY20 (Slippages 1.45 percent ann). Provisioning Coverage Ratio stood at 67 percent which provides comfort.

KMB is well positioned due to higher capitalisation (Tier I - 17.3 percent), a strong liability franchise (CASA: 51 percent) and benign asset quality, which would allow it to gain further market share.

RITES

RITES has a strong and diversified order book. RITES’ standalone order book stands at Rs 6,052 crore (3x FY19 revenue). The order book is expected to grow by over 17 percent in FY20 which provides strong revenue visibility for the next 2-3 years.

The Order book is well diversified with high margin consultancy and low margin turnkey business contributing 41 percent each. RITES has a competitive edge in winning orders owing to its over four decades of experience in transport infrastructure consultancy and its association with MoR.

Ample opportunities within railways (50 percent revenue share) being captured by RITES via venturing into turnkey projects and railway station development is increasing its scale of operations. Focus on strengthening EPC business, diversification and continuous infrastructure push by the government is expected to augur well for RITES.

Dixon Technologies

Dixon is a leading player in Flat Panel Display (FPD) TV with over 50 percent market share. It is also a leading player in Lighting accounting for over 35 percent domestic volumes and commands over 40 percent share in the Washing Machines EMS market.

Indian Consumer Electronics and Appliances market is expected to grow at a faster pace of 19 percent CAGR between FY19-21E as compared to global CEA market growth at 8 percent CAGR in the same period. High growth in consumer electronics and increasing EMS presents a huge opportunity for players like Dixon.

We expect strong growth in key segments viz., Consumer Electronics, Lighting and Home Appliances led by a strong order book. The addition of new clients, recovery in the mobile segment and robust growth in the security surveillance segment would aid revenue growth, going forward.

Amber Enterprises

Amber is the market leader in the OEM/ODM industry with 55.4 percent share in volume terms (outsourced market). AEL’s share stands at 19.1 percent in the overall residential air-conditioning (RAC) market in terms of volume.

Key customers include Godrej, Bluestar, Daikin, Hitachi, LG, Panasonic, Voltas, Whirlpool and Carrier Midea, which together account for 75 percent of the market share.

With the acquisition of Sidwal Refrigeration, the company has made a foray in the mobile air-conditioning segment. We believe that Sidwal Refrigeration Industries Pvt Ltd (SRIPL) is a strategic fit in Amber’s portfolio.

Amber will continue to deliver industry-leading growth and is a proxy play in evolving and fast-growing RAC market- the most underpenetrated segment in the white goods category in India.

Expert: Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services

Avanti Feeds

A leading exporter of processed prawn and fish feeds in India. Avanti has five shrimp feed manufacturing units with a capacity of 6,00,000 MT and two processing and exporting units with a capacity of 22,000 MT.

Being the market leader in the feed segment the company is aiming to become one of the largest players in the processing segment through its capacity addition.

The recent improvement witnessed in farm-gate and stabilisation in export prices provides a better outlook for both Feed and Processing segments. Going forward the revenue/PAT is expected to grow at 14/19 percent CAGR over FY19-21E.

Coromandel International

Largest privately-owned phosphatic fertilizer manufacturers in India with a considerable presence in its home market, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and other nearby states.

The subsequent improvement in monsoon and central government schemes like the Pradhan Mantri-Kisan scheme announced this year to help double farmer income and boost the demand for fertilizer products.

Expect PAT to grow by a CAGR of 17 percent during FY19-21E on the back of an increase in the share of new unique grade products and improvement in margins due to backward integration.

Mold-Tek Packaging:

It is one of the leading manufacturers and suppliers of high quality airtight and pilfers proof containers/pails in India for Paints, Lubricants, Food and FMCG.

The company is credited with shifting Indian paint and lubricant industry to plastic pails from metal containers. Going forward, MTEP is expected to capitalise on long-term growth opportunities, aided by higher volumes due to increasing acceptance of IML in paint and lubricant segments.

Further, focus on capacity expansion, diversification of end-users and penetration into newer markets will drive earnings growth.

Brokerage: HSBC

L&T Finance Holding

The brokerage has a buy rating on L&T Finance Holding with a target price of Rs 130. LTFH delivered a stable September quarter performance in a very challenging environment.

Focused loan book grew 19 percent on a YoY basis, while asset quality and margins (plus fees) remained largely stable on QoQ. It raise FY20-22e earnings on lower tax outgo.

The management has maintained a fine balance between growth and asset quality. Risks associated with asset quality outlook of the wholesale mortgage loans appear priced in.",1899,0.8930703453395678

Indian market remained volatile, but rose a little over 9 percent in Samvat 2075. However, the rally may not be over yet.

Experts feel that we are well on track to hit fresh record highs by Diwali 2020 as most of the bad news is priced in.

There are many global and domestic headwinds which the D-Street has to fight it out in the short term for it to break out into unchartered territory. But, the recent fall in the Indian market has made valuations slightly more attractive.

Most experts see Nifty50 hovering in the range of 12,300-13,500 levels in the next one year. The opportunities are likely to remain stock specific; hence, investors should do bottom-up cherry-picking from different sectors.

“The earnings yield of equities is attractive and supportive of high valuations. A bearish outlook on oil and commodities in general also upholds India’s case. The fag-end monsoon onslaught, which fetched an excess to the tune of 110 percent of long-term averages, augurs well for the next Rabi crop,” YES Securities said in a note.

“Our one-year target for Nifty is placed at 12,330, based on 21x multiple to FY21 earnings. Our best-case target stands at 12,915 but with high chances of a steep fall, which may even pull back Nifty to sub-11,000,” it said.

The market is putting a good fight amid bad news from both global, as well as, domestic fronts but most of it is in the prices, feels Atul Suri, Founder & CEO, Marathon Trends in an exclusive interview with CNBC-Tv18. He feel that Nifty may touch 13,500 by Samvat 2076.

Key monitorable to watch out in the next 12 months include the global situation, math of fiscal deficit, Indian Rupee movement (specifically pursuant to any US-China trade war escalation) and ongoing stress in real estate, SMEs and shadow banks.

Although mid and small-cap stocks have remained under pressure in Samvat 2075 but there could be stock-specific opportunities that could come in the next 12 months.

In the next three years, there could be 12-15 percent compounded gains in the market, said market veteran Madhu Kela in a chat with CNBC TV18. Kela said that he prefers midcaps than indices at this juncture as it is more about the quality and cheaper stocks than sectors.

We have collated a list of 10 high-quality stocks from different brokerage firms which investors could look at buying for Samvat 2076:

Brokerage Firm: Yes Securities

HDFC Bank: Buy

Within the Indian financial system, the macro scenario has been playing out in a way that would immensely benefit larger well-governed and well-capitalized private banks having solid outreach and brand equity.

The choking of NBFCs, weaker position and consolidation within PSU Banks and specific issues faced by smaller/regional private banks and co-operative banks would mean a significant shift of incremental business to stronger private banks.

The one bank which we trust to take ‘prudent advantage’ of the given opportunity is HDFC Bank. The bank is set to witness accelerated market share gains, reflected in its resilient loan growth delivery amid a slowing system-wide credit growth.

ICICI Bank: Buy

Over the past four years, ICICI Bank has impressively de-risked and rebalanced its core revenue streams by increasing the contribution of retail loans (61 percent of loans), de-emphasizing on international lending (10 percent), focusing on higher-rated domestic corporate loans, reducing exposure to stressed sectors/borrower groups, substantially increasing the share of low-cost sticky deposits and retailizing the fee income to a large extent.

Along with margins and credit cost, subtle improvement in cost metric through digitization would also be an RoA driver. Stand-alone bank’s RoE would likely reach 15 percent in FY21.

Adjusted for the significant value of its holdings in ICICI Pru Life, ICICI Lombard, ICICI Pru AMC, and I-Sec, the ICICI Bank trades at a valuation of 1.7x FY21 P/ABV. Its capital position is robust with Tier-1 ratio at 15.6 percent.

UltraTech Cement: Buy

Post-acquisition of Century cement assets, the domestic capacity of UltraTech Cements has scaled to ~113.4 MTPA, translating into a volume share of 25 percent vis-à-vis 10 percent in FY05.

Although the demand remains jittery in the near term due to liquidity crunch and slowdown in Govt funding towards infrastructure, we believe the sluggish scenario is transient in nature.

We reckon that massive investments lined up in the infrastructure segment combined with a pick-up in tier 2 and tier 3 housing space will drive growth going ahead.

UltraTech Cement will continue to outperform the industry growth rate on the back of ramp-up of organic capacity and sweating of inorganic assets.

Polycab India: Buy

Polycab is a market leader (12 percent organized market share) in the domestic C&W segment led by its diverse product portfolio, strong distribution network, and high brand recall.

Domestic C&W market is expected to witness 10-12 percent CAGR over FY19-22E on the back of strong power distribution capex, strengthening of current T&D network revival in demand from real estate and adoption of electric vehicles.

In line with its aim to evolve as a large B2C player, the company is constantly investing in new products and new categories in the FMEG space.

Led by strong revenue CAGR of 25 percent over FY19-22E in the FMEG space and execution of large orders over the next two years in the C&W segment, we expect the company to witness a revenue/operating profit of 10.8 percent/9.9 percent CAGR over FY19-22E.

Cochin Shipyard Ltd: Buy

Cochin Shipyard (CSL) has an order book of Rs80.5bn & it is also likely to receive incremental order for IAC Phase III (~Rs103bn) soon. This implies a total order backlog of Rs183.5 (~6x TTM sales) by FY20.

Shipbuilding (SB) is expected to deliver a healthy 21 percent CAGR over FY19-21E. CSL also has a shipbuilding order pipeline of Rs100bn+ comprising next-gen missile vessels, solar research vessels & coastal shipping vessels which are likely to be finalized over FY19-21.

Strong infrastructure capabilities coupled with diverse competencies in the SB & SR segments give CSL a significant edge over peers. With a huge capex planned at Rs30bn over FY18-21E (funded through internal accrual) and superior return profile (average RoEs, RoCEs of 15.5 percent, 16.5 percent, respectively, in FY12-17), we believe CSL is a quality play and is on a strong footing.

Brokerage Firm: Motilal Oswal

State Bank of India: Buy

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal is of the view that State Bank of India (SBI) is well poised for an earnings recovery led by a steady operating performance at the PPOP level, recoveries from NCLT resolutions and normalization in credit cost to 1.9 percent/1.3 percent over FY20E/FY21E.

Hindustan Unilever: Buy

Four key trends point towards an elevated earnings growth trajectory for HUL compared to the past, such as (1) rapidly improving adaptability to market requirements, (2) recognition and strong execution on Naturals, (3) continuous strong trend towards premiumization, and (4) extensive plans to employ technology, creating further entry barriers. Premium valuations are justified as the company has the best earnings growth visibility in the large-cap Indian consumer space, and also, the highest return ratios so far.

Titan Company: Buy

The longer-term investment case remains strong as Titan is well placed to grow led by a combination of its own initiatives and regulatory tailwinds.

With over 60 percent of the jewelry segment growth continuing to come from SSSG, operating margins are also likely to improve.

Ashok Leyland (AL): Buy

Unlike the previous cycles, AL is currently on a strong footing (lean cost structure and net cash balance sheet) and is focused on adding new revenue/profit pools. Valuations are reasonable in view of the downcycle in earnings.

L&T: Buy

For L&T, we forecast adjusted consolidated EPS CAGR of 23 percent over FY19-21. Consolidated RoEs should expand to 17.6 percent by FY21 from 14.6 percent in FY18.

Adjusted for valuation of subsidiaries, core E&C business is trading at FY20/21E P/E of 19.6x/16.1x, which is at a significant discount to its long-term one-year-forward trading multiple of 23x.

Volumes declined by 1.7% YoY to 17.8 MT (Adjusted volumes 16.04 MT vs. I-Direct estimates of 15.9 MT).

Outlook

As seen in the earlier acquisitions, the management’s ability to turn around the acquired assets provide confidence in the company and we expect similar performance even in the newly acquired Century assets. With deleveraging on cards, on the back of strong cash-flows and expectations of recovery in the cement demand from the 2nd half, we continue to remain positive on Ultratech. We value the company at ~14x FY21E EV/EBITDA and arrive a target price of Rs 5,350.

Share prices of UltraTech Cement gained over 2 percent intraday on October 22 after the company had reported net profit which was up 2.3 percent at Rs 639 crore.

The profit after tax (PAT) jumped 72 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 639 crore against Rs 371 crore profit in the same quarter last year. The top line of the cement maker grew 5 percent YoY to Rs 9,129 crore from Rs 8,710 crore, it said in a BSE filing.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 29 percent YoY to Rs 1,995 crore from Rs 1,544 crore in the year-ago quarter.

UltraTech Cement is expected to post stellar numbers for the July-September quarter, driven by strong operating income and higher realisations year-on-year (YoY), but sequential numbers are likely to be weak amid lower realisations from south/east markets.

According to brokerages, the profit growth range is 80-130 percent and revenue may increase in single-digit with volume growth of 2.5-4 percent YoY due to consolidation of acquired assets.

""We expect a 2.5 percent volume growth led by growth in July and September, partly offset by weak August volumes. We expect blended realisations to decline by 3.5 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) led by sharp price declines in East and South during the quarter,"" said Kotak which expects profit growth of 132 percent YoY.

Motilal Oswal expects blended realisations to decline 4.5 percent QoQ but increase 3.7 percent YoY.

Expected lower fuel cost and pet coke & coal prices may boost operating profit in the quarter ended September 2019. Hence, EBITDA growth could be around 50-60 percent YoY.

""Fuel costs should decline due to lower pet coke and coal prices but the majority of benefit to come in Q3FY20.

Analysts continue to be upbeat about Indian market despite the Nifty tumbling from September 23 high of 11,694. In a recent note, ICICI Securities maintained its one-year target for the Nifty at 13,400, which translates into an upside of 20 percent from current levels.

The domestic brokerage firm maintained its overweight stance on growth and quality companies catering to the domestic demand recovery. ICICI Securities top picks include Bandhan Bank, Ultratech Cement, L&T, Siemens, NMDC, Greenlam, TVS Motors, Galaxy Surfactants, Dabur, and JB Chemicals and Pharma.

Fear indicators, which comprise India VIX and gold prices, have been rising since the beginning of Q2FY20, leading to high volatility in the equity markets, but H2FY20 could throw in some positive surprises.

The fall in the equities is in sync with global volatility driven by geopolitical risks and slowing growth. Emerging Market flows, including India, improved month-on-month in September, but continued to remain volatile.

The domestic brokerage firm said of the top 500 stocks, 212 rose more than 8 percent immediately after the tax cuts. But, 85 stocks had given up most of their gains and 51 were in a negative territory.

However, 127 stocks retained gains of at least 4 percent, out of which, 60 were up more than 10 percent. Interestingly, quality and growth outlook vs high-risk perception was the key differentiator for the divergence in stock performance instead of overall sector risk (NBFCs, industrials, banks, etc. have both winners and losers).

ICICI Securities highlighted that risk spreads were declining: CDS spreads (India), CP spreads over T- Bills and NBFC CP spreads over non-NBFC CPs.

On the global front, weak data on growth in the US as measured by the ISM manufacturing index further brightened the chances of the US Fed remaining accommodative, while they increased buying of US treasury in September (US$22bn).

Starting off the QE2 by European Central Bank in November will further add to global liquidity along with accommodative stance from most other major central banks.

In India, the Reserve Bank of India has cut the repo rate further by 25 bps to 5.15 percent, with a commitment for further reduction as long as growth remains weak. All these factors will give comfort to equity investors.

On the growth front, the domestic brokerage firm is of the view that GDP was expected to rise to 7% in H2FY20, thanks to government capex of Rs 732 billion, fall in crude oil prices, improvement in capacity utilisation, and strong sales recorded in e-commerce channels.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech Cement (UTCEM) reported 5% miss on our EBITDA (higher by Rs339mn due to adoption of AS116 related to operating lease accounting) estimates due to elevated maintenance costs on preponement of kiln shutdown (leading to cost higher by Rs45/t) and lower volumes. Adjusted for preponement of maintenance cost, EBITDA came in line with our estimate. However, EBITDA came ahead of consensus estimates by 6%. Led by Rs100/t QoQ reduction in cost and higher realisations, EBITDA/t of Ultratech Nathdwara (UNCL- erstwhile Binani Cement) rose 45% QoQ to Rs1,200/t. Overall EBITDA/t of Indian operations (including UNCL) rose 58% YoY/37% QoQ to Rs1,466.

Outlook

High share of trade volumes and smooth integration of acquired assets (manifested in upgrade in margins to UTCEM levels) would provide sustainability to UTCEM's margins. We reiterate BUY with TP of Rs5,175, EV/EBITDA of 14x FY21E.

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

Higher realisations (up 14.2% YoY to Rs 5484/t) led to healthy margins and profitability growth for the company during the quarter. However, volume growth of 2.2% (17.9 MT vs. our estimate: 19.1 MT) missed our estimates marginally due to general elections, sand mining issues in some states and temporary slowdown in infra projects. Along with better pricing, cost also remained benign during the quarter with power & fuel and freight both declining by 3.7% YoY and 5.7% YoY respectively. As a result, EBITDA margin increased 834 bps YoY to 26% (vs. I-direct estimate of 21.9%) with company reporting EBITDA/t of Rs 1428/t (highest ever) during the quarter. With all major acquired units (except Century) now being streamlined with the company’s process, the focus of the management now is to bring down the debt using the free cash flows and optimise costs.

Outlook

Hence, we continue to remain positive on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 5350/share (valuing at 15.0x FY21E EV/EBITDA).

UltraTech Cement chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla July 18 said the company will complete merger of Century Cement during the course of the second quarter of the current fiscal, which will take its capacity to 117.35 million tone.

In May 2018, the Aditya Birla group announced a reorganisation of the cement business of the group firm Century Textiles' cement business, under a scheme of demerger.

The deal, which has long been in the works involving Kumar Mangalam Birla and his grandfather BK Birla (who passed away earlier this month) will give UtlraTech market leadership in all regional markets.

The reorganization will bring to UltraTech get ready ownership of 13.4 million capacity spread across MP, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, helping the land-endowed Century focus more on its real estate business and pare debt of about Rs 3,000 crore.

""The merger of Century Cement will be completed during the second quarter of the current financial year,"" Birla told the shareholders at the 19th AGM here.

Birla said, excluding China, UltraTech is already the third largest cement maker in the world and the merger of Century will further buttress this.

""After the completion of Century Cement transaction, coupled with the on-going capacity expansion, our capacity will be augmented to over 117.35 million tonne per annum, inclusive of its overseas operations,"" he told shareholders.

The company has already got the approvals for this from the exchanges, the Competition Commission and the shareholders apart from the NCLT, he said, adding the transaction will be effective in the second quarter of FY20.

The only pending approval is for the transfer of mining leases, which should be in any time now, he said.

""This transaction gives us an opportunity to strengthen our presence in the highly fragmented, but competitive and fast growing Eastern and Central markets. It will also extend our footprint in the Western and Southern markets,"" Birla said.

Century's cement business consists of three integrated units in MP, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra and a grinding unit in Bengal.

He further said once the transfer of the mining leases gets completed, the financials will be recast to give effect to the necessary changes.

During FY19, the company had completed acquisition of Binani Cement, which was subsequently renamed UltraTech Nathdwara Cement, which has a 6.25-mt capacity in Rajasthan, and operates plants in China and the UAE.

As of March 2019, UltraTech had an installed consolidated capacity of 102.75 mt of grey cement (including 4 mt under commissioning), a capacity of 0.68 mt of white cement and two wall-care putty plants.

In FY19, it reported a net income of Rs 2,456 crore as against and Rs 2,231 crore in FY18 on a revenue of Rs 35,704 crore, which rose from Rs 29,358 crore.",470,0.9928760230541229

William O'Neil India

Sector in a nutshell

> Cement stocks have corrected about 10-15 percent from their recent peaks in May over concerns around pricing roll-back in June and demand moderation following the elections.

> Cement volume rose 13 percent in FY19. FY20 started in a subdued note following the general election and the monsoon but is expected to improve in H2.

> Capacity utilization reached 78 percent in Q4, the highest level in the last 28 quarters. Utilization level is expected to grow further as the industry is expected to grow at around 8-10 percent.

> Indonesian coal prices, a key raw material, has fallen 14 percent in the first two months of the fiscal year. International thermal coal prices are down 21 percent sequentially.

> With international coal/petcoke price declining, it has been an added positive as costs has reduced. Margins started to improve in Q4 FY19 and it is expected the trend will continue.

> Increase in petrol/diesel prices by Rs 2.5/litre (proposed in the Budget) may push up logistics cost (which accounts for 34 percent of total operating cost) by 50-60bps.

> The sector is comprised of many good quality stocks, but based on the O’Neil Methodology, we shortlisted UltraTech Cement (watchlist stock) and Heidelbergcement India (Ex-Portfolio) as our top picks.

Demand expected to pick up in H2 FY20

Despite a higher base, most Indian companies reported higher volume growth in the last one year, on the back of continued government spending on infrastructure (accounts for 22-24 percent of volume) and housing segments (53-55 percent of volume).

It was mostly South (flood restoration in Kerala, Amravati development and irrigation & low cost housing related work in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) and East India (West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Odisha) that witnessed strong volume growth.

In the Union Budget 2019, the government emphasised on infrastructure which includes railways, road, highways, and irrigation projects. This is expected to increase investment across sectors and will stimulate cement demand.

Continuing the momentum gained in the previous year, the cement production rose 13 percent in FY19 (first time since FY10), thanks to 16 percent production growth in March led by strong industry utilization (improved 600bps y/y to 71 percent in FY19).

In Q4 FY19, the capacity utilization reached 78 percent, the highest over the last 28 quarters. Growth was mainly led by a lower base (GST in H1 FY18) and strong demand from East and South India.

Taking demand into account, capacity utilization in the industry has been soaring and is currently at 80-81 percent compared with 71 percent at the end of FY19.

The utilization level is expected to grow further (~80-90 percent) given the fact that the industry is going to grow at around 8-10 percent. However, cement demand in H1 FY19 was adversely affected due to the General Elections and the onset of monsoon (production grew 2 percent and 3 percent in April and May, respectively), but is expected to recover in H2, driven by pick up in infrastructure and housing growth.

Demand driver for the industry: Housing and infrastructure to steer volume growth

The demand for the cement industry is mainly derived from the housing & real estate sector (54 percent) followed by infrastructure (23 percent), low-cost housing (12 percent), and Industrial (11 percent).

Housing segment - Government initiatives on housing and tax reduction to support growth

Among the categories mentioned above, the housing segment carries the highest weightage, especially after some of the changes brought in by the government.

> The GST committee has lowered the GST rate for the property under construction to 5 percent from 12 percent, which favours the end-consumer demand. The reduced rate should create increased demand for cement manufacturers.

> The affordable housing scheme launched by the government, aimed at the rural population, also helped in improving cement prices. This, in turn, improves profitability in the highly competitive low-margin business. In FY19, 15.3 million homes were built under this scheme with an expenditure of Rs 258,530 million.

Infrastructure segment - Contributing 25 percent of industry demand

The government is equally focused on developing other infrastructure such as roads, ports, and dedicated freight corridors to enable smooth functioning of trades/operations.

Some initiatives introduced by the government include Bharatmala (completion by 2022), Sagarmala for ports, dedicated freight corridor which consists of six corridors spanning the country (completion by 2020), and the smart city project (Rs 240B allocated in FY19).

Moreover, in its election manifesto, the ruling BJP party mentioned they will build 60,000 kilometres of national highways in the next five years.

Easing input cost and strong realisation to improve margin

Cement companies are battling cost increases on multiple fronts. The companies have been grappling with the repercussions of rising crude oil prices and raw material costs. Crude oil price which were benign during the period FY16 ($38 per barrel), started to rise in FY17 and increased 72 percent to reach $71 a barrel in Q2 FY19.

Logistics make up the majority (30-35 percent) in total operating cost because it is positively correlated to oil prices which rose 72 percent from April 2016 to October 2018. With the government increasing fuel price by Rs 2.5 (proposed in annual budget), it will increase the logistics costs.

The prices of petcoke and diesel rallied strongly in the past. While the petcoke prices more than doubled to $116 per tonne in Q3 FY19 compared to $56 per tonne in Q1 FY17, diesel increased 37 percent during the same period. However, prices eased in Q4 FY19 and fell 16 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Domestic petcoke prices are down 13 percent QoQ to Rs 7,600 per tonne in Q4 FY19.

The price of coal, a key raw material which tends to be in high demand among cement manufacturers, has increased, adding to energy costs. Since most of the requirement is met through imports, a weakening rupee is adding to the expenses.

However, Indonesian coal has come to the rescue as average coal prices have fallen 14 percent YoY in the first two months of the fiscal year. It is to be noted that India imports more than 50 percent of its coal requirement from Indonesia. Rising production and lower Chinese demand have pulled down Indonesian coal prices. Further, domestic thermal coal availability has improved after restocking at power plants while international thermal coal prices are down 21 percent sequentially.

Strong price realization - South and central lead price hike

After a strong show in April and May (price increased Rs 30-50 per bag according to the Cement Manufacturing Association), June witnessed a price correction of about Rs 5-10 per 50kg bag following increased competition due to higher volume push by selected firms.

The onset of monsoon indicates further price moderation in the next few months. However, price correction was restricted to a few markets - it was not a broad-based reversal.

In Q4, cement price increased 3 percent q/q on average, mostly driven by reconstruction activity seen in Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. In the eastern region, prices were moderated (-1 percent YoY). Despite the correction in June, the overall cement price in Q1 increased ~9 percent YoY on average, mostly driven by the northern and central part of India.

Region wise cement price

Q4 Results - strong volume growth drives revenue

Q4 results for cement manufacturers were encouraging. While the topline grew 10 percent on average, on the back of strong volume growth, EBITDA increased 29 percent, driven by disciplined cost management and price hikes.

Both Ultratech and Shree Cement reported double-digit volume growth while other major players were in the mid-to-high single-digit bracket.

Management of different cement companies mentioned that higher government spending in infrastructural projects and effective execution of affordable housing has led to strong volume growth over the last one year.

It is a good time for investors looking to start their fresh journey in the market along with the new government at the Centre, Siddhartha Khemka, Head – Retail research, MOFSL, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q: What is the range you are looking at for Nifty or Sensex based on the election results? Do you think we are heading for new highs in 2019?

A: India voted decisively in favour of the incumbent BJP-led NDA government. The market reacted positively with benchmark indices touching new highs.

The S&P BSE Sensex crossed 40,000 levels for the first time and touched an intraday high of 40,124 while Nifty 50 crossed 12,000-mark to touch 12,041 intraday on Thursday.

However, some profit booking was seen on the election result day as indices had seen a decent move post the Exit Polls on Monday.

We expect the momentum in the market to sustain over the next few weeks. The verdict of a continuance of stable government with majority augurs well from reforms and policy agenda perspective.

However, we do not see a room for significant re-rating for markets from current ~12,000 levels given the underlying fair valuations and continued earnings downgrades. The Nifty50 is currently trading ~19x FY20 P/E which is above the long term averages.

Q: What are the sectors which one can bet on based on the govt. which will form the government and why?

A: The massive win by NDA brings the focus back on the BJP manifesto 2019. The manifesto was good from economists’ perspective as it didn’t include any populist schemes or unrealistic promises.

The manifesto focused to continue on the key reforms started earlier like – Housing, health, and education for all Make in India, MUDRA scheme, various incentives to farmers etc.

From the infrastructure perspective, the manifesto aims to invest Rs 100 lakh crore over the next five years. Hence, we expect sectors like corporate banks, Consumer, Cement, Capital Goods, Infra and construction to do well over the next few years.

Q: As a new government takes centre stage, should investors look at select mid & smallcaps for the next 5 years?

A: Yes, midcaps clearly offers the scope for a valuation catch-up as there is a huge divergence in their performance. In the last year, the Nifty Midcap100 Index was down by about 7 percent while the Nifty 50 index gained about 10 percent, resulting in a sharp underperformance of 17 percent from midcaps.

There have been issues like corporate governance, earnings downgrades as well as regulatory uncertainty regarding mid and smallcaps in the past which led to their underperformance.

However, given that sentiments have changed now after the election verdict, there could be good inflows into some of the mid and small cap quality names where there is room for valuation expansion.

Hence, one has to stick to quality names and look at bottoms-up opportunities in the midcaps space.

Q: What would be your advice to investors for the next 5 years who are probably starting their journey with this new government at the Center?

A: It is a good time for investors looking to start their fresh journey in the market along with the new government at the Center. The mandate is clearly in favour of the continuance of government which augurs well from reforms and policy agenda perspective.

The economy would also see the benefit of the development work carried out by the government in the last five years. Hence there is an expectation of stable growth in the economy which bodes well for the equity market.

Further, corporate earnings are likely to see a recovery in FY20 after four tepid years. However, given the current valuations, we would suggest new investors adopt a staggered investment strategy to benefit from any correction in the market.

Q: Top 5 fundamentally strong stocks which investors can look buying at for the next 5 years?

A: Here is a list of top 5 stocks which are good long term bets for the next 5 years:

ICICI Bank:

ICICI Bank has delivered a steady performance at the PPOP (Pre-Provision Operating profit) level and is showing signs of earnings normalization. With asset quality stabilizing, we expect credit cost to moderate meaningfully in FY20/21, boosting return ratios.

ICICI Bank has improved its provisioning coverage and guided for normalization in credit cost from FY20, which will drive its RoE or return on equity expansion. We have a Buy rating, with a near term target of Rs 470

Titan Company Ltd:

Jewellery growth prospects remain robust, and now Watches and even Eyewear have started contributing to growth. In addition, operating leverage arising from the rising share of SSSG in Jewellery sales (72% in FY19 over an already impressive 60% in FY18) is likely to drive healthy EBITDA margin expansion, fuelling the best-of-breed and sustained earnings growth performance for the company.

High valuations are fully deserved for a business that has perhaps the best top-line growth visibility in the large-cap FMCG/retail space (20% CAGR in Jewellery, the largest segment, in the next four years). We have a Buy rating on the stock.

UltraTech Cement:

The acquisition of Century’s cement asset and Binani has led to increasing capacity and market share in the North to 26 percent (from 19% currently) for UltraTech Cement which took its pan-India capacity market share to 25 percent (from 20% currently).

UltraTech Cement reported strong numbers in Q4 as well as in FY19. Healthy operating performance along with consistent efforts to lower costs arguers well for UltraTech.

This along with industry tailwinds should help UltraTech in improving profitability going forward. We have a buy rating with a Rs 5,190.

L&T:

The management exceeded its FY19 revenue/order inflow guidance. It is positive on ordering environment as prospective orders have got funding tied-up and will be awarded eventually.

Total prospects across the domestic and overseas market stand at Rs 9 lakh crore. With the overall strike rate at ~20 percent, it implies Rs 1.8-2 lakh crore of fresh orders.

We forecast an adjusted consolidated EPS CAGR of 25 percent over FY19-21. The core E&C EPS CAGR is estimated at 35 percent over the same period, helped by strong execution, normalization of margins and financial leverage. Consolidated RoEs should expand to 18 percent by FY21 from 14.6 percent in FY18.

Siemens Ltd:

The strong focus on products/services has helped Siemens to mitigate the slowdown in industrial capex, as it has been able to capitalize on opex-related spending. We expect the trend to continue, driving strong growth for its products business.

Any revival in capex spending can further strengthen its revenue trajectory. We expect overall revenue growth to be driven by Building Technologies, Mobility, Digital Factory, and Process Industries.

The current valuation provides comfort, given the scope of an improvement in the operating performance and the likely gradual recovery in capex.

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement’s revenues for Q4FY19 grew 16.6% Rs 10,500 crore (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 10,095 crore) almost entirely led by volume growth. Volume sales clocked during the quarter were at 20.46 MT (vs. I-direct estimate of 19.4 MT) whereas realisations remained flat YoY at Rs 5134/t. EBITDA margins were upbeat, expanding 216 bps YoY to 21.1% (vs. I-direct estimate of 17.3%). The strong operational performance drove the margin expansion with production costs per tonne reducing from Rs 4138/t to Rs 4050/t. Consequently, EBITDA/t for the quarter was at Rs 1082/t, up 12.1% YoY. EBITDA for Q4FY19 was at Rs 2213 crore (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 1750.4 crore). PAT for the quarter grew 108% YoY to Rs 1017 crore on account of a strong operational performance and partly due to a low base.

Outlook

Hence, we remain positive on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 5300/share (valuing at 15.0x FY21E EV/EBITDA).

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech, being the market leader, is expected to reap benefits of the multi-year industry upcycle. UltraTech reported strong standalone net earnings growth, which was aided by continued healthy volume growth and cost efficiencies. UltraTech shifts its focus to deleveraging while reaping benefits of increasing capacities and profitability of its acquired assets. The industry may witness transient issue of muted demand in H1FY2020 owing to ongoing general elections. Nevertheless, demand is expected to significantly pick up in H2FY2020.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating on UltraTech by revising our PT to Rs. 5,000, assigning higher valuation multiple.

Nalanda Securities' research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech reported standalone volume growth of 15.3% y-o-y to 21.3mt in Q4FY19. Operating leverage coupled with strong demand led to standalone EBITDA growth of 30% y-o-y and 51.6% q-o-q to INR 2213 crore. Low cost housing and construction demand led to volume off take across industry. Volumes surprise street estimates, reported better than expected numbers Realization remained a miss, EBITDA/ton improved sharply led by volumes Recent M&A’s started reaping positive benefits, full benefits to see by FY21E.

Outlook

We assign a target price of INR 4850/share giving an upside of 10% (at an average of 15x FY21 EV/EBITDA and $175 FY21 EV/Ton). We suggest to ADD the stock on dips (we believe the stock is fairly valued at the current juncture) for an investment horizon of 1 year as we believe post election results there will be heavy thrust on infrastructure and housing projects.

HDFC Securities' research report on UltraTech Cement

During 4QFY19, UTCEM delivered earnings beat as standalone net sales/EBITDA/PAT rose 18/30/42% YoY. FY19 revenue/EBITDA/PAT rose 22/11/11% YoY. Grey cement volume rose 16/18% YoY/QoQ to 20.9mn MT, driven by strong growth in the East and South markets. White and putty sales rose 3/11% YoY/QoQ to 0.41mn MT. Blended NSR rose a modest 1% QoQ (+3% YoY), 2% below our est. We reckon cement prices have firmed up in all markets in April and are sustaining, which should buoy FY20E profitability.

Outlook

We recommend BUY on UltraTech (UTCEM) with a TP of Rs 5,140 (15x FY21E EBITDA). We ascribe premium valuations to the stock owing to UTCEM’s capacity leadership (25% mkt share in India) and superior op profits outlook (Rs1000/MT+), and stable balance sheet.

The average cement demand is expected to grow 1.2 times of the GDP growth rate in the country over the long term, according to UltraTech Cement. The growth of industry will be primarily driven by the government-led spending on big infrastructure projects and low cost housing, besides uptick in rural housing.

India is the second largest producer of cement in the world after China, with an installed capacity of 472 mtpa.

The domestic industry has sustained cement consumption growth of seven per cent in last 17 years.

""Industry reached historical GDP multiple in FY'18 post slowdown in the last three-four years...Long-term average cement demand growth is expected to be 1.2 times of GDP growth rate,"" the Aditya Birla group firm said in its investor presentation.

UltraTech, with an installed capacity of 105 mtpa (million tonne per annum), expects ""demand momentum to maintain with improved focus on infrastructure, low cost housing and uptick in rural housing.""

The Reserve Bank of India had last week projected an economic growth rate of 7.4 per cent for 2019-20 as against 7.2 per cent in the current fiscal.

The industry would ""witness new capacity addition at the rate of 15-17 mtpa"", said UltraTech adding that the current capacity additions are backed by old limestone mining leases.

Although India is among the leading producers of cement in the world, its per capita cement consumption is at 210 kg, which is lowest among the developing countries, it said.

The world average is 580 kg, while countries such as China has a per capita cement consumption of 1,780 kg, followed by Turkey (830 kg) and Vietnam (660 kg).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech Cement (UTCEM) reported disappointing earnings for Q3FY19 with miss of 6%/13% on EBITDA/PAT level. Fall in realisations and higher than expected energy and maintenance cost drove the miss. Management sounded cautious on prices due to demand predominantly coming from non-trade segment and intense competition. We have been highlighting this structural change in the sector for past one year affecting pricing power of sector despite strong demand.

Outlook

Given the stretched valuations and overoptimistic street expectations, we maintain HOLD rating with TP of Rs3,725 (earlier Rs4,040).

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement reported a mixed set of numbers. Revenues were above our estimates led by better realisations with volumes being in line and meeting our estimates. EBITDA and PAT were below our estimates due to higher than expected input costs Revenues increased 18% YoY to Rs 8,812 crore during Q3FY19 (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 8,590 crore) mainly led by increase in volumes to 17.1 MT (in line with I-direct estimate of 17.1 MT). Revenues beat I-direct estimates on account of better net realisations, up 4.2% to Rs 5,154/t (above I-direct estimate of Rs 5,029/t) EBITDA margin declined 121 bps YoY to 15.8% (vs. I-direct estimate:17.8%) mainly due to higher power & fuel cost (up 34.4% YoY due to usage of high cost pet coke inventory and weak rupee). EBITDA/t declined 3.3% YoY to Rs 813/t (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 893/t) led by higher P&F costs/tonne at Rs 1,186/t in Q3FY19 vs. Rs 1,000/t in Q3FY18 Freight costs were higher by Rs 40/t on account of higher diesel costs and busy season surcharge by railways. P&F and freight costs should soften, going forward, with sequential correction in prices of petcoke and diesel price. We expect total cost to come down by ~Rs 124/tonne PAT during the quarter witnessed 6.5% YoY growth to Rs 449.1 crore, below I-direct estimate of Rs 579 crore mainly led by contraction in EBITDA margins.

Outlook

After acquiring Jaypee (21.1MT), Binani (6.25MT) and Century assets (13.4 MT), the company has achieved greater scale to become largest player in the Industry with total domestic capacity of over 107MT. However, this, in turn, also has put pressure on their margins during the current year due to low asset utilisations of acquired assets aided by weak pricing environment. Going forward, we believe as the newly acquired plant stabilises with industry demand (~27 MT p.a.) outpacing with supply growth (~15 MT p.a.). We expect the company to be a major beneficiary of operating leverage benefit. Consequently, we maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 4,150/share (i.e. at 15.0x FY20E EV/EBITDA).

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech reported decent operational performance backed by volume and realisation growth. Management is positive on the cement demand outlook as industry capacity addition is expected to lag incremental demand over the next three years. UltraTech would be focusing on improving profitability of the recently acquired Binani Cement’s assets, bringing it at par with UltraTech. Moreover, transfer of Century’s cement assets is expected to be completed by Q1FY2020.

Outlook

We upgrade UltraTech Cement (UltraTech) to Buy with a revised PT of Rs. 4,330, rolling forward our valuation multiple to FY2021E, while factoring the recently acquired assets in consolidated financials.

Sachin PalMoneycontrol Research

UltraTech Cement, India’s largest cement maker, posted a decent performance in Q3FY19. Standalone revenue grew 18 percent year-on-year (YoY) driven by incremental volumes resulting from the consolidation of cement assets of JP Associates (JPA). Volume growth of 13 percent was driven by strong domestic cement demand.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was Rs 1,390 crores compared to Rs 1,269 crores in the same period last year. EBITDA margins contracted ~120 bps YoY and 70 bps quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) on a rise in input costs.

Realisations were better YoY but subdued sequentially as cement prices weakened in most parts of the country during the quarter. Cost per tonne fell sequentially as prices of key inputs pet coke and crude oil moderated. However, the realisation decline kept the EBITDA per tonne under pressure on a sequential basis.

Large scale infrastructure construction activities aided healthy demand and in turn volume growth. UltraTech expects the demand trend to outpace the GDP growth rate in the near term.

UltraTech (CMP: 3,795; Market cap: 1,04,225 crores) has been consolidating market presence through mergers and acquisitions and has increased cost discipline to bring in operating efficiencies. Although it enjoys a strong market leadership position, the current valuations appear stretched from a medium-term perspective. The market continues to remain volatile and long term investors can look forward to accumulating this stock during corrections.",240,-0.1666494607925415

UltraTech Cement, which will declare its quarterly earnings on January 24, is expected to report solid growth in earnings backed by operating income and revenue, but margin may contract in Q3 on a year-on-year basis.

Most brokerages expect profit growth in the range of 37-80 percent. Reliance Securities expects maximum growth of 80 percent in Q3 profit while ICICI Securities sees 37.4 percent increase in bottomline.

Edelweiss Securities is the only brokerage which expects profit to fall 8 percent YoY as it said net profit for the quarter would not be comparable as due to the impact of the net debt increase from Binani acquisition.

The topline growth is also expected to be in double-digit led by volume growth. Brokerages largely expect revenue to grow in the range of 11-18 percent YoY with likely volume growth of more than 10 percent YoY.

""Ramp-up in the capacity utilisation of acquired assets of Jaypee (17 MT) to help the company register volume growth of 13.1 percent YoY. The impact on sales volume from Binani (6.25 MT) would be visible only from the next quarter onward,"" ICICI Securities said.

Binani Cement is operating at 50 percent utilisation only currently.

Emkay expects 12.3 percent YoY volume growth at 16.96 million tonne on the back of higher utilisation of JP Group's acquired assets. ""Grey cement realisation is expected to improve by 6 percent YoY. Higher grey volume/realisation should result in 16.8 percent YoY revenue growth and 16.1 percent YoY growth in EBITDA.""

According to Prabhudas Lilladher, blended realisations are expected to increase by 3.5 percent/Rs148 YoY to Rs 4,418 per tonne and grey cement volumes are expected to grow 11.5 percent YoY at 17.3 million tonne.

At operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is also expected to grow in double digit (the range is 15-30 percent) but margin may contract in Q3 year-on-year.

""EBITDA is estimated to increase 19 percent YoY, resulting in PAT growth of 67 percent YoY,"" Motilal Oswal said while Reliance Securities expects 30 percent growth in EBITDA due to cost reduction and better pricing.

The holding companies generally tend to outperform the underlying ones in a bull market. Thus, with a 2-year view, one should look at buying holding companies of strong groups, Ambareesh Baliga, independent market expert, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q) After a muted 2018, what are your predictions for the year 2019?

A) The initial period of 2019 would be lackluster unless one witnesses a fresh pro-BJP wave which seems remote as of now. We should see a decisive move post general elections — which could be either up or down depending on the outcome. Broadly there could be three scenarios –

1) BJP/NDA managing a workable majority: The markets will bounce back and we could witness a sharp rally. Could lead to a new high in 2019.

2) Congress forming the government with dependable allies – A knee-jerk reaction which would be limited leading to normalisation of the markets in a few months

3) An unstable weak formation: Markets will correct sharply and seek lower levels

Q) Any sector(s) which you think could turn out to be a dark horse in 2019?

A) The dark horse bet for 2019 would be sugar sector. I believe the policy change to allow sugar mills to produce ethanol directly without going through the traditional route of producing sugar is a “game-changer”.

With increased blending, the sugar mills will have a greater control over their operations. Secondly, I don’t believe the fortunes of Ethanol will depend only on the oil price as environmental considerations and the forex savings will ensure it remains in focus.

I would also suggest retail investors look at holding companies which have corrected sharply and most of them are quoting at more than 60 percent discount to the underlying.

The holding companies generally tend to outperform the underlying in a bull market. Thus, with a 2-year view, one should look to buy holding companies of strong groups.

One such pick is Pilani Investments. It is a holding company of the Birla Group having blue-chip investments like Century Textiles, Grasim, Ultratech to name a few. Among others, one could look at Uniphos Enterprises and BF Investments.

Q) A large part of the recovery in 2018 was led by heavyweights and on the other hand, small & mid-caps remain muted. Do you think the broader market is likely to remain under pressure?

A) Broader markets will remain lackluster due to lack of participation. However, we could see specific stocks in action based on news or developments in the specific sector or stock.

Q) 2019 strategy: Top five fundamental safe stocks which are good buys at current levels for a holding period of 1 year?

A) Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Ultratech Cement, TCS, and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories.

Q) Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in 2019?

A) Though I expect FMCG and pharma to do well in 2019, I expect a good recovery in cement and discovery of PSU banks as a sector.

Q) Where do you see the benchmark indices headed in the near term?

A) Global events, as well as impending election results, kept the markets on the edge in the first two weeks of December. The market absorbed the outcome of state election even though BJP failed to get an absolute majority in any of the Hindi heartland states.

Markets generally prefer continuity, except for 2014 when it was waiting for the Modi government to take over. However, it also expects a stable government after an initial period of knee-jerk reaction and volatility, whenever there is an upset for the incumbent government. Thus, I expect the markets to be back on track in 2019, even if there is an upset at Centre.

Q) Do you think the pain in the mid and smallcaps is here to stay in 2019?

A) Well, the small and the midcaps as a group is moving up after a sustainable rally in the largecaps. However, 2018 was different as even among the largecaps, the rally was limited to a few index heavyweights.

The pain the small and midcaps would continue in the initial months of 2019, but I see it as a stock pickers’ delight.

Q) Do you think rupee will continue to appreciate in the near term?

A) I think we have seen the worst for the rupee when it was trading closer to Rs 75/USD. Going forward, I believe INR/USD should stablise around Rs 70/71 and possibly appreciate if we have a stable government in 2019 with incremental foreign flows.

Q) What should be the ideal portfolio allocation for investors for the next one year?

A) One should look to increase exposure to equities since troubled times is a great opportunity to get invested. I would invest 60 percent in equities, of which 10 percent in cash, 30 percent in fixed income, and the rest 10 percent in gold/gold equivalents.

Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech Cement

BCL's acquisition at $100/tonne post Brownfield expansion is likely to be earnings dilutive in the initial years, given significantly lower profitability and higher interest burden. Key risk to our rating is the downward revision of GST rate for cement from 28%. The stability in petcoke prices could help improvement in profitability.

Outlook

We downgrade UltraTech Cement to Hold (from Buy) with unchanged PT of Rs. 4,065, given the recent run-up of 11% in the stock price along with uncertainties regarding profitability ramp-up of recently acquired Binani Cement Limited (BCL).

IDBI Bank is awaiting a green signal from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to recover Rs 1,600 crore of Binani Cement's dues from UltraTech Cement, according to a report by Mint.

On November 19, the board of directors of UltraTech approved a proposal to incorporate debt-ridden Binani Cement as its wholly-owned subsidiary. UltraTech also promised to pay all of Binani's dues.

The bank cannot receive money from UltraTech Cement or remit it to its Dubai branch without RBI's permission. A delay in the central bank's approval may be because of the way the loan was disbursed -- through IDBI Bank's Dubai branch to a Binani group company in Belgium, the news daily reported.

RBI has reportedly been sending questions to IDBI Bank on the same.

The loan was originally given to 3B-The Fibreglass Co, a Binani group firm in Belgium. Binani Industries, the holding company of the Binani Group, had acquired 3B-The Fibreglass Co in February 2012.

The loan was, however, guaranteed by Binani Cement, which is why IDBI Bank was allowed to recover its loan through the insolvency process, sources told the paper.

""We need RBI permission to remit the money to the Dubai branch where the loan was given in euros,"" a source was quoted as saying. RBI's approval may depend on whether the central bank is satisfied with IDBI Bank's reply, the source said.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Senior IDBI Bank officials are planning to meet RBI Deputy Governor BP Kanungo to clarify its position on the transfer of funds. ""This money would substantially aid our recovery efforts,"" another source told the paper.

Cash-strapped IDBI Bank has non-performing assets (NPAs) worth Rs 60,875 crore, which is 32 percent of total loans. The bank's total capital adequacy ratio has slipped below the regulatory requirement (9 percent) to 6.22 percent as on September 30, 2018.

The bank, which is under the RBI’s prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, is hoping that fresh capital from LIC will hasten the process of cleaning up its books.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) in June had permitted LIC to increase its stake in IDBI Bank from 8 percent to 51 percent.

In August, the Cabinet had approved an acquisition of controlling stake in the bank by LIC as a promoter through preferential allotment/open offer of shares, and relinquishment of management control by the government in the bank.",411,-0.8505372107028961

UltraTech Cement said its board has approved a proposal to incorporate Binani Cement (BCL) as it a wholly-owned subsidiary.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) last week had approved the revised bid of Aditya Birla group firm UltraTech Cement for debt-ridden Binani Cement.

""The board of directors of UltraTech at its meeting held on the November 19, has approved UltraTech's proposal to form Binani Cement (BCL) into a wholly-owned subsidiary of UltraTech from the November 20,"" UltraTech Cement said in a statement.

UltraTech has acquired BCL's plants totalling 6.25 MTPA (million tonne per annum) in Rajasthan, inclusive of an integrated cement unit and a split grinding unit at a value of Rs 8,024 crore.

""This acquisition gives the company access to superior quality limestone reserves. BCL's subsidiaries in China and UAE stand transferred to UltraTech,"" the company said.

The move has been largely made on account of these factors and synergies that will stem from it. These include economies of scale, optimization of costs, both in manufacturing and logistics, coupled with a wider distribution network, it added.

UltraTech is extremely well positioned to turnaround BCL's operations, given its competence and unmatched experience in this sector, the company said adding to take this forward it has combined the acquired markets with its North zone and West zone operations, which are led by Sudeep Grover and Raju Anklesaria.

It further said that G Balasubramaniam, formerly Unit Head, Awarpur, has moved as Head of BCL's integrated cement unit.

With the addition of BCL's plants, UltraTech's network has grown to 50 plants pan India, the statement said.

The Supreme Court dismissed the plea of a Dalmia Bharat Group firm challenging the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order allowing rival UltraTech Cement to acquire debt-ridden Binani Cement.

A bench of justices R F Nariman and Navin Sinha upheld the NCLAT's last week order which had allowed the Aditya Birla group firm to acquire Binani Cement by approving its revised Rs 7,950.34 crore bid over an offer by Rajputana Properties.

The bench said there was no infirmity in the NCLAT's order.

The NCLAT had approved UltraTech's resolution plan for Binani and rejected the resolution plan submitted by Dalmia Bharat's Rajputana Properties by terming it ""discriminatory"" and ""unbalanced"".

The top court's order came on a plea by Rajputana Properties against the NCLAT order.

In its order, the NCLAT had observed that the plan submitted by Rajputana discriminated between ""equally situated"" financial creditors and did not balance other stakeholders such as the operational creditors of Binani Cement.

Rajputana Properties had moved the appellate tribunal against the May 2 order of Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that allowed the Resolution Professional and Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Binani to consider UltraTech's revised offer while affording Rajputana an opportunity to revise its resolution plan.

The CoC had earlier approved Rajputana's Rs 6,932.4-crore bid, but the decision was changed once UltraTech revised its offer.

The NCLAT had observed that the amended offer of UltraTech Cement has got 100 percent voting from the CoC and added that the intent of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was maximisation of the value of assets.

""We approve the revised resolution plan submitted by UltraTech Cement which shall be binding on the corporate debtor (Binani Cement) and its employees, members, creditors, guarantors and other stakeholders involved in the Resolution Plan,"" the NCLAT order had said.

The operational creditors of Binani, represented by Dhaval Vussonji, hailed the apex court order saying it has upheld the NCLAT's order ""which emphasises that the corporate insolvency resolution process must maximise value for stake holders and there should not be any discrimination amongst creditors who are at least similarly placed.""

The NCLAT had also dismissed the plea of promoters of Binani Industries for termination of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process after settling the dues with lenders under section 12 A of the IBC, saying that the application did not have the requisite 90 percent voting share of the CoC.

""Binani Industries cannot take advantage of Section 12A nor can be allowed to settle the matter,"" the NCLAT had said.

UltraTech is the leading cement manufacturer of the country with an installed capacity of 96.5 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) of grey cement.

It is already merging the cement business of BK Birla Group company Century Textiles and Industries, which has a capacity of 11.4 MTPA.

In its 44-page-long order, the NCLAT had observed that financial creditors such as ""Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company, IDBI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Bank of India and State Bank of India have been provided with 100 percent of their verified claim"" but the resolution applicant Rajputana Properties has given ""lesser percentage to Export-Import Bank of India 72.59 percent and State Bank of India-Hong Kong 10 percent"".

On the other hand, the resolution plan submitted by UltraTech allows ""maximization of assets of the Corporate Debtor (Binani Cement) while some amount of working capital has been infused (Rs 350 crores) and all the financial creditors and the Operational Creditors have been paid 100 percent of dues except the related parties,"" the NCLAT order had said.",619,-0.6118823289871216

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) Wednesday approved the revised bid of Aditya Birla group firm UltraTech Cement for debt-ridden Binani Cement.

A two-member bench of NCLAT, headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya, approved UltraTech's resolution plan and said that plan submitted by the rival Dalmia Bharat group firm Rajputana Properties was “discriminatory” against some financial creditors.

Earlier on July 2, the Supreme Court had transferred all matters related to corporate insolvency resolution process of Binani Cement to the appellate tribunal from the National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata.

The apex court had directed NCLAT to hear the case on a day-to-day basis.

Rajputana Properties had moved the Supreme Court against a decision by the lenders of Binani Cement to consider the revised resolution plan submitted by UltraTech.

The committee of creditors had also asked Rajputana Properties to revise its offer of Rs 6,930 crore.

UltraTech Cement's revised offer was at Rs 7,900 crore, against its earlier bid of Rs 7,200 crore.",173,

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement reported a mixed set of Q2FY19 numbers. The volume growth of 20% YoY to 15.8 MT (vs. I-direct estimate: 16.2 MT) was mainly led by an increase in utilisation of Jaypee assets and healthy institutional demand from East & North regions Average pet coke cost for the company was at $114/t. In August 2018, with China imposing 25% duty on US pet coke, pet coke prices have corrected from the peak of $122/t to below $105/t. With the advent of new axle load norms, freight costs reduced 7-8% for the company. However, that has been overshadowed by a rise in diesel prices on account of hardening of crude prices The company will commission 4 MT grinding unit at Bara, UP by March 2019. This coupled with acquisition of Century’s cement business will augment its capacity to 111.1 MT from 92.5 MT currently. The company is also looking at further investments in WHRS systems at these plants.

Outlook

Higher infra spend along with a revival in the rural economy is expected to boost cement demand by 8% in FY18-20E. This, coupled with limited supply (3% CAGR in FY18-20E) is expected to drive utilisation and pricing. Further, cost benefits emanating from hike in load carrying capacity, fall in petcoke prices, rise in WHR and renewable energy share along with cost optimisation of Jaypee plants (~Rs 35/t) is expected to keep UltraTech ahead of its peers in terms of profitability. Consequently, we maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised target price of Rs4,400/share (i.e. at 14.0x FY20E EV/EBITDA).

Centrum's research report on Ultratech Cement

During Q2FY19, UltraTech’s (UTCEM) total volume rose 19% YoY thus boosting standalone net sales by 21% YoY. However, EBITDA and PAT fell 4% and 9% YoY respectively, driven by elevated cost inflation amid muted price increase. Management expects inflationary pressure to sustain during H2FY19.

Outlook

However, expected cement price improvement during H2FY19 (amid sustained good demand and rising utilisation), should aid UTCEM’s margin recovery. We reiterate BUY on UTCEM with a revised TP of Rs4,450.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech (UTCEM) reported Q2FY19 earnings below our estimates due to higher than expected costs and lower volumes. Management believes that hike in prices higher post festive season and fall in fuel and freight cost would support the earnings in H2FY19e. However, we do not expect much improvement in prices due to high competitive intensity and structural shift in demand to low margin Non-trade segment. UTCEM would only add to this intensity with the impending acquisition of Binani cement (operating at 40% utilization), increase in utilization of acquired plants of JPA in Central region and new additions.

Outlook

In the backdrop of continued pressure on prices, we cut our EPS estimates for FY19e/FY20e each by 5%. We maintain HOLD with revised TP of Rs3,820 (earlier Rs4,000).

Nalanda Securities' research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech maintained its high double-digit volume growth which stood at 15.7mt for the quarter, up by 20% YoY. Realization increased by 3.7% sequentially due to an industry-wide increase in cement prices. Net Sales rose by 20% YoY (-7% QoQ) to INR 8151cr.

Outlook

However, near-term input cost pressures as well as delay in Barra project prompts us to reduce our target price to INR 4110/share giving an upside of 14% (at an average of 14x FY20 EV/EBITDA and $175 FY20 EV/Ton)

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Ultratech Cement

UTCEM’s volumes grew 20% YoY to 15.8mt (our estimate: 16.7mt) in 2QFY19. Realizations increased 1.4% QoQ to INR5,015/t (in-line) due to higher prices in the central, north and southern markets. Net sales grew 21% YoY (-8% QoQ) to INR79b (our estimate: INR83.7b).

Outlook

With ~23% market share, UTCEM is likely to emerge as a beneficiary of a likely upturn in the Indian cement cycle over FY18-20. We value UTCEM at 14x Sep’20 EBITDA to arrive at a TP INR4,157. Maintain Buy.

UltraTech Cement stock fell 3.36 percent intraday to hit 21-month low of Rs 3,488 on October 22 after brokerage houses said earnings missed estimates on lower volume and higher cost.

These research firms barring Credit Suisse expect 8-47 percent upside in the stock.

While maintaining buy call on the cement major, Edelweiss slashed target price on the stock to Rs 4,411 from Rs 4,779 (implying a potential upside of 22 percent) due to its inability to take price hikes despite decent volume gains is disheartening.

With cement prices continuing to be weak, the research house cut FY19 EBITDA estimates by 9 percent but stayed optimistic on price hikes, which would is likely to be effective from January 2019.

Nomura also maintained its buy rating on UltraTech with a target price of Rs 5,150, implying a potential upside of 43 percent as it believes UltraTech is best geared for cement cycle upturn that has begun. Though the company missed Q2FY19 estimates.

It said Q2 miss was driven by lower volume and higher costs.

Morgan Stanley has overweight call on UltraTech with a target price of Rs 4,954 per share, citing above expectation volume growth and in-line realisation which helped the company deliver in-line EBITDA.

Demand momentum remained strong but the pace of cost acceleration will be moderate, given softer petcoke prices, it said, adding, price hike during seasonally strong demand period is key to delivery on earnings.

Deutsche Bank also reiterated its buy call on the stock on improved pricing power. It sees a robust 30 percent EPS CAGR over FY18-21 supported by 18 percent CAGR in volume.

However, it cut its target price to Rs 4,500 from Rs 4,760 due to energy cost inflation and also slashed its FY19-20 EPS estimate by 3-4 percent. Price hikes are expected to drive margin recovery, it feels.

The cement major reported a 9 percent fall in Q2 standalone profit YoY to Rs 390.8 crore on weak operational performance and rising energy & logistics cost.

Revenue during the quarter increased 21 percent to Rs 7,771.3 crore while EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) declined 6.7 percent to Rs 1,207.6 crore and margin contracted 460 basis points YoY.

Power and fuel cost in Q2 rose 30 percent to Rs 1,886 crore and freight and forwarding expenses jumped 25 percent to Rs 1,946.9 crore compared to year-ago. Other expenses also increased by 19.8 percent to Rs 1,058 crore YoY.

Higher cost was due to a weak rupee, higher diesel intake and higher other costs, said Axis Capital which retained its hold rating with a target price of Rs 3,885 (potential upside of 8 percent).

The research house expects positive demand momentum going ahead.

Credit Suisse maintained its underperform call on the stock and slashed target price to Rs 3,300 from Rs 3,500. It also cut FY19/20 EPS by 15/19 percent after earnings.

It expects volumes to be impacted from lower disbursements by housing finance companies.",501,-0.17538699683021097

Cement major UltraTech Cement may report a 21 percent year-on-year rise in its net profit for the September quarter at Rs 520 crore, according to Motilal Oswal. Meanwhile, Emkay estimates the profit to be Rs 430 crore for the quarter under review.

The grey cement volumes are estimated at 16.4 million tonnes, including JP Associates’ volumes, analysts at Motilal Oswal wrote in their report. “Realisations are estimated to increase 1.4% QoQ to Rs 5,015/tonne, led by pricing improvement in North and South India,” they further wrote.

Emkay estimates this to improve 3 percent year on year.

The EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisaion) /tonne is likely to be reported at Rs 871 (down Rs 57 QoQ) primarily due to cost push. EBITDA margin is expected to contract 1.4 percentage points QoQ to 17.4%, Motilal Oswal reported.

In terms of volumes, Emkay expects 19.9% YoY growth in volume to 15.75 MT, led by the higher utilisation of JP Group’s acquired assets. “Higher volume/realisation should lead to revenue growth of 23.8% YoY.”

- Volume growth recovery and outlook

- Cement pricing outlook and sustainability

- Update on JPA’s operations

Century Textiles and Industries' decision to demerge the cement business into UltraTech Cement and transfer the viscose filament yarn business to Grasim will help it reduce the debt and focus on textiles, pulp and paper and real estate businesses, a top company official said.

Century Textiles and Industries (CTIL) in May this year announced plans to demerge its cement business into Aditya Birla group firm UltraTech Cement.

The company last year also entered into a deal with Grasim Industries to manage and operate its viscose filament yarn (VFY) business for a period of 15 years. The agreement would provide Grasim the right to use the relevant assets of CTIL, however, the ownership of assets to remain with CTIL.

Grasim would be paying Rs 600 crore royalty and a refundable security deposit of Rs 200 crore, to be done through internal accruals.

""This will help the company in reducing its debt,"" CTIL vice chairman Kumar Managalam Birla told shareholders at the annual general meeting today.

The company's debt is estimated at around Rs 4,100 crore at present.

Currently, CTIL has exposure to the cement, textiles, pulp and paper and real estate businesses.

Its VFY plant is located at Shahad, Thane, having a capacity of 25,000 tonne, which includes 19,000 tonne of VFY and 6,000 tonne in rayon tyre yarn.

""CTIL has also decided to demerge 13.4 million tonne cement capacity to UltraTech Cement which will enable transfer of debt of around Rs 3,000 crore,"" Birla said, adding UltraTech is in a growth phase and the acquisition will give the company ready capacities in growing markets.

Shareholders of CTIL will receive one share of UltraTech for every eight shares held.

""This transaction will help the firm in deleveraging balance sheet and creating an opportunity for its growth in the remaining businesses especially in unlocking the value in the real estate portfolio,"" he said.

Currently the company has around 30 acre in Worli area in the city, besides around 100 acres in Kalyan.

It also has land parcel in Pune, which will be developed at a later stage, the company said.

The company yesterday reported a net profit of Rs 162.66 crore for the three months to June, against Rs 120.24 crore in the year-ago period.",384,0.9671119600534439

Centrum's research report on Ultratech Cement

UltraTech’s (UTCEM) Q1FY19 standalone EBITDA rose a modest 4% YoY, as weak pricing amid elevated cost inflation moderated the positives of 33% YoY volume growth (core volume up ~7.5% YoY). Continued improvement in energy consumption metrics and lead distance reduction partly moderated the impact of rising energy costs YoY. Amid a good demand outlook, we expect UTCEM to deliver an industry leading 14% volume CAGR during FY18-20E.

Outlook

We also expect UTCEM’s margins to benefit from better pricing (H2FY19 onwards), UTCEM’s rising economies of scale and prudent cost controls. We reiterate BUY with a revised TP of Rs4,740.

JM Financial's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech reported revenue growth of 31% YoY for 1QFY19, primarily on volume growth aided by JP assets’ ramp-up (70% capacity utilisation). Blended realisations remained flat on a sequential and YoY basis. EBITDA/t declined by 20% primarily on cost escalations which was partially offset by better operating leverage. JP assets cash breakeven was achieved in 1Q and company is targeting PBT breakeven by 1QFY20. Management guidance for double digit growth going forward stems from demand improvement on infrastructure and affordable/rural housing segments. The company commissioned 1.75 grinding capacity during the quarter. UltraTech’s net debt as on 1QFY19 stands at INR 117.99bn (net debt-to- EBITDA at 1.74x). Swift execution of capacity expansion and a quick ramp-up in utilisation builds confidence in its execution capability.

Outlook

We continue to value UltraTech’s existing assets at 12x EVE and incorporate INR 650 on the expansion potential. Our TP is INR 4,430 and we maintain BUY.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech (UTCEM) reported Q1FY19 earnings below our estimates due to lower than expected realisations. Street is betting on sustainable strength in prices (with expansion in margins), led by strong demand and emerging discipline. However, we do not believe that this theme would unfold over next couple of years due to weak quality of demand and long pipeline of capacity addition in the sector.

Outlook

Most importantly, stretched valuations (EV/EBITDA at 15.2x, P/E of 29x FY20e) limits meaningful upside from current levels with limited margin of safety. We maintain HOLD with TP of Rs4000.

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement reported volume growth of 32.6% YoY to 17.5 MT (above I-direct estimate of 17.1 MT) mainly led by an increase in utilisation of Jaypee assets to 70%, better sand availability and higher infra demand. Consequently, revenues increased 30.6% YoY to Rs 8,655.0 crore (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 8,752.2 crore) However, 35.0% YoY increase in pet coke prices and 20% increase in diesel prices adversely impacted EBITDA/t (down 21.5% YoY to Rs 928/t) The company will commission its 4 MT grinding unit at Bara Uttar Pradesh by March 2019. Further, acquisition of Century’s cement business will take the total capacity to 111.1 MT.

Outlook

Higher infra spend along with a revival in the rural economy is expected to boost cement demand by 8% in FY18-20E. This, coupled with limited supply (3% CAGR in FY18-20E) is expected to drive utilisation and pricing. Further, the increase in load carrying capacity by truckers is expected to lower logistic cost (accounts for 30% of overall cost). This coupled with various cost efficiencies like higher WHR share (from 7% to 15%), cost optimisation of Jaypee plants (Rs 50/t) and use of alternative fuel is expected to keep UltraTech ahead of its peers in terms of profitability. Consequently, we maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 4,800/share (i.e. at 16x FY20E EV/EBITDA).

UltraTech Cement's standalone profit for the June quarter declined 32.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 598.39 crore due to dismal margin performance, but revenue from operations grew by 30.6 percent to Rs 8,655 crore.

""The company's acquisition of 21.2 mtpa cement capacity in June 2017 has already achieved an average capacity utilisation of 70 percent across all the regions and a cash break even. This has been one of the fastest ramp ups of an acquired capacity,"" UltraTech said in its filing. ""Sales volume in Q1 jumped 34 percent to 16.8 million tonnes YoY.""

But the figures for the three months ended June 2018 are not comparable with the previous corresponding periods as the company had acquired cement plants from Jaiprakash Associates and Jaypee Cement Corporation on June 29, 2017.

UltraTech said notwithstanding the hike in fuel prices, it achieved an operating EBITDA of Rs 929 per tonne compared to Rs 922 per tonne in Q4FY18.

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased 4 percent to Rs 1,623.8 crore but margin contracted 474 basis points to 18.8 percent due to rise in depreciation expenses (up 57 percent YoY), finance cost (161 percent), power & fuel cost (53 percent) and freight & forwarding expenses (40 percent).

Brokerage houses remained positive on the stock, expecting the stock to give returns up to 4-27 percent.

Morgan Stanley: Overweight | Target - Rs 4,894 | Return - 27%

EBITDA 3 percent is ahead of our estimate. The key driver to earnings was 34 percent volume growth to 17.5 million tonnes. Positive surprise was a 1.5 percent QoQ improvement in realisation.

EBITDA per tonne was flattish sequentially. Management expects demand momentum to remain strong.

Deutsche Bank: Buy | Target - Rs 4,400 | Return - 14%

Numbers were broadly in-line. We see margin improving by year end and stayed 8-10 percent below consensus on FY19 EPS on weaker margin expectation.

We are structurally positive on company based on better pricing power in West and Central India.

ICICI Securities: Buy | Target - Rs 4,800 | Return - 25%

Higher infra spend along with a revival in the rural economy is expected to boost cement demand by 8 percent in FY18-20E. This, coupled with limited supply (3 percent CAGR in FY18-20E) is expected to drive utilisation and pricing.

Further, the increase in load carrying capacity by truckers is expected to lower logistic cost (accounts for 30 percent of overall cost).

This coupled with various cost efficiencies like higher WHR share (from 7 percent to 15 percent), cost optimisation of Jaypee plants (Rs 50 per tonne) and use of alternative fuel is expected to keep UltraTech ahead of its peers in terms of profitability.

Consequently, we maintain Buy recommendation on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 4,800/share (i.e. at 16x FY20E EV/EBITDA).

Motilal Oswal: Buy | Target - Rs 4,696 | Return - 22%

Ultratech's volumes (including white cement) rose 33 percent YoY (-5 percent QoQ) to 17.5mt (estimates of 17.63mt) due to inclusion of Jaiprakash Associates' assets, which operated at 70 percent utilisation in Q1FY19 (versus 75 percent in Q4FY18). We estimate domestic grey volume growth at 9.5 percent YoY for ex-JPA operations in Q1FY19.

Blended realisations rose 1.4 percent QoQ to Rs 4,947 (estimates of Rs 5,030) due to better pricing in the central and west markets. Realisations improved QoQ in the west and central markets, the impact from which was partially offset by lower prices in the north and south markets.

The stock trades at 14.6x/11.3x FY19/20E EV/EBITDA. We value the stock at 13x FY20E EBITDA to arrive at a target price of Rs 4,696. Buy

Prabhudas Lilladher: Hold | Target - Rs 4,000 | Return - 4%

Ultratech reported Q1FY19 earnings below our estimates due to lower than expected realisations. Street is betting on sustainable strength in prices (with expansion in margins), led by strong demand and emerging discipline.

However, we do not believe that this theme would unfold over next couple of years due to weak quality of demand and long pipeline of capacity addition in the sector.

Most importantly, stretched valuations (EV/EBITDA at 15.2x, P/E of 29x FY20e) limits meaningful upside from current levels with limited margin of safety. We maintain Hold with target price of Rs 4,000.

The stock price closed at Rs 3,857.25, up Rs 7.90, or 0.21 percent on the BSE.

UltraTech Cement started off the financial year 2018-19 on a weak note as standalone profit during the April-June quarter fell 32.9 percent to Rs 598.39 crore due to dismal margin performance.

Bottomline numbers for the quarter ended June 2017 stood at Rs 890.62 crore.

The company had acquired cement plants from Jaiprakash Associates and Jaypee Cement Corporation on June 29, 2017. Hence the figures for the three months ended June 30, 2018 are not comparable with the previous corresponding periods.

Revenue from operations grew by 30.6 percent to Rs 8,655 crore compared to Rs 6,626.45 crore in same period last fiscal.

""The company's acquisition of 21.2 mtpa cement capacity in June 2017 has already achieved an average capacity utilisation of 70 percent across all the regions and a cash break even. This has been one of the fastest ramp ups of an acquired capacity,"" UltraTech said in its filing.

Sales volume in Q1 jumped 34 percent to 16.8 million tonnes YoY.

The company said notwithstanding the hike in fuel prices, it achieved an operating EBITDA of Rs 929 per tonne compared to Rs 922 per tonne in Q4FY18.

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased 4 percent to Rs 1,623.8 crore but margin contracted 474 basis points to 18.8 percent due to rise in depreciation expenses (up 57 percent YoY), finance cost (161 percent), power & fuel cost (53 percent) and freight & forwarding expenses (40 percent).

Key concerns highlighted by the company in its filing are rising cost pressures, likely increase in interest rates and sluggish demand in the Tier-II and III urban housing and commercial segment.

Meanwhile, UltraTech said board has approved a scheme of of arrangement amongst Century Textiles and Industries, the company and their respective shareholders and creditors. ""Century will demerge its cement business into the company.""

Century's cement business consists of three integrated cement units in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra and a grinding unit in West Bengal.

As per the scheme, UltraTech will issue one equity share for every 8 equity shares of Century to the shareholders of Century.

UltraTech Cement has won a lawsuit against Everest Industries in a copyright infringement case, according to a report by Mint.

On March 21, Aditya Birla Group-owned UltraTech Cement had moved to the Bombay High Court against Everest Industries for copyright infringement claiming that the latter was using the marks ‘Ultratruf’ and ‘A One Ultratruf’ to sell cement.

UltraTech had also stated that the placement of the mark, its style, font and colour combination, were deceptively similar to the registered mark and, hence, it had sent a cease-and-desist notice to Everest.

Under the Intellectual Property Rights law, this is called ‘passing off’ or making a false representation leading to a person to believe that the goods and/or services are from another seller. A brand can approach the court to protect its rights.

In his order, Justice SJ Kathawala said, “Prima facie, the marks ‘Ultratruf — The Builders Choice’ and ‘A One Ultratruf’ used by the defendants are deceptively similar to the plaintiffs’ registered trademark ‘UltraTech’.

The court also stated that Everest was deceptively using another brand name ‘Ambruja’ which was similar to that of ‘Ambuja Cements Limited’.

On May 14, the court ordered Everest Industries to not use the mark in any manner and asked them to deposit a sum of Rs 10 lakh as costs and damages within two weeks.",230,

Edelweiss' research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement’s (UTCL) proposal to acquire 13.4mtpa cement assets from Century Textiles (CTIL), we believe, will delight investors given: 1) lucrative valuation of USD96/t (USD106/t adjusted to 2mtpa split grinding unit) broadly at par with current replacement cost; 2) the acquisition will fortify UTCL’s leadership position & catapult market share from 21% to 24%; 3) acquisition will be EPS neutral from day one with low hanging levers to enhance current profitability; and 4) no major stress on balance sheet. UTCL’s endeavour to bolster its market share via acquisitions amidst organic expansions, both at optimal cost, is heartening. While the deal is subject to regulatory clearances and CCI’s approval, management’s confidence of completing it over the next six-nine months is comforting. Rough cut analysis indicates no major changes in our FY20 EPS and TP.

Outlook

With a positive view on the cement sector citing rising clinker utilisations and numero uno UTCL being an obvious beneficiary, we maintain ‘BUY’ with TP of INR4,779.

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement (UltraTech) has entered into a scheme of arrangement with Century Textile and Industries (Century) to acquire its 13.4 MT cement capacity at | 8,621 crore. This move will increase its capacity by 14% to 109.9 MT (from current 96.5 MT), marking it the largest cement player in the domestic market (third largest player globally) with market share of over 24%. The assets to be acquired include 13.4 MT cement capacity along with 177 MW captive thermal power plant for | 8,621 crore, which works out to US$96/t

Outlook

UltraTech will have a presence across regions (except NE) enabling it to reap the benefits of a demand recovery led by higher government spends on infra and revival in housing demand. Although the deal remains positive, the transaction is subject to various regulatory approvals. Hence, we have not factored in the transaction in our valuation. We continue to maintain our positive view with a target price of | 5,000/share (i.e. at 16x FY20E EV/EBITDA) and BUY rating on the stock.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech (UTCEM) announed much expected merger of Century textile's cement business (capacity of 13.4mn t) for consideration of Rs86.2bn. The merger would further strengthen UTCEM's presence in Maharashtra, Central and Eastern region. Though the deal looks attractive on EV/t with valuations at USD106, weak profitability makes transaction expensive on EV/EBITDA with valuations at 17.5x FY18/12.0x FY20e. Led by upgrade in prices, rationalisation of overheads and cost efficiencies, UTCEM is confident to increase margins to Rs900/t (from current Rs400) over couple of years. However, we believe that margin improvement would restrict to Rs700 since current profitability already carries the benefits of restructuring done by UTCEM over past couple of years on pricing and cost front.

Outlook

Though UTCEM remains the best play in the sector given its high scale and efficient operations; weak pricing power and expensive valuations limits us to maintain Accumulate rating with TP of Rs4,500, EV/EBITDA of 16x FY20E.

A scheduled meeting of Binani Cement's lenders for Thursday has been postponed after Dalmia Bharat alleged that UltraTech is ineligible from participating in the auction.

The lenders were to consider UltraTech's offer to buy Binani Cement, as per an order by the National Company Law Tribunal last week. The tribunal had also asked the lenders a revised bid from Dalmia if the company wished to offer.

Auction of Binani Cement has remained stuck after the lenders chose Dalmia's bid, only for UltraTech to contest the decision. Later, the Aditya Birla company offered to provide a line of credit to Binani Cement's parent -- Binani Industries -- in return of a majority stake in the distressed company.

But even before the lenders could consider UltraTech's offer, Dalmia has objected to the move. The Delhi-based company has argued that UltraTech's bid should be termed ineligible as the latter had made an agreement with Binani Industries, which is a defaulter.

""We are perplexed at Dalmia's move,"" said a source close to Binani Cement.

UltraTech has made a revised bid of Rs 7,840 crore for Binani Cement. Dalmia's offer of Rs 6,700 crore was higher was UltraTech's first bid. The Aditya Birla company later upped its offer.",214,-0.8557264804840088

Centrum's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech’s (UTCEM) Q4FY18 standalone EBITDA rose 33% YoY buoyed by 31% YoY volume growth (core volume up 8% YoY), and better cost control amid rising input and freight costs. Strong demand bolstered volume growth and boosted utilisation. Continued improvement in energy consumption metrics and lead distance reduction partly moderated the impact of rising energy costs YoY.

Outlook

We trim FY19/20E EBITDA estimates by 4%/3% respectively to account for ongoing increase seen in fuel and diesel prices. We continue to like UltraTech owing to its industry leadership, prudent cost structure, and steady capacity growth without straining its balance sheet. We reiterate BUY with a revised TP of Rs4980 (15x FY20E EBIDTA).For all recommendations report, click here

Acquired plants of JPA (17mtpa) continued to ramp-up ahead of schedule with utilisation at 75% in Q4 and exit rate of 84-85%. However, we cut our earnings estimates by 10%/12% for FY19E/FY20E factoring in lower realisations (on account of intense competition and overcapacity). Admittedly, earnings would remain under pressure in near term but given the strong pipeline of capacity addition (11mn tonnes (t) in next two years), smooth merger of JPA plants and quality operations, UTCEM would be well poised to exploit the price led recovery.

Outlook

We maintain Accumulate with TP of Rs4,500, EV/EBITDA of 16x FY20E

Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol Research

UltraTech Cement ended FY18 on a much stronger note although reported numbers were impacted by exceptional one-off charges. Turnaround of acquired capacity from JP Associates (JPA) is starting to reflect. The management sounded optimistic on the demand scenario in FY19 and expects the industry to achieve historical correlation with GDP growth after a gap of nearly seven years. The cost pressures that had been plaguing the industry could be passed on going forward, given the improved capacity utilisation. Although the stock valuation doesn’t leave room for comfort, given the improved outlook for the sector, liquidity will continue to support the elevated valuation. Hence, investors can accumulate the stock on any dip.

Q4 FY18 at a glance

The company posted a decline in profitability on account of several one-offs: payment of stamp duty on account of acquisition of JP assets (Rs 226 crore), deferred tax provision (Rs 41 crore) and lower mark-to-market gains (Rs 64 crore).

While the headline volume number at 17.64MT exhibited a 32 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth, adjusting for the acquired capacity of JPA (21.2MT), like-to-like growth translates to 6.7 percent.

Despite cost pressures emanating from logistics (sequential increase of four percent and six percent YoY) and energy (sequential increase of four percent and 17 percent YoY), the company managed to contain overall costs, thanks to several efficiency improvement programmes. It also managed to reduce its lead distance, cut power consumption and increase usage of low-cost fuel.

Realisation showed an uptick in the quarter gone by. Consequently, there was a significant sequential improvement in profitability per tonne. The management said the price trend remains subdued in the south, flat in the north but has improved in eastern and western markets.

Improvement in capacity utilisation

What is heartening to note is the improvement in capacity utilisation. The management sees clear greenshoots and said the improvement in capacity utilisation should permit passing on rising cost pressures.

Early turnaround of JPA capacity

UltraTech has seen significant success in ramping up capacity utilisation (to 75 percent) in the acquired assets of JPA. It has also achieved cash break-even despite debt funding to the extent of 80 percent for this acquisition. Operating expense of these capacities are dropping steadily and there is a current gap of only Rs 125/ t between the existing and intended cost for these capacities. The management has set a profit before tax (PBT) breakeven target of Q1 FY20. But given the capacity utilisation of 80 percent as at FY18-end, the target should be achieved much earlier.

Smart greenfield expansion raises questions about future M&A valuations in the sector

The management commissioned greenfield clinker capacity of 2.5 mtpa (cement capacity of 3.5 mtpa) at Dhar, Madhya Pradesh in less than a year and under $90/MT. This sets a new benchmark and has far reaching implications for future merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the sector. A greenfield plant can be set up within a year at a cost close to $105/tonne (including land) only if the seller of a cement asset offers huge limestone reserve. Otherwise, it doesn’t make economic sense to grow inorganically.

UltraTech is interested in Binnani’s capacity in the north given the latter’s access to superior quality limestone which will take care of future expansion. The management is still open to the inorganic growth to maintain its market share but would be selective on assets and geographies. It said is keen on expanding its footprint in the east and northeast and won’t mind leveraging its Balance Sheet.

Management sees higher growth in FY19

The management believes the industry clocked demand growth to the tune of eight percent in FY18. It expects a much better FY19, with long-term average cement demand growth of 1.2 times GDP making a comeback. Its optimism stems from increased infrastructure activities led by the government, incentives given to affordable housing, stability in the real estate market post implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016.

Should investors buy at current levels?

These multiple tailwinds should in general support the elevated valuation of the sector and UltraTech in particular. Given multiple moats – industry leading capacity, cost leadership and smart acquisition - we see little medium-term risk of its stretched valuation (EV/EBIDTA of 16 times FY19 and EV/tonne of $217). The company is a long-term secular exposure on India’s GDP growth and should be accumulated on dips.

UltraTech Cement has reported a 29 percent year-on-year degrowth in March quarter standalone profit at Rs 488 crore due to provision for stamp duty, boosted by revenue and operational income.

The company had posted profit for the March quarter 2017 at Rs 688 crore.

""A onetime provision for stamp duty of Rs 226 crore and Rs 41 crore for deferred tax due to the change in tax rates has resulted in reported profit at Rs 488 crore,"" the company said, adding profit before one-time adjustment stood at Rs 677 crore against Rs 688 crore previous year.

Revenue on standalone basis grew by 36.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 9,002.5 crore for the quarter ended March 2018, with a 31 percent increase in sales volume and 5 percent rise in realisation.

Domestic sales volume was 32 percent higher at 17.64 million tonne in March quarter 2018 compared to 13.35 million tonne in year-ago period.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) in Q4 jumped 33.2 percent to Rs 1,703 crore but margin contracted 50 basis points to 18.9 percent compared to same quarter last year.

The company said the quarter continued to witness increase in input costs attributable to rise in pet coke and coal prices and the ban on pet coke usage in TPPs.

Tax expenses for the quarter were lower by 29 percent year-on-year at Rs 163.3 crore while deferred tax increased 20 percent to Rs 115.8 crore.

UltraTech Cement's bid to acquire Binani Cement has got a big boost. The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has asked the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to consider a proposal by Binani Industries - parent company of Binani Cement - to pay off all its creditors.

This indirectly paves the way for the out-of-court settlement between Binani Industries and the Aditya Birla firm.

According to the settlement, UltraTech will issue Binani Industries a letter of comfort providing Rs 7,266 crore. Binani Industries will use the funds to pay off Binani Cement's creditors, including the unsecured ones. In return, UltraTech will acquire 98.47 percent stake in BInani Cement

The Bench added it will hear all the petitions on April 2.

Binani Industries had earlier asked the Bench for permission to pay off its lenders by April 10.

If approved, this will set a precedent for insolvency proceedings that are being pursued at the present. Also, Binani's petition to terminate insolvency proceedings against its cement unit will have to be cleared by the lenders.

Twists and turns

Earlier, UltraTech had alleged lack of transparency in the proceedings to auction Binani Cement, which was referred to the NCLT after accumulating debts of Rs 5,000 crore.

In a meeting held on March 16, the CoC had approved the plan presented by Dalmia Cement, dealing a blow to UltraTech's plans.

Dalmia had offered bid worth Rs 6,350 crore to Binani's lenders, with an equity of 20 percent.

Sources close to the development further told Moneycontrol that UltraTech has also got the nod from Competition Commission of India for its bid for Binani.

Respite for smaller creditors

“This is the best example of upholding the law of the country,” said Sidharth Tibrewal, Senior Committee Member and spokesperson, Binani Operational Creditors Forum (BOCF). The Forum represents 3,000 operations creditors of Binani Cement.

“This is a big win for everyone,” added Tibrewal.

The Forum has claimed Rs 550 crore in unpaid dues from Binani Cement. “While the lenders were getting 16 per cent interest in their loans to the company, we were expected to take a haircut of almost 80 per cent,” added Tibrewal. He added that the claim will rise to Rs 700 crore if the rate of interest is added, as in the case of the banks.

The 3,000 operations creditors supply several items to Binani, and this includes coal, packaging and transportation services.

Binani’s total secured and unsecured debt amounts to about Rs 6,265 crore. Of this, the largest exposure is from Edelweiss ARC with an outstanding of about Rs 2,775 crore. UltraTech had offered Rs 700 crore more than Dalmia. But after its bid was rejected by the lenders’ committee and the resolution professional, UltraTech challenged the decision in at NCLT’s Kolkata bench.

IDBI's case

The bench also heard the case of IDBI, the unsecured lender to Binani Cement. According to sources attending the proceedings in Kolkata, IDBI's claim has been questioned.",501,0.16118030548095702

Aditya Birla Group firm UltraTech Cement today said that it has not violated the IBC in offering a Rs 7,266 crore bid to acquire debt ridden Binani Cement (BCL), which was already set to be sold to the Dalmia Bharat group by its creditors.

UltraTech has announced to acquire BCL by providing Rs 7,266 crore to its parent company Binani Industries Ltd (BIL) against bid of Rs 6,350 crore along with 20 per cent equity in BCL by Rajputana Properties, a part of Dalmia Bharat group, approved by the resolution professional (RP).

""We are fully compliant with IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code). We have submitted our bid. We are allowed to revise our bids. IBC says maximise value and if the banker is getting higher amount of money before they have taken a decision, then they should take a decision with their eyes open,"" UltraTech Cement CFO Atul Daga told PTI.

He further added that the company is ""committed to honour"" the amount which it has offered.

""We have filed it with NCLT, well before the Committee of Creditors (CoC) recommendation was put out, well before CoC filed their resolution plan bid with NCLT. Where we have gone wrong?,"" Daga added.

He said UltraTech agreed to issue 'comfort letter' to provide Rs 7,266 crore in return for 98.43 percent stake in Binani Cement after an approach from the owners of BCL.

""If they can take the company out of insolvency proceedings, we are happy to pay the same amount of money to buy the company and it has to be used to repay the debt. For that purpose they wanted a letter of comfort and we have given them a letter of comfort. I do not think that we have gone against IBC anyway,"" Daga added.

According to him, some of the creditors who were not happy with Dalmia Group bids have approached NCLT backing Ultratech's bid.

""All the creditors, who are against the bid from the present resolution plan have gone to NCLT. They are trade creditors, suppliers who have filed the claim at NCLT,"" said Daga.

He further said, ""SBI Hongkong, Exim bank had filed a case for maximisation of the value because clearly they were feeling let down by the proposal accepted by the majority of the creditor"".

Meanwhile, in a separate development, BIL denied reports of resolution professional alleging fraud by BIL promoters.

""The question of any fraud committed by the company or by members of the board of directors of the company does not and cannot arise as all the accounts of the company and the holding companies are fully audited and all transactions, including related party transaction have been disclosed,"" BIL said in a regulatory filing.

Dalmia Bharat had yesterday informed stock exchanges that its Rs 6,350-crore bid has been submitted by RP before NCLT for approval and it has also submitted a performance bank guarantee (PBG) of 10 per cent of upfront payment of its offer to the financial creditors of BCL.",510,-0.5769509077072144

Aditya Birla Group's UltraTech Cement is likely to get support from Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Binani Cement in the ongoing fight for control after the Birla company issued comfort letter worth Rs 7,266 crore to Binani group for 98.43 per cent stake.

UltraTech had said that Binani Industries Ltd (BIL) - the promoter firm of BCL - had approached it for arranging funds to pay off the lenders.

""As a creditor, we support the UltraTech offer as it offers a better deal for us,"" an official from a lead creditor told PTI.

This is despite the CoC's approval of the Dalmia Bharat's bid.

""Since, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code IBC proceedings initiated about 7-8 months back on Binani, a moratorium on interest had been imposed. The UltraTech offer allows the loan to a regular one and there will be no haircut even in the interest loss in the interim period,"" the official explained.

A revised bid after the CoC approval is perhaps a first instance and legal opinions remain divided on its sanity.

But, if the NCLT proceeding is challenged in the Supreme Court, CoC will support the move.

The bid by Dalmia Bharat Cement jointly with Bain Capital's Resurgent India Fund of Rs 6,350 crore has been to buy Binani Cement offering 20 per cent equity in Binani to the lenders.

The total secured and unsecured debt of financial creditors is around Rs 6,265 crore, of which the largest exposure is from Edelweiss ARC with an outstanding of about Rs 2,775 crore.

The Dalmia offer covered the financial creditors but several small operational creditors (read MSMEs) have claimed their debt has not been taken care of properly and haircut of even 80 per cent was sought, Rajesh Tibrewal, representing these operational creditors, said.

""We have also moved an intervention petition against the resolution professional (RP) for neglecting our interest and the same was listed for hearing on March 22, he said.

The MSME operational creditors' dues are about Rs 700 crore in Binani Cement, he added.

Tibrewal said that the insolvency law does not treat operational creditors at par with financial creditors which is lacunae in the law.",371,0.9979768395423889

In a fresh twist to the auction of Binani Cement, UltraTech Cement on Monday announced it is set to buy Binani's stressed assets after its board agreed to issue a 'comfort letter' providing Rs 7,266 crore to Binani's parent.

Binani Industries Ltd, the parent, will use the money to pay off Binani Cement's lenders and other liabilities.

The latest move comes after the Aditya Birla Group company had alleged lack of transparency in the proceedings to auction Binani Cement, which was referred to the National Company Law Tribunal after accumulating debts of Rs 5,000 crore.

In a meeting held on March 16, the Committee of Creditors had approved the plan presented by Dalmia Cement, dealing a blow to UltraTech's plans.

According to reports, Dalmia had bid Rs 6,350 crore to Binani's lenders, and had also offered an equity of 20 percent.

""Binani Industries...has approached the Company for arranging funds to pay-off the lenders,"" UltraTech said in a statement to Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday. In return, the country's largest cement maker will purchase 98.47 percent in Binani Cement.

But the deal is subject to termination of the auction proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

""The Board... has agreed to issue the comfort letter confirming that the company will provide funds amounting to Rs 7,266 crore, being the amount it had offered the Committee of Creditors...""

A consortium led by Dalmia Bharat has received final approval from the Committee of Creditors (CoC) to acquire Binani Cement for Rs 6,700 crore, including capital of Rs 400 crore, reported Business Standard.

However, the deal has not gone down well with Aditya Birla Group firm UltraTech Cement, which was also in race for Binani, and had increased its initial bid to Rs 6,900 crore. Considering its bid is higher than that of Dalmia-led consortium, UltraTech may challenge the deal in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

""Expect a full-scale legal battle as the resolution professional ran a non-transparent process while ignoring our offer of Rs 69 billion (Rs 6,900 crore),"" an UltraTech executive told the paper.

The CoC approved the resolution plan proposed by Dalmia Bharat Cement after four hours of discussion. The decision was taken despite UltraTech's increased bid on Wednesday, a person familiar with the development told the paper.

“Usually after the CoC voting, it takes two to three days to place the proposal before the NCLT for final approval,” said the source quoted above.

A Dalmia Bharat spokesperson said the company would not comment on the Binani Cement acquisition at present.

Earlier, UltraTech had moved the NCLT against the resolution professional and Deloitte for rejecting its bid for Binani Cement. Following which, the NCLT asked Vijaykumar Iyer, the resolution professional for Binani Cement, to appear in person in the Tribunal to answer questions on the bidding process on March 13.

UltraTech had alleged the resolution professional did not follow a transparent bidding process and did not offer any details for not considering their bid.

A Deloitte spokesperson had earlier declined to comment citing client confidentiality.

Binani Cement has debts of around Rs 4,000 crore and and unsecured lenders of about Rs 2,500 crore. It is one of the rare cases where banks are not taking a haircut.

Interestingly, the promoter of Binani Cement has already challenged the resolution professional in NCLT claiming that the RP has “personal interest” in undervaluing Binani Cement.

The value of Binani Cement is Rs 17,300 crore, according to Binani Industries.

If NCLT approves this deal, it will be the third such acquisition by Dalmia Bharat Cement, the other two being Murli Cement and Kalyanpur Cement.

Indian equity benchmarks traded mostly in green for most part of the day but ended in red with Nifty slipping below 10,250 mark. The brutal sell-off in last hour of trade dragged the markets lower with Sensex falling around 400 points and Nifty closing at fresh 2018 low.

Banking shares were under pressure with Nifty PSU bank index hitting 52-week low of 2,917.

On the global front, Asian shares regained some ground on Tuesday after US President Donald Trump faced growing pressure from political allies to pull back from proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, easing investor worries about an imminent trade war.

Technical Outlook

Nifty has given a fresh breakdown from a consolidation phase of 10,300-10,630 levels. It opened higher but failed to hold gains and closed at 10,249.25 down 109.60 points. The Index has formed 'Bearish Belt Hold' candlestick pattern indicating downfall to continue in near term.

It is heading towards 10,127 levels which is the 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) which might work as immediate support zone.

Cement companies have increasingly turned toward waste heat recovery system (WHRS) to lower their operating cost after the 30 percent increase in petroleum coke (petcoke) and coal prices over the year squeezed their profit margins, reports Mint.

Power and fuel costs account for 25-30 percent of the total operating cost for the power guzzling industry.

The decision to look for alternative sources of energy was also triggered by the fact that the Supreme Court in November banned the use of petcoke in northern states to curb air pollution that was later relaxed and the increase in import duty for petcoke to 10 percent from 2.5 percent.

Waste heat recovery system is an energy recovery heat exchanger that recovers thermal energy from the exhaust gas and convert it into electrical energy.

Some of the big cement manufacturers have already been using WHRS as it is the cheapest source of power generation that helps in reducing the carbon footprint.

Binod Modi, analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd told the newspaper that the cost of power from WHRS comes at Rs 0.5-0.7/unit as compared to Rs 6-8/unit for grid power and Rs 3-4/unit for thermal power.

HeidelbergCement Ltd generates 20 percent of its total power requirement from WHRS helping it to significantly reduce its fuel cost per tonne in the third quarter.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech (UTCEM) reported Q3FY18 earnings below our expectation due to lower than expected realisations. Though it missed our realisations estimates, a big positive surprise on volume growth compensated to a significant extent. We believe that current quarter don’t reflect the steady run‐rate of realisations and hence, we keep our earnings estimates unchanged for FY18E/FY19E. Given the strong pipeline of capacity addition (11mn tonnes (t) in next two years), smooth merger of JPA plants and quality operations, UTCEM is best placed to exploit the recovery in demand.

Outlook

We maintain Accumulate with TP of Rs4,900, EV/EBITDA of 16x FY20E.

JM Financial's research report on UltraTech Cement

Ultratech reported revenue growth at 35% YoY primarily on volume growth aided by ramp up of JP assets. However realisations declined significantly QoQ (flat YoY) as southern/western region witnessed price correction. EBITDA/t declined by 15% YoY as cost escalation in absence of realisation improvement impacted margins. Management indicated a double digit growth in industry volumes with Ultratech gaining market share. In addition management guided for higher growth going forward as demand improves from infrastructure and affordable/rural housing segment. Company reduced the net debt by INR6.3bn vs 2QFY18 (net debt to EBITDA at 2.35x). Demand growth and supply additions are key monitorables to determine pricing power, in our view.

Outlook

We continue to value the company at 12x EVE to arrive at a TP of INR4,550 (Dec’18). Maintain BUY.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Ultratech Cement

Volumes rise as JPA operates at 60% utilization: 3QFY18 volume rose 35% YoY (+21% QoQ) to 15.85mt (est. of 14.02mt), as JPA’s average utilization for the quarter was 51%. However, realization fell 4% QoQ to INR4,789 (est. of INR5,132) due to weak pricing in south and west. Net sales stood at INR75.8b (+15% QoQ), exceeding our estimate of INR73.7b.

Outlook

While short-term profitability is impacted by JPA acquisition, we believe addition of ~31% of present capacity at virtually zero lead time is critical for a large-scale player like UTCEM to retain market share. Also, the expanded capacity would give it an edge when there is an upturn. We value UTCEM at FY20E EV/EBITDA of 14.5x. Our TP of INR5,131 implies 16% upsideFor all recommendations report, click here

Centrum's research report on Ultratech Cement

UltraTech’s (UTCEM) Q3FY18 standalone EBITDA rose 14% YoY buoyed by 35% YoY volume growth (core volume up 14% YoY) as UTCEM capitalised on strong demand from infrastructure and low cost housing and as it has been efficiently ramping up the JPA’s acquired assets. Aggressive volume push resulted in flattish NSR YoY. Improving energy consumption and logistics efficiencies partly moderated impact of rising energy cost YoY. Amid improving demand outlook, we expect UTCEM to deliver 15% volume CAGR during FY17-20E, largely led by capacity ramp-up of the acquired assets. We also expect UTCEM’s margins to benefit from economies of scale and its prudent cost controls. We reiterate BUY with a revised TP of Rs5,140.

Outlook

We continue to like UltraTech owing to its industry leadership, prudent cost structure, and steady capacity growth without straining its balance sheet. We roll forward our valuations to FY20, leading to revised TP of Rs5140 (15x FY20E EBIDTA).

""It will cater to the markets in western Rajasthan where UltraTech Cement does not have a significant presence,"" the company said.

With this expansion, UltraTech will have a foot print across the country with 50 plant locations, alongwith 103 ready mix concrete plants.

The board also approved a proposal for an increase in investment limits by foreign investors from existing limit of 30 percent to 40 percent of paid-up equity.

Kotak Securities' research report on Ultratech Cements

Ultratech Cement earnings were ahead of our estimates. Volumes are not comparable with last year due to amalgamation of cement assets of Jaiprakash Associates but volumes were in line with our estimates for the quarter. Blended realizations were better than our estimates which led to EBITDA improvement despite higher costs. Power and fuel cost and freight cost per tonne had moved up in line with higher pet coke and diesel prices.

Outlook

We arrive at a revised price target of Rs 4547 (Rs 4474 earlier) based on average of 17x EV/EBITDA and $200 per tonne EV/Tonne for FY19. Owing to adequate upside from current levels, we upgrade the stock to BUY from ACCUMULATE earlier. Key risk to our estimates would come from lower than expected demand revival, steep increase in costs or pressure on cement prices.

Net sales stood at INR 65713 mn as against our estimate of INR 65870 mn; up by 20.4% y-o-y and flattish on q-o-q basis. Cement sales volume was higher by 17.5% on y-o-y basis and remained flattish on q-o-q basis standing at 13.14 MT. EBIDTA stood at INR 13513 mn which was up by 17% y-o-y and down 13.4% q-o-q and EBIDTA margin stood at 20.6% as against 21.2% same quarter last year. EBITDA was 13% above our expectations (est. of 11970 mn) on account of higher realizations and lower than anticipated freight costs. PAT stood at INR 4312 mn which was down by 28.3% y-o-y and 51.6% q-o-q while PAT margin stood at 6.6%. Net profit stood 15% higher than estimates (est. of 3760 mn) owing to better than expected operational efficiencies.

Outlook

Currently, the key focus for Ultratech is to achieve cash break-even for JPA assets by Q1FY19E. The acquisition acts as a positive trigger for the company in the long term as it provides scalability and significant increase in capacity share for the company (capacity share in North and Central to increase from 13% to 49% post acquisition). With expected net debt of INR 106223 mn by FY19, the company trades at an EV/ton of $190 and EV/EBITDA of 14.17x. We believe the company will trade at premium valuations compared to its large cap peers on account of a.) significant market share(~20% post acquisition), b.) superior brand, and c.)higher operating efficiencies. We maintain our ACCUMULATE rating on the stock with a target price of INR 4605 (assigning EV/EBITDA of 16x on FY19E) which is an upside of 14.2% from CMP of INR 4034.For all recommendations report, click here

Centrum's report on Ultratech Cement

UltraTech’s (UTCEM) Q2FY18 standalone EBITDA rose 17% YoY buoyed by 18% YoY volume growth as good demand helped UTCEM ramp-up production from the recently acquired assets from Jaiprakash Associates (JPA). Improving energy consumption and logistics efficiencies helped moderate impact of rising energy cost YoY. Amid improving demand outlook, we expect UTCEM to deliver 15% volume CAGR during FY17-19E, largely led by capacity ramp-up of the acquired assets, as against 2% growth in FY17 (and 4% CAGR in its past five years). We also expect UTCEM’s margins to benefit from economies of scale and its prudent cost controls.

Outlook

In our view, strong volume growth outlook should boost valuation rerating. Thus, we upgrade to BUY with a revised TP of Rs4420 (15x FY19E EBITDA). In our view, UTCEM’s strong and industry leading volume outlook will accelerate the industry leader’s market share gain to 22% in FY19E vs 18% in FY17 (and 9% in FY07). This alongwith sustenance of its superior margin profile should drive valuation rerating. Thus, we increase our valuation multiple to 15x FY19E EBITDA (closer to its 5-year mean of 16x). Thus we raise our TP to Rs4420 (vs earlier TP of Rs3790 @ 13x FY19E EBITDA).For all recommendations report, click here

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement’s results were broadly in line with our estimates. While revenues, PAT were in line with our estimate, EBITDA remained above our estimate mainly due to lower than anticipated raw material Revenues increased 20.4% YoY to Rs 6,571.3 crore (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 6,691.9 crore) mainly led by 17.5% YoY increase in volumes to 13.1 MT (vs. I-direct estimate of 13.6 MT) and 2.4% YoY increase in realisation to Rs 5,001 (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 4,922) Despite one-time cost due to consolidation of Jaypee and increase in operating cost, the company was able to keep EBITDA/tonne over Rs 1,000/tonne (above I-direct estimate of Rs 874/tonne) The board has approved an investment of Rs 194 crore for putting up 0.4 MT of wall care putty capacity. The plant is expected to be commissioned during Q2FY20.

Outlook

The government’s focus on low cost housing and roads is expected to drive cement demand in the coming years. In addition, revival in the rural economy (accounts for 40% of total sales), slowdown in capacity addition and consolidation in the industry augurs well for UltraTech (a pan India player). This, coupled with acquisition of Jaypee and capacity expansion at Madhya Pradesh may result in revenue CAGR of 22.2% in FY17-19E. In addition, improving realisation and the company’s focus on cost rationalisation is expected to aid margins. Hence, we maintain our BUY rating with a target price of Rs 4,750/share (i.e. at 17.0x FY19E EV/EBITDA).For all recommendations report, click here

EBITDA for the quarter grew by 17% YoY with EBITDA/t at INR907/t vs. INR897/t in 2QFY17, grew marginally as stable realisation and cost controls offset the increase in power/fuel and freight costs.

Outlook

While the acquisition is earnings dilutive at present, we expect it to be EPS accretive by FY20 as operations ramp up on demand uptick. We continue to value the company at 12x EVE to arrive at a TP of Rs4,550 (Sep’18). Maintain BUY.For all recommendations report, click here

Motilal Oswal's research report on Ultratech Cement

Blended realization increased 4% YoY to INR 5,001/t due to healthy pricing in its focus markets. Grey cement realizations rose 7% YoY to INR 4,452/ton due to improved pricing across most markets. Power & fuel cost/t rose 14% YoY due to the impact of higher petcoke and coal prices. Freight cost increased 4% YoY due to a 7% YoY rise in diesel prices, partially offset by lead distance reduction.

Outlook

While in the short-term, the acquisition of JPA would be earnings-dilutive, we believe addition of 31% of present capacity at virtually zero lead time is critical for a large-scale player like UTCEM to retain market share. Expanded capacity would give it an edge, when there is an upturn. We value the stock at FY20E EV/EBITDA of 14x. Our TP of INR 4,906, implies 20% upside.

For Q2FY2018, UltraTech Cement (UltraTech) reported standalone revenue of Rs. 6,571 crore (up 20.4% y-o-y and down 0.8% q-o-q). Revenue grew, as inclusion of Jaypee cement assets from Q1FY2018 led to volume growth of 17.5% y-o-y to 13.1 million tonnes (mt) and blended realisation also increased by a 2.4% y-o-y. Operating profit margin (OPM) declined by 60 basis points (bps) y-o-y and 298 bps q-o-q to 20.6%, due to higher power and fuel cost per tonne (up 29.1% y-o-y and 10% q-o-q).

Currently, UltraTech is trading at a valuation of 17x FY2019E EV/EBITDA, which we believe largely factors in the uptick in sales volume from the recent acquisition, better demand outlook and current pricing discipline.

West and East India outpace other regions with 15% YoY and 6% YoY growth for Q2FY2018, respectively. North, Central and Southern India witness 2-2.5% YoY decline in average cement prices for the same period. Pan-India pricing discipline witnessed during Q2FY2018 is likely to benefit pan-India cement players such as Ultra Tech, ACC and Ambuja in a seasonally weak quarter. However, our channel check suggests continued muted demand environment for the cement sector only benefitting from government-led infrastructure investment.

Outlook

Ultra Tech is trading at a valuation of 17.2x FY2019E EV/EBITDA, which we believe largely factors in the uptick in sales volume from the recent acquisition, better demand outlook and current pricing discipline. We maintain our Hold rating on the stock with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs.4,500.

Ultratech Cement expects domestic cement demand to return to its ""normal level"" on government's push for infrastructure projects and uptick in rural housing, after weak volume growth in the past three to four years.

Besides, rapid urbanisation along with reduced home loan interest and strong demand from IT/ITES park in centres like Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad would also act as demand drivers for the cement industry, the Aditya Birla group firm said in an investor's presentation.

""Demand is likely to reach its normal level with improved focus on infrastructure, low-cost housing and uptick in rural housing,"" it said without specifying a definite time period.

According to industry body Cement Manufacturers' Association, the domestic sector added 50 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity in last three years.

However, the industry has witnessed a slow growth in the last few years. In FY2014-15, production was 270.93 MTPA up 5.6 per cent and 4.9 per cent with 283.45 MTPA in FY 2015-16.

""Cement volume growth has been weak in past 3-4 years, led by a slowdown in housing and commercial (segments),"" Ultratech Cement said in its presentation.

According to the company, rise in rural demand along with improvement in economy there on the back of two years of good monsoon and seventh pay commission hike would drive demand.

It further said government-led spending will continue to be a key growth driver on projects which include building another one lakh kilometre of concrete roads, Western and Eastern dedicated freight corridors and port development.

""Metro rail project coming up in various cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Lucknow, Kochi, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Nagpur, Kanpur, Hyderabad, Surat and Pune"" with plan of 1,000 kms track would also lead to pick-up in the demand.

Among various listed companies of the group, UltraTech Cement's valuation stood at Rs 1,10,097.70 crore at the end of Friday's trade while that of Grasim Industries was Rs 76,881.73 crore.

The Nifty50 which gave some early indication of reversal recouped much of losses and closed 0.51 percent higher for the week ended 4 August. With no major triggers lined up for the month of August, it will be difficult for the market to gain similar momentum which it saw last month.

Expectation of some bit of consolidation cannot be ruled out in the coming week and investors will be better off taking bets on individual stocks.

“The much awaited trigger of the policy is gone and index has already hit record highs with a massive velocity. Going ahead, if market has to extend this rally, it would look for some other cues may be on domestic or global front,” Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

“But, we continue to mention that the index now needs some kind of a breather to maintain the sturdy structure of its multi-year bull run. For the forthcoming week, we expect this consolidation to continue in a trading range of 200 – 300 points,” he said.

Commenting on the level, Chavan is of the view that 10,055 – 10,150 would be seen as immediate resistances; whereas, 9980 – 9944 would be the levels to watch out for on the downside.

The Nifty50 went through a corrective phase in the first week of August as traders continued to book profit at higher level.

After forming a bearish reversal trend on the daily chart for two trading session, Nifty saw a marginal uptrend on Friday to close above its psychological mark of 10,000 indicating a positive trajectory going forward.

On weekly chart, Nifty made a slightest bullish reversal trend. Further, the relative strength index (RSI) at 64 indicates a favourable buy price coupled with uptrend momentum depicted by MACD at 108 trading above its Signal Line.

“Regardless of trading on negative bias during past week, the Fridays uptrend suggest a positive trajectory if it manages to close above psychological level on daily basis before witnessing a next rally,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

Here is a list of top 10 money making ideas which can give up to 14% upside in the next 5-20 trading sessions:

Analyst: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking

Radico Khaitan: BUY| Target Rs159| Stop Loss Rs139| Return 9%| Time 6-8 sessions

Recently, this stock underwent a strong consolidation phase during which every attempt towards Rs138 – 140 was getting sold into. However, on Monday, we saw strong follow up buying interest post previous Friday’s sturdy closing; leading to a confirmation of ‘Inverse Head and Shoulder’ pattern on daily chart.

This price activity was accompanied by higher than average daily volumes, which certainly is an encouraging sign. In addition, some of the key moving averages along with the technical indicators are still maintaining their upward trajectory.

Hence, we advise traders to buy this stock at current levels and on declines at Rs.143 for a target of Rs.159 over the next 6- 8 sessions. The stop loss now should be fixed at Rs.139.

Havells India: BUY| Target Rs520| Stop Loss Rs465| Return 5%| Time 14-21 sessions

Since last couple of months, the stock has been consolidating in a range and has formed a ‘Symmetrical Triangle’ pattern on the daily chart. On Thursday, the stock prices finally managed to give a breakout from the pattern with decent volumes.

The ‘RSI’ oscillator too, after a consolidation phase, has resumed the positive momentum. The price breakout, supported by the volumes and positive momentum oscillator is indicating that the stock has resumed its larger degree uptrend.

Hence, we are expecting the stock to move higher in near term. Thus, we recommend buying this stock at current levels and on a correction up to Rs.486 for a target of Rs.520 over the next 14 – 21 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs.465.

Tata Motors DVR: SELL| Target Rs237| Stop Loss 267.55| Return 7%| Time 5-10 sessions

This stock has been a clear underperformer since September 2016 highs. During this period, our benchmark index rallied more than 20 percent and is trading around all-time highs; whereas, this stock kept descending towards its 52-week low.

This is a clear sign of weakness. On Thursday, we saw breakdown from a major near term support level of 258 on a closing basis. In addition, the ‘RSI-Smoothened’ has slipped below its recent lows, which we believe would provide an impetus for further correction.

Thus, we recommend selling this stock at current levels and on a bounce up to Rs.258 for a target of Rs.237 over the next 5 – 10 sessions. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs.267.55.

The rally from the recent low of Rs635 on high volumes on the back of decent result and double bottom kind of technical formation is signalling the end of the corrective swing which is in place from the highs of Rs767.

Hence, traders should make use of the current dips to create long positions for a target of Rs767 and a stop loss of Rs630.

Geojit Financial Services recommends the following stocks:

Federal Bank Ltd

Rating: BUY CMP: Rs115 TP: Rs134

Federal Bank Ltd (FB) is a mid-sized private commercial bank having a network of 1252 branches across India with a loan book size of ~Rs77,000cr.

FB maintained steady business growth in Q1FY18 with healthy 28 percent YoY & 18 percent YoY growth in Loan and deposits respectively. Loan growth outlook continues to remain robust supported by maturing retail network and strong traction in mid-size corporate and retail loans. Asset quality outlook has further improved due to reduction in large risk assets. Fresh slippages are expected to reduce in the coming quarters leading to lower provisions and we expect strong 32 percent CAGR in earnings over FY17-19E.

Ultratech Cement Ltd

Rating: BUY CMP: Rs4,090 TP: Rs4,514

UltraTech Cement Ltd. (Ultratech), part of the Aditya Birla Group, is the largest producer of grey & white cement and ready-mix concrete in India.

Ultratech has completed the acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates’ assets in Q1FY18 and overall capacity has increased by 21.2 MT to 93 MT. The focus now is to improve the operational efficiency and utilisation level of the acquired assets to 60 percent over the next one year and 70 percent by FY19. We expect the acquisition will be earnings dilutive in the short run, however the volumes are likely to grow at 19 percent CAGR over FY17-19E led by steady ramp up of Jaypee assets and pickup in demand from housing and infrastructure sectors.

RBL Bank Ltd

Rating: Accumulate CMP:Rs528 TP:Rs591

RBL Bank Ltd. has emerged as one of the fastest growing private sector banks with a network of 215 branches and 374 ATMs.

RBL Bank continue to maintain high growth momentum with 40 percent YoY growth in advances and 45 percent YoY growth in earnings during Q1FY18. Higher earnings growth, steady asset quality, improving business mix and above industry average loan growth will help the bank to sustain premium valuations over new generation private sector banks.

Geojit Research's research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement Ltd. (Ultratech), part of the Aditya Birla Group, is the largest producer of grey & white cement and ready-mix concrete in India. It has an overall installed grey cement capacity of 69.3 MTPA. Despite weak volumes, Ultratech posted ~7% YoY growth in its consolidated revenue in Q1FY18 led by higher realisation. EBITDA came in higher than expected up by ~11% YoY primarily on account of strong growth in realisation and improvement in operational efficiency. Although, we expect the pace of EBITDA margin expansion to remain moderate in FY18E owing to integration of Jaiprakash Associates’ cement assets, we factor a healthy 150bps YoY increase in margin in FY19E. We now factor in the impact of Jaiprakash Associates’ cement acquisition into our estimates. We expect volumes to grow at 19% CAGR over FY17-19E led by steady ramp up of Jaypee assets and pickup in demand from housing and infrastructure sectors. We recommend BUY rating on the stock with a revised TP of Rs. 4,514 (Rs. 4,320 earlier) based on 16x FY19E EV/EBITDA.

Outlook

We expect revenue/PAT to grow at a CAGR of 21%/18% over FY17-19E owing to steady ramp up in capacities. Further with strong capacities in place, we believe the company is in a position to benefit from any cyclical demand recovery. Hence, we recommend BUY with a revised TP of Rs. 4,514 (Rs. 4,320 earlier) based on 16x FY19E EV/EBITDA.

Outlook

However, demand is likely to dip now, given the strong onset of monsoon. Continuing issues with sand availability in some key states (UP, Punjab, Tamil Nadu) and drought will further weigh on demand.

Edelweiss' research report on UltraTech Cement

Calibrating the JPA assets for 9mFY18 and FY19, while our EBITDA estimates are revised up 7% and 19%, respectively, full blown impact of rise in depreciation & interest leads to 18% and 3% dip in PAT estimates, respectively. Maintaining our view that market leader UTCL will be prime beneficiary of our positive sector outlook, maintain ‘BUY’ with revised TP of INR4,862 (INR4,422 earlier).

Outlook

Incorporating the JPA acquisition in our financials, we value UTCL at 15x FY19E EV/EBITDA and maintain ‘BUY/SO’ with a revised TP of INR4,862.

KR Choksey's research report on UltraTech Cement

Total Sales stood at INR 75203 mn which was up by 6% Y-O-Y and 0.3% Q-O-Q as against our estimate of INR 77354 mn. Cement sales volume was flat on Y-O-Y basis and declined by 6.2% on Q-O-Q basis and stood at 13.19 MT.EBIDTA stood at INR 15601 mn which was up by 9.7% Y-O-Y and 22.1% Q-O-Q and EBIDTA margin stood at 20.7% as against 20% same quarter last year. EBITDA was marginally above our expectations on account of lower than anticipated raw material costs.PAT stood at INR 8906 mn which was up by 14.9% Y-O-Y and 29.4% Q-O-Q while PAT Margin stood at 11.8%. Net profit was primarily above our estimates due to lower than expected interest costs.

Outlook

We believe that acquisition of cement assets of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd will lead to dilution in margins for the company in the near term and we estimate EBITDA margins to fall by 139 bps Y-O-Y and PAT margins to dip by 400 bps Y-O-Y in FY18. However, the acquisition acts as a positive trigger for the company in the long term as it provides scalability and significant increase in capacity share for the company ( capacity share in North and Central to increase from 13% to 49% post acquisition). With expected net debt of INR 115795.1 mn by FY19, the company trades at an EV/ton of $198 and EV/EBITDA of 14.85x. We believe the company will trade at premium valuations compared to its large cap peers on account of a.) significant market share(~20% post acquisition), b.) superior brand, c.) healthy balance sheet and d.) higher operating efficiencies. We value Ultratech Cement Ltd at an EV/EBITDA of 16x and arrive at a target price of INR 4570 which is an upside of 8.5% from CMP of INR 4210 . We have an ACCUMULATE rating on the stock.For all recommendations report, click here

However, the volumes were disappointment as it has posted 1 percent lower than expected volumes at 13.2 million tonnes.

On a per ton basis, the company's EBITDA grew 10 percent Y-o-Y and 30 percent Q-o-Q to Rs 1182, which was supported by strong realization but partly offset by increased costs.

The reported PAT grew 15 percent Y-o-Y, to Rs 890 crore, which was ahead of reserach firm estimate, supported by higher other income and lower interest payment, apart from higher EBITDA.

Markets leader UltraTech Cement announced a Rs 2,600-crore new integrated cement plant in Madhya Pradesh with a capacity of 3.5 million tonne per annum, which will increase its capacity to 96.5 mt by FY19.

""The board has approved a greenfield integrated cement plant at Dhar in Madhya Pradesh with a capacity of 3.5 mt per annum. The plant will involve an investment of Rs 2,600 crore and is likely to being commercial production by the fourth quarter of FY19,"" UltraTech chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla told the 17th annual general meeting.

This will further enhance UltraTech's presence in Central India, he said, adding the company has also commissioned cement grinding units in Nagpur in Maharashtra and at Patliputra in Bihar during the year gone-by.

The acquisition of the cement business of Jaypee Group (Jaiprakash Associates and Jaypee Cement Corporation) and those in the overseas operations in the UAE will propel UltraTech's capacity to 96.5 mt, he said adding these greenfield expansions will improve this further.

Excluding the JP deal, its capacity now stands at 66.3 million tonne per annum.

""We also have an additional capex plan of about Rs 2,200 crore for the current fiscal, which will mainly be utilised for capacity de-bottlenecking projects, regulatory requirements, plant infrastructure and routine maintenance,"" Birla said.

He said after completion of Jaiprakash Associates and Jaypee Cement deals, the focus now will be on to optimise capacity utilisation and generate cash flows.

""The operations will be strengthened by process and technological upgradations, leading to enhanced capacity utilisation. Creating synergies in manufacturing, distribution and logistics offer many advantages. Furthermore, economies of scale and reduced lead-time to markets will be achieved,"" Birla said, adding he expects these units to turn around in the next three-four years.

The company has in-principal approval to rise Rs 9,000 crore debt but has no plans to raise equity, offer rights issue or splitting the share value as the company has a very strong balance sheet and robust cash flows, Birla said.

On the business outlook, he said government focus on infrastructure development, affordable housing and smart cities are expected to strengthen cement demand and reduce oversupply.",365,0.9994077285130819

Motilal Oswal's research report on Ultratech Cement

UTCEM’s clinker capacity addition over the next two years (FY17 -19) would be similar to the clinker capacity added over the last six years (FY11- 17). The JPA acquisition has significantly reduced lead time for asset creation and market share enhancement. FY19E EV/tonne adjusted for JPA’s assets and Dhar expansion appears moderated by over 20%, implying reduction in the ~50% premium over peers’ EV/tonne to 25 -30%. UTCEM has achieved strong cost efficiency parameters in power & fuel and freight cost for standalone operations. We believe the cost curve for JPA would also improve meaningfully post takeover by UTCEM.

Outlook

JPA’s acquisition is likely to result in PBT dilution of ~19% in FY18 and ~ 8% in FY19; we expect the acquired assets to break even in 1HFY20. While the earnings dilution is transitory, the asset creation is permanent and would add to UTCEM’s long -term competitive advantage. We reiterate Buy.For all recommendations report, click here

Motilal Oswal on Monday reiterated its buy stance on UltraTech Cement, with a target price that implies an upside of 17 percent at Rs 4,936.

The broking firm highlighted the enterprise value per tonne to be moderated, adjusting the acquisition of JP Associates’ assets and capacity expansion at its Dhar plant.

“As JP Associates’ assets are acquired at USD 120/tonne as against UltraTech’s EV/tonne of USD 245, blended EV/tonne appears meaningfully moderated at USD 195/tonne. This implies a reduction in the 50 percent premium over peers’ EV/tonne to 25-30 percent,” the brokerage house said in its report.

Further, it highlighted that its clinker capacity additions over the next two years are at a much faster pace.

The cement major could add a clinker capacity of 19 million tonnes over FY17-19, led by JP Associates’ acquisition and Dhar expansion, similar to the clinker capacity added over FY11- FY17. Thus, it would be recreating the assets it created over the last six years in just two years, it explained in its report.

Moreover, the last two limestone bids indicate a sharp increase in the cost of acquisition of limestone. “Players acquiring new capacities would be at a cost disadvantage to players with legacy assets. Companies like UltraTech Cement that hold large limestone reserves are likely to get premium multiples on account of the significant competitive edge they possess,” it added.

Motilal Oswal also said that the company’s cost measures has reflected in their curtailment in the last few quarters. This in an environment where underlying fuel prices have almost doubled.

“Improved power consumption norm, higher proportion of alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR), greater reliance on waste heat recovery systems (WHRS), and higher sales from split grinding units have helped contain its unitary costing,” the report added.

In terms of earnings, the acquisition of JP Associates’ assets could dilute the profit before taxes (PBT) over the next current and next fiscal. The breakeven is seen from the first half of FY20, it added.

The stock has gained around 4 percent in the past one month, while its three-day gain stood at just over a percent. At 11:56 hrs UltraTech Cement was quoting at Rs 4,231.35, up Rs 12.95, or 0.31 percent on the BSE.

Timing is most crucial element in investing or trading. This timing can be known through financial astrology. Astrology is only science which can predict future correctly & guide us about sectors which have to outperform.

Every year with commencement of new Samvat (Hindu New Year), astrologically, based on planetary position, certain new sectors start getting strong astrological support & start outperforming, while some others sectors which were performing earlier start underperforming. Some sectors/stocks remain laggards. Stocks of astrological supported sectors outperform resulting in exorbitant gains irrespective of market behaviour, either bull market or bear market.

Predicting bullish sectors of next Samvat 2074

Every year we release sectors of new Samvat in the month of March/April when new Samvat starts. But this year, we shall prepone release of next Samvat sectors, which are going to get strong astrological support & stocks from those sector outperform markets. Purpose of releasing sectors of next Samvat earlier is that investors & traders should get maximum advantage of down trend of markets by good timing.

We firmly believe that these special astrological positions present very unique opportunities to investors and traders both. This opportunity, if utilised properly, can safeguard your existing portfolio and simultaneously optimise your future investments and trading also. Successful investing and trading is all about good timing only.

Needless to mention our innumerable past predictions, where most stocks from the SECTORS of SAMVAT gave exorbitant returns & certain stocks appreciated by over 500 percent.

During current Samavat 2073 among other sectors – dyes/chemical/sugar sector received strong astrological support & outperformed and gave exorbitant return. Many stocks from dyes/ chemical sector appreciated by over 500 percent.

Sectors which get very strong astrological support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

Edelweiss' report on Ultratech Cement

UltraTech’s (UTCL) Q4FY17 numbers sprung a positive surprise, especially on volumes. Management is cautiously optimistic on the affordable house segment and believes it entails significant potential to drive the nascent demand recovery well into the medium term. While the cost pressure challenge persists, the company is reasonably confident that the market can absorb any industry-wide cost push.

Outlook

Overall, at current valuations, though near-term upside appears capped, in the medium term the operating leverage could be significant. Maintain ‘BUY’ with target price of INR 4,422/share.

ICICI Direct's report on UltraTech Cement

Over FY08-17, utilisation in the cement sector witnessed a decline from 83% in FY08 to 64% in FY17 mainly due to capacity addition (incremental supply of 223 MT) outpacing demand (incremental demand of 105 MT). As a result, industry capacity doubled from 198 MT in FY08 to 421 MT in FY17 vs. demand, which increased from 164 MT in FY08 to 269 MT in FY17.

Outlook

With industry-leading growth, higher margins and a healthy balance sheet, we maintain our BUY rating with a target price of Rs 4,750/share (i.e. at 19.5x FY19E EV/EBITDA).

Reliance Industries

Citi maintained its buy call on the stock with an increase in its bull case target to Rs 1,923 due to higher Jio valuation and lower peak net debt. It believes that the company’s outperformance could sustain as the earnings are an at an inflection point. Among key risks to the stock are weakening in refining fundamentals and global petrochemical spreads, the research firm added.

Analysts at the firm termed the company’s March quarter performance as strong, with the standalone EBITDA being 3 percent ahead of estimates. Meanwhile, the profit after tax (PAT) was largely in line, it said. Gross refining margins of USD 11.5 per barrel

were above its estimates, it said.

On the company’s capex plans, it sees standalone capex being lesser than USD 2.5 billion in FY18. Jio’s capex in the first quarter of the fiscal will be similar to March quarter before declining sharply, it said.

Nomura maintained its buy call on the stock as well, but with an unchanged target price of Rs 1,540. The brokerage house observed that the net profit was 1-2 percent ahead of its estimates, driven by lower tax rate. It too feels that the recent outperformance of the company could sustain.

However, the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and profit before tax (PBT) were below its estimates on the back of higher depreciation and lower other income. These numbers too were partly offset by lower finance costs, it added.

Going forward, it sees earnings growing ahead once Jio, petchem and refining expansion projects start to deliver. It expects consolidated EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 19 percent/15 percent, respectively over FY16-20.

Meanwhile, it observed that high capex on Jio continued during the quarter and expects similar capex in Q1 of this fiscal. The near term focus will be on addition in customers of Jio. Having said that, it feels that the large capex cycle is coming to an end.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded the stock to neutral, but increased the target price to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,375. The global brokerage firm observed that the firm’s March quarter net profit was 9 percent above estimates, while refining beat was led by GRM.

Analysts at the firm now have the focus on Jio’s success and the capex cycle. They believe that a further rerating on the stock is contingent on a successful Jio P&L as well as falling capex. It further added that while capex could decline, there is limited visibility on a successful Jio P&L.

The stock could find support from growth in Jio’s monthly subscribers, while weak margin, project startup hiccups and high capex were the key risks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has an overweight rating on the stock as it saw upside risks from improving energy margins as well as project executions. A steady project pipeline commissioning from FY18 should reduce the risk of further capex, it added.

JPMorgan is neutral on Reliance with an increased target price of Rs 1,310 from Rs 1,240. While the lower capex in its core business was positive, Jio was the key unknown element, it said. Further extension of discounts by Jio would be negative, it added.

Rolling forward its valuation to FY19, Deutsche Bank raised its target by 10 percent to Rs 1,600. Lower downstream margins, policy vagaries were the key downside risks for stock, it said.

(Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.)

Indiabulls Housing Finance

CLSA retained its buy call on Indiabulls Housing Finance with an increase in target price to Rs 1,170 from Rs 950. The brokerage firm also raised its earnings estimates by 3 percent and saw 23 percent profit CAGR over FY17-20. It observed that the earnings growth was led by topline growth and operating efficiencies. CLSA also saw growth to be led by housing loans, especially from the affordable segment in the next three years.

Mahindra and Mahindra

Credit Suisse upgraded Mahindra and Mahindra to outperform from neutral and increased the target price to Rs 1,500 from Rs 1,390, implying 20 percent potential upside. While tractor volumes were up 14 percent in March despite demonetisation, there was a potential for tractor business to surprise positively, it added.

The weakness in utility vehicle market was already factored in, it observed. The stock was currently trading at a 40 percent discount to Maruti Suzuki, which it expects to narrow.

UltraTech Cement

CLSA raised the target price of the stock to Rs 4,575 from Rs 4,000. The company’s March quarter performance was in line with its estimates, it stated. A pan-India presence, growth focus and cost optimization were the key focusses, CLSA said. UltraTech was the only preferred stock in the sector, it added.

Deutsche Bank reiterated its buy call on the stock with an increase in target price to Rs 4,750 from Rs 4,560. It highlighted the company’s gain in market share during a challenging environment in the cement space. Moreover, it expects continuing reduction in costs and working capital for the company.

While markets await the Q4 earnings announcement from Reliance Industries and Ultratech Cement, it is worth taking a look at some of the lesser known names whose numbers captured our attention over the weekend.

Coming on the back of a very substantial rally, the Rs 125 crore market cap Amal reported good numbers. The company was promoted by Piramal Group in 1974-75 while the controlling interest was sold to Atul of Lalbhai Group in 1985-86.

Amal is engaged in manufacturing and marketing bulk chemicals such as Sulphuric Acid and Oleum and their downstream products such as Sulphur Dioxide and Sulphur Trioxide. The valuation doesn’t lend comfort although a correction could make it look interesting.

Fag Bearing -- the 51 percent subsidiary of Germany-based Schaeffler Group -- also reported decent earnings on the back of margin improvement. The Indian subsidiary is the second-largest player in the bearings market with 15 percent market share. It is well-diversified across segments and is the market leader in the passenger vehicle segment. The industry is at an inflection point, and for risk-averse investors a stock like Fag offers mid teen earnings growth story.

International Travel House, an associate company of ITC Limited and which offers a full bouquet of travel services, also reported a performance worth taking note of. Despite a modest topline growth, significant improvement in operating margin aided a significant surge in profit.

The run-up in the past one year has been modest and the valuation looks reasonable seen in the context of the financial performance ofThe Tinplate Company of India (TCIL), a subsidiary of Tata Steel. The company is a producer of tin coated and tin free sheets. It manufactures various grades of electrolytic tinplates, tin-free steel sheets and full hard cold rolled sheets (FHCR) used for metal packaging.

By far the largest application of tinplate is in packaging. Tinplate is primarily used for packaging foodstuffs and beverages, but it is also used in containers for oils, grease, paints, powdered, polishes, waxes, chemicals and many other products. Aerosol containers and caps and closures are also made from tinplate. The improved performance beckons attention.",364,0.9999875128269196

Nifty has taken two years to cross the 9000 level but this 360-degree recovery seems to riding on the hope of strong fundamentals going ahead. Major decisions including GST rollout and demonetisation taken by the Central government since it came in power in 2014 are likely to take centre-stage in the investment discourse on India over the next 2-3 years. But earnings will be a significant driver for further upside in markets, finds a Motilal Oswal report.

""Demonetisation and progress on GST have been the two most significant macro developments. Together, these two reforms have the potential to alter the investment landscape for several sectors. The obvious consequence of these two reforms is a greater formalisation of the economy and value migration from the unorganised to the organised segment,"" it reasons.

After a sharp 15 percent rally in three months, the market seems to have largely shrugged the impact of demonetisation and valuations already have become stretched. This rally was largely backed by conducive macro factors – inflation under control, twin deficits within tolerance limits, government sticking to the fiscal consolidation path, and stable currency among others.

The brokerage house says valuations for the Nifty based on both one-year forward earnings and on trailing earnings are rich but at similar levels to March 2015.

Motilal Oswal says Goods & Services Tax (GST) is on track for implementation from July 1, 2017. The BJP's strong showing in the recent UP elections (won 4/5th majority) should provide tailwinds for further reforms. The political calendar is light, as the next major assembly elections are due only in January 2018 (Gujarat). But earnings recovery is the only missing link, according to the research house.

It expects around 23 percent earnings growth in FY18 but delivery of the projected earnings growth is crucial for valuations to sustain and expand.

While FY18 would benefit from a low base in the second half of FY17 (demonetisation impact), there are two important near-term earnings headwinds to watch for - one is inflation in commodity prices, which could erode margins for B2C sectors like autos, consumer and cement, and second is the implementation of GST, which could impact earnings for a quarter or two (inventory adjustment in trade, initial implementation hurdles), the brokerage house says.

A Look Back at the Past

Over March 2015 – March 2017, institutional flows were dominated by DIIs. While inflows from DIIs were USD 15.9 billion, inflows from FIIs were relatively muted at USD billion. The shift in institutional flows in favour of DIIs are reflected in the sharper outperformance of midcaps and small caps. The Nifty CNX Midcap index has delivered 22 percent return over this timeframe, outperforming the Nifty by 21 percent. Also, over the last two years, the foreign ownership of Nifty stocks has reduced by 140bp whereas the ownership of DIIs and other domestic investors has increased by 190bp, the brokerage house says.

FIIs have increased their stake by 550-1,050bp in Eicher Motors, Adani Ports and BPCL, but have reduced their stake in Grasim, ICICI Bank and Ambuja Cement. DIIs have increased their holdings by 600-800bp in Kotak Mahindra Bank, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank and Cipla, but have reduced their holdings by 200-500bp in BPCL, Maruti and Eicher Motors.

Following are top investment ideas from Motilal Oswal:

Indian Oil Corporation

PSU oil retailer IOC shot up 117 percent in two years period and nearly 14 percent in 2017 amid lower crude oil prices and deregulation of petrol & diesel prices.

Britannia Industries

Bakery products manufacturer showed consistent performance in its earnings. During March 2015 to September 2016, its profit grew by 212 percent on half yearly basis.

Motilal Oswal in its report dated March 7 said Britannia's FY16 annual report highlighted a healthy operating performance, with revenue growing 10 percent YoY to Rs 8,680 crore and EBITDA margin expanding 310bp YoY to 14.1 percent led by benign commodity prices and premiumisation. Operating cash flow increased to Rs 960 crore (FY15: Rs 580 crore), supported by Rs 150 crore reduction (FY15: Rs 160 crore increase) in bank deposits; adjusted for this, operating cash flow was Rs 820 crore (FY15: Rs 740 crore).

The stock gained 57 percent in last two years and 17 percent in 2017.

Hindalco Industries

Aluminium major Hindalco Industries climbed 25 percent in two years and nearly 24 percent in 2017, backed by rally in commodity prices and hopes of revival in earnings.

ITC

Cigarette-hotel-to-FMCG major ITC saw a rally of more than 17 percent in current calendar year after lower-than-expected excise duty hike on cigarettes and improvement in earnings. Analysts expect no change in total tax incidence on tobacco post GST implementation.

JK Cement

Incorporated in 1975, JK Cement, the second largest white cement manufacturer, gained nearly 25 percent in 2017 on hopes of revival in infrastructure sector.

The brokerage house in its report dated March 27, said company's FY16 annual report highlighted an improvement in the operating performance, with consolidated EBITDA rising 21 percent to Rs 550 crore (FY15: Rs 450 crore) due to stabilisation at UAE operations and cost-control measures. However, consolidated PAT declined 57 percent, with the margin contracting to a five-year low of 1.6 percent due to higher finance and depreciation charges.

UltraTech Cement

In its report dated March 24, Motilal Oswal said it believes the company's increasing presence in a market dominated by tier-II players would improve the business dynamics in the region. With the completion of Jaiprakash Associates' acquisition by UltraTech in Q1FY18, the brokerage house expects the company to ramp up the utilisation of these assets to 60 percent over the next 6-9 months. The stock gained 23 percent in FY17.

Colgate Palmolive

After meeting the management of Colgate, the brokerage house enthused about its longer-term business prospects, said the company has weathered the storm from herbal players like Patanjali, with minimal damage to its market share in the last three quarters. It believes the sharp dip towards the end of FY16 was only a small blip in what has been a longer-term uptrend in market share.

Given its rural dominance, Colgate is a great play on rural recovery, it feels. It said valuations are lower than the average 3-year and 5-year multiples.

Colgate has best-of-breed return on equity, strong earnings growth prospects, and best-in-class dividend yield, which is likely to rise rapidly now that a major part of the capex is over, said the brokerage house while maintaining buy on the stock in its recent research report (March 20).

The stock gained more than 9 percent in 2017.

Bharti Airtel

The country's largest telecom operator stock price rallied 13 percent in 2017 but fell nearly 2 percent in two years due to pricing competition.

State Bank of India

The stock fell 2 percent in two years but gained 15 percent on hopes of early resolution to non-performing assets and ahead of merger of associate banks with itself.

Larsen & Toubro

After meeting with management, Motilal Oswal, on March 6, said company's base orders in infrastructure (which includes water, T&D and transport infrastructure) would drive order inflow in Q4FY17 and domestic execution pick-up is likely in FY18.

It further said the company is exposed to several levers across its business/geographical segments. It has emerged as the engineering & construction partner of choice in India, which provides it with a robust platform to capitalise on the next leg of investment cycle. It maintained a buy call with an SOTP-based price target of Rs 1,660.

The stock gained 15 percent in FY17 on hopes of revival in earnings in FY18 after sluggish growth.

Tata Motors

The stock fell 0.5 percent in current calendar year (2017) and lost 17 percent in two years because of subdued earnings performance of Jaguar Land Rover. However, analysts still confident of revival in earnings performance due to likely new launches from JLR going ahead.

The brokerage house in its report dated February 3, said Tata Motors was one of its top picks in auto space, with a target price of Rs 775 after company's new strategy for the passenger vehicle business and sub-brand/vertical TAMO.

""We see these initiatives as step in right direction and infuse more energy in TTMT’s PV business by giving autonomy and ring-fencing TAMO vertical to focus on innovation. This could long way in transforming PV business through agility, adaptability and making business leaner and meaner,"" it said.

Tata Motors, on Wednesday, has launched the Tigor – a subcompact, sub-4 meter sedan with style-back design – in India.

Motilal Oswal believes the Tigor should do well, given that the company has come up with an aggressive pricing strategy. ""TTMT is well on its course with its strategy to cater to every segment of passenger vehicles with its new offerings. The next in line is the much-awaited compact SUV Nexon.""

ICICI Bank

Country's largest private sector lender stock price lost 19 percent in two years but gained 10 percent on likely strong earnings in FY18 post NPA concerns.

Jindal Steel

In its report dated March 10, Motilal Oswal said after visiting Angul steel plant, company appeared to be on track to more than double its steel capacity at Angul to 5 million tonnes (from current around 2 million tonnes) in two years by adding capacity through a more efficient hot metal production route (currently DRI).

With this, steel sales volumes will increase from around 3.3 million tonnes in FY17 to 5.8 million tonnes by FY19, implying a CAGR of 31 percent, the brokerage house said. It expects consolidated EBITDA CAGR FY17-19 of 32 percent to Rs 7,800 crore. Although adjusted PAT would remain negative due to bloated depreciation on massive asset revaluation, there will be a sharp turnaround in cash profits, it says while retaining buy call on the stock.

The stock price shot up 71 percent in current calendar year (2017) on rally in commodity prices and production capacity expansion.

RBL Bank

Maharashtra-based RBL Bank (erstwhile Ratnakar Bank) share price surged 45 percent on strong financials and fundamentals. Asset quality also improved in October-December quarter. The bank raised Rs 1,100 crore through its IPO in August 2016.

Crompton Greaves Consumer Electrical

Home appliances and LED bulbs maker was demerged from Crompton Greaves and later on acquired by private equity firms Temasek & Advent International in 2016. The stock gained 42 percent in 2017.

Bharti Airtel

CLSA has downgraded Bharti Airtel to underperform from buy and also revised target downward to Rs 380 from Rs 393 (implying 4 percent upside) after lowering FY18-19 revenue by over 10 percent & EBITDA by 17-19 percent.

CLSA says there is a high risk of ARPU dilution but consolidation in industry is a positive.

Reduction in dual SIMs and sector consolidation may give upside to estimates, it feels. CLSA says company leads with 33 percent revenue market share. ""We see further gains led by spectrum and execution edge,"" the brokerage house says.

Sun Pharma

CLSA says Mohali plant clearance is a significant for the company and indicates progress on regulatory issues.

It says now resolution of Halol facility would be the next major regulatory trigger.

""We currently build in resolution of the Halol plant by Q3FY18. Early resolution of the Halol plant has earnings upgrade potential for company,"" the brokerage house says.

Other units having consent decree from US FDA are Toansa, Dewas, Paonta Sahib.

CLSA has a buy call on the stock, with a target price at Rs 790.

Morgan Stanley also says Mohali clearance is a relief for the company but retained equal-weight rating on bigger challenges.

The brokerage house does not expect material EPS impact from Mohali over next few quarters, it feels. The company has near-term growth challenges due to Taro & gGleevec concentration, Morgan says.

According to the research firm, specialty portfolio may take a while to ramp up in the US and valuations appear full for the time being.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch also says Mohali resolution is sentimentally positive and this resolution is in-line with earlier expectations.

Better synergy benefits now are likely on account of Ranbaxy merger and it may be used for site transfers for important products, it adds.

The brokerage house has maintained buy rating on Sun Pharma with a target price at Rs 750.

While reiterating buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 872, Deutsche Bank says after clearance to Mohali unit, all eyes are on Halol plant resolution.

Delay in resolving warning letter at Halol Plant is a key risk, it feels.

Macquarie expects approvals to start coming through from Mohali. The stock is preferred pick among the large cap names and the company is best positioned for specialty transition, it says.

The research firm has maintained outperform rating on Sun Pharma with a target price of Rs 850.

IndusInd Bank

Jefferies says the bank is acquiring ILFS Securities Services with a view of capturing equity cap market supply-chain. Benefits for the company includes fee income & possibly better deployment of free-float.

Deal could be marginally positive for the stock and seems to have happened at a fair premium to the book value, it feels.

Morgan Stanley says capital impact on bank from ILFS Securities Services' acquisition will depend on the transaction's structure.

If ISSL remains arm, then bank's parent Tier I will be affected to extent of price paid, it feels.

Morgan says according to management, ISSL acquisition is broadly in-line with the bank's strategy. It will possible for ILFS to offer IndusInd’s banking products to its clients, the brokerage house feels.

Biocon

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a buy call on Biocon, with increased target price at Rs 1,170 on rising visibility over Tratsuzumab launch.

The company may launch first biosimilar for Herceptin post settlement with Roche. First nod for Tratsuzumab will aid price erosion and better settlement with innovators, it says.

BoAML says settlement by innovators indicates superior quality of biosimilar filings. Triggers for re-rating of the stock include Glargine, Humira and GCSF filings in next few quarters.

Morgan Stanley is overweight on Biocon with a target price at Rs 1,264 as Mylan settlement with Genentech & Roche is a positive with respect to Trastuzumab and eliminates legal hurdles & provides certainty of launch.

The brokerage house expects US launch for Trastuzumab to be around mid-2019 and expects EU launch to be around mid-2018 for Trastuzumab.

Citi also says Roche settlement is positive for Trastuzumab launch. Hence, the brokerage house raised target price on the stock to Rs 1,315 from Rs 1,180. It has a buy call on the stock.

Citi raised net present value for Trastuzumab in its target to Rs 195 and raised value for Trastuzumab’s base to Rs 800 per share as it rolled over to 20x June 2018.

NMDC

Macquarie has resumed its coverage on NMDC with an underperform rating and set a target price at Rs 110 as it feels the company should see 23 percent YoY sales volume in FY17.

Coal India

Credit Suisse has maintained outperform rating on Coal India and slashed target price to Rs 373 from Rs 395. Normalisation of thermal power generation growth is a key catalyst, it says.

Credit Suisse estimates free cash flow per share in FY18-19 to be in the range of Rs 17-19.

Reliance Industries

Morgan Stanley is overweight on Reliance Industries with a target price at Rs 1,506.

""While investor debate on telecom earnings and energy project execution may continue near term, we believe delivery of energy earnings will provide the next leg of stock performance, as it should boost earnings expectations and lift returns. Telecom's drag on returns may reduce at the margin but is unlikely to halt overall growth in returns, as energy investments deliver on earnings growth steadily until FY20,"" it says.

(Disclosure: Reliance Industries, the parent company of Reliance Jio, owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com)

Cement

CLSA feels demonetisation continues to haunt cement industry as demand is under pressure in many markets and liquidity is still an issue that is hampering cement consumption.

Dealers are hopeful of pick-up ahead as government-led infra projects kick off.

Pricing is showing mixed trends. North India is back at pre-demonetisation levels while west Indian markets are also seeing stabilisation, wherein prices are up 7-13 percent. East India continues to suffer from demand-supply imbalance.

CLSA remains negative on the sector as it believes 2017 will be a lacklustre year for the sector. It has negative ratings on all cement company except UltraTech Cement that is its only preferred name in the sector.",1040,0.4669453998406728

Cement companies have raised product prices in the north market by Rs 10-15 per 50 kg bag while reducing them by Rs 5-Rs 10 in south, according to dealers. This is the second consecutive price hike in the north after cement companies raised the prices by as much in February. Analysts and trade sources blamed the rise in input costs for the price hikes even as demand remains subdued.A top official with a large player in the south told Moneycontrol prices had moved down in Tamil Nadu and Kerala markets due to a weak market.A cement bag in Delhi now costs anywhere between Rs 290 and Rs 320. A bag in the southern states is now being sold for Rs 390-Rs 400.While the hikes could not be ascertained from individual companies, dealers said as per the trade practice, the hike had been carried out by all companies. This includes UltraTech Cement Shree Cement and Birla Corporation .Coal, pet coke and freight are the main costs for cement companies, all of which are selling at rates higher from last year.“The hike has been around Rs 10-Rs 15 in Delhi and Rajasthan markets. They could not have taken the price hike after March 15 as March is financial year-end and year-end targets have to be achieved,” a cement analyst with a domestic brokerage told Moneycontrol.An investment banker tracking the cement sector had a different take. He said cement price hikes were normally taken in December and January but due to demonetisation, it could not happen this time.“Costs have risen but cement companies could not undertake a price hike in December and January as business was badly hit due to demonetisation. Cement companies don’t hike prices in March so as not to hurt year-end targets as price hikes immediately hurt volumes. So that pressure on costs is being passed on now,” the banker said.A cement dealer in Delhi said offtake remained slow as the impact of demonetisation was still being felt in the realty and construction sectors, the main consumers of the binding material.",351,-0.9653593897819519

Jaiprakash Associates today said it has got the approval of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for transfer of its cement plants to the Aditya Birla group firm, UltraTech Cement.

""NCLT Allahabad bench has sanctioned the scheme of arrangement whereby the company proposes to transfer identified cement plants owned by the company and its wholly owned subsidiary M/S Jaypee Cement Corporation to M/S UltraTech Cement on slump exchange basis,"" the company said in a BSE filing.

JP Associates had last year announced the sale of its cement business to the Kumar Mangalam Birla-led Ultratech for around Rs 16,000 crore, marking the biggest consolidation in the cement sector.

The deal will help the Jaypee Group firm to reduce debt, which runs into thousands of crores of rupees. The deal was subject to various regulatory approvals.

The group's cement operations have a total capacity of 17.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) spread across Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Andhra Pradesh.",170,

Lupin

With assigning underperform rating on Lupin and target price of Rs 1,350, Credit Suisse says surprising approval of generic Suprep Bowel Prep Kit could add 5 percent to its FY18 EPS. It could record revenue of USD 40 million for Lupin and competition will be high post exclusivity, it feels.

Lupin has received approval for Suprep Bowel Prep Kit and is eligible for six months sole exclusivity. It has lost the case at the district court and patent expiry for Suprep is later in 2023. Lupin settled on the product in Aug-2016 but the settlement terms were not known, Credit Suisse says.

Nomura also says it may see USD 40 million in revenue during the exclusivity period from this drug. Settlement allows company to launch gSuprep in FY18 with 180-day exclusivity.

With maintaining neutral rating on the stock and target price of Rs 1,626, Nomura says it projects earnings CAGR of 12 percent over FY17-19 despite a large base.

Morgan Stanley has maintained overweight rating on Lupin, with a price target of Rs 1,846.

Tata Motors

CIMB has a reduce call on Tata Motors and lowered target price to Rs 339 from Rs 352.

After Q3 JLR EBITDA margin collapsed due to poor product mix, high ASP discounts, the brokerage house cut its FY17-19 consolidated EPS forecasts by 17-50 percent.

Profitability due to success of new Land Rover product is a key upside risk, it says.

Cement sector

CLSA says cement sector in FY17 is likely to report a YoY decline, the first in 15 years. The brokerage house turned cautious due to concerns on volumes & margins.

UltraTech Cement is its relative pick in the sector.

Goldman Sachs forecasts flat cement demand growth for FY17 and sees 8-9 percent demand decline for March quarter.

It also remained cautious on near-term cement demand. It believes demand will continue to be affected in near-term due to note ban.

Cement demand remained weak in January, registering 13 percent decline. Prices are better but sustainability of price increase remained under pressure.

DB India's top picks

Deutsche Bank says there is no visible evidence suggesting a risk of earnings downgrades.

Liquidity driven expansion in valuations may not sustain, it feels. Deutsche remained excited about the roll-out of the GST in July.

Its largecap picks are Aurobindo Pharma, BPCL, Maruti Suzuki, NTPC, SBI, Shree Cement, Tata Motors, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Vedanta India.

Midcap picks are CESC, M&M Financial, Petronet LNG, Ramco Cements, Shriram Transport and UPL, it says.",425,-0.1787198503812154

The much-awaited announcement on the mega-merger of telecom majors Vodafone and Idea Cellular might come in the first week of March, alongside voting notices that the Kumar Mangalam Birla group plans to send out to the shareholders of Grasim Industries and Aditya Birla Nuvo on their proposed merger, reports Business Standard.

The reasoning behind initiating the activities together is that it might help mitigate concerns of Grasim shareholders over Nuvo’s exposure to Idea, which has been witnessing falling returns on capital employed amid severe competitive pressures from new player Reliance Jio.

Aditya Birla Nuvo is the promoter shareholder of Idea with 23.25 percent stake, while Grasim is one of the co-promoters with 4.75 percent stake. At current market prices, Grasim’s stake in Idea amounts to roughly Rs 2,000 crore.

At present, relatively newer businesses of the Kumar Mangalam Birla group mostly in the financial services and telecom space are under Nuvo. Grasim has the more mature businesses like cement through UltraTech Cement. Grasim also owns small stakes in other group companies like Hindalco, Aditya Birla Nuvo and Aditya Birla Fashion.

Meanwhile, P5 Asia Investments (Mauritius), an arm of the private equity firm Providence Equity Partners, also sold its 3.3 percent stake in Idea via a block deal on Tuesday. The PE firm had picked up 15 percent in 2006 for around Rs 1,800 crore and has been paring its holding continuously over the years. Citi is believed to be the sole book runner for this deal.",256,-0.6116982102394104

Jaiprakash Associates today reported widening of standalone net loss to Rs 1,095.02 crore for the third quarter ended December of 2016-17.

The company's net loss in corresponding period of last fiscal was at Rs 827.26 crore.

""Total income has decreased to Rs 1,648.87 crore during the quarter as against Rs 2,121.59 crore for same period year ago,"" JP Associates said in a regulatory filing.

The dismal performance of the company is mainly because of losses from cement, construction, sports events and real estate businesses.

Its Board of Directors during the quarter under review approved scheme of arrangement between the company and UltraTech Cement for sale of part of its cement business, including that of its 100 percent subsidiary Jaypee Cement Corporation.

Besides, the company said the Board at the meeting held today authorised the Finance Committee to ""consider and approve the realignment of remaining debt of the company subject to consents and approvals required including that from shareholders and lenders of the company.

The company has been reeling under substantial financial stress and has defaulted on loans and other payments running over multi-crore rupees, besides overdue interest on loans.

Sale of its cement business to Kumarmangalam owned Birla Group is touted as the biggest deals for the sector in the country and it is expected to fetch the JP group Rs 15,900 crore.

Besides, the power business was sold off to JSW Energy in early 2016 for Rs 3,500 crore.

Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol ResearchIn the past one month, the stock price of little-known Andhra Cements ran up close to 70 percent, even beating its larger peers by a margin. The rally could most likely have been sparked by market buzz that the Jaypee Group-promoted cement player has been put on the block. A look at Andhra Cements’ books reveals how many of its ills, also plaguing its promoter, could possibly make it a fit target for a takeover. It has a very high debt-to-equity ratio of 11.6X and has a modest capacity of 2.6 million tonnes. Given the state of its balance sheet, organic growth looks difficult and a smarter option will be to find a buyer.A larger question to ask then is how smaller companies in the cement space are surviving against all odds?The Indian cement market is split down the middle into two groups -- acquirer and the acquiree. The latter usually comprises companies with smaller capacities (usually with less than 5 million tonnes) and highly leveraged balance sheets which puts paid to any plans they might have to gain market share through expansion. Smart investors appear to have taken a fancy to this group, waiting for deals to get announced as most of these assets are still quoting at a discount to the replacement cost. Also, they are much cheaper than setting up a capacity from scratch.Last month, smaller cement companies punched above their weight with the likes of Burnpur Cement, Deccan Cements, Kakatiya Cement, KCP, NCL, Prism and Sagar Cement outperformed their bigger rivals. Such resilience was surprising given how demonetisation had done its damage and capacity utilisation of these companies showed no signs of improvement (close to 67 percent). Besides, cost pressures, which were on the rise, added to their woes.So, what explains the strength? The answer lies in the willingness of these players to consolidate, maintain volumes and stick to a pricing discipline. They have come to view acquisitions as a way of life in order to step up their game and healthy balance sheets stand to support this view. Access to ready resources and reduced time to the market are some of the benefits for the acquirers.It is no wonder that in the last two years there have been a raft of deals involving big acquirers like UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement, Orient Cement and JSW Cement. With capacity addition diminishing over the coming years, the industry will stand to benefit from further consolidation significantly. However, weak demand could throw a spanner in the works during this fiscal year.



While fragmented capacities are scattered across geographies, southern India has the largest concentration. With an overall installed capacity of close to 400 million tonnes in India, even a company with a 5 MT capacity will have to expand or grow inorganically in order to bag a meaningful share of this market.While the efficiency level would vary across companies and plants, a discount to the replacement cost (currently hovering around USD 140/T) should keep the interest alive in these companies.Are the rainmakers queueing up?",517,0.0

According to him, government will never take the move of reducing the cess on the crude as it is a big source of revenue for the government. Below is the transcript of SP Tulsian’s interview to Anuj Singhal and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18. Anuj: I want to start with Grasim, 5 percent lower on that stock. If Aditya Birla Group has to infuse money in Idea and if Grasim is the preferred route, do you think it warrants the kind of derating we are seeing in Grasim today? A: Two things. First you need to take the Q3 numbers also in consideration, yesterday which numbers when they came out. In fact if you see the standalone, I am referring the standalone intentionally because there is no point in taking a consolidated call. We have already seen that UltraTech have posted good Q3 numbers so the reflection of that has been seen having reflected in the consolidated numbers. The chemical division has disappointed because the way we have seen the caustic soda prices rising, that is not seen having got reflected into the standalone number, Viscose Staple Fibre (VSF) again have posted good numbers so no complaint. So yesterday’s results were in fact maybe on the expected lines but below I have disappointed on the chemical front. So, this is a situation. So yesterday only the stock should not have risen so much, number one. Number two, if you come on the fresh story that probably Aditya Birla Group is looking to have a respectable stake in the joint entity that is Vodafone-Idea, that will be seen extremely negative. Again if you really want to ask me, the group is making a big mistake because if you take a call now, the company Idea has grown with a market cap of closer to about USD 6 billion. You have a market cap of closer to about Rs 40,000 crore. What will be the situation on the merged entity? You will be having a debt of over Rs 1 lakh crore. I agree that the parent is all looking to infuse into the merged entity and all that, so matching contribution also has to come from the Aditya Birla Group. But here we are not talking of maybe Rs 2,000-5,000 crore. The investment is going to be quite high and I do not think this is the sector which is being well-received by the market. So yes, if the money has to get because these are all premature stories and premature moves, but if need to believe that yes, for having a respectable stake by the Aditya Birla Group. In fact market has taken it in its stride or positively for Aditya Birla Nuvo and Grasim yesterday, because they seem to be exiting from the Idea business because both of them are holding close to about 7-8 percent. But if Grasim needs to put additional money into that, I do not think that the standalone situation is very robust on part of Grasim where they can really make these kind of investments and more specially when Aditya Birla Nuvo is getting merged into Grasim. So, if it happens if it happens, then it will be seen extremely negative and market probably again will give a beating to the share price when the news of this sort starts coming in that yes, Grasim is looking to invest and as I said, the investment will run into maybe anywhere between USD 1 billion and USD 2 billion. It will not be a smaller amount. Sonia: Every year we discuss the potential in the oil and gas space before the Budget and this time, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is at a 52-week high. The expectation is that there will be a reduction in the cess rate. But do you think that news is already been priced in or is this still a good time for long-term investors to buy in the hopes of that? A: I will not be playing on this theme that the cess is going to be reduced because I am not expecting that to happen because if you really see the situation before the government, they have to make allocations for so many things. And naturally, in the given situation and when the crude prices have started rising marginally, government will never take that move of reducing the cess on the crude. So this is going to be a big disappointment on part of the ONGC shareholders if it does not come and as I said that generally, I never take such an aggressive view where the cess reduction is likely to happen which is seen a milking cow for the government. If you see the excise duty having raised on the petro-products on diesel and petrol by this new government, that has kept the prices even high. So, government will in fact, that is the big source of revenue for the government and I do not think that they will really be aggressive in going for cut in the cess on the crude. So, I will not be taking a positive call on Oil India and ONGC both. As such Oil India has disappointed on Q3 numbers, that is a different story, but on Budget theme expectations of this crude cess reduction or cut, I am not going to take a positive call based on that.

Anuj: Your thoughts on JSW Steel numbers? A: Numbers are looking good because actually if you see, these numbers have to be seen in the back drop of the rising raw material prices also and the company is procuring the iron ore largely from the third party sources. Now recently they have got the iron ore connectivity or the assurances of those things. So I would say that numbers are really looking quite good.",988,0.0

Centrum's research report on UltraTech Cement

Strong Cost Control Moderates Weak Demand Impact During Q3FY17, UTCEM exhibited strong cost control which moderated the impact of weak demand post currency demonetisation and rising input costs. Its standalone EBITDA remained flat YoY, adj PAT rose 7% over the same period, and unitary EBITDA rose 1% YoY.

Outlook

We remain positive on UTCEM’s steady focus on cost controls (both manufacturing and logistics). Further, the country’s largest cement maker has a strong presence across both trade and non-trade segments which are expected to recover going forward. Amid scant new capacity expansions, the cement industry’s pricing power should firm up during FY17-19, thus boosting cost pass through capability. We upgrade to Buy with a revised TP of Rs 3,890.

ICICI Direct's report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech reported a good set of Q3FY17 numbers. While revenues were in line with our estimate, EBITDA and PAT were above our expectations mainly due to lower power & fuel cost and tax expenses. Revenues declined 2.0% YoY to Rs 5,540.1 crore (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 5453.9 crore) mainly led by 2.2% YoY fall in volumes to 11.3 MT (vs. Idirect estimate of 11.1 MT) while realisation stayed flat YoY to Rs 4,885 (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 4,903.0).

Outlook

In the near term we expect revenues and profitability growth to moderate mainly led by liquidity crunch and slowdown in construction activities. However, over the longer term, we expect UltraTech (a pan-India player) to be a key beneficiary of increased government spend, slowdown in capacity addition and consolidation in the industry. With industry-leading growth, higher margins and a healthy balance sheet, we maintain our positive view with a target price of Rs 4,300/share (i.e. at 18.0x FY19E EV/EBITDA).

Motilal Oswal's report on Ultratech Cement

UTCEM’s 3QFY17 revenue declined 2% YoY to INR 55.4b (estimate: INR 53.43b). Its gray cement volume declined only 0.6% YoY, led by higher exports (+90% YoY; ramp up of Gujarat unit). PAT grew 7% YoY to INR 5.6b, aided by lower depreciation and lower tax expenses.

Outlook

Even in challenging times post demonetization, UTCEM’s strong focus on market share gain and cost efficiency have helped deliver better than estimated results. It is a strong bet on the cycle upturn, and in our view, success in asset creation should overshadow any near-term concerns for long-term investors. We factor in 5-6% volume CAGR and 21% EBITDA CAGR over FY17-19. We value UTCEM at INR 4,058 (EV of 15x FY19E EBITDA and USD225/ton).

Edelweiss' research report on Ultratech Cement

UTCL reported gross revenue of INR 63.7bn, down 2% YoY, aided by flat volume growth and realisations, which fell 1% YoY. This is stellar considering interim fears of retail sales compressing 15-20% YoY post demonetisation. Another interesting take away was that total cost/t fell QoQ despite rising pet coke prices and 17% YoY higher diesel prices.

Outlook

Ultratech Cement’s (UTCL) Q3FY17 numbers surpassed consensus and our forecasts largely due to higher-than-estimated volumes and lower costs. The other positive surprise is that capital cost for new project at Dhar, Madhya Pradesh (MP) is 15-20% lower than capex reported so far by the industry. We have raised FY17E EPS 7% as UTCL has achieved 82% of our FY17E in 9mFY17. However, we have trimmed FY18E and FY19E EPS 2% each to factor in lower other income following the new capex announcement. Our revised TP of INR 4,372 (INR 4,488 earlier) implies an exit P/E of 25x and factors in value of JPA assets at replacement value. Apart from the structural benefits that the company may enjoy following the cost cutting drive, the operating and financial leverage will drive EPS CAGR of 30% over FY16-19E, rendering it the key large-cap pick in the sector. Retain ‘BUY’.

Karvy's report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech’s Q3FY17 operational performance was better than our estimates with revenues/EBITDA came at Rs 55.4bn/10.4bn against our estimates of Rs 53.3bn/9.0bn. Blended cement volume was flattish YoY, better than our estimate of 5% YoY de-growth. EBITDA/ton also remained flat YoY at Rs 890/t (vs. estimate of Rs 817/t) as lower realisation negated the impact of lower costs.

Outlook

We expect EBITDA/t of Rs 1111/t by FY19E from Rs894/t in FY16 (led by realisation improvement, cost moderation & operating leverage benefits) with EBITDA CAGR of 14% over FY16-19E. Valuation at 16.9x/14x FY18E/19E EV/EBITDA (post the stock correction by 12% in last 3 months) looks attractive considering the growth potential going ahead. We maintain BUY rating on UltraTech with revised TP of Rs 3940 (based on 17.5x Sept-18E EV/EBITDA).

The Competition Commission of India's penalty of Rs 206 crore on seven cement companies is likely to shave off ""under 2 percent of operating profits"" of the players, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) said today.

The impact however, would be credit neutral on the companies due to their low leverage levels, the rating agency said.

Yesterday, Shree Cement, UltraTech Cement, Jaiprakash Associates, J K Cement, Ambuja Cements, ACC and JK Lakshmi Cement were penalised for violating competition norms with regard to a tender floated by a Haryana agency back in 2012.

This is the second penalty this fiscal over and above the Rs 6,700 crore penalty imposed by CCI in August 2016 on 11 cement companies.

Ind-Ra said the cement industry in India is unique, with around 60 percent of the industry's total capacity being controlled with the top eight players.

""To the extent regulatory intervention limits coordinated supplier actions with respect to price and quantity, smaller firms (single or multiple plants with high geographic concentration) with uneconomic cost structures will become uncompetitive and face significant deterioration in their credit profiles.

""As such, the level of fragmentation in the industry is expected to reduce and larger and vertically integrated companies are likely to gain market share,"" it said.

Noting that Cement sector has been impacted with demonetisation and increasing cost curve in last two months.

Ind-Ra said the agency expects cement production to grow by around 4 percent in 2016-17.

The agency earlier estimated 4 percent-6 percent growth for Cement sector in 2016-17.",263,-0.1420345221246992

UltraTech Cement's third quarter profit on standalone basis is likely to decline at Rs 507 crore compared with Rs 508.6 crore in year-ago period.

Revenue during the quarter may fall 5.4 percent to Rs 5,510 crore from Rs 5,826 crore on yearly basis, according to average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Analysts say topline may see a bump up of Rs 600 crore due to excise duty added in gross sales.

Operating profit is seen falling 9 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,025 crore and margin may contract 70 basis points to 18.6 percent in Q3, impacted by lower realisations.

Realisations are likely to fall by 2 percent YoY.

Key factors to watch out for would be impact of higher pet coke prices, EBITDA per tonne, volume growth recovery & outlook, cement pricing outlook & sustainability and update on scale-up of newly commenced Rajasthan plant.

Analysts expect total sales volumes to fall 4 percent YoY to 11.15 MT due to demonetisation. Demand was impacted in areas like northern, western and even the eastern part of the country.

They say higher petcoke prices may start reflecting from Q3FY17 and fully from Q4. Petcoke usage has increased from 65 percent to 76 percent in past 1 year, which will hurt them now.

Every USD 10 per tonne higher petcoke price impacts profit by Rs 60 per tonne.

The Chinese embargo or limits on metal buying will definitely be seen negative by investors, says SP Tulsian of SPTulsian.com'. He says he has cautious call on Hindalco. Below is the verbatim transcript of SP Tulsian's interview to Anuj Singhal and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.

Anuj: Your thoughts first on what transpired in last one hour in the Bank Nifty that Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) issue and the fact that we saw so much intraday volatility?

A: Maybe market is playing to all sort of news which we have seen in this last one hour of MSS getting raise to about Rs 6 lakh crore for 28 days window. Now if you see the background I don’t think that news anyone had any doubt that this will not come and again we are all going to see the rate cut also as per the estimates all going on, but market likes to play on each and every news and the volatility gets created. Honestly, if you really see the announcement of this news flow, I don’t think that there is anything new to that and one should take this as a surprise, because this has been the CRR hike has to get offset by the MSS which has all being expected. The Rs 6 lakh crore which has come now is way ahead of the amount which has been squeezed via CRR — so I think both these news may be now it just a matter of the order in which these things will follow, because this MSS will come for 28 days now whether this comes after the rate cut or prior to rate cut is just a matter of what you call the strategy of the RBI to be decided, but there is nothing new in this news flow which has come in.

Sonia: I wanted your thoughts on a couple of stocks that have been the biggest losers this week. One of them is Hindalco which is down almost 7 percent for the week. It had a great trend up until this week, but now there is some profit taking. So, would you at any point, look to buy into it and the other one is Asian Paints. We have spoken about this is in the past, but once again this week, it has been the big loser. What would you do with two of these names?

A: If you first come on the Hindalco, if you see China has put an embargo or some kind of limits on the metal buying also and that will definitely be seen negative. So yes, you have to keep a cautious or negative call on all the metal stocks. The kind of run up which we have seen, maybe some of the zinc and lead producers, the secondary lead smelters also like Nile, Pondi Oxides or maybe Gravita kind of things. So, you have to have a cautious view on all the metals stocks, but specifically on Hindalco, I have never in fact convinced with this kind of run up, because if you see the business model, I do not see in what way the company is seen to be enjoying this upsurge in the metal prices also because they are the primary aluminium producers and they have not seen much benefits really flowing to them and for the copper, I do not think they are really enjoying any kind of benefits being TCRC earning only accruing to them.

Coming on Asian Paints, definitely the rising crude will be seen negative for the paint industry and you need to have a cautious view on both. So, maybe I will not take a buy call or positive call on both the stocks.

Anuj: The point Sonia makes is quite relevant. For Swift and Swift Dzire, for example, they sell off like hot cakes I have not heard of discounts at least in this bracket from Maruti. What is your thought on this stock now at Rs 5,000-5,050?

A: If you take a call from Maruti point of view, I think this strategy is perfectly right on part of the, because either you cut the production and you see the sales falling maybe to a level of 1,00,000 cars per month and all sort of things. Number two, I have always maintained that when the stock has moved to a level of Rs 5,300-5,400 that the stock has reached to its optimum level. But the kind of bullish views presented at that point of time, in fact if you take a chart or maybe the view on Maruti of the last six months, it was bizarre. When it was ruling at Rs 3,300-3,400, people have been giving a negative call because the yen was hardening against the dollar. It moved to a level 102-103 per dollar and the experts have taken a view that things cannot really move up because as long as the yen remains at those levels. Yen did not weaken thereafter, but the stock has almost seen a rise of 60 percent, number one. Number two, at that point of time, I have always been preferring Maruti over Tata Motors, but majority, I am not trying to blame or I am not trying to blow my trumpet, but at that point of time, Tata Motors was liked more by the market which has also proved wrong.

So on this strategy if the profit booking is coming in, it is giving a buying opportunity, maybe at a level below Rs 5,000 because as such you can see the price getting capped for Maruti at Rs 5,400. Nobody can rule out the kind of negative effect likely to be seen because of the demonetisation, but that is likely to remain confined only till December. I do not think that the shortage of currency supply will go beyond there and the things will dramatically change. And just to recap, in maybe the last couple of days when the market was moving up, I have seen the experts changing the view that the effect of demonetisation will not be very high. On November 30, when I was asked that why the automobile stocks have been going up, people have all been saying that probably the hit may not be that bad for the two-wheelers and cars. So, we keep changing our views looking to the market movement. But I do not think that the things were looking positive as such till December 31 otherwise also and I will not be too disturbed with this Maruti strategy and if it falls below Rs 5,000 then it qualifies a buy as an investor.

Sonia: We have discussed this earlier, but anything from the paint companies, the tyre companies that got impacted this week, because of higher crude prices or even aviation companies you have been negative on aviation stocks, but what about the other pockets?

A: Yesterday, in fact I have expressed this because of this crude three sectors are going to get impacted; one is the paint stocks, second is the telecom stocks and third even if you take a call on the tyre stocks also. Aviation, paint and telecom because mind it in the telecom the towers are consuming lot of diesel and no one has really talked of that and if you have the double whammy like Jio extending their free schemes till March 31 that is also seen quite bad for them.

Coming on tyre stocks if you see the price behaviour or the pattern the rubber prices have gone up in China than corrected couple of days back and it has been swinging to that volatility. If you really see the situation prevailing here in India, the Q2 numbers have not really cheered much and so what I feel that all the tyre stocks seem to have picked out and will only give you the volatility depends on the natural rubber prices behaviour and if you take the synthetic rubber also styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) that will also be seen going expensive with the rising crude prices, so negative or maybe cautious view on all the four sectors which I have stated.

Anuj: Any stock that has corrected which you fundamentally like right now?

A: If you want to take a sector rotation call then already cement and non-banking finance companies (NBFC) which were recommended by me about two weeks back have given a good profits. You have referred for Grasim, so if I take a call on three Grasim related stocks, that is Grasim, Aditya Birla Nuvo and UltraTech Cement. I am keeping a positive bias on all three. And if you take a call now on the auto ancillary stocks, probably they are looking quite good and amongst them, maybe like Pricol which is going for the restructuring from this Monday, maybe there will be a delisting or maybe the suspension for about a couple of weeks but I really find huge value in that. Or maybe like Ucal Fuel Systems, Rico Auto, Harita Seatings, so I am quite positive on the auto ancillary stocks at the current level.",1530,-0.7127233147621155

UltraTech Cement said the Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT) has granted a stay on an order passed by the fair trade regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI) against the company on deposit of 10 per cent of the penalty amount.

In August, CCI had slapped over Rs 6,700 crore of penalty on 11 cement firms including UltraTech, ACC, Ambuja, Ramco and JK Cement as well as the industry body Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) for indulging in cartelisation.

UltraTech had filed an appeal against the Order dated August 31, 2016 before the COMPAT.

""Hearings on the stay application had been held by the COMPAT. While disposing off the application, the COMPAT vide its order dated November 21, 2016 granted stay with the deposit of 10 per cent of the penalty amount within one month from the date of the Order,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.

The CCI had imposed penalty of Rs 1,175.49 crore on the firm. This Order was passed by CCI pursuant to the Order of the COMPAT setting aside the Order of the CCI dated June 20, 2012 and remitting the matter to CCI for fresh adjudication, the flagship firm of the Aditya Birla Group said.

In the August 2016 order, apart from penalising the CMA, CCI had directed all the firms to ""cease and desist"" from indulging in any activity relating to agreement, understanding or arrangement on prices, production and supply of cement in the market.

This order was passed by CCI following directions issued by the COMPAT, which had remanded the matter involving the cement firms to regulator for passing fresh orders. Tribunal had also set aside fine on the 10 firms imposed earlier.",289,

Centrum's research report on UltraTech Cement

UTCEM delivered operationally strong numbers – standalone EBITDA/PAT up 18%/31% YoY (In-line EBITDA). This is led by operating costs per MT reduction by 7% YoY (continued savings in energy and freight costs) which more than offset for muted volume growth and 3% YoY lower NSR. Strong supply discipline led to 3% QoQ NSR increase despite weak demand during monsoon. We like the stock on its strong presence in both trade and non-trade segment, strong cost efficiency and stable balance sheet amid improving narrowing cement demand supply gap. As we factored in JPA asset amalgamation in FY18, its lower profitability and higher leverage leads to lower TP of Rs3,770 (earlier Rs3,900). Amid no near term upside, we downgrade to HOLD.

We introduce our FY19E estimates. We downgrade to HOLD with a revised TP of 3,770, valuing it at 13x FY18 EBITDA (earlier Rs 3,900). The target price reduction is on account of the lower initial profit contribution from JPA asset amalgamation with UTCEM.

Debt-laden Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) on Monday said its shareholders have approved the sale of the firm's cement business to Aditya Birla Group's UltraTech Cement.

Earlier this year, the Aditya Birla Group firm announced acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates' cement plants with a total capacity of 21.1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) at an enterprise value of Rs 16,189 crore.

JAL in a regulatory filing informed about the outcome of the court-convened meeting of the equity shareholders held on October 22, 2016.

The shareholders approved ""Scheme of Arrangement (merger) between Jaiprakash Associates (JAL) and Jaypee Cement Corporation (JCCL) and UltraTech Cement and their respective shareholders and creditors"", it added.

According to the deal, UltraTech will pay Rs 16,189 crore to buy Jaypee Group's cement operations that have a total capacity of 17.2 MTPA spread across Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Andhra Pradesh.

In addition, it will acquire a 4 MTPA grinding unit being constructed in Uttar Pradesh.

Of this, 11.2 MTPA capacity is in Central India, 5 MTPA in coastal Andhra Pradesh and 4.8 MTPA in Himachal Pradesh.

While presenting the July-September quarter results, UltraTech said: ""Transaction is expected to complete in next 5-6 months."" It added that approval from Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been received and the next step involves seeking approval from the concerned High Court and the final approval from capital markets regulator SEBI.",241,

We believe that UltraTech Cement (UCL) is a strong franchise in the cement space which can deliver sustainable growth in earnings and continue to trade at higher multiples as it enjoys a scarcity premium. However, despite our firm belief, we have downgraded our rating on the stock to Sell (from Accumulate earlier) as we believe the risk-return trade-off is completely tilted in favour of risk at the moment. The stock trades at a historically high valuation, especially at a point when the earnings trajectory is likely to hit a bump on account of uncertainty over the large 21.2mnmt acquisition of assets of Jaiprakash Associates (JAL). We believe the market is not completely factoring in the possibility of a substantial correction in the profitability matrices like EBITDA/mt and RoCE post completion of JAL assets acquisition. While we believe this acquisition will be remunerative for the company over the long run, we are not quite ready to pay a substantial premium for the same currently. As with any other acquisition, there is likelihood of initial teething problems in running the acquired plants and replacing the Jaypee brand with UltraTech in a new market. If demand growth in the industry continues to be weak, then it will take much longer time to realise the synergies of this acquisition which the market is not factoring in the stock price, in our view. We have revisited all our assumptions and estimates for the company and have also factored in a relatively rosy post-acquisition scenario. Despite this, we had to cut our EBITDA estimates for FY18 and FY19 by 16.7% and 9.1%, respectively, as our earlier estimates were more optimistic to begin with. To give UCL the benefit of doubt for its size, reach, premium pricing and market leadership, we have increased our EV/EBITDA target multiple on it to 15.0x from 12.5x based on September 2018 quarter earnings estimate to arrive at a target price of Rs 3,532, down 12% from the current market price.",418,-0.9987791180610657

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech Cement



UltraTech announced its Q2FY17 results that are not directly comparable due to adoption of new accounting standard (IND-AS). Under the new accounting standard, the company reported sales including excise duty. Hence, optically revenues look significantly higher than our estimates (Rs 6,134.6 crore vs. our estimate of Rs 5,502.8 crore). After adjusting for excise duty, revenues of Rs 5,397.9 crore are in line with our estimate. However, the EBITDA and PAT were above our estimates mainly due to lower than anticipated power cost and higher than anticipated other income (IND AS impact) Revenues during the quarter declined 2.3% YoY to Rs 5,397.9 crore due to 3.1% YoY decline in realisation (Rs 4828/tonne vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 4804/tonne) partly offset by 0.8% YoY growth in volumes (11.2 MT vs. I-direct estimate of 11.5 MT) EBITDA/t increased 17.6% YoY to Rs 978/t (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 900/t) in Q2FY17 led by lower power & fuel cost/t and freight cost/t.

Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions. The cement sector is poised to witness robust growth in coming years led by 1) improving demand, 2) slowdown in capacity addition and 3) consolidation. UltraTech being a pan India player makes it a key beneficiary of this upturn. Further, improving realisation and the company’s focus on cost rationalisation is expected to aid margins. With the industry-leading growth, higher margins and healthy balance-sheet, we maintain our positive view with a target price of Rs 4,600/share (i.e. at 20.0x FY18E EV/EBITDA).

Axis Direct's research report on Ultratech Cement



UltraTech reported an EBITDA/ton of more than Rs 1,000 in Q2FY17, which is commendable, given Q2 is a seasonally weak quarter for cement industry due to monsoon. This is the highest EBITDA/ton for September quarter in past four years. Firm cement prices across regions despite low off-take (volume growth of only 1% YoY) was the key reason for higher profitability.

Standalone EBITDA at Rs 11.5 bn (up 17% YoY) was in line with consensus and our estimates. Blended EBITDA/ton was Rs 1,030 (vs. Rs 890 in Q2FY16 and Rs 1,080 in Q1FY17). Average realization improved 3% QoQ to Rs 4,880/ton due to cement price hikes in North/South regions. Volumes at domestic operations were 11.2 mnt (up 1% YoY). Cost/ton increased 6% QoQ due to higher cost of pet-coke and negative operating leverage because of lower sales.

Debt-laden JP Group said its shareholders have approved the company's proposal to convert its debt into equity.

Shareholders of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) approved the ""option to convert loans, debentures or other borrowings/debt of the company into equity shares/securities of the company,"" it said in a regulatory filing.

Explaining the rationale behind the move, JAL in a filing had earlier said that recessionary trend in construction/ infrastructure sectors during the last few years coupled with setbacks in timely monetisation of some of the assets of company resulted in cash flow mismatch leading to some delays in honouring debt obligations.

""The lenders may consider an option to convert their loan/credit facilities (including unpaid interest) in full or part thereof, into equity shares/securities of the company...,"" it had said.

In the last few months, JAL has informed exchanges that it has failed to meet its debt and interest payment commitments.

Jaypee Group has on a consolidated basis failed to repay Rs 2,905.6 crore in principal amount to banks and another Rs 1,558.93 crore in interest payments. JAL owes over Rs 30,000 crore to a consortium of lenders led by ICICI Bank.

In a bid to pare debt, the firm in March inked a deal Ultratech Cement, which agreed to acquire its cement plants in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh with a total capacity of 21.20 million tonnes per annum for Rs 16,189 crore.

The Group had a consolidated debt of around Rs 58,250 crore as of March 2016.",261,-0.9999811053276062

Motilal Oswal's research report on UltraTech Cement



Led by the current government’s thrust towards faster implementation of infrastructure projects, cement demand from the infrastructure segment is likely to grow at 1.5x the GDP growth over FY16-21, implying a demand CAGR of 13%. This would generate incremental demand of 53m tons over the next five years. Within the infrastructure segment, demand growth would be led by (a) roads – investment of over INR 2t by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), and (b) irrigation projects – NABARD has recently agreed to give funding to both state and central governments for stalled projects worth INR 2.5t. Cement demand from the commercial segment would grow at a CAGR of 7.7% over FY16-21, as India is progressing towards being one of the world’s largest service providers.

Cement firms includingACC, Ambuja and India Cements today said they will move COMPAT against fair trade regulator CCI's order to impose Rs 6,700 crore penalty, while others like UltraTech and Shree Cement adopted a wait-and-watch approach.

Yesterday, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) had slapped an over Rs 6,700 crore penalty on 11 cement firms for indulging in cartelisation.

In separate regulatory filings, LafargeHolcim-controlled Ambuja Cements and ACC as well as India Cements and Ramco Cements said that they will approach the Competition Appellate Tribunal (COMPAT) against the judgement.

However, Aditya Birla Group's Ultratech Cement, Shree Cement, Jaiprakash Associates and JK Cement said they will decide the future course of action after studying the order and seeking legal advice.

Even as cement companies have taken a cautious approach, CREDAI, the apex body of private real estate developers, said the judgement is ""encouraging"" for the entire construction ecosystem.

""Developer community has always claimed that there is an unprecedented increase of cement prices at certain times of the year and it results into cost of the construction for affordable homes going up,"" it said in a statement.

Analysts say the order may put pressure on companies with relatively high levels of debt and can have implication on new capex.

India Ratings said the order will put pressure on credit metrics for firms with relatively high levels of leverage.

Religare said though the order is not in favour of cement players, it expects the judgement to be contested and will turn out to be a long-drawn process.

In the medium term, Edelweiss said, ""If we assume that top-12 cement players in India have to pay this fine, close to about 40 per cent of annual cash flows of the entire sector would not be available either for debt/equity/new capex. This would have implications for the cement cycle."" CCI had imposed a fine of Rs 1,147.59 crore on ACC, while penalties on Jaiprakash Associates and Ultratech are Rs 1,323.60 crore and Rs 1,175.49 crore, respectively.

The fines on other firms are Rs 274.02 crore (Century), Rs 187.48 crore (India Cements), Rs 128.54 crore (JK Cements), Rs 490.01 crore (Lafarge), Rs 258.63 crore (Ramco), ACL (Rs 1,163.91 crore), Binani (Rs 167.32 crore), while industry body CMA faces a fine of Rs 0.73 crore.

Through a separate order, the regulator slapped a fine of Rs 397.51 crore on Shree Cement for unfair businesses practices.

The latest order has been passed by CCI following the directions issued by COMPAT, which had remanded the matter involving the cement companies to CCI for passing fresh order.

The tribunal had also set aside fine on 10 cement firms imposed earlier.",450,-0.41202209889888763

2:20 pm Market Outlook: The Indian market has been on a upward ride ever since it crashed to 52-week lows of about 6,800 in February.

Cash-strapped infrastructure firm Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) today said it has failed to pay a total of Rs 36.25 crore in principal installment and interest for NCDs due April 25.

This is the second time in around five months that the firm has informed about failing to meet payment commitments.

On March 8, Jaiprakash Associates had informed BSE that the interest, which was payable on the Bonds on the semi-annual interest payment date of March 7, 2016, has not been paid. ""The Issuer wishes to inform you that it has not paid such interest. The Issuer intends to engage in discussions with holders of the Bonds to arrive at a solution in respect of the unpaid interest."" At that time the company had said that it is in the process of reducing debt through inking an MoU with UltraTech Cement Ltd (UTCL) for sale of cement plants in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, AP and Karnataka with a total capacity of 18.40 MTPA for Rs 16,500 crore.

JAL on February 28, 2016 had announced the signing of a ""binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)"" with UCL for divestment of part of its cement business.

In today's filing, JAL said, ""The filing may be read in consonance with disclosures/press releases of February 28, February 29, and July 4, 2016 wherein company has informed about the disinvestment initiatives being undertaken"".

On July 4, JAL had said: ""The company has informed that taking note of decision of Joint Lenders Forum of company's Lenders on the invocation of Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR), subject to approval of Lenders."" In this regard JAL's Board constituted a Committee of Directors to evaluate various options necessitating financial restructuring as may be applicable with evolving guidelines of RBI and Banks to deal with the debt management and take all actions/steps, necessary, by the said Committee, it added.

On February 29, it had said its Board has taken note with approval of the said MOU and that ""The company will execute a definitive agreement with UCL in this regard in due course.

Edelweiss research report on UltraTech



UltraTech Cement’s (UTCL) Q1FY17 numbers suggest that the sharp 31% YoY net profit jump to INR7.7bn was largely driven by cost savings, which will be reversed post consumption of low-cost fuel inventory. However, this is only partially true. A closer look at the result indicates: (a) ~INR100/t cost reduction is primarily from higher blending—a structural change; (b) better working capital management led to higher cash release resulting in the company turning net cash a couple of quarters ahead of our estimate; and (c) higher focus on rural penetration coupled with JPA acquisition will help UTCL gain better foothold in India’s fastest-growing markets and boost market share gains, akin to Shree Cement.

Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions. Considering dispersed small-ticket investments driving current investment cycle, UTCL, with its preeminent position in the sector, appears well placed. Thanks to rising utilization/consolidation, EPS CAGR at ~35% over FY16-18E can well sustain till FY20 which can help sustain multiples. UTCL’s operating leverage could rise disproportionately post culmination of the JPA deal. As per our earnings model, a 1% volume variation leads to 3% change in EPS and 1% price to 8-9% change in EPS, close to double the current sensitivity.

ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech



UltraTech results were above our estimates at EBITDA and PAT level. However, there was topline miss (Rs 6182.3 crore vs I-direct estimate of Rs 6390.6 crore) due to adoption of Ind AS accounting. Under the new accounting standard discounts and direct sales incentives are directly deducted from sales instead of showing it as an expense line. If we adjust this then topline would have been higher by Rs 100-125 crore to Rs 6307.3 crore. Hence on an adjusted basis topline was broadly in line with our estimate. Volumes during the quarter increased 6.4% YoY to 13.2 mt (vs I-direct estimate of 13.1 mt) driven by healthy infra spends in north, east and south. EBITDA margin increased 380 bps YoY to 22.2% (above I-direct estimate of 20.6%). EBITDA/t increased 17.9% YoY to Rs 1,040/t (vs I-direct estimate of Rs 1007/t) in Q1FY17 led by lower power & fuel cost/t.

Further, EBITDA/t is expected to increase from Rs 890/t to over Rs 1048/t led by increase in realisation, commissioning of various grinding units and WHRS.

Blended cement volume grew by 6.4% YoY, in-line with estimates. EBITDA/ton improved 18% YoY to Rs 1040/t (vs. estimate of Rs 1046/t) primarily on account of 9% YoY fall in total cost/ton. Going ahead, better volume growth to continue (led by ramp-up of new capacity additions) with improvement in operating margin implies 23% EBITDA CAGR during FY16-18E.

Standalone EBITDA at Rs 14.2 bn (up 23% YoY) was in line with our and Street estimates. Blended EBITDA/ton increased to Rs 1,080 vs. Rs 1,000 in Q4FY16, mainly due to higher realizations.

Cement prices in North and Central India have moved up since end of Q4FY16.

Aditya Birla Group-controlled UltraTech Cement said its capacity will increase to 91.1 miilion tones per annum (MTPA) by the current fiscal-end, following aquisition of Jaiprakash Associates' cement plants.

""We expect to complete transaction to acquire Jaiprakash Associates' cement plants within the next 12 months period. Our capacity then will stand augmented to 91.1 MTPA, including overseas operations, from the present 66.3 MTPA,"" UltraTech Cement Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla told shareholders at the company's 16th annual general meeting here.

Earlier this month, the company announced acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates' cement plants with a total capacity of 21.1 MTPA at an enterprise value of Rs 16,189 crore.

Birla said the proposed transaction is essentially a geographic market expansion which will lead to UltraTech's entry into the growing domestic market. These include the Satna cluster in Madhya Pradesh (East) and Uttar Pradesh (East), Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and coastal Andhra Pradesh.

The operations will be strengthened by the consequent technological upgradation and enhancement in capacity utilisation on a year-on-year basis.

It will lead to creating synergies in manufacturing, distribution and logistics. As a result, advantages such as economies of scale and creation of efficiencies by reducing lead time to markets will be attained, the noted industrialist said, adding that the company will spend Rs 1,500 crore towards capex plan next year.

On Lafarge, Birla said the company was unable to bid due to Competition Commission of India (CCI) restrictions. ""We were restricted by CCI to acquire Lafarge, but there is enough room for geographical expansion."" The company has commissioned cement grinding units at Jhajjar in Haryana, Dankuni in West Bengal and Pataliputra in Bihar. A cement bulk terminal went on stream in Pune last year.

UltraTech has a very strong balance sheet, robust cash flows and gearing levels well within reasonable limits. The company enjoys the confidence of its stakeholders, reflected in its market cap of around USD 14 billion, he added.

The country's cement demand remained passive for most of FY16, particularly on account of low demand from the housing segment.

Birla was optimistic on the cement sector which is expected to grow at around 7 per cent in FY17. He opined that India is moving on to a higher growth tract.

The Government's focus on infrastructure development, housing sector, smart cities, roads etc, along with good monsoon should drive expansion going forward, he added.",402,0.6892443001270294

Moneycontrol BureauCement companies have been at a slight disadvantage when it comes to executing orders from the government. The government asked for a bulk procurement discount, leading to lower margins for cement firms. Also, a year ago, government had set fixed prices for new road projects for three years. But a report from Credit-Suisse notes that in new contracts the base bids of cement firms are a lot closer to the market rate. An increase of 10 percent has been allowed in prices, it says.It adds that, ""price escalation of 10 percent gives high protection."" The report believes that the current price hike in retail is assumed to be 8-10 percent Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)."" This means — that with the already low-cost of production because of the low power and fuel costs — cement companies will also benefit from better prices from the government. But the report also points out that margins however good will still be lower than retail orders as prices for government road projects will remain fixed for the next one year starting April 2016.The large cement firms have committed 3 percent of capacity to such government contracts. UltraTech — according to the report — has the highest bids compared to its large cap competitors in the new road projects. But the report says that more competitive bids are coming fromShree, JK Lakshmi, JSW, Lafarge, Century and smaller players in the South. Credit-Suisse in its report recommends UltraTech in large caps and JK Lakshmi in mid-caps.The report expects a double-digit growth in the sector. ""We are positive on demand recovery, but neutral on large caps.""",280,0.9999717473983765

Morgan Stanley is overweight on UltraTech Cement expecting the cement company to reap benefits from its acquisition of JP Associates’ (JP) cement assets. It believes the deal, should it go ahead, would be completed by March 2018. The acquisition will give UltraTech access to the attractive central India market, where it currently has limited presence. Among other benefits, the brokerage house cited freight cost savings and a shift in focus to other acquisitions as key for the company.

ICICI Securities is of the view that the JP deal will be positive for UltraTech and maintains a ‘buy’ call raising its target price to Rs 3900. It has increased its FY18 revenue and EBITDA estimates for UltraTech by 15 percent and 9 percent, respectively.

“We reduce its FY18E EPS by 13 percent as we factor the company’s USD2.4 billion acquisition of 21.2 million cement capacities of JPA group,” adds a note by ICICI Securities.

It sees the net debt-to-equity ratio increasing to 0.6 times against its earlier estimate of nil.

The deal gives the company access to growth markets of central and east Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and coastal Andhra Pradesh, and is likely to be consummated by the first quarter of FY18 post various regulatory approvals.

“UltraTech's pan-India capacity market share would increase to 20 percent; while its market share in the high growth central region would increase to over 30 percent from the current 11 percent”.

The deal is expected to be EPS-accretive from the third-year post acquisition.

“We estimate UltraTech would need to generate Rs 2000 crore EBITDA to breakeven at net levels.”",277,0.39196766416231793

Amid reports that lenders may take majority control of the debt-laden Jaiprakash Associates, a senior SBI official on July 1 said it has classified the account as an NPA and lenders will soon meet to take a call on invoking Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR) provisions.

""Jaypee became a non-performing asset (NPA) some time back,"" the senior official said, adding the country's largest lender has an exposure of Rs 7,000 crore to the account.

The official added the Joint Lenders' Forum (JLF) will be meeting soon to take a call on invoking the conditions of SDR, which involves banks taking majority control of the company.

The comments come amid a news reports that the JLF, led by private sector lender ICICI Bank has decided to convert its debt into majority ownership under the SDR route.

The lenders have also reportedly decided to invoke the provisions at a meeting on Tuesday after uncertainties over a Rs 15,900 crore deal in which Aditya Birla Group company Ultratech Cement was to take over JP's cement assets.

UltraTech and Jaiprakash Associates had signed an agreement on March 31 for the sale of the cement division, which has a capacity of 21.2 million tonnes in factories located across five states.

Jaiprakash Associates had a consolidated debt of Rs 58,250 crore as of March 31.",228,

The Cabinet has approved recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, which will grant salary hike to over one crore government employees and pensioners. The government has increased pay and pension segments while allowances have been kept on hold which will be revised over next four months. Pay hike for government employees is likely to boost consumption and bolster growth with higher spending.

Though 7th pay hike is lower than in 6th Pay Commission and the arrear payouts are likely to be lower, analysts still expect a consumption boost. Citi economists expect consumption growth pick up to 8.4 percent in FY17 from 7.6 percent in FY16 (marginal downside risks from potential delays in implementation of allowances hike). It estimates combined wage stimulus could be over 1 percent of GDP over FY17-18. The firm sees positive impact in consumer related segments - auto, retail, durables, housing, retail banking. It has buy rating on autos (Maruti), consumer related (Titan, Voltas, Coffee Day, Phoenix Mills), retail focused banks (HDFC Bank, Kotak, IndusInd), housing finance (HDFC, LIC Housing Finance) and cement companies (Ultratech).

Macquarie believes that the wage revisions will help boost private consumption especially in urban areas thus support overall growth. It says that private consumption growth will likely improve to 8 percent in FY17 from 7.4 percent in FY16 on annual basis due to wage revisions and the one rank one pension (OROP) scheme, hopes of a good monsoon, contained inflationary pressures and lower cost of capital ,among others. As per Macquarie’s estimates 47 percent of central government employees are based in Tier 1/Tier 2 cities and rest in smaller cities.

Credit Suissse thinks that the pay hike mostly benefits top quarter of urban consumers. Housing (rent,and likely ownership) and transportation (mainly four-wheeler purchases and fuel) are the most likely beneficiaries LIC Housing Finance, Maruti, BPCL, IOC, Kajaria and Havell's are top plays, according to the brokerage firm.

However, it also points out that railways may see the worst impact. “Delayed implementation of allowances (no arrears on them) limits impact on this year's union budget but there could still be Rs 25000- Rs 30000 crore additional costs. Better corporate profits could create some room; the 7th Pay Commission hikes should also help taxes. Early start in states would help central tax take as well,” it says in a note.

Surendra Goyal of Citi says he expects some surprises in earnings as companies started reporting Q1FY17, based on Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), although it is too early to figure out the quantum.He feels some companies that may see negative Q1FY17 earnings are Zee Entertainment due to interest on redeemable preference shares, and Tech Mahindra, Eicher Motors & Info Edge due to ESOP (employee stock option) cost.

According to him, PSU earnings may benefit on reported employee costs & some corporates like Maruti Suzuki & Hero MotoCorp may gain due to higher interest income.

He remains constructive as better-than-expected Q4FY16 earnings (ex-financials) raises confidence in bottom-up forecast of 14 percent earnings growth in FY17.

While Indian market continues to be volatile, analyts feel direct economic impact of Brexit on broad emerging market is likely to be limited. On Friday, in a surprise move UK voted to leave the European Union sending world markets including India into a tailspin.

Although many feel that Brexit may drag UK into a recessionary phase, few are optimistic that next catalyst for the market would be political developments in Europe as well as central bank activity globally. On Friday, the day of Brexit referendum results, the benchmark Sensex lost nearly 1,100 points intra-day before closing 604.51 points lower. Investors' wealth in stock market took a hit of nearly Rs 1.8 lakh crore on that day.

Correspondingly metals and IT services would be less preferred, it warns.

Credit Suisse: It advises investors to stay overweight domestic focused defensive sectors: consumer staples, discretionary, utilities, and OMCs (ICICI, L&T, BPCL, HUL, HDFC, Shriram Transport Finance). A global low interest rate environment should also support NBFCs.

Goldman Sachs is positively surprised with recent rise in cement prices despite no major increase in demand during May.

The brokerage house believes near-term cement demand is likely to be weak due to monsoons, which could lead to seasonal weakness in prices but it remains structurally positive on the medium-term demand and supply outlook (especially after monsoon).

Historically, the March quarter is strongest for cement demand, while September is the weakest.

According to the brokerage firm's note, a normal monsoon is likely to be positive for 2H demand, as it is likely to revive rural housing demand (30-35 percent of total demand) that been a key overhang on demand for the last 12 months. Even in Union Budget 2016, there was significantly higher allocation towards rural spending should also address the issue of weak rural housing demand.

Additionally, it believes demand growth will be aided by better infrastructure-related cement consumption and forecasts 7 percent YoY demand growth in FY17.

Even government's focus on infrastructure (roads, railways, metros) and housing for all by 2022 is expected to help cement demand grow 9 percent CAGR in FY16-19, says Goldman Sachs, which expects limited capacity additions as land acquisition remains a key bottleneck.

As per cement dealers, in north, cement prices rose by Rs 20-30 per bag in the last week and on west side, prices in Maharashtra / Gujarat increased by Rs 5 per bag.

In south, prices in Hyderabad climbed Rs 30 per bag in the non-trade segment in the last 2-3 weeks while Bengaluru prices rose Rs 15 per bag. Prices were flat in Chennai. Dealers expect further firming up of prices in the near term. Prices in east were stable compared to May.

In cement space, Goldman Sachs has retained buy on Grasim with target price of Rs 5,300 as it is trading at a 44 percent discount to FY18 NAV. It believes that is not justified as it expects a pick-up in its key businesses (cement/VSF).

Among the pure-play cement companies, the brokerage prefers UltraTech Cement on its capacity leadership, strong earnings growth, ability to grow inorganically. It has buy rating on the stock with target price of Rs 3435.

Key risks for both companies are higher-than-expected coal/freight costs and low VSF prices, it says.Posted by Sunil Shankar Matkar",393,0.7524999439716339

SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com in an interview to CNBC-TV18 spoke on the sales number by auto companies. He said the sales numbers by Ashok Leyland were disappointing, while he sees more upside for SML Isuzu.

He also shared his views on Amtek Auto, Asian Paints, Adani Ports, the cement stocks and tractor manufacturers.

Below is the verbatim transcript of SP Tulsian's interview with Anuj Singhal and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18. Anuj: First a word on Ashok Leyland and the fact that it’s down 5 percent today, of course, a remarkably strong stock, but your first thoughts on the monthly sales number and the market’s reaction? A: If you see the company has posted the average monthly sales, I am referring the last quarter that is first quarter of 2016 or fourth quarter of FY16 they have posted a monthly sales average of about 14,000 vehicles per month. We have seen the disappointment in the month of April where the sales were at about 11,000, but this time sales having come below 10,000 is definitely a cause of concern because company has been on an upward trajectory and people have taken that 12,000-13,000 run rate of monthly sales is going to maintain by the company and that will give them a very big operating leverage, because of the high fixed cost and all sort of things, but yes monthly sales now slipping below 10,000 will be seen a disappointment, because this has happened continuously for two months for month of April it fell by about 3,000 vehicles on an average and now down by further 1,000 will be seen quite disappointment.

Sonia: Your other favourite SML Isuzu has done very well this month yet again. It is in the same space, ballpark, and the numbers are looking quite good. Would you buy this stock at this price or do you think it has run up a lot? A: These are excellent numbers are if you see these are the highest monthly sales posted by SML Isuzu and I wish to draw we discussed this in the morning when I said that I am expecting the sales numbers of SML Isuzu to come very good. If you see 1,400 were the numbers for the month of April and in fact sometimes when you analyse the numbers of SML Isuzu with Force Motors you feel that probably the share of Force Motors is eaten away by SML Isuzu and 1,900 vehicle sales in the month of May makes a total sales of above 3,300. Now if you see for March quarter they had a sales of about 3,500 vehicles for three months and already in two months they have achieved a sales of about 3,350. If I go by year-on-year (Y-o-Y) also always Q1 is the best number for the company on the monthly sales as well as on the financial performance. If I am again expecting similar kind of run I am not expecting 1,900 vehicles for month of June but definitely it is likely to be anywhere between 1,300 to 1,500. So, if you get to see the sales figure of about 4,800 the Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of the company will be seen at Rs 25 plus and that will be received very well by the market because people will now start taking a call on the profitability of the company from here on and that will be seen very positive with EPS of Rs 25.

So, I am expecting that probably we have a very good upside from here on because now the monthly sales number of June and then thereafter a call on Q1 numbers which as I said are going to be an excellent numbers with EPS expected to be of about Rs 24-25 for Q1.

Sonia: You heard what the Amtek Auto management had to say. Between last quarter and now there has been no progress on the deal closure although they are promising that things will take place within the next four to six weeks. You had recommended the stock a while back. Would you still keep the faith here? A: You are right and actually I recommended the stock and post that the stock has risen by about 50 percent and way above my target given about six months back. But If you really take a call on the management they are just repeating the same thing, debt of Rs 15,000 crore, monetisation of Tekfor, identifying the promoter, identifying the buyer, monetising the other assets also in India and abroad, expected to realise about Rs 7,000 crore. Earlier they were talking about Rs 10,000 but in today's commentary they said about two third of the debt will get reduced in next two to three years. That means they are talking of the debt coming down to Rs 4,000 crore but market has stopped believing the management and unless and until we see some concrete steps because if you recall alone Tekfor can see the debt reducing by about Rs 4,000-5,000 crore for the group because this Rs 14,800 crore debt stated by the management is a consolidated debt and in fact three or four companies all are victim of that.

Whether you include Castex Technology, Metalyst Forging, Amtek Auto or JMT Auto. JMT Auto is not as vulnerable as the other three companies are. So, yes, if these things will happen market will definitely be taking that with both the hands because it is a very good auto ancillary company though again management has posted cautious view on India but these companies, the Amtek Group has a very strong presence abroad. Maybe like you can call it as a mini Motherson Sumi kind of things but the debt burden, the results which we have seen of all these four companies for this March quarter was really horrible, the kind of exceptional and all that. So, yes, quick actions has to be taken and I wish that management stick to their commitment because management stick to their commitment because last time also four to six months back they were very categorical in saying that the debt monetisation will happen in next three to four months but nothing has happened and I recall at that time they had given an indication of Rs 7,000-8,000 crore mobilisation in next one year. We have already seen 6-7 months having elapsed. So, let us hope that this time deal happens in next 6-8 weeks and they are able to mobilise about Rs 4,000-5,000 crore and if that happens there will be a vast rerating of the stock because the company is backed by the asset. It is not like a case of JP Associate Group where the deterioration or asset valuations have fallen. They can recover this money, they have huge investments in India also. So, let us hope the management sticks to their plan of mobilising at least Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in next six to eight weeks for Tekfor. Anuj: The other stock that we have to discuss now is Asian Paints. Of course we discussed it a week back and from that point actually got even more expensive. Do you get a sense that it is time to just retreat from here and wait for correction before making fresh entry? A: That is right and in fact couple of days back only I have said that Rs 1,000 looks the March more valuations and you can call it as fully priced because probably now the momentum or the trading grip that is making the stocks to move up. Once you see the Q1 numbers definitely going to be disappointing I don't think that the same kind of growth can be maintained by the company. Yes, Q2 and Q3 will be a different story but market will not wait for four or five months to see that Q2 numbers. So, the stock has to take some profit booking and may have to correct to a level of Rs 970-975 and I won't be surprised to see that happening in this June series only. I am not saying that this stock will collapse, maybe everyday this stock is forming the higher bottom but the next support maybe seen at Rs 970-975 once that correction even takes place which is expected in this series and on a fundamental basis I won't give a buy call on this stock now. Anuj: A word on Adani Ports. That has been a phenomenal stock. I remember it used to be one of your big calls. You were bullish on Adani Ports. At Rs 202 how is the stock stacked up? A: That is right. In fact maybe when the stock was ruling at around Rs 230-240 and then when it went up to level of Rs 290-300 and during that time the buy call was given and even at the current rate of maybe once the stock corrected to the level of Rs 225 we again started giving a buy call and we continue to have a positive view because if you go by the financial performance and the growth trajectory which the company is posting expanding on both east and west coast those are since quite good but actually it is very unfortunate that in this last four or five months since its inclusion in the Nifty and Sensex this stock has been correcting since then.

Generally it is always the other way. When the stock is included in the main indices it always goes up. Then maybe with Q4 numbers once they are declared some kind of inter-corporate or maybe the group transfer of the money was raised as a concern by the market and that has made the stock to correct. But yes, at the current stage if someone has the courage to buy the stock with one year view I won't be surprised to see with a gain of about Rs 30-35 percent from the current levels. That means a target of about Rs 270-275.

Anuj: Any call on cement? Of course, you have had your favourites in the past but, ACC and Ambuja at current prices. Would you buy them? A: Ambuja, in fact has not participated in the cement rally to the extent which was warranted from that company, number one. Number two, ACC I see a lot of efficiency improvement to be seen in the performance of the company, maybe in terms of the margin expansion and all that. So, both the stocks from that point of view looks good because if you take a frontline stock like Shree Cements, UltraTech Cement or maybe Ramco Cements, because they are all 25 million plus category cement companies and Ambuja and ACC also, have the same kind of capacity of 30 million tonnes, So if you place them, probably both of them are looking quite cheap as compared to other three stocks which I mentioned. Sonia: The tractor sales for the month of May have looked very good. Mahindra and Mahindra tractor sales up 20 percent, Escorts tractor sales in double digit growth and we have some of these smaller companies like Swaraj Engines which have in any case been in the news on the upside. What would your pick of the pack be? A: You are right and actually we have discussed again that in the morning that M&M is going to perform or going to post very good numbers on the tractor front and rightly so they have posted a sales of 23,000 vehicles, 23,000 plus and actually I expect the same momentum to continue for June also because April, May and June or maybe May and June are always the best. Even coming on Escorts, the tractor number sales of about 5,000 plus, but if you take a call on the Swaraj Engines, they are reaching to their capacity utilisation to the full level. They are supplying closer to about 70,000 engines, if I am not mistaken. They have not been, because you may take a positive view on a quarterly results, but if you take a Y-o-Y result, I do not think that there is any kind of upside we have seen in the performance of Swaraj Engine. The stock has become quite expensive but yes, amongst the auto space, we have discussed a while back that SML Isuzu probably looks the best and then followed by maybe M&M. Even I will remain away from Escorts also because one has to see the valuation and also on those parameters, it is not seem to be too comforting.",2104,0.0

Today’s planetary position: Moon will be transiting in Sagittarius. Jupiter & Lord Rahu in Leo. Mars & Lord Saturn in Scorpio. Sun & Venus in Taurus, Mercury in Aries. Ketu in Aquarius. Pluto in Sagittarius. Neptune in Aquarius & Uranus in Pisces.

Rahu Kal Time: - 12:00 – 13:30

Planet Mercury, which controls our mind (Buddhi) is transiting in Aries and will be in retrograde position from 28 April 2016 to 22 May 2016. Be cautious, as one is likely to take wrong decisions, resulting in financial losses, depending on its position in individual horoscope. Technical analysts/researchers can be worst affected (since planet Mercury is significator of this profession). Persons with Aries, Gemini, Virgo, Libra/ascendant need to be extra vigilant.

Following sectors will be receiving astrological support:

Cement: ACC, Ambuja Cements, UltraTech Cement, Prism Cement, Birla Corp, JK Lakshmi Cement, etc.

Every year with commencement on new Samvat (Hindu New Year), astrologically, based on planetary position, certain new sectors start getting astrological support & outperform, while others remain laggards.

During last Samavat 2071 among other sectors, food processing & leather sectors received strong astrological support & outperformed.

Always be very cautious, when some main planets i.e. Rahu, Ketu, Jupiter & Lord Saturn are changing their houses. It may be that certain sectors which were continuously getting support for long time may stop receiving support due to change in position by above planets & stocks of those sectors starts coming down, resulting in losses. This is common reason, why most people loss money.

One should trade only in the stocks of that sectors which are getting very strong astrologically support.

Sectors which get very strong astrological support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

Moneycontrol BureauBrokerage house Goldman Sachs says it is “structurally” positive on the medium-term demand/supply outlook for cement. It expects a 9 percent compounded growth in demand, led by the government’s focus on infrastructure and “housing for all” by 2022.“A significantly higher allocation in the FY17 Budget towards rural spending should address the issue of weak rural housing demand, which has been a key overhang for the last 12 months, in our view,” says the Goldman Sachs note, adding it expects limited capacity additions (2 percent compounded annually) as land acquisition remains a key bottleneck.Goldman is bullish on Grasim with a 12-month price target of Rs 5050.“It is trading at a 43% discount to FY18 (estimated) net asset value, which we view as unjustified on our expectations of a pickup in its key businesses (cement/ VSF),” says the Goldman note.Among pure cement plays, the brokerage also likes UltraTech Cement, citing capacity leadership, earnings growth and ability to grow inorganically.

Following the significant rise in deal activity in April, M&A deal value for the first four months of the year amounted to USD 12.57 billion, registering a jump of 49 percent over the January-April 2015.

The overall M&A market witnessed a significant upsurge this month with a USD 2 billion transaction and two deals worth over USD 100 million, Grant Thornton India said.

Domestic M&A deals saw a steep hike, predominantly on account of Ultratech Cement's USD 2.4 billion acquisition of Jaiprakash Associate's cement business.

Moreover, domestic transactions doubled as compared to the corresponding period last year and cross-border deals also grew at a steady 9 percent.

""The key growth has come from the domestic M&A activity, which contributed USD 3.3 billion to deal values. Both inbound and outbound deal flow has been nominal this month,"" Grant Thornton India LLP Partner Prashant Mehra said.

Growth in values, despite volumes remaining fairly stagnant, reflect a significant increase in high-value deals (above USD 100 million) with 26 such deals in M&A and PE, together contributing to more than 70 per cent of total deal values so far this year.

Outbound deal values grew about three times the value as compared to last year, while inbound deals have been muted during January-April, falling by about 24 percent.

Sectorwise, manufacturing led the deal activity in April, contributing around 66 per cent of total deal value. The month witnessed its largest deal this year Ultra Tech Cement's acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates.

In terms of number of deals, e-commerce, topped the deal table. With increasing consolidation in the E-commerce space, start ups attracted M&A deal volumes constituting 23 percent of total deal volumes.

The month also witnessed some big ticket deals in sectors like telecom and IT&ITES, Grant Thornton said.",323,0.7640414386987686

Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in India jumped 5.2 per cent to USD 8.2 billion in the first quarter this year, says a Mergermarket report.

According to the global deal tracking firm, amid challenging global macro-economic environment and slowing pace of M&A activity in Asia-Pacific compared to 2015, India still gained a 5.2 per cent, over the same period last year, in terms of deal value.

Sector-wise, construction became the most active target sector in India, with the top two transactions in this sector amounted to USD 3.1 billion.

The largest transaction targeting India's cement sector was UltraTech Cement's acquisition of the cement business from Jaiprakash Associates for USD 2.4 billion.

According to Mergermarket, the cement sector will remain hot for M&A transactions led by buy-side interest, ranging from foreign private equity players like KKR and Blackstone, to homegrown corporates.

Transportation was another sector attracting increased interest with 11 announcements worth USD 732 million.

According to the report, India's FDI policy was reformed in the second half of last year, allowing 49 per cent above overseas investment within aspects of the railway industry, which could lead to a future boost in the financing of railway development projects.

The energy, mining and utilities sector saw just six transactions in the first quarter of the year. However, the proposal to double clean energy cess on coal by the government in February this year is expected to accelerate the shift from traditional oil & gas towards renewable energy and thus drive a new wave of M&A transactions.

Meanwhile, the traditionally popular sectors including Pharma, Medical & Biotech and Industrials & Chemicals were under-performing compared to the first quarter of 2015.

""In line with the government's vision to attract more and larger infrastructure investments to 100 smart cities across India, as well as increasing the connectivity between cities and towns, there is an expectation for more prominent M&A activity in the infrastructure-oriented sectors during the coming months,"" the report said.",335,0.6408363083998362

Moneycontrol BureauBritannia Industries has become the latest casualty of fraudulent practices at its share registrar, Sharepro Services. The fast moving consumer goods major is the third company to be hit after Asian Paints and Aptech.On Friday, Britannia informed the stock exchanges that it was terminating its agreement with Sharepro following “certain irregularities at Sharepro with respect to share related operations and dividend encashment activities.” the company has also filed a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW).And while the company did not give any further details, moneycontrol.com has learnt from a source that the value of shares and dividends illegally transferred from the accounts of bonafide shareholders to those of some Sharepro employees is around Rs 18-20 crore. The figure could not be independently confirmed with Britannia. The source said that Britannia had got consultancy firm EY to do a forensic audit of its shareholder list.In response to an e-mail questionnaire, EY said: ""As per our company policy, we cannot comment on specific companies.""Britannia did not respond to the e-mail on the issue sent to the agency handling its corporate communications.Sharepro is a SEBI registered Category I registrar to public issues and share transfer agent, and has been in the share registry business for over two decades.The Sharepro website claims Larsen & Toubro Finance Holdings, Bajaj Hindusthan, Hexaware, Ultratech Cement, Dena Bank, Bank of India, Zee, Godfrey Phillips, Mahindra Lifespaces, Abbot India, Clariant, Novartis, BASF, Balmer & Lawrie and Bombay Dyeing among its main clients.Strangely, there has been no action from the Securities and Exchange Board of India so far. Last week, Aptech had filed a criminal complaint against Sharepro alleging fraudulent transfer of shares. A week before that, Asian Paints had terminated its agreement with Sharepro, and sought the arrest of Sharepro's Managing Director GR Rao and Operations Head Indira Karkera for illegal transfer of the dividend and shares of some shareholders.In the First Information Report filed by Asian Paints at the Saki Naka police station, Asian Paints alleged that the shares of some shareholders were transferred to the accounts of Sharepro employees by forging documents and opening fake demat accounts, bank accounts and trading accounts. The value of the shares and dividends were just under Rs 2 crore.Sources said SEBI had asked Asian Paints to look into the matter after an anonymous letter tipping the regulator about the irregularities at Sharepro.",403,0.0

ICICIDirect's research report on UltratechcementUltraTech Cement (UltraTech) has entered into a binding MoU for acquisition of 22.4 MT cement assets of Jaiprakash Associates (Jaypee). This move will increase its capacity by 33% to 90.7 MT (from the current 68.3 MT), making it the largest cement player in the domestic market (fourth largest player globally) with a market share of over 22%. The assets to be acquired include 22.4 MT cement capacity along with 325 MW captive power plant for |16,970 crore, which works out to US$110/tonne. However, if we consider a US$100-110/tonne valuation for 6 MT plant in south operating at 55% utilisation (due to overcapacity in the region) and | 470 crore for 4 MT under construction grinding unit, the valuation for remaining assets works out to US$140-145/tonne, which, we believe is fairly valued and in line with current replacement cost. The transaction is subject to various regulatory approvals and amendments in MMDR regulations resulting in a gestation period of 12- 15 months. The deal will be positive for the company considering synergy benefits, access to newer markets and reasonable valuation. Hence, we remain positive on the company and maintain our BUY recommendation.

The acquisition is likely to increase UltraTech’s cement capacity to 92.3mtpa and place it in the top five global cement players’ league. The deal is synergistic for UltraTech in terms of entering newer markets, logistics benefits, working capital management and consolidating its leadership position in India. We have not factored in any revision in estimates from the proposed acquisition as it will have to go through corporate and regulatory approvals. UltraTech remains our preferred pick in the sector due to its leadership position and healthy balance sheet. Currently, the stock is trading at an EV/EBITDA and EV/tonne of 11.1x and $173 respectively of its FY2018E earnings.

Should the deal close in FY18, our EPS forecast for that year would reduce by only 4-5% due to lower EBITDA/t for JPA plants. Maintain BUY.UTCEM’s D/E ratio post deal closure would move to 0.6x from 0.1x currently which is reasonable. Further, factoring in lower EBITDA/t for JPA plants (900 vs. 1250 for UTECM), we could expect an EPS cut of 4-5% in FY18 for UTCEM. For now, we would await further regulatory progress before factoring the deal into our estimates. UTCEM remains our top pick in the sector and we believe this deal is a long-term positive for the stock.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Edelweiss's research report on UltraTech CementUltraTech Cement (UTCL), India’s largest cement company, is set to acquire JP Associates’ (JPA) 22.4mtpa cement assets at an attractive EV/t of USD111 versus USD110‐120/t current replacement cost. Effective valuation could potentially turn sweeter adjusted to accumulated losses (exact details of which are not yet known). We are positive on the transaction, as besides the lucrative EV/t, increase in UTCL’s market share (from 17% to 21%), entry in new markets, benefits of potential freight synergies and inheritance of certain fiscal benefits render it a value deal over the long run. In the short‐run, however, the deal is estimated to be earnings dilutive by ~10% for FY18E (assuming full year of operations), while debt equity ratio will rise to ~1.1x versus current 0.4x. We continue to value UTCL at 11x FY18E EV/EBITDA and assuming acquisition benefits our TP is revised up to INR3,195 (INR3,131 earlier). Maintain ‘BUY’. In our view, near‐term concerns of earnings dilution and balance sheet stress will be outweighed by long‐term positives of strengthening market share and potential freight and other operational synergies. We maintain ‘BUY/SO’ with revised target price of INR3,195. On existing operations, UTCL currently trades at ~9x FY18E EV/EBITTDA.

UltraTech Cement's Rs 17,000 crore proposed acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates's cement plants is expected to be completed by June 2017, a top official from the Aditya Birla Group's flagship firm has said.

UltraTech had announced the acquisition of debt-ridden JP Group's cement plants for nearly Rs 17,000 crore (about USD 2.5 billion) few days back, making it the biggest deal in the sector, which will also place India's largest cement maker in the top five global producers upon completion of the deal.

""We have to ink definitive agreements and get permission from the High Courts. This will take time. The firm expects the agreement to be finalised in the next 12-15 months. Expect it to consummate by June 2017,"" UltraTech Cement Chief Financial Officer Atul Daga said in a concall with analysts.

UltraTech is also looking at alternative routes in case the proposed amendments in Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act does not happen, Dada told analysts yesterday.

Last month, government took views from public, states and industry on amending the MMDR Act to include provisions allowing transfer of captive mines granted through procedures other than auction.

Mines Ministry has prepared the draft Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) (Amendment) Bill, 2016 to amend Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.

As part of consultations, government invited suggestions from public, state governments, mining industry and entities concerned, on the draft bill. The last date for sending comments and suggestions was January 26.

The transfer of captive mining leases, granted otherwise than through auction, would facilitate banks and financial institutions to liquidate stressed assets where a company or its captive mining lease is mortgaged.

The move will allow M&As worth billions of dollars in the domestic market, especially in the cement sector where several such deals are stuck.

UltraTech Cement had said it has entered into a binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with JAL for the acquisition of its identified cement plants having a total cement capacity of 22.4 MTPA (million tons per annum).

These plants are situated in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

Under the deal, the cement plants have been valued at Rs 16,500 crore. Besides, the deal also includes a 4 MTPA plant under implementation at a cost of Rs 470 crore.

Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, the firm's cement capacity will rise to 90.7 MTPA from the current 68.3.

The plants will give UltraTech access to newer markets of Satna, UP East, Himachal Pradesh and Coastal Andhra where it does not have a presence as of now.

UltraTech said the deal will aid the firm as the cement industry is expected to recover from the slump and the demand is likely to rebound to 7.5 percent on the back of improving infrastructure spending and urbanisation.",477,0.8196141421794891

Moneycontrol Bureau

Shares of UltraTech Cement rallied 2 percent on Monday after the Aditya Birla Group firm acquired debt-ridden Jaiprakash Group's cement plants for Rs 16,500 crore (about USD 2.5 billion). Jaiprakash Associates' shares also surged nearly 8 percent intraday today.

UltraTech Cement said it entered into a binding Memorandum of Understanding with Jaiprakash Associates for the acquisition of its identified cement plants having total cement capacity of 22.4 MTPA (million tons per annum) situated in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

This includes a 4 MTPA plant under implementation at a cost of Rs 470 crore, UltraTech said in a statement.

UltraTech said the assets will give it access to the newer markets of Satna, UP East, Himachal Pradesh and Coastal Andhra where it does not have a presence as of now.

""Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, the company's cement capacity will stand augmented to 90.7 MTPA (current 68.3 MTPA),"" it added.

The two groups have agreed to an enterprise value of Rs 16,500 crore for the deal, which is subject to definitive agreements and necessary regulatory approvals, the statement added.

It was not clear whether the deal includes the two cement plants of JP group whose purchase was called off last week by UltraTech on account of lack of necessary approvals.

UltraTech had said on Friday it was calling off that deal with Jaiprakash Associates, which has been selling its cement and power assets to pare debt and improve balance sheet.

In December 2014, UltraTech had said it will acquire JAL's Bela unit (Madhya Pradesh), which has 2.1 MTPA clinker and 2.6 MTPA cement grinding capacity.

The other unit, located at Sidhi also in Madhya Pradesh, has 3.1 MTPA clinker and 2.3 MTPA cement grinding capacity. Both units have a total of 180 MW power generation capacity.

Brokerages say this deal is positive for UltraTech but there may be regulatory hurdles.

While maintaining underperform on UltraTech, Macquarie believes it will not be an easy deal to get regulatory approval given very high market share of Ultratech in North India.

According to JP Morgan, transaction will be earnings dilutive in the initial years due to interest payout on assumed debt.

""This is the largest M&A deal in India’s cement industry. This deal is positive for UltraTech as it yields enormous scale to the company (90MT) and provides access to missing markets in its geographic footprint in one single transaction and at a fairly good price (enterprise value per tonne of Rs 7500 at a discount to recent transactions),"" the brokerage said said.

More importantly, strategically this acquisition makes sense given challenges in setting up greenfield plants (land, limestone availability issues) and regulatory issues (MMDRA) in closing asset sale transactions, JP Morgan believes. It is overweight on the stock.

At 09:22 hours IST, the scrip of UltraTech Cement was quoting at Rs 2,830.90, up Rs 55.45, or 2 percent and Jaiprakash Associates rose 3.6 percent to Rs 6.97 on the BSE.(With inputs from PTI)",510,0.44140414680753437

Ashwani Gujral of ashwanigujral.com told CNBC-TV18, ""UltraTech Cement has made a base around Rs 2,600-2,900 zone. It is now coming out of that zone, so this is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 2,900 for target of Rs 3,020. The stock has done extremely well through this decline from 9,000 to 7,000. You would recall that it was about Rs 3,000 when the index was at 9,000.""""Biocon did very well previously and then it had a sharp correction. Now, that correction seems to be getting over. So, Biocon is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 465 for target of Rs 490. Today, Aurobindo Pharma should do well. Biocon generally tends to participate with it, so it should move up for the day,"" he said. ""PSU banks kind of floundered yesterday and today maybe because of Punjab National Bank (PNB) there will be some pressure. However, basically Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) has not participated at all in this rally and that is a sign of weakness, something which starts drifting sideways instead of moving up. So, OBC is a sell with a stop loss of Rs 86 for target of Rs 72."" ""Engineers India Limited (EIL) has not really been able to move above Rs 150. So, this is a sell with a stop loss of Rs 155 for target of Rs 142."" ""Since Punjab National Bank (PNB) is also sitting on some gains, I think PSU bank index is already reached its 20-DMA and from there I think the PSU bank index could see more weakness than the private banks."" ""CESC is starting to make sort of a base and kind of Budget related. So, this is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 440, look for targets of Rs 475,"" he added. ""Yesterday there was a sell call in NTPC in late afternoon and anything that goes in for these follow on offers, generally tends to perform badly post it. Yesterday, NTPC has fallen from its 200-DMA. So, chances are that we will see the stock closer to Rs 115-120 in days to come.""""Bharti Airtel is already up for several days in a row. I don’t think it is showing great amount of traction plus I think Budget sensitive stocks will do much better than your average stocks. So, maybe today I would go for Aurobindo Pharma, not that it is Budget sensitive, but given that it is coming out of correction and has positive news. Bharti Airtel is probably coming to the end of its rally, getting closer to Rs 345-350."" ""The order flow news should be used to sell into BHEL. It can go up for a couple of days but that could not I think change the trend. So, just be alert and whenever it shows weakness. I think closer to maybe Rs 108-110, those are places you would like to re-sell into BHEL."" ""Lupin had that large move from Rs 1,600 to Rs 1,800; that move has corrected and now the stock is again kind of pushing on the upside. So, Lupin and Sun Pharma are stocks that you would buy into. Aurobindo Pharma has corrected quite a bit, so, midcap pharmaceutical is now finding some support. So, for the day, Aurobindo Pharma looks extremely good. Overall, whenever the market bottoms out and starts moving up, I think pharmaceutical will again take the lead on the upside. Most of these stocks have corrected. So, basically people can re-enter into large and midcap pharmaceutical stocks.""""Bajaj Auto and Eicher Motors are outperforming but if I have to choose, I think Eicher Motors is the better stock. I think it has put in a firm bottom around Rs 15,000 and at some point we will get back towards previous highs."" ""Bajaj Auto is more kind of a ranging stock, so either it is between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,500 or between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,000. So, possibly it is heading for a rally towards Rs 2,650. You should use today’s decline to buy but overall I think Eicher is the better stock."" ""All of these inclusions are now trading at the lows of the day. So, there is no immediate follow through on Tata Motors DVR. ""I like BF Utilities. It is now at Rs 540, so on declines I think it should be bought. I don't know if it is a Budget move but clearly the stock seems to have made a bottom. So, keep a stop loss say around Rs 500 and I think in a decent market, we will see probably levels upwards of Rs 600."" ""I think Aurobindo Pharma can be bought with a stop loss at about Rs 660 with a target of Rs 685 but Just Dial can be sold with a stop loss of Rs 565 with a target of Rs 520 and Mindtree can be sold with a stop loss of Rs 1,440 and target of Rs 1,380.""",835,0.0

Grasim Industries' third quarter standalone profit is expected to increase 86 percent year-on-year to Rs 174 crore and revenue is seen rising 21 percent to Rs 1,880 crore, according to analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Topline may be aided by higher viscose staple fibre (VSF) volumes & realisations. VSF volumes may grow on the back of commissioning of the new capacity at Vilayat plant.

Operating profit in Q3 may increase 55 percent to Rs 281 crore and margin may expand 330 basis points to 14.9 percent compared to corresponding quarter of last fiscal.

Margin may get supported VSF margin (that may rise with some respite in pulp cost), VSF realisations improvement, improved performance of Epoxy, sustenance of steady performance in chemicals business and benefit of merger with Aditya Birla Chemicals.

As far as consolidated numbers are concerned, majority of consolidated earnings are already in via UltraTech Cement. Grasim holds 60.3 percent stake in UltraTech that contributes roughly 70 percent to topline & bottomline of consolidated Grasim numbers.",176,0.9999999105930328

The Supreme Court has held that the Rajasthan government will take back possession of a mine from Gotan Limestone Khanji Udyog Pvt Ltd (GLKUPL), which was transferred to cement major Ultra Tech, saying that competent authority was ""misled"" by concealing the real transaction.The apex court set aside the order of the Rajasthan High Court which had dismissed the state government's plea to restore to it the possession of a mine, located in 10 sq km area near Gotan town in Nagaur district, the lease of which was transferred in contravention of rules to Ultra Tech Cement Ltd (UTCL), also known as Ultra Tech.It also directed the Rajasthan government to frame and notify its policy with regard to transfer of mining lease within one month and said, ""Till such a decision is taken, status quo may be maintained.""Holding that the Rajasthan government rightly exercised its power to cancel the lease transferred in violation of rules, a bench of Justices A R Dave and A K Goel said, ""In the present case, it was not a case of mere transfer of shareholding or change of Directors or even a routine merger, but use of device to unauthorisedly acquire mining lease by misleading the competent authority by concealing the real transaction.""Real transaction is of impermissible sale of the lease which was the only asset of the company. If true facts that lease was to be sold were disclosed, power to permit transfer of lease may not have been exercised. Lease could not be transferred to make profit. Thus, the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil should be invoked,"" the bench said.""The public power of permitting transfer of lease could not be used to benefit a private operator, who sells its rights in natural resources given to it by the State, in violation of law,"" the bench said.The state's Mines Department on December 16, 2014 had cancelled the mining lease granted in favour of GLKUPL, which was set aside by the single judge bench of the high court on March 25, 2015.The Rajasthan government's appeal against the single judge order was also dismissed on May 14, 2015, by a division bench which said there was no contravention of the 1986 rules in the transfer of the lease of the mine in question.The bench noted the contention of the state government that Ultra Tech cement has purchased the mine from GLKUPL, the shareholders of which were four brothers, who were booked by Anti-Corruption Bureau in August 2014 for the lease transfer.Further, along with the state government, rival cement major J K Cements Ltd had also contended that the high court had failed to take note of the fact that Gotan Limestone had not even ""come into existence when it asked for or made an application seeking transfer of the lease"".It was contended that the same by no stretch of imagination can be termed as legal as at relevant time Gotan Pvt Ltd was not a legal entity and hence had no existence in the eyes of law.Noting that minerals vest in the State and it has to exercise its power as per doctrine of public trust, the apex court said, ""In the present case, this principle (of corporate veil') clearly applies as transfer of shares to cover up real transaction which is sale of mining lease for consideration without the previous consent of competent authority, as statutorily required.""The statutory requirement is sought to be overcome with the plea that it was a transaction merely of transfer of shareholding when on the face of it the transaction is clearly that of sale of the mining lease. In view of the above, the view taken by the high court cannot be sustained,"" it said.The bench said, ""It was clear that formation of GLKUPL itself was a device for transfer of mining lease from GLKUPL to UTCL for monetary consideration without disclosing the real transaction to the competent authority.""It said a lessee privately and unauthorisedly cannot sell its rights for consideration and profiteer from rights which belong to State.""Once it is held that transfer of lease is not permissible without permission of the competent authority, the competent authority was entitled to have full disclosure of facts for taking a decision in the matter so that a private person does not benefit at the expense of public property.""The original lessee did not disclose that the real purpose was not merely to change its partnership business into a private limited company as claimed but to privately transfer the lease by sale to a third party. This aspect has also escaped the attention of the high court,"" the bench said.The court held that sale of shareholding by GLKUPL to Ultra Tech was a private ""unauthorized"" sale of mining lease which being in violation of rules is ""void"".""GLKUPL has been formed merely as a device to avoid the legal requirement for transfer of mining lease and to facilitate private benefit to the parties to the transaction, to the detriment of the public,"" the bench said.",843,0.0

ICICIDirect's research report on Ultratech Cement

Standalone revenues increased 4.7% YoY (up 2.3% QoQ) to Rs 5,747.3 crore (vs. I-direct estimate: Rs 5,665.4 crore) due to 7.1% YoY growth in volumes to 11.60 MT (vs. I-direct estimate of 11.40 MT) led by capacity expansion. Realisation declined 2.2% YoY to Rs 4,955 (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 4,953) due to pricing pressure across regions EBITDA/tonne increased 15.2% YoY in Q3FY16 to Rs 900/tonne (vs. Idirect estimate: Rs 833/tonne) due to a decline in power & fuel costs as there was an increase in pet coke consumption (from 51% to 74% YoY in fuel mix). RM cost during the quarter increased due to DMF levy The management expects amendment to the MMRD Act to get passed in the upcoming Budget session. It expects consolidation of acquired Madhya Pradesh units of Jaiprakash Associates by Q1FY17 end

With the government’s focus on infrastructure and a gradual revival in housing demand led by stable housing prices and the Seventh Pay Commission, cement demand is expected to improve, going forward. We assign premium valuations multiple to UltraTech vs. its peer companies due to industry-leading growth (on the back of consistent capacity additions), higher margins and healthy cash flows. Hence, we continue to maintain our positive view on the stock with a BUY recommendation and a target price of Rs 3,600/share (i.e. at 20.0x FY17E EV/EBITDA and EV/tonne of $225/tonne).

Emkay's research report on Ultratech Cement Benefitting from decline in energy costs, the company reported marginally better than estimated EBITDA of Rs 10.4bn (up 23.4% yoy) against our estimates of Rs 10.2bn and EBITDA/tn of Rs 904 (up 17.4% yoy) vs. estimated Rs 857/tn. Lower cement prices during the quarter led to lower than estimated Revenue of Rs 57.5bn (vs. est. Rs 59.9bn) Sales volume of Cement and Clinker was up 5.1% yoy to 11.55mt (est. 11.86mt), blended realisation was marginally down by 0.4% yoy to Rs 4,978/t (est. Rs 5,047/t). Grey cement realization was down 4.3% qoq (but, up 1.2% yoy) to Rs 4,121/tn Operating cost/tn declined 3.7% yoy led by 15.7% yoy decline in energy cost on account of decline in pet-coke price (down 18% yoy, 29% qoq), higher usage of pet coke (74% vs. 51%/65% in Q3FY15/Q2FY16) and WHRS (5% share in total power mix vs. 1% last year). OPM improved 276bps yoy to 18.2% (est. 17.0%) We have revised EPS estimates downwards by 5.7%/8.6%/2.8% for FY16e/FY17e/FY18e to factor in subdued pricing scenario. Recent correction in the stock price factors in the near-term concerns in our view and hence, we upgrade our rating on the stock to Buy from Accumulate with a price target of Rs 3,281 (earlier: Rs 3,421) Though, cement prices are subdued in the North and Central regions, we believe that declining fuel prices would negate the impact of lower cement prices to a large extent. We remain positive on long-term prospects of the company as it is expected to benefit from organic and inorganic capacity additions. It is best placed to benefit from improvement in demand, with under-utilized capacities in Gujarat (acquired plant of JCCL) and capacity expansions over the last one year, which may help it to generate superior profits in an upcycle. Considering long term prospects and recent correction in stock prices (EV/EBITDA of 12.9x/8.9x for FY17e/FY18e), we upgrade our rating on the stock to Buy from Accumulate with a PT of Rs 3,281 (earlier: Rs 3,421).For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Sharekhan's research report on Ultratech CementFor Q3FY2016, UltraTech Cement (UltraTech) reported a revenue growth of 4.7% YoY to Rs 5,747.3 crore on account of lower base (Q3FY2015 was hit by lowest volume) while weak cement price affected blended realisation (down 2.3% YoY). The savings through lower power and fuel cost (decline in pet coke price and usage of low cost fuel) helped UltraTech to improve its blended EBITDA per tonne (up 15.2% YoY to Rs 900 per tonne). Further, lower interest expense and lower tax rate led to the adjusted net income growth of 39.6% YoY. We have lowered our estimates for FY2017 on account of above reasons. We have also introduced FY2018 earnings estimates in this note. On the valuation front, the stock has corrected recently factoring delayed recovery in demand and recent cement price correction (December price cuts MoM). Consequently, we have revised our price target downwards to Rs 3,580. However, we have maintained our Buy rating on the stock on account of UltraTech’s strong balance sheet and pan-India presence.

Moneycontrol Bureau

After China debacle, brace up for another monster waiting to gulp down few more moolahs in domestic market. Most analysts feel October-December quarter results are likely to show tepid recovery and earnings recession will continue. Sentiment is already at a low, unable to withstand Chinese, Indian market sinking to 52-week low in the beginning of 2016 itself. Last week, the Sensex tumbled 4.7 percent and the Nifty crashed 4.5 percent following geo-political tensions, China fears, and multi-year low by crude oil prices.

How bad will be third quarter of FY16?

Crisil thinks Q3 will be sixth consecutive quarter of single-digit topline growth. It expects Q3 revenue growth to be tepid at 2 percent and sees a 60-70 basis points (bps) decline in the overall EBITDA margins.

Ambit has cut FY16-end Sensex target to 26500 and set FY17-end Sensex target to 29,000 based on single digit earnings growth for FY16 and FY17 amid a 6.8 percent GDP growth in FY17.

In Q3, companies under Antique's coverage universe, including oil and gas, are likely to post a revenue decline of 5.8 percent year-on-year. It expects topline to contract yet again (5.8 percent down Y-o-Y), with weakness across most sectors. However, margin growth is once again expected to pick up slack with a whooping 200 basis points (bps) EBITDA margin gain, driven largely by oil and gas.

Antique’s 12 months Sensex target of 30800 and warns that earnings downgrades to continue while FY17 outlook will hold key for the market. “We also believe that at the macro level, reforms in sectors which do not require a legislative framework have witnessed a decent traction and will continue to support growth,” it says in a report.

All is not that bad!

Edelweiss says that revenue and profit may remain flattish but EBITDA margins may improve over the past three quarters. The brokerage feels that consumer discretionary and private banks are likely to drive earnings in December quarter.

“Excluding commodities, top line and bottom line growth will be better at 7 percent and 9 percent YoY, respectively, higher than past four quarters’ run rate of 4‐5 percent. EBITDA margin of our coverage universe is estimated to improve 40‐50 bps Y-o-Y and Q-o Q predominantly led by domestic consumption, while export sector’s margins are likely to contract, “ it adds.

Good & bad sectors

Adding to woes will be Chennai floods which will impact earnings of consumer discretionary sectors , IT services, auto components and engineering while commodity prices are likely to hurt topline growth of steel, petrochemicals, and commodity chemical producers.

Crisil further warns that steel, housing, IT services and pharmaceuticals sectors are likely to see an overall decline. It expects IT revenue growth in the range of 10 percent and sees moderate 13 percent revenue growth in pharmaceuticals

According to Crisil, export-linked sectors to be the only bright spot in terms of topline growth and media, retail, & telecom sector to post healthy double-digit topline growth. It estimates EBITDA margin for the cement sector to improve by 200-220 bps and 50 bps improvement for automobile players.

Ambit has downgraded outlook for technology, capital goods and real estate dependent sectors. Auto is the only sector it has upgraded. Its largecap buys are ITC, HCL Tech, Coal India, Ashok Leyland and recommends selling UltraTech Cements, BHEL and Hindalco.

Antique also feel that margins are expected to expand by 200 bps annually with the largest increases being in oil and gas, although automobiles and industrials are also likely to post decent upticks.

“We expect banks especially PSU to post only a moderate growth, wherein regulatory directives such as the one to clean up the balance sheet will increase provisioning. Private banks are expected to maintain their healthy earnings trajectory. However, fresh slippages could surprise negatively,” Antique adds.

Antique's top picks are HDFC Bank, ONGC, Tata Motors, Ultratech Cement, Power Grid, YES Bank and Ashok Leyland among others.

Though, Edelweiss sees an uptick in growth, it feels commodities, auto exports (Tata Motors) and PSU banks are likely to clock a soft quarter with profits continuing to contract in teens. Domestic consumption, especially autos is likely to report strong EBITDA and profit growth due to superior margins. Private banks are likely to report decent growth in teens—mirror run rate of past 3‐4 quarters.

Currency war, crude volatility coupled with weak Asian markets and tepid December quarter are likely to keep market under lot of pressure. Vikas Khemani of Edelweiss Securities people are struck with panic and fear about future because of yuan devaluation and next 3-6 months will be volatile.

Vivek Gupta, CapitalVia Global Research says macroeconomic data, trend in global markets, investment by foreign institutional investors, movement of rupee against US dollar and movement of crude oil prices will dictate trend of the market in near term and also CPI, IIP data to be announced on January 12 and WPI data to be announced on January 14.Follow @NasrinzStory",831,-0.31129031255841255

Fight for survival continues in the cement sector as sluggish demand and slow growth are ailing the sector. Only saving grace is strong demand in East India due to higher spending by state governments. July-September earnings, too, were not anything to be cheerful about. Adding to the woes will be implementation of goods and service tax (GST) which is likely to become a reality in 2016.

V Lakshmikumaran, Managing Partner, Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan says, ""Service tax paid on the transportation cost if is not made available at the dealers’ level, all become cost of the cement production. Unless and until the rates of GST on cement is kept at the level of not more than 12 percent, it is going to have adverse impact as far as the infrastructure industry is concerned.""

Falling price

In North India, cement prices dipped to a four-month low as it fell in the range of Rs 40‐50 per bag in November and December due to intense competition and weak demand. Prabhudas Lilladher expects prices to further soften by Rs 5‐10 per bag in rest of the month due to year-end discounts and lean season for activity. Sequentially, realisations, the region’s average prices are expected to fall by Rs5 per bag, it adds.

According to the brokerage, prices are expected to fall by Rs 12 per bag in Andhra Pradesh quarter-on-quarter due to low prices in October. Prices in Karnataka fell by Rs 8 per bag Q-o-Q due to surge of material from AP while, prices in Tamil Nadu and Kerala remained stable Q-o-Q in December.

Prices in Maharashtra fell by an average of Rs 16 per bag (Q-o-Q) due to intense competition from Southern players and weak demand. While, prices in Gujarat are up by Rs 5 per bag (Q-o-Q) on the back of better discipline.

However, it does not end there. Prabhudas Lilladher says margins would contract sequentially across the regions due to weak prices, partially offset by savings in energy costs. ""We see a strong case for revival of price/supply discipline in northern and western region as the current prices are unsustainable at current levels due to weak earnings,"" it adds in a report.

The brokerage picks ACC, UltraTech and JK Lakshmi Cement as best bets in the sector.Posted by Nasrin SultanaFollow @NasrinzStory",393,-0.4149450361728668

Neelkanth Mishra, Credit Suisse says while India remains among the fastest nominal GDP and earnings growth economies, global weakness could be an overhang.

Despite rich valuations, he stays overweight on consumption and underweight on financials.

Mishra has an outperform rating on Tech Mahindra, HUL, UltraTech Cement and Tata Motors. He recommends trimming positions in SBI and Bharti Airtel.

Meanwhile, Mahesh Nandurkar, CLSA says looking at the consensus earnings trend over the last six years, considerable investor anxiety exists over FY17 earnings forecasts.

While FY17 earnings will likely get downgraded, earnings growth should still be near 15 percent, which would be far superior than the 7 percent average earnings growth seen over the past five years, he feels.

Nandurkar believes earnings recovery in FY17 should be driven by improved revenue growth as the economic recovery becomes more visible, operating leverage leads to margin improvement and most importantly, the base effect.

""Base effect-led earnings growth improvement should be visible from H2FY16 itself, with pharma, auto, cement, Reliance Industries, leading the trend, he says.",181,0.3332110544045766

Reliance Infrastructure's shares gained 1.4 percent intraday Friday on top of a 3.3 percent rise in previous session. A media report indicated that the company is in talks with Aditya Birla Group company for stake sale in cement units.

""The Aditya Birla Group's cement company, UltraTech Cements, is in talks to take over cement units of the Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Infrastructure,"" a media report said quoting unnamed sources.

Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group company's cement units are likely to fetch an enterprise valuation of Rs 5,000-5,500 crore, the report added.

Reliance Infrastructure has put up its cement units for sale last month to reduce its Rs 25,766 crore debt.

The company earned revenue of Rs 379 crore from its 5.5 million tonnes per annum operational capacity in September quarter. The company, on November 4, said it has been in process of obtaining requisite clearances for Sial Ghogri coal mine on track and the mining is expected to commence in Q1FY17.

Hero MotoCorp's promoter Pawan Munjal emerged as the highest paid director among the top listed private companies, taking home a pay packet of nearly Rs 44 crore last fiscal, followed by two other executives of the auto group, says a report. The group's two other promoters - late Brijmohan Lall Munjal and Sunil Kant Munjal - were the second and third most paid directors during 2014-15 period, according to proxy advisory firm InGovern. Brijmohan Lall, who passed away earlier this month, had a pay packet of Rs 43.64 crore, while that of Sunil Kant Munjal stood at Rs 41.87 crore.

Desh Bandhu Gupta, chairman of Lupin, earned a salary of Rs 37.58 crore, while Larsen & Toubro chairman A M Naik drew an annual remuneration of Rs 27.32 crore. An analysis of the salary of 95 directors in Nifty companies shows that on an average remuneration of a director is Rs 9 crore. All the top 10 directors were paid remuneration in excess of Rs 19 crore.

According to the report, Pawan Munjal took home a pay packet of Rs 43.91 crore last fiscal, which is 1.84 per cent of his company's net profit. A total of 34 Nifty-50 companies disclosed pay-ratios, while three firms - Bajaj Auto, Bosch and Maruti Suzuki - shied away from making any such disclosures. The Index has 10 PSUs which are exempted from making such disclosures.

Notably, the top three highest paid directors are from Hero MotoCorp and Lupin also contributed two directors to the top-10 list. Interestingly, seven out of these 10 directors are promoters of their respective companies. Among others in the top 10 are Bharti Airtel's Sunil Bharti Mittal (Rs 27.18 crore), Vinita Gupta, CEO of Lupin (Rs 24.86 crore), Hindalco MD D Bhattacharya (Rs 21.59 crore), TCS MD N Chandrasekaran (Rs 21.28 crore) and Ultratech Cement's Kumar Mangalam Birla (Rs 19.04 crore).

As per the report, as many as eight directors were paid remuneration that was more than one per cent of the standalone net profits of their companies with the highest being 2.33 per cent awarded to Bhattacharya. On the other hand, pay package of 16 directors was less than 0.05 per cent of the net profits of their firms. ""Remuneration of 11 directors was more than 400 times the median employee remuneration of their companies.

This included three directors each of Lupin and Hero MotoCorp and one each of Hindalco, L&T, Cipla, ITC and TCS"", it said. Besides, three executive directors earned less than Rs 1 crore in the last fiscal. M D Gupta of Lupin took home a salary of Rs 50 lakh; Sanjeev K Gupta, who was on the board of Axis Bank during the last fiscal, drew an annual remuneration of Rs 84 lakh and Sailesh T Desai of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries pocketed Rs 93 lakh.

The Rs 5400 crore Jaypee and UltraTech deal may see some fruition as the government is now likely to announce a proviso to allow financially stressed companies to transfer all of its non-coal reserves to recover money and pay back the banks.

In context with the merger, Jaypee was unable to transfer two of its limestone reserves to UltraTech, without which UltraTech was not really interested in the deal.

So, just to take care of this problem, we may now see a proviso which may allow companies that are financially stressed, companies which might be bad assets, to sell or rather transfer all of these non-coal reserves along with the plant that is along with cement plants, along with steel plants to recover money and pay back the banks.

The government is trying to address the problem of bad loans. So, once this proviso is in place, it will be great news for Jaypee and UltraTech. It is also great news for lenders.",173,0.004208847880363464

Reliance Securities' research report on Cement space

All India average cement price has declined marginally by ~1% month-on-month (mom) mainly owing to a meaningful price correction seen in the Northern markets and the all India average price is currently ruling at ~Rs300-305/bag. However, Western and Southern regions have witnessed an improvement in prices, whereas Eastern and Central declined moderately mom. Demand environment continued to remain dismal mainly on account of; a) absence of pickup in government projects, b) festivals, c) sand and water issues in many pockets, and d) absence of pickup in real estate activities. Dealers in many pockets are of the view that prices are likely to soften a bit in many pockets in the coming days as yearly closing for some of the companies will entail a price cut so as to push volumes. However, demand scenario is expected to pickup post Diwali.

Key Takeaways1. A significant price deterioration seen in the Northern region resulted in a marginal decline of ~1% in all-India average cement price to ~Rs300-305/bag. However, Northern prices are prevailing around ~280-285/bag (down by ~Rs10-15/bag mom).

2. Western region has witnessed a moderate improvement in prices (Rs5-10/bag mom) mainly owing to a meaningful pickup in demand and pricing scenario in Gujarat market. Further, a price reversal seen in AP/Telangana (recovered by ~Rs30-35/bag) resulted in a growth of ~3% mom in Southern prices.

3. However, Eastern and Western regions corrected by ~2-4% mom owing to softening of demand on monthly comparison. Demand in these regions was affected due to festivals and labour issues due to Bihar assembly election.

4. Most of the dealers are of the view that prices are unlikely to witness a sharp increase hereon at-least till December 2015 and may soften a bit as some of the companies will try to push volumes so as to meet year end targets. We are hopeful that 2HFY16E will witness a decent uptick in demand mainly driven by; a) expected pickup in construction activities from infrastructure projects, b) improvement in rural demand, c) pick up in housing activities, etc.

Outlook and Valuation: An absence of capex revival in Infrastructure and real estate activities has consistently been hurting the demand environment. We expect demand to improve in 2HFY16E with the pick up is construction activities. Further, rural demand is also expected to pickup post festivals. We foresee a decent uptick in demand scenario due to expected pickup in construction activities especially from projects awarded in the last 6-9 months. Notably, slowing capacity addition and incremental demand from smart cities / housing for all scheme of government / capital formation in Andhra Pradesh are likely to aid in improving utilizations of the industry and hence profitability. We firmly believe that cement industry is the perfect play on Infrastructure boost in India owing to better balance-sheet of cement companies. At the CMP, we maintain our BUY recommendation on Ultratech Cement in large cap space. Whereas, among mid-cap cement stocks we prefer J.K. Cement, JK Lakshmi Cement and Ramco Cements.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Aditya Birla Group firm Grasim Industries reported 17 percent growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 488.50 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, helped by higher sales, among other factors. The diversified products firm had a net profit of Rs 416.38 crore in the year-ago period, it said in a BSE filing. Total consolidated income of the firm grew by 6 percent to Rs 8,392.90 crore in July-September quarter this fiscal from Rs 7,943.05 crore in the same quarter of 2014-15.

Grasim Industries in engaged in manufacturing Viscose Staple Fibre (VSF) -- used in apparels -- and cement, contributing over 90 percent of its revenues and operating profits. It is also present in chemicals. VSF revenue rose 13 percent driven by higher sales volume at 1.14 lakh tonnes.

Grasim's cement subsidiary UltraTech Cement reported a 4 percent growth in revenues and the sales volume was also higher at 11.4 million tonnes (MT) against 10.9 MT last year. With commissioning of grinding units of 1.6 MTPA each in Haryana and West Bengal, the cement capacity has now increased to 67.7 MTPA. In the Chemical Business, revenue rose by 26 percent with a volume growth of 20 percent in caustic soda and 68 percent in epoxy.

The merger scheme of Aditya Birla Chemicals India (ABCIL) with the company has been approved by Competition Commission of India and the High Court of Madhya Pradesh. The sanction from High Court of Jharkhand is expected in Q3 2015-16. Upon receiving the requisite approvals, the scheme will be effective from April 1, 2015.

On outlook, Grasim said in VSF, prices are likely to be influenced by the developments in the industry such as the resumption of operations at some of the shut capacities in China and prices of competing fibres. In the Chemical Business, the scale of operations will rise significantly post the merger of ABCIL with the company, it added. ""In cement, the demand is expected to be higher with the government's focus on infrastructure development, housing sector, smart cities etc and the softening of interest rates,"" Grasim said.

However, the firm said that deficit monsoon, the delay in execution of government projects as well as surplus inventory in urban housing are concern areas for its cement business.",385,0.5989803910255432

Profit may be supported by higher other income via dividend. Topline may be aided by higher viscose staple fibre (VSF) volumes that may increase on commissioning of new capacity at Vilayat plant. Realisations could see some improvement sequentially.

Operating profit is seen rising 6 percent year-on-year to Rs 230 crore but margin may decline 40 basis points to 13 percent in same period. VSF margin may rise with some respite in pulp cost.

Analysts see improved performance of Epoxy and sustenance of steady performance in chemicals business in Q1FY16. Benefit of merger with Aditya Birla Chemicals will get added in Q3FY16.

Two weeks ago when DCB Bank announced it is planning to increase the number of branches by 50 percent to meet competition from small banks, the market beat down the stock price by 50 percent. But most other midcap banks were spared. I think the market is being myopic about the power of the new banks in the banking space.Just take number of accounts. After the Jandhan movement opened 127 million accounts, the total number of bank accounts in the country is 210 million. The total number of telephone subscriber accounts is over 1 billion. Airtel, which now has a banking licence can actually cajole its 232 million subscribers to open accounts with it. That alone is more than the total bank accounts in the country. Airtel has already done the KYC. It has credit scores for these customers going by their record of clearing phone bills.Likewise, Idea has 163 million customers that may be three times the number of bank accounts in SBI, the largest bank. Idea will have access to fertilizer- customers of Indo Gulf, small scale units that buy from Hindalco, Grasim and Ultratech. That’s a massive data base of customers to whom it can package credit from AV Birla money.On Friday governor Raghuram Rajan said RBI is looking at credit for products bought on the net. Imagine the kind of service the phone facilities can provide. Rel Jio, which has tied up with SBI, has a Reliance Fresh and Reliance Trends already in place. Paytm has already captured the urban payments market. It is a small walk to begin providing credit even without being a bank.All these new players come with oodles of cash to burn at least during the early phases. Like Yes and Kotak, there is a possibility, these new players will pay slightly more than the legacy banks for the basic savings account. They already are big brands. Is it tough to expect many of their customers, especially their younger clients to open their first bank account with their phone company rather than the local Corporation Bank or Dena Bank or LVB or KVB or Karnataka Bank?At the other end the small banks may not take that long to learn the basics of due diligence to create an asset book. Janalakshmi, Equitas, Ujjivan are all led by bankers. Equitas already has a book of about 2000 cr by way of loans to commercial vehicle owners. These small banks will also eat into the SME borrower segment of banks.To be sure it wont be a cakewalk for the new entrants. The small banks are mostly yesterday’s MFIs. Their cost structure required a lending rate of 20 percent-plus. But can they manage at lower lending rates remains to be seen. Also how will they woo new depositors in the face of competition from payment banks, remains unanswered.To what extent the payment banks can tie up with loan providers, digital retailers and mutual funds and make money purely on the service they render also remains to be seen. They can burn cash for a year or two. Ultimately they have to show profit.Meanwhile the payment scene itself is changing. National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the umbrella organization for all retail payment system in India, has taken up a new initiative called “Unified Payment Interface”. The new interface is designed to enable all account holders to send and receive money from their smartphones with a single identifier – Aadhaar number, mobile number, virtual payments address – without entering any bank account information. Will this stymie payment banks? Or will they find a way to compete and integrate with it with their superior service and relation with the customer. Also, it isn’t clear how soon the UPI will be up and running. It is possible if it is late, the payment banks will have taken away the game.The legacy banks are showing some fight in the face of the payment bank challenge. HDFC Bank, ICICI and SBI all have mobile wallets and some of these have already tied up with digital retailers. If you buy goods this Diwali through the wallets of some of these banks, you may get it cheaper than if you buy from the vendor. Even midcap banks are fighting back. Federal Bank allows you to open an account called “selfie” in 4 minutes by taking a selfie and sending your KYC details like aadhaar over the phone.There is one category of banks which hasn’t shown any fight – the PSU banks. Other than SBI, which has launched a mobile wallet and also tied up with Rel Jio for the payment bank – the rest of the PSUs are in a state of stupor. Bank of Baroda didn’t have a CEO for over a year. PNB didn’t have one for a little less than a year. The new “private” managers of BoB have so far not shown any signs of warming up to the new banking dynamics. As for the Denas, the IOBs, the Allahabads, the Corporations, one has heard nothing at all by way of preparing for the coming competition.It is clear the low fund cost advantage from current and savings account (CASA) will end for the legacy banks. The thinning of margins comes when the burden of non-performing or bad loans is at its height. In any industry, increase in competition thins margins. In banking, the number of players is set to increase from 45 in 2014 to 66 by 2016. That’s a 45 percent rise in the number of competitors. Some of the new banks come with cash and staying power and without a legacy of bad loans.The market fears for DCB. I fear for all banks. The midcap PSU banks look set to die. And this death won’t be a loss but a gain. Even the most ardent proponents of PSU banks have begun to admit that bank nationalisation is an unmitigated failure. The advent of payment and small banks may be an opportunity for the country to cleanse out at least some of these PSU banks that have become irreparable failures. PSU banks have been hotbeds of political patronage for a very long time. This is why I worry if the government will have the political will to kill them or let them die. One hopes these entities are not kept alive at the cost of the taxpayers’ money, as has been done with Air India.",1077,0.0

Emkay research report on UltraTech CementThere could be near-term risk to earnings because of increased volatility in cement prices in Maharashtra as low rainfall has impacted construction activities and muted demand from infrastructure and real estate sectors, however, in the long-run the company is expected to benefit from organic and inorganic capacity additions once there is improvement in demand scenario. The company is best placed to benefit from improvement in demand, with underutilized capacities in Gujarat (acquired plant of JCCL) and capacity expansions over the last one year, which may help it to generate superior profits in an up-cycle. Considering long term prospects and ~14% correction after our rating downgrade post Q1 results, we upgrade our rating to Accumulate.We have revised our revenue estimates downward by 4.9%/4%/3.2% considering delay in consolidation of acquired plants of JP Associates in the Central region and lower prices in the West region. Our sales volume assumption for FY16e/FY17e/FY18e stands at 46.2mt/53.7mt/61.9mt against 44.94mt in FY15. We have assumed grey cement realization/tn for FY16e/FY17e to be at Rs4,334/Rs4,667/Rs5,024 against Rs4,468/Rs4,811/Rs5,125 earlier. Lower sales volume and realization assumption for FY16e/FY17e/FY18e leads to 8.4%/6.7%/2.6% downwards revision in EBITDA estimates for FY16e/FY17e/FY18e. We expect EBITDA/tn to be at Rs996/Rs1,182/Rs1,325 in FY16e/FY17e/FY18e against Rs874 in FY15.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Arihant capital markets' report on Ultratech Cement

Ultratech’s (ULTC) 2QFY16 top line and operating performance beat analyst expectations but the bottom line remained below the estimates. During the quarter standalone sales volume declined by 3.27% to 11.5 mn MT, while blended realizations decreased to Rs. 4883 per ton. EBITDA margins increased by 130 bps to 17.4% on YoY basis, this is largely attributed to decrease in energy costs (softening of pet coke prices & higher usage of low cost fuels). EBITDA per ton increased to Rs. 836 from Rs. 823 YoY on a standalone basis.

Outlook: We expect ULTC to outperform the industry with its expanded capacities and controlled costs. Prices are also expected to firm up as demand for cement from infrastructure projects are slated to rise exponentially. We are positive on the prospects of the sector.

Valuations: We expect revival in investment cycle over long term beginning with the coming quarter. We forecast ULTC’s EBITDA margins to remain at 18% for the coming half year on the back of expected strong pricing environment and lower energy cost. We continue to value stock using EV/EBITDA(x) and have ascribed EV/EBITDA of 20(x) to its FY16E EBITDA. Our fair value for Ultratech comes at Rs. 3,114 per share. We recommend ‘HOLD’ rating on the stock.

Prabhudas Lilladher's report on UltraTech CementUltraTech Cement (UTCEM) reported Q2FY16 EBITDA ahead of our expectation on account of higher than esimated realisations. However, the beat on EBITDA was restricted to at‐par‐with‐expectation on PAT level due to higher than estimated depreciation and tax rate. We believe that UTCEM would be the key beneficiary of recovery in demand on the back of its highly efficient operations, sizeable capacity base and strong balance sheet. In this backdrop, we reiterate our Accumulate rating on the stock with TP of Rs 3,220 (at EV/EBITDA of 15x FY17), says Prabhudas Lilladher research report.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

ICICI Direct research report on UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement standalone revenues increased 4.5% YoY (down 6.9% QoQ) to | 5,620 crore (vs. I-direct estimate: | 5,526 crore) due to 4.0% YoY growth in volumes (led by capacity expansion) & 0.5%YoY increase in realisations. EBITDA/tonne increased 7.6% YoY in Q2FY16 to | 834/tonne (vs. I-direct estimate: | 842/tonne) due to a decline in power & fuel costs as there was an increase in pet coke consumption (from 50% to 65% YoY in fuel mix). RM cost during the quarter increased due to DMF levy (30% of royalty on limestone with effect from December 1, 2015). Acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates’ 5 MT Madhya Pradesh asset has been delayed by six months due to provision on transfer of mines in the recently introduced MMR&D Act. The management expects clarity on these provisions/amendments by the government in next three months.

With the government’s focus on infrastructure and initiatives like smart cities, concretisation of roads, and housing for all, cement demand is expected to improve, going forward. We assign premium valuations multiple to UltraTech vs. its peer companies due to industry-leading growth (on the back of consistent capacity additions), higher margins and healthy cash flows. Hence, we continue to maintain our positive view on the stock with a BUY recommendation and revise our target price to | 3,600/share (i.e. at 14.0x FY17E EV/EBITDA and EV/tonne of $220/tonne).

Sharekhan's report on UltraTech CementStrong operating performance backed by cost efficiency: For Q2FY2016, UltraTech Cement (UltraTech) reported a revenue growth of 4.5% YoY to Rs5,620.9 crore driven by both volume (up 3.2% YoY) and better realisation (up 1.3% YoY). Lower power and fuel cost (decline in pet coke price and usage of low cost fuel) led to an improvement in EBITDA per tonne (up 12.0% YoY to Rs810 per tonne). Further, adjusting for prior-period item (District Mineral Fund for prior periods) the adjusted net income grew by 3.4% YoY (higher effective tax rate and lower other income).Maintain Buy with price target of Rs 3,750: UltraTech is our preferred stock in the cement space due to its strong balance sheet and pan-India presence. We have increased our earnings estimates for FY2016 and FY2017 factoring improvement in operating margins. We see enough room for re-rating considering the historical peak valuations and operating leverage yet to kick in with an uptick in demand from H2FY2016.

Reliance Securities' report on cement sectorAll India average cement prices have broadly been flat month-on-month (mom) mainly owing to price recovery seen in Northern and Central regions and current prices are ruling at ~Rs300-305/bag. However, a sharp price correction seen in Western region (down by ~12% yoy and ~5% mom) led to average correction of ~2% on yearly comparison. Notably, after seeing a price recovery of ~Rs50-55/bag mom in Aug’15, selected pockets in Northern region continued to witness price improvement mom. Average price in Northern region improved by ~3% mom and ~4% yoy to ~Rs300/bag. Notably, demand environment remained subdued in Sept’15 mainly on account of; a) absence of pickup in government projects, b) delay in capex revival, c) sand issues in many pockets, and d) absence of pickup in real estate activities. Dealers in many pockets are of the view that prices are likely to remain firm at current levels despite subdued demand scenario and may increase in coming months with the expected pickup in construction activities post Diwali.Outlook and Valuation:""Absence of capex revival in Infrastructure and real estate activities has consistently been hurting demand environment. However, we expect demand for cement to improve from Nov-Dec’15 with the pick up in construction activities. Notably, slowing capacity addition and incremental demand from smart cities / housing for all scheme of government / capital formation in Andhra Pradesh are likely to aid in improving utilizations of the industry and hence profitability. We firmly believe that cement industry is perfect play on infrastructure boost in India owing to stable balance-sheet of cement companies. At the current market price, we maintain our BUY recommendation on Ultratech Cement in large cap space. Whereas, among mid-cap cement stocks we prefer J. K. Cement, JK Lakshmi Cement and Ramco Cements"", says Reliance Securities research report.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Realtors' apex body CREDAI on Monday said it has filed complaint with fair trade regulator CCI against cement manufacturers alleging manipulation in prices of construction material that have risen by up to 40 percent in last two months. Last month, CREDAI's NCR chapter decided to stop buying cement from companies like Ultratech and Lafarge for unilaterally increasing cement prices in last one month. ""To control the cost of construction and make home prices work for the common man, the Confederation of Real Estate Developer's Associations of India (CREDAI) has moved the Competition Commission of India (CCI) against cement manufacturers who have been unduly increasing the cost of cement,"" the association said in a statement.

In its submission to the CCI, CREDAI has pointed out that the cost of raw material used in manufacturing cement has come down from January 2015 to September 2015 but the companies never passed on this benefit to their consumers. ""Instead, they seemed to be working together in controlling supply and prices,"" CREDAI alleged. Industry body said that despite low demand, the prices of cement have jumped by 20-40 percent in major cities across India in the last couple of months.

CREDAI (National) President Getamber Anand said that in Delhi-NCR, the prices have risen to about Rs 300 per bag from Rs 210 a bag on August 1. ""It is unfair that the cement manufacturers indulge in practices that control the prices of cement. CCI has warned CMA (Cement Manufacturers Association) in the past as well but it is unfortunate that they seem to be continuing with their price and market manipulation,"" Anand said.

CREDAI said that demand for cement has declined in view of huge slowdown in the real estate sector. The realty sector accounts for nearly half of the cement demand in the country. The association complained that ""there seems to be no grounds for supply restriction and the recent price increase in cement given the low demand"".

In its complaint, CREDAI has submitted to the CCI that cement manufacturers have contravened the Commission's 'cease and desist' order of 2012 ""as the prices of all the cement manufacturers are moving in tandem leaving the customers with no choice but to succumb to the cartel"". ""This is quite unfortunate and not in public interest. We all want to participate in the 'Housing for All' vision of the government, but we are unable to bring down our costs of construction to a level which is affordable to the common man,"" the association said.",427,-0.9746231436729431

India Cement Dealer Check: ReligareNorthern resurgent, south slumpsAmid a continuing demand slump, cement prices have rebounded by Rs 70-100/bag in North India and Rs 10-15/bag in select western markets this month, while dropping by Rs 10-20/bag in southern markets. This should boost realisations for north and west-based players (SRCM, JKLC) by 3-4% QoQ in Q2FY16. Cement stocks appear attractive in the aftermath of the recent correction and are pricing in the weak demand environment – BUY on dips with a 2-3-year horizon. Top picks: UTCEM, ORCMNT.Mixed trends in central markets; east stable: In central markets, prices were stable in Uttar Pradesh (though the disruption by JP in the non-trade market is still prevalent), but increased in Madhya Pradesh by Rs 20/bag in the last one month. Demand weakness lingers in the region. The eastern market saw limited price movement and soft demand could herald some correction in future.Demand slump continues in most regions: Our discussions with dealers across cities suggest continued weakness in demand on the back of (1) subdued government investment, (2) poor housing demand, and (3) lack of rains affecting rural offtake.Quarterly realisations to improve QoQ for north/west players: With prices rebounding in the northern and western regions in Q2FY16, we expect a 3-4% QoQ increase in realisations, particularly for players with north/west market exposure (SRCM, JKLC). Companies in the south could see some dip in realisations on account of the Andhra market, with stable numbers for eastern market players. Overall, demand remains feeble and holds the key for any meaningful recovery in the sector. Top picks: UltraTech Cement and Orient Cement.

The RBI policy rate cut of 50 basis points yesterday paves the way for this, he feels.

He says a slight tweak by the RBI in its language towards an easier real interest rate methodology has raised hopes of more rate cuts in certain sections of the market. While corporate capex should be slow to react due to demand issues, rate reductions should help to stabilise property markets, he adds.

Nandurkar believes key beneficiaries of falling rate environment in his coverage universe will be IndusInd Bank, HDFC, Maruti, property companies, Power Grid and leveraged companies, including IRB Infra and PVR.

Anand Kumar, Bank of America Merrill Lynch says while this higher than expected cut in policy rates is a positive for the markets at the margin, the impact on earnings will likely be felt with a lag of around two quarters after the transmission into lending rate cuts.

This sets up a case for earnings recovery in FY17, he feels. According to Kumar, key gainers would be Yes Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Sobha and UltraTech Cement.",195,0.798190971215566

Shares of Shree Cement slipped more than 4 percent intraday Tuesday after the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI) NCR banned its products on Monday, alleging that the company indulged in practices of cartelisation and malpractices. Besides Shree Cement, CREDAI has also banned UltraTech Cement and Lafarge on the same grounds.

After banning UltraTech Cement and Lafarge earlier, CREDAI had said: ""This decision has been taken by the apex realty body in order to help fair price determination of key raw materials required for the realty sector.""

""We have decided to boycott Ultratech and Lafarge as they have not delivered the cement to our members at the decided price, despite taking advances,"" CREDAI National President Getamber Anand said. He had also warned that if the situation did not change, then they can also go on a national strike.

Cement companies have increased prices by almost 40 percent since August 1 and violated CCI 2012 order. This is despite the fact that demand from real estate companies during the period has been rather subdued.CREDAI has said this will not result in delays of realty projects that are to be ready for possession in the next one year. It also plans to move the Competition Commission of India (CCI) against the Cement Manufacturers Association (CMA) this week. CCI in 2012 had found the CMA guilty of price collution. CREDAI NCR has about 220 members from Delhi, Noida, Yamuna Expressway, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad, Rajnagar Extention, Faridabad Neemrana, Bhiwadi and other adjoining areas.

In further blow to cement companies, CREDAI South India may also ban these companies and move CCI.(With inputs from PTI)",281,-0.999046802520752

Aditya Birla Group flagship firm UltraTech Cement today said it has commissioned its grinding unit with a capacity of 1.6 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in Jhajjar, Haryana. The move is aimed at increasing the firm's slice in the north region — that accounts for a lion's share of India's cement market — particularly the National Capital Region (NCR) and Haryana. With commissioning of the firm's 13th unit, UltraTech's total cement capacity has reached 63.1 MTPA, it said in a regulatory filing.

The third line at Aditya Cement, Rajasthan, commissioned in March 2015, will cater to the clinker requirement of this plant, it added. North region accounts for 35 per cent of the cement demand in the country and is expected to grow at around 8 per cent, it said. ""With this commissioning, the company will further increase its capacity in north region.

The plant's location at a distance of less than 100 kms from the markets of NCR and Haryana will assist in capturing the growing demand for cement in this region with timely and effective supplies to the customer,"" it added. Shares of the company today fell 3.27 per cent to settle at Rs 2810.90 apiece on the BSE.",211,0.9778965711593628

After acquiring Jaiprakash Associate's two cement plants in Madhya Pradesh, Aditya Birla Group is keen to buy the former's Bhilai cement facility too. The Group's cement arm Ultratech is in talks with Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) for acquiring its 2.2 million tonne (MT) Bhilai unit. Both the firms have approached SAIL for its nod for the deal as the domestic steel giant has a 26 per cent stake in the facility, sources said.

Meanwhile, the company in a BSE filing said, ""The Company, in the course of its business, evaluates various proposals. No proposal has reached the stage which would merit intimation under the listing agreement...."" The issue will be discussed at UltraTech's annual general meeting scheduled for tomorrow in which Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla will address the shareholders highlighting the industry issues, its impact on business, strategic moves made and the future outlook. Queries sent to Aditya Birla Group spokesperson regarding the proposed acquisition of Bhilai facility, however remained unanswered.

JAL is the flagship company of Jaypee Group and is the third largest cement producer in the country. Shares of JAL surged 11.71 per cent to Rs 9.73 on bourses following the reports of sale of Bhilai unit. JAL's Bhilai facility in Chhattisgarh has a production capacity of 2.2 MT per annum.

SAIL has about 26 per cent stake in the plant. However, a SAIL spokesperson could not furnish details regarding the deal. Earlier this year, Ultratech shareholders and creditors had approved the firm's acquisition of JAL's cement units at Bela and Sidhi in Madhya Pradesh for Rs 5,400 crore, that have a cement capacity of 4.9 MTPA and a thermal power generation capacity 180 MW TPP.

In one of the biggest deals in the cement sector, Ultratech's board had approved the acquisition for JAL's Bela unit which has 2.1 MTPA clinker and 2.6 MTPA cement grinding capacity and Sidhi unit which has 3.1 MTPA clinker and 2.3 MTPA cement grinding capacity. This deal had followed Ultratech's acquisition of JAL's cement plant in Gujarat having 4.8 mtpa capacity for Rs 3,800 crore last year. Ultratech's consolidated net profit had declined to Rs 591 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2015-16 as against Rs 628 crore in the year-ago period.

Debt-ridden JAL would have about 20 MTPA capacity after this sale. The company has been selling cement and power assets to pare debt and improve its balance sheet. ""The group has divested assets of over Rs 20,000 crore, displaying the intent of the group's founder of maintaining credibility with all its stakeholders including lenders, creditors and shareholders,"" Manoj Gaur, Executive Chairman, JAL had said earlier.",448,0.3331983685493469

Shares of UltraTech Cement, Ambuja Cements and Grasim Industries gained 1.5-2 percent intraday Wednesday as brokerage CLSA has retained its overweight rating on these stocks, saying these are top picks in the sector.

Notwithstanding monthly volatility, the brokerage expects a gradual cement demand recovery and model-in 7.5 percent CAGR over the next three years. Supply pressures, too, are receding, it said.

It believes that the worst is behind for the industry, which is on course for a gradual recovery after seven years of contraction in the utilisation rate.

According to the brokerage, stocks are currently trading above their historic multiples but this must be seen in the context of an ensuing upcycle, strong balance sheets, improving return on equity, etc.

The recent quarterly results (April-June quarter) highlighted significant regional contrast as south India-based cement players reported the highest unit EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) despite lowest industry utilisation. On the other hand, north/central unit EBITDA fell to lows of several quarters despite much better utilisation.

This was largely due to producer discipline in the south while demand disappointment along with hyper competition impacted north/central pricing, it reasoned. According to CLSA, the east continued to witness good volume growth and resilient overall pricing, despite the entry of Shree Cement which sold at a discount to frontline brands.

Overall Q1FY16 aggregate cement EBITDA declined 10 percent Y-o-Y due to a fall in overall realisations.

Most companies have sounded a word of caution on near-term demand, given continuing weakness in macro and a sluggish trend in housing and infra.

However, the brokerage believes current pricing is almost unsustainable in the north and central, given abysmally low unit EBITDA. So it expects strong recovery in the near term.

Prices in south are also likely to be steady in the near term as industry utilisation rates are quite low, though, there may some corrections during the monsoon, it said.

Shares of Ambuja Cements closed at Rs 230.90, up 1.85 percent. UltraTech Cement rose 1.17 percent to Rs 3,170 and Grasim Industries was up 0.23 percent at Rs 3,715.20 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.Posted by Sunil Shankar Matkar",367,0.24012027382850648

Neelkanth Mishra, Credit Suisse said while aggregate Nifty sales fell 4.3 percent year-on-year in Q1FY16 (up 5 percent excluding oil & metals), EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) decline slowed sharply and operating margins posted a three-year high.July-September quarter sales should see a bigger boost from USDINR, he added.

He expects further cuts for metals and PSU banks, but currency-driven upgrades to IT and pharma. According to him, the meaningful risks for the market continued to be outside India. As fiscal headwinds to growth has receded, and government spending (particularly state governments) has picked up, domestic economic momentum is on the mend, he believes.""We continue to prefer private banks (Axis Bank, HDFC Bank), construction (Larsen and Toubro, UltraTech Cement) and consumption plays (Maruti Suzuki, Hindustan Unilever),"" Mishra said.",138,0.9999634027481079

Emkay's research report on UltraTech Cement

1Q performance was largely in-line with estimates with EBITDA at Rs10.9 bn (vs est Rs10.5bn) and OPM at 18.1% (vs est 17.3%). EBITDA/tn was at Rs900 (vs est Rs862)

Sales volume of Cement and Clinker was up 3.8% yoy, whereas, blended realization was up 3% yoy. OPM was up 26bps yoy to 18.1%

Operating cost/tn increased by 2.7% yoy led by higher raw material cost (due to increase in limestone royalty), employee cost and freight cost (increase in rail freight rate). Increased usage of pet coke led to 12% yoy decline in energy cost

EBITDA estimates for FY16e/FY17e are getting revised downwards by 4%/3% for FY16e/FY17e due to lower sales volume assumptions as consolidation of acquired plants in MP will happen now in Q4FY16e. Though, it remains our preferred pick in large cap space, sharp increase in stock price in last month leave little room for further upside. We continue to like the company but would wait for better entry points. Downgrade rating to Hold from Buy with a one-year PT of Rs3,529""We expect UTCEM to benefit from organic and inorganic capacity additions once there is improvement in demand scenario. The company is best placed to benefit from improvement in demand, with underutilized capacities in Gujarat (acquired plant of JCCL) and capacity expansions over the last one year, which may help it to generate superior profits in an upcycle. Its ability to control operating cost is reflected by the changing fuel mix based on cost benefits which will continue to yield positive results in future too. However, sharp run-up in stock price in last one month (up 20%) leaves little room for further upside in our view. Though, we continue to prefer the stock, stretched valuations make us to downgrade our rating to Hold from Buy with a 1-year PT of Rs 3,529"", says Emkay Global Financial Services research report.

""UltraTech Cement (UTCEM) reported Q1FY16 earnngs ahead of our expectation, led by beat across the fronts.

In this backdrop, we reiterate our Accumulate rating on the stock with TP of Rs 'BUY' with revised TP of Rs 3,550.""

Valuation and outlook: ""We have been circumspect on the price hikes at the start of quarter due to weak demand. However, we see the price hikes to become more constructive Q3FY16 onwards when demand would start recovering gradually on the back of lower interest costs and elevated govt spending. In this backdrop, we like UTCEM on the back of its strong scale of operations and efficient operations"", says Prabhudas Lilladher research report.

Edelweiss' report on UltraTech Cement

""UltraTech Cement’s (UTCL) Q1FY16 EBIDTA of INR11.5bn (up 10% YoY) was in line with our estimate. Volume growth of 4% YoY and realisation decline of 3% QoQ were also in line. Lower-than-estimated fixed cost helped offset the QoQ marginal rise in variable cost/t. Ergo, EBITDA/t at INR928 rose 6% YoY. Factoring the current weakness in demand and prices (all India average prices dipped ~4% QoQ and expected to stay under pressure in Q2FY16 owing to monsoon) we lower our FY16E EBITDA ~8%. However, we remain optimistic on demand recovery from H2FY16 and, hence, broadly retain our FY17E. While the sector outlook of expected demand revival and slowing capacity additions remains positive, the stock seems to be fully pricing in potential benefits of the same. At our existing FY17E EBITDA (factoring 11% volume growth and EBITDA/t of INR1,438), we are higher than the consensus by ~10%, offering little scope for an earnings upgrade. We continue to value UTCL at 11x FY17E EV/EBITDA (at higher end of its historical multiple) yielding target price of INR3,170. At CMP, the risk-reward seems unfavourable. Hence, we downgrade to hold"", says Edelweiss research report.

Despite the recent rally in the market, Mithil Pradhan of Violet Arc Global Managers does not think it is the right time to go in for profit booking. He is extremely bullish on the market. He is looking for a breakout in sectors such that PSU banks and IT that are not doing too well at the moment.

He recommends investors to continue to stay invested and buy on dips. He is bullish on stocks such as Cipla, Biocon, HUL, LIC Housing Finance and GIC Housing Finance. He also likes the midcaps space, especially names such as Arvind and PVR.

Market expert Shashi Bhushan advises investors to stick to largecap IT companies.

Post UltraTech Cement's first quarter numbers, Mayuresh Joshi of Angel Broking says he liked the stock at lower levels. He says the company's performance on the EBITDA front and bottomline was good. ""It was an all-round performance. But a lot depends on performance sustainability and what the management has to say,"" he told CNBC-TV18.

Joshi also likes Asian Paints despite the fact that it is expensive. He says the stock derives its valuation premium on the back of earnings and also being the market leader in the segment. He believes that the company will benefit from economic revival and capacity addition.

In the banking space, Joshi has a bias towards large private banks.

UltraTech Cement's standalone profit after tax is expected to fall 12 percent year-on-year to Rs 549 crore in the quarter ended June, according to a CNBC-TV18 poll. Higher interest and depreciation cost associated with acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates’ Gujarat plants may impact the bottomline. The company will announce its earnings on July 20.

Total income from operations is seen rising 7 percent to Rs 6,088 crore in the first quarter of financial year 2015-16 from Rs 5,692 crore in the year-ago period led by capacity growth.

Total volumes are expected to inch up nearly 3 percent to 12.3 million tonnes, supported by new capacity addition and acquired assets.

Operating profit may increase by 1 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,062 crore but margin may decline 110 basis points to 17.4 percent in the quarter gone by. Analysts feel weak pricing environment and lower international coal prices (against higher railway freight costs) may impact operating profit margin.

As far as realisations are concerned, stable pricing environment in south may cushion the impact of weakness in north & west. UltraTech may benefit from higher price in eastern and southern India.

Key issues to watch out for would be volume growth recovery & outlook, cement pricing outlook & sustainability, update on scale-up of the newly commenced Rajasthan plant, and update on financial performance of Star Cement, UAE.",233,0.29125792980194093

Abhay Laijawala, Deutsche Bank said with the anxiety over Greece and China ebbing, expectations of a Fed liftoff will be back on the table for financial markets. With the FOMC meeting scheduled for September, the market will start to price in a lift-off then, unless some counter factors emerge, he added.

US economics team believes that US Fed is on track for a September liftoff, he said.

According to him, the Fed liftoff may emerge as the most significant event for emerging market liquidity. Over past 2-3 years, there has been a generally negative correlation between US 10-year bond yield and MSCI EM/MSCI India, implying that periods of rising US bond yields have led to an environment of subdued foreign inflows for emerging markets (EM), said Laijawala in its note.

He believes India will outperform amid impaired environment of FII flows.

""While India will not stay immune to any FOMC liftoff induced suppressed inflows for emerging markets, India will be relatively less impacted as the EM differentiation – which started about one and a half years ago - is likely to intensify further as global commodity deflation becomes more entrenched. In addition, the perception of EM currency stability and willingness/ability of respective governments to engineer a domestic turnaround – within a volatile global environment - will also be further factors of differentiation,"" he reasoned.

While foreign portfolio inflows stay subdued, and domestic portfolio investors remain key drivers of market liquidity, mid caps are likely to outperform more meaningfully in the run up to the Fed liftoff, he believes. His top mid cap picks are Apollo Tyres, IRB Infra, Castrol, Cummins, HPCL, Ashok Leyland and Bajaj Finserv.

According to him, commodity deflation will get entrenched, which is further strengthening the case for public investment in India.

He feels a strengthening USD, slowing China and the recent Iran nuclear deal are all pointing towards a lower for longer commodity price environment. By virtue of its net commodity importer status (oil, coal, gold, silver and fertilizers account for around 40 percent of India’s merchandise imports), India stands out relative to its EM peers.

Laijawala said a prolonged period of commodity deflation can provide additional fiscal manoeuvrability to the government of India to ramp up vital public investments without exerting much pressure on fiscal balance. The environment for public investment has not been as conducive as it is currently, he feels.

Direct beneficiaries of commodity deflation include HPCL, BPCL, Apollo Tyres, Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra.

He said at the brokerage, they have trimmed the weight of financials from 124 basis points to 69 basis points in the Deutsche Bank India model portfolio.

According to him, in the run up to the Fed liftoff in September, RBI may choose to put rupee over rates as its focus area. Unless FII limits on treasury bonds are eased 10-year bond yields are likely to stay elevated, he said.

He added that the brokerage maintained IT services as a key underweight sector as it believes that cross-currency headwinds will continue to be a challenge for the sector at least until the Fed liftoff.

Its key overweight remained unchanged with industrials remaining highest overweight at 354 bps (against 337 bps earlier). He suggested that investors should position their portfolios in line with shift in government’s policy focus on public investments and infra-creating assets.

Laijawala said energy remained key overweight driven by Coal India, HPCL and BPCL. ""We have introduced Castrol and Apollo Tyres (beneficiaries of lower oil price) into the model portfolio, while Tata Motors exits the portfolio due to weakening demand environment in China. Our top large cap picks are: BPCL, Axis Bank, M&M, HDFC Bank, UltraTech, Maruti, Zee, Container Corporation, Bharti, L&T and Coal India,"" he added.",632,0.3679407409259251

Maximizer Jun 2015: Karvy

Indian equities started the year 2015 on a high note and rallied quickly towards the all time high levels in the first week of March 2015. However, selling pressurewas witnessed from those euphoric levels due to concerns over the pace of interest rate hikes in the US and worries over Greece exiting the European Monetary Union. On the domestic front, lag in earnings momentum catching up with the market run up led to disappointment during the quarterly results. All these factors led to markets giving up the gains of the last six months, giving an opportunity for fresh investments to enter the Indian equity markets. We retained eight out of ten stocks and replaced two stocks in our Wealth Maximizer 2015 due to expected under performance in the coming quarters.

Our take on the marketWe expect Nifty to trade in the band of 8400 – 10800 in the coming 12-15 months, implying a P/E band of 14-18x for CY16 consensus EPS. There could be short term volatility triggered by global events. We remain overweight on domestic consumption, Agri, Automobiles, BFSI, Cement, Consumer Goods, Infrastructure, Software and Pharma.

Wealth Maximizer Jun 2015: Our top ten large-cap picks in the Wealth Maximizer (for a time frame of 9-12 months) are Asian Paints, Divis Labs, HDFC Bank, ITC, L&T, Maruti Suzuki, Reliance Industries, TCS, Ultratech Cement and UPL.

With both and retail institutional demand struggling to grow, the fiscal is likely to be a ""tough year"" for the north Indian cement market, which accounted for 31 percent of the country's consumption in 2014-15, a report said.""FY 2015-16 will be a tough year for north India, with both retail and institutional demand struggling to grow,"" Ambit Capital said in its report.In 2014-15, north India accounted for 79 million tonnes or 31 percent of the country's cement consumption, it added.""Our discussion with industry participants suggests that the seasonally strong April-June quarter has been poor and given the lack of government tenders, scope of a meaningful improvement in the remaining part of the year is limited.""Hence, we do not envisage a volume growth in excess of 3-4 percent, which itself is dependent on higher execution of infrastructure projects,"" Ambit Capital said.The year 2015-16 was expected as a recovery year, but demand has worsened as rural sales have declined sharply and real estate inventory has hit an all-time high. Infrastructure recovery remains elusive with weak government tendering.North India accounts for one-fourth of cement produced in India (87 million tonnes installed capacity as on end 2014-15) with Rajasthan accounting for 54 percent (and almost entire clinker capacity) and UP for 14 percent of total capacity.Shree Cement is the market leader, followed by UltraTech, Jaypee and Ambuja. Other relatively large producers are Binani Cement, JK Cement and JK Lakshmi, the report said.The increasing prominence of regional manufacturers (51 percent capacity share in 2014-15 as against 45 percent in 2006-07) in a market with limited logistic challenges (largely roads) has led to price wars. Now prices in north India are at a 35 percent discount in comparison to south India, it added.North India is facing growth challenges, on account of infrastructure recovery remaining elusive and rural demand deteriorating significantly in the last one year due to poor rainfall, low subsidies, wage growth and paltry MSP hikes.Besides, the real estate business is facing liquidity constraints due to the government's clamp-down on black money, Ambit Capital said.Regional manufacturers with scale and cost efficiencies will benefit the most in an infra-led cement demand recovery, it added.Pan-India players trade at rich valuations, run earnings downgrade risks and do not have the best cost/capital efficiency to meaningfully improve return on capital expenditures, as volumes might grow but chances of a sharp pricing recovery are scanty, the report said.""With retail demand languishing, price increases will be difficult to pass through, as the regional manufacturers compete on prices to garner the maximum volumes from the institutional clients,"" Ambit Capital said.",438,0.0

Prabhudas Lilladher's report on cement sector

The general feedback from our channel checks remained weak, while the pace of fall in volumes has significantly subsided in May compared to March. After assimilating the data points collected from various channel checks, we expect All- India cement despatches to grow 3-4% YoY (on a high base) in May compared to fall of 5-6% YoY in March. East was the best performing region with growth in the range of 9-10% YoY. Demand in North and Central region is likely to have grown by 3-4% YoY on a high base of 10%. Channel checks in the Western region suggest growth in positive territory after 10 months of continuous fall. However, growth is marginal at 0.5-1.0%. On the contrary, demand in the Southern region continued to remain weak with fall in the range of 7-8% on a negative base of 5-6%.

May month’s volume numbers indicate some signs of improvement. However, pick up in volumes has not translated into higher prices or lessening the fall in prices due to intense competition. Hence, sustenance of the trend in the coming months would be the key for prices. We continue to maintain our positive view as we see recovery in demand to pick up Q3FY15 onwards on the back of increased public spending. We continue to like UltraTech, ACC and JK Lakshmi in the space

Abhay Laijawala, Deutsche Equities said while the brokerage remained constructive on market outlook & are maintaining our December 2015 Sensex target of 33,000, it does believe that both the economy & stock market are now urgently looking for critical offsets to balance the continued absence of private sector investment.

With the private sector still on sidelines, rural consumption deteriorating & export growth looking anemic, public investment has emerged as the most critical driver for economic revival, until private sector has recovered, he added.

According to him, a strategic thrust on public investment can be one of the strongest offsets the government can consciously provide India Inc to tide over this period of transition.

“Our top picks are Ashok Leyland, Axis Bank, Bharti Airtel, CONCOR, Cummins, HPCL, IRB Infra, L&T, Maruti, SBI, Shree Cement, Ultratech and Zee Entertainment,” Laijawala said.",149,0.33219343423843384

Alpha trading strategy by ICICIdirect.com

The Nifty has witnessed some reversal from the important support level of 8050 and is currently trading near 8350. Despite a marginal recovery, the Nifty as well as most index heavyweights have failed to add fresh open interest. Nifty open interest is currently at the lowest levels since September 2014 and major upsides may not be seen in the index till fresh open interest is formed

In such a scenario, few stocks that have already started witnessing fresh accumulation of open interest are likely to hold their levels and may even outperform the index in the near term. UltraTech Cement is one such stock where after shedding close to 43% open interest in the last couple of months, fresh upsides were observed on the back of fresh long additions. The stock added more than 7% OI in the recent few sessions

In the cement space, UltraTech is one of the best performers among its peers and has showed significant resilient in the market declines. It is currently trading at its monthly high levels. We believe downsides in the stocks may be limited in the near term and can be hedged by selling two lots of Nifty futures

In options space, the stock had a major Call base at 2800, 3000 strikes. As it has already surpassed the 2800 Call strike, short covering in stuck up Call writers is likely to provide the thrust for fresh upward momentum

The stock has a history of witnessing directional moves after surpassing its 200 DMA levels. Recently, the stock surpassed its 200 DMA. We believe the positive bias may continue in the stock in the near term

In the first week of the May series, UltraTech saw significantly high delivery based activity as broader market weakness continued. However, the stock held Rs 2700. We believe weak hands are now out of the stock. In such a scenario, UltraTech Cement may witness a significant up move along with the market recovery

The price ratio of Nifty/UltraTech Cement has seen pressure at higher levels since January 2014. Recently, it also breached its support line enforcing since June 2014. We expect a further decline in the price ratio. It may move towards 2.60 levels in the days to come, says ICICIdirect.com research report.

StrategyBuy 1 lot UltraTech Cement June futures at Rs 2885-2895 and sell 2 lot Nifty June futures at Rs 8345-8355Parameters:Current price ratio (Nifty/UltraTech Cement): 2.88Target: 2.59Stop loss: 3.02

Shree Cement has completed the acquisition of a cement grinding unit of Jaiprakash Associates for Rs 358.22 crore.

The acquisition of a 1.5 mtpa cement grinding unit of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd, situated at Panipat, has been consummated on April 27, 2015 for an aggregate consideration of Rs 358.22 crore, Shree Cement said in a filing to the BSE on Monday.

In August last year, the board of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd had approved the sale of the unit on a going concern basis to Shree Cement Ltd.

Post this transaction, Jaypee Cement continues to be India's third largest manufacturer with an aggregate capacity of over 29 million tonnes per annum. After the acquisition, Sree Cement's capacity stands at 19 mtpa with facilities in Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Bihar and Haryana. The company sells cement under the brand name of Shree Ultra and Bangur.

In September 2014, the Competition Commission of India had cleared the deal and noted that post transaction, the market share of Shree Cement will go up by 3 per cent to stand at 26 per cent. In 2013, India's largest cement maker UltraTech Cement had acquired the Gujarat cement unit of Jaypee Cement Corporation for Rs 3,800 crore to help pare debt of the company. Shares of Shree Cement Ltd on Monday closed at Rs 9,947.25 apiece on the BSE, down by 0.54 per cent.",235,

Maruti Suzuki

The auto major outperformed benchmark indices with a gain 3 percent after posting stellar March quarter earnings. Its Q4 profit rose a whopping 60.5 percent, supported by higher volumes and favorable foreign exchange. The profit increased to Rs 1,284 crore from Rs 800 crore in the year-ago period. Strong operational performance also boosted bottomline. (Read full story)

Though the private bank matched street expectations with the profit rising 10.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,922 crore in the quarter ended March 2015, the stock took a knock of 2 percent.

Moneycontrol Bureau

Shares of UltraTech Cement rose 2 percent intraday on Monday despite a decline in net profit of March quarter. The company’s net fell 24 percent to Rs 657.2 crore for the fourth quarter of 2014-15 due to a a penalty imposed by Competition Commission of India (CCI) on cartelisation charges.

Macquarie maintains an underperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2020 per share. It states that due to the low base of FY15, volume assumptions for FY16 are looking very optimistic; more particularly amidst weak rural demand environment. The brokerage is concerned that with poor rains expected there may be a risk to recovery of cement demand from 5-6 percent in FY15 to estimate of 8 percent year-on-year in FY16.

“On the costs front, benefits of lower oil prices are already factored in and going forward, we expect costs to trend upwards with increase in excise duty nd higher freight announced in the recent budget. Further, MMDRA amendment doubles limestone royalty and would increase cost by Rs 5-6 per bag,” it says in a report.

Goldman Sachs remains neutral on the stock with an unchanged target of Rs 3200 per share.

Meanwhile, Barclays has an overweight rating and sees the stock touching Rs 3447 driven by improving fuel mix, greater operating efficiency and better-than-expected realisations.

At 09:44 hrs UltraTech Cement was quoting at Rs 2,737.65, up Rs 30.50, or 1.13 percent on the BSE.

Moneycontrol Bureau

As the market struggles under selling pressure, investors are keenly keeping an eye on the week ahead when another set of corporate earnings of March quarter will be announced. On Friday, the Sensex plunged 297.08 points or 1 percent at 27437.94 and the Nifty dived 93.05 points or 1 percent at 8305.25.

So, here are the stocks you need to closely watch next week:

ICICI Bank

ICICI Bank, which will announce its Q4 earnings on April 27, is expected to report strong jump in profit due to exchange gains from repatriation income, feel analysts. Profit is likely to grow 11 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,944 crore and net interest income may climb 13.7 percent to Rs 4,952.8 crore in the quarter ended March 2015. Net interest income is the difference between interest earned and interest expended.

Stock closed at Rs 308.10, down Rs 3.70, or 1.19 percent on Friday.

Maruti Suzuki

Maruti Suzuki 's fourth quarter profit after tax is seen rising a whopping 43 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,145 crore compared to Rs 800 crore in the year-ago period led by operating performance, according to a CNBC-TV18 poll. Revenue is likely to increase 10.3 percent to Rs 13,350 crore in the quarter ended March 2015 from Rs 12,101.4 crore in the same quarter last fiscal. Overall, it is expected to be a good quarter for Maruti as volume growth was decent at 7 percent Y-o-Y.

Stock closed at Rs 3,539.80, up Rs 45.75, or 1.31 percent on Friday.

Idea Cellular

Idea Cellular is expected to announce March quarter results on April 28. Its revenue is expected to rise 4.5 percent at Rs 8396 on a qaurterly basis due to volume growth which offsets impact of lower revenue per margins (RPM). According to CNBC-TV18 poll, net profit is seen rising 9.5 percent at Rs 840 crore (Q-o-Q) from Rs 767.1 crore. RPM is seen lower this quarter due to interconnect usage charge cut from March 1 while data growth is expected to be strong. The stock has been an outperformer given the auction overhang has come to an end.

UltraTech Cement

UltraTech Cement on Saturday reported a 24 percent dip in consolidated net profit at Rs 657.2 crore for the fourth quarter of 2014-15, mainly on account of a penalty imposed by CCI on cartelisation charges. The country's largest cement maker reported a growth of 4.47 percent in its turnover during the quarter at Rs 6,597.49 crore.

The company said, the main reason for the dip in its net profit is due to a Rs 117.55 crore payment made as ordered by the Competition Commission of India following charges of cartelisation by the company.

It ended at Rs 2,707.15, down Rs 27.90, or 1.02 percent on the BSE.

Infosys

Infosys is likely to see more action in its counter on Monday as well after losing 6 percent on Friday. Technology stocks are under pressure after announcing tepid March quarter results hit by constant currency headwinds. Analysts are mixed on the Vishal Sikka-led company with most brokerages still betting on it but slashed target price and earnings per share (EPS) estimates.

UltraTech Cement on Saturday reported a 24 percent dip in consolidated net profit at Rs 657.2 crore for the fourth quarter of 2014-15, mainly on account of a penalty imposed by CCI on cartelisation charges.

In the same period of last fiscal, UltraTech had registered a turnover of Rs 6,314.86 crore. The company said, the main reason for the dip in its net profit is due to a Rs 117.55 crore payment made as ordered by the Competition Commission of India following charges of cartelisation by the company.

The company also paid Rs 49.86 crore during the quarter towards additional charge on deferred tax due to increase in surcharge on income tax.

Total expenses during the quarter rose to Rs 5,520.63 crore as against Rs 5,287.92 crore in the same period of previous year, owing to higher cost of raw materials. During the quarter, the company commissioned a 2 mtpa clinkerisation plant and a 10 MW waste heat recovery system in Rajasthan. Another 6 MW waste heat recovery system was commissioned in Karnataka.

For the financial year ended March 31, 2015, the country's largest cement maker reported a 4.88 percent drop in its net profit at Rs 2,098.34 crore.

It had registered a turnover of Rs 21,651.5 crore in 2013-14. Cement and clinker sale of grey cement rose to 44.85 million tonnes during the year as against 41.47 million tonnes in 2013-14, the company said. It added, white cement sales stood at 12.25 lakh tonnes during the year-under review as against 11.41 lakh tonnes in the year-ago period.

The company raised its capacity to 60.2 mtpa during the fiscal after it acquired cement plants from the Jaypee Group.

The company's board also declared a 90 percent dividend amounting to Rs 246.96 crore.

Century Textiles, part of the Basant Kumar Birla group, is planning to spin off its cement unit and merge it with India’s largest cement maker UltraTech in an all-share deal, according to media reports.

Century’s cement business could be valued at an enterprise value (EV) of Rs 10,500 crore, implying an EV/tonne of USD 132/tonne, says Goldman Sachs in a research report. The brokerage house estimates current replacement cost for Indian cement assets at USD 135-140.

In the last two years, UltraTech has announced acquisitions of Rs 9200 crore.

Goldman Sachs has a 'neutral' rating on the stock, and a 12-month price target of Rs 3200 for UltraTech.

""While we expect a sector upturn in the medium term, near-term demand is weak and valuations expensive versus history,"" says the Goldman note.

Should the merger go through, Goldman expects a 20 percent increase in UltraTech's domestic capacity, and increased exposure to the West and Central India markets, where much of Century's capacities are concentrated.

The brokerage does not see debt as a big issue, since UltraTech's net borrowings is just 0.6 times its operating profit.

The only issue could be Century's lower operating efficiency with the EBITDA (operating profit) per tonne of cement produced around 46 percent lower than that of UltraTech.

Business and economic cycles are strongly influenced by a country's political genealogy, says PhillipCapital. Though some critics argue that the government has achieved little, the brokerage house finds the mechanics of the government functioning to be sound.

India's business as well as economic cycles turned on sentiment (positive) though some critics argue that the government has achieved little, but PhillipCapital finds the mechanics of the government functioning to be sound.

The brokerage house, in a research report, says big bang reforms while awaited, the long-term growth prospects are set to improve as the focus of the government is capacity creation and improving the system efficiency with a spate of policies and reforms. Significant rise in government capital expenditure, lower inflation and trending down of interest rates are the most palpable outcomes over the near-to-medium term, says PhillipCap.

The brokerage house is introducing 'PhillipCapital Model Portfolio' based on the themes of the uptick in government capital spending, lower interest rates, strong dollar and pick up consumer discretionary spending with focus on value and mid-cap stocks. It is overweight on financials, autos, early cyclicals, pharmaceuticals and underweight on late cyclicals, tobacco and oil and gas.

According to the PhillipCapital Model Portfolio, FY16 will be marked by high degree of volatility and slowing foreign investments. However, valuations are likely to sustain with decreased cost of capital and improvement in earnings visibility,

Its top picks for the year are SBI, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, Coal India, Canara Bank, UltraTech, NCC, Biocon, Tech Mahindra, Dish TV, Maruti, Tata Communications, Kaveri Seeds, Trent and Asian Paints.

Excerpts from the report:

Onset of capacity creation after long phase of distribution: Many economists feel that UPA1's success was borne out of the policies of NDA1, which set capacity creation cycle in motion with public capital spending averaging at 28 percent of GDP, much higher than UPA1 at 23 percent, the adds says.

The cycle was augmented strongly by private investments in UPA1, leading the much-touted investment cycle of 2004-2008 and the key factor of UPA1's success. The FY16 Budget with 26 percent yoy increase in capital expenditure is indicative of BJP's policy framework based on capacity creation. PhillipCap believes that the present government's way of functioning will be similar to NDA1 and much will be achieved in reviving the investment cycle and improving long-term growth prospects.

Structurally a phase of low inflation; cost of funding to come down: The brokerage house expects 75 basis points reduction in interest rates in FY16 as compared to consensus expectations of 25 bps. ""While RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has a hawkish stance on inflation, but a closer look at historical NDA fiscal management policies indicate that inflation will remain structurally low,"" it adds. Maintaining a tight control on finances, reduction of subsidies, capex investments and curtailing of black money mean inflation will trend lower, according to the report.

Focus on efficiency with reforms: The four biggest reforms which have been touted as must-haves are: 1) Tax reforms, 2) Land acquisition, 3) Labour and 4) Irrigation.

Even as critics consider reforms process to be sluggish, PhillipCap says activity on all fronts has gathered pace with the conclusion of one of the most productive Parliament sessions.

Betting on infrastructure and construction sector recovery, Credit Suisse is constructive on cement upcycle over the next 3-4 years and has retained its 'outperform' rating on UltraTech Cement. It prefers companies that are adding capacities and have strong balance sheets that enable it to do so.

“We highlight several projects which could take UltraTech’s capacity from current 75 million tonne to 100 million tonne,” says Credit Suisse.

The brokerage house has identified eight new projects, of which three are near-term - a 2.5 MT plant at Dhar, MP, a 3 MT plant at Nawalgarh, Rajasthan, and a brownfield expansion to 2.4 MT at Awarpur, Maharashtra.

Credit Suisse is also betting on consolidation of BK Birla group assets. It believes the consolidation will be value-accretive, and has the potential to improve profitability of these assets by more than 50 percent.

It further expects cement demand growth to accelerate to 8 percent in FY16 after a weak and meager 4 percent growth clocked in FY15 and margins expansion on the back of supply growth at 6 percent. The brokerage house has a target price of Rs 3900 per share.

Brokerage house Bank of America Merrill Lynch feels India is vulnerable to a near term global correction as too many global fund managers own shares in this market.

“One of our near term concerns has been that investors are very overweight India; this makes India vulnerable to any near term global correction,” says the Merrill Lynch note, adding that a macro recovery appears to be some way off.

“While we are structural bulls on India with an index target of 54,000 by end-2018, we have been highlighting that we see the market being range-bound to negative over next few months,” the note further says.

According to the brokerage, the pace of economic recovery as well as earnings recovery will disappoint investors near term.

“Investors, post their company meetings, seem to agree with our view that valuations were probably pricing in too much of good news. While we think the market will remain expensive through the year, we think it will consolidate for the next 3-6 months,” the note says.

Merrill Lynch is bullish on auto, banks, cement and oil. It expects pharma shares to do well near term as the market consolidates.

Prabhudas Lilladher's top picks report

The free float EPS for NIFTY companies in FY15 is revised downwards to Rs432.6 while the FY16 and FY17 remained more or less unchanged at 512.5 and 610.7 respectively, representing a YoY growth of 6.7%, 18.5% and 19.2% respectively. The major growth in earnings is expected from BFSI at 14.9% in FY15, 21.9% in FY16 and 21.2% in FY17, IT at 15.5%, 13.6% and 12.5% FMCG at 12.8%, 17.6% and 16.6% and Automobiles at 19.3%, 22.3% and 19.2%.

NIFTY at 8,757 is trading at 20.2x FY15E, 17.1x FY16E and at 14.3x FY17E estimated free-float earnings. The last ten-year average for NIFTY’s one-year forward PE is at 15.3x, implying the NIFTY at 17.8x (EPS for year-ending March 2016is Rs512.5) is trading at a premium to its last 10-years average of one-year forward multiple.

The chart on Page 20 indicates MSCI India’s premium to MSCI Asia (excluding Japan) over the last ten years. The average of the last 10-year’s premium was at 26% and the current premium is at 38%. With the better earnings growth among the peers, India still continues to be one of the favoured destination for the FIIs reflected in the increased premium.

With the governments focus on adhering to fiscal discipline, our channel checks indicate that the government spending in 4QFY15 is lower than the expectations. This could lead to disappointment in terms of earnings across the sectors and we expect the recovery to get postponed to 2QFY16 as the government expenditure resumes in 1QFY16 and the effect of it getting reflected in the economy from 2QFY16 onwards. The corporate confidence levels continue to remain high, while the confidence level has not materialized into big ticket investments, our channel checks also indicate that the initial thrust is more on the completion of un finished projects which have been stuck half way. Post the reduction in repo rates by 25bps, the 10 year GSecs too is trading at 7.74%. India continues to remain in a sweet spot with a potential of higher economic growth while most of the economies in the world are struggling to fight its economic woes. Consequently we expect India to attract higher FIIs interest keeping the valuation metrics on elevated levels.

The recent Rabi harvest output has not been encouraging with lower yields, lower production as well as lower than normal increases in MSP. We expect this to have a pressure on the disposable income in the rural areas. Given this, we continue to recommend overweight position in the Financial Services, M&HCVs in the Automobiles, overweight in Infrastructure and IT while remaining Neutral in Capital Goods and Healthcare while remaining underweight in FMCG.

Keeping in mind the possibility of superior economic growth among peers, benefits from benign crude oil prices and the resultant interest from the FIIs, we are revising our Nifty trading range for the market to 8200-9300 levels for the next three months while maintaining the 12 month target of 10,000. While the impact of domestic factors seem to be behind us, the global issues though continue to overshadow the domestic optimism.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Cement space

Ministry of Power (MoP) has proposed competitive allocation of linkage coal for the non-regulated sector.

We believe the auction of existing linkage should impact cement players. But current fuel price dynamics of imported and pet coke favor switching to these alternate fuels in kiln if linkage prices go up. However, dynamics of linkage coal is favorable in captive power plant (CPP).

Regional dynamics are naturally different, with plants in East and Central India likely to have the cost advantage on linkage.

We note the usage of pet coke having meaningful cost benefits in most regions. Our basic analysis on pet coke demand-supply (both globally and in India) highlights sustainability to remain unaffected in the foreseeable future.

""Our positive outlook on cement sector is based on (a) revival of volume growth to 8-10% CAGR over FY16E-18E, (b) slowing down of capacity addition to boost industry utilization to 80%/85% by FY17E/18E (v/s 70%/72% in FY14/15E), (c) increasing consolidation and (d) moderation of cost push. Acceleration of the investment cycle, which is essential for higher demand growth and sustenance of robust pricing, is yet to materialize. However, government’s strong emphasis on infrastructure projects augurs positively for a gradual revival of demand cycle. We continue to prefer players with strong volume levers, efficient operations and healthy balance sheet (or deleveraging visibility). We like UltraTech among large caps, and JK Lakshmi, Dalmia Bharat and JK Cement among mid caps"", says Motilal Oswal research report.

Union Budget 2015-16 analysis by Prabhudas Lilladher:

No big bang announcements: The Budget did not make any big bang announcements, while stressing the need for increasing growth and laying out a roadmap for accelerating growth, enhancing investment and passing the benefit of the growth benefits to the common man. While the GDP estimates as per the revised methodology for FY15 is at 7.4 percent, for FY16 it is targeted at 8-8.5 percent , and a road map is laid out for improving the growth to double digits going forward. While the fiscal deficit for FY15 was maintained at 4.1 percent of GDP, the target set last year to achieve a fiscal deficit of 3.6 percent in FY16 have been revised to 3.9 percent with a road map to achieve a fiscal deficit of 3 percent of GDP by FY18. The additional fiscal spend is expected to go to infrastructure spending which in turn is expected to spur growth.

Capital expenditure to lead to economic recovery: The Finance Minister have assumed a gross tax revenue growth of 15.9 percent in FY16. This translates into an expectation of around 8-8.5 percent growth in the economic growth, and this expected to be achieved through a 35 percent increase in plan capital expenditure, while the total plan expenditure has remained neutral.

Gross tax collection estimates an increase of 14.6 percent to Rs 13.6 lakh crore while the direct taxes are estimated to go up by 13.4 percent and the indirect taxes are expected to see an increase of 19.2 percent. Within the direct taxes, corporate taxes are expected to increase by 10.5 percent to Rs 4.7 lakh crore and the income tax by 17.5 percent to Rs 3.2 lakh crore. Within the indirect taxes, Excise duties are expected to increase by 23.9 percent to Rs 2.29 lakh crore, Customs duty by 15.3 percent to Rs 2.08 lakh crore and the Service tax by 24.8 percent to Rs 2.09 lakh crore.

The subsidies have not seen any increase in FY16. While both the food and fertilizer subsidies have been maintained more or less at the same level as in FY15, the petroleum subsidy has seen a decrease of 50 percent owing to lower crude oil prices. With the beginning of direct transfer of LPG subsidies and low crude prices, the maneuverability of the government to provide less has been high.

The Budget has seen a larger devolution to states from the gross tax collection, and has increased to 36.0 percent in FY16 from a level of 26.9 percent in FY15, thereby implementing the recommendation of the 14th Finance commission which had recommended for passing on higher share of the tax collection to the states.

The total plan expenditure is expected to be at the same level as in FY15 at Rs 4.65 lakh crore versus Rs 4.67 lakh crore in FY15, the capital plan expenditure has seen an increase of 33.8 percent to Rs 1.35 lakh crore versus Rs 1.01 lakh crore.

Defense continues to see a thrust in terms of capital expenditure and is expected to increase by 15.4 percent to Rs 94,600 crore. The major increases in the non plan expenditure stems from interest payments, up 10.9 percent while the food subsidy and fertilizer subsidy has been maintained more or less at the same level as at FY15.

Proceeds from the non tax revenues including telecom fees and dividends & profits are expected to see only a modest growth of 1.8 percent in FY16.

GST is estimated to be implemented from 01 April 2016.

Reducing the corporate taxation by 500 bps to the ASEAN levels of 25 percent, while removing exemptions is one of the key steps taken to simplify the corporate tax mechanism and improve the effective tax rate of the corporate.

With the changes made in the personal income tax exemption levels, with proper tax planning an individual tax payer with an income of Rs 445,000 will be able to have a zero tax.

Tobacco and tobacco products have been seeing heavy taxation in the last few years and this budget too has seen an increase in the same.

The government continues to bring in more services to the tax net and we have seen additional services like theme parks, water parks, rides, toll manufacturers of liquor etc being brought into the service tax net thereby broad basing the target to tax at the consumption levels. Measures against black money could lead to increased tax collections.

We have seen a steady reduction in the capital infusion by the government in the PSU banks. The allocation for FY16 is at Rs 7,900 crore is lower than in FY15.

Creation of Bankruptcy protection law is an important move.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday unveiled a budget that aims to ramp up growth, aided by a slowed pace of fiscal deficit cuts and a raft of tax measures to put private domestic and foreign capital to work.

In his first full-year budget since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's landslide election victory last May, Jaitley said India's economy was about to take off. Modi tweeted that the budget would ""further reignite our growth engine"".

The following sectors/companies will benefit or be hurt by the budget proposals:

WINNERS:

* HOUSING

Jaitley announced an allocation of 224 billion rupees (USD 3.6 billion) for housing and urban development in 2015/16. He said the government plans to build 40 million homes in rural areas and 20 million in urban areas by 2022.

Real estate builders such as DLF Ltd, Oberoi Realty, Godrej Properties and Puravankara Projects are expected to benefit from the proposal.

* ROADS

Jaitley said India will need to build additional 100,000 kilometres of road, which is positive for IRB Infrastructure Developers, GMR Infrastructure and Ashoka Buildcon.

* SANITARY WARE

In his budget speech, Jaitley said the government was on track to achieve its target of building 60 million toilets, which could boost orderbooks of Cera Sanitaryware, HSIL Ltd, Somany Ceramics and Kajaria Ceramics.

* STEEL

The proposal to raise import duties on steel to 15 percent from 10 percent is expected to help local steelmakers like Tata Steel, Jindal Steel and Power, Steel Authority of India and JSW Steel, who have been pressured by rising steel shipments from China and Russia.

* PRIVATE BANKS

Private lenders YES Bank and Axis Bank are seen as beneficiaries of the budget proposal to make no distinctions between foreign direct investments and foreign portfolio investments.

* REITS

Jaitley proposed changing capital gains taxes to pave the way for the listing of real estate investment trusts (REITs), boosting shares of DLF, Phoenix Mills and Prestige Estate Projects.

LOSERS:

* CIGARETTE

The budget raised excise duty on cigarettes by 25 percent for stick length not exceeding 65 mm and by 15 percent for other lengths. The proposal is negative for tobacco companies including ITC Ltd and VST Industries.

* SERVICES:

The finance minister proposed a hike in service tax rates to 14 percent from 12.36 percent. This will make eating out, phone calls, insurance premiums and gym memberships expensive, potentially hurting the companies offering these services.

*CEMENT:

Excise duties were raised on cement, which could impact demand and sales of companies like UltraTech Cement, Ambuja Cements and Star Ferro and Cement.

* PUBLIC SECTOR BANKS:

India will inject USD 1.3 billion into state-owned banks in the next fiscal year to bolster their capital reserves, a smaller-than-expected sum which means the sector's heavyweights may have to turn to the market or curb lending.

Stating that auction of coal mines is one of the top three achievements of the government in its nine months' period, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said the process would bring several lakhs of crores of rupees to the kitty of coal-bearing states.

""I would like to talk of three achievements as they demonstrate the quality and conviction of our government the other is coal auctions,"" he said in his Budget speech.

He further said that earlier ""the states only got benefits of royalty. Now, by the transparent auction process that we are carrying out, the coal-bearing states will be getting several lakhs of crores of rupees"".

The money from e-auction proceeds, he said, could be used for creation of long-awaited community assets and for the welfare of the people. The government had recently auctioned 19 coal blocks in the first lot.

The allocation of coal blocks, including through ongoing auction, will fetch a whopping Rs 15 lakh crore over the next 30 years, for the respective states, Power Minister Piyush Goyal had said on February 19.

Coal Secretary Anil Swarup on Saturday tweeted that ""Finance Minister hails coal block auction and consequent flow of funds to the states as one of the top three achievements of the government"".

""States like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, and MP to benefit the most out of e-auction proceeds"". he had earlier tweeted. The companies that had bagged the 19 blocks on offer include Reliance Cement, GMR Chhattisgarh, Hindalco, Sunflag Iron and Steel, Jaiprakash Associates, Jaiprakash Power Ventures, OCL Iron and Steel, Bharat Aluminium, Essar Power MP, Jindal Power and UltraTech Cement.

The auction of first lot of auction which began on February 14 closed on February 22. However, the government has put off the second round of auction of 21 coal blocks to March. The auction of mines in the second tranche was earlier scheduled to begin from February 25.

The auctions of the mines came after the Supreme Court in September last year cancelled the allocation of 204 coal mines.",349,0.9999992847442627

Ritika Dangemoneycontrol.comIn what comes as a double whammy for the Indian cement sector, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today hiked excise duty by Rs 100 per tonne to Rs 1000 per tonne.

Jaitley in his Budget speech said: Tariff rate of excise duty in goods falling under Chapter sub-heading 2523 29 is being increased from Rs 900 per tonne to 1,000 per tonne.Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu on Thursday announced a 2.7 percent hike in freight rates for cement in the Railway Budget 2015-16. This hike is likely to increase the manufacturing cost for cement by Rs 7-10 per bag and corporates said they’d await the Union Budget before taking a call on raising prices.Cement companies have been under pressure over the past few quarters because of a sluggish economy. While corporate confidence has improved, that is yet to translate into activity on the ground. Weak demand, below average monsoon, falling prices and over-capacity are some of the issues the sector has been grappling with.Indian cement sector contributes 67 percent to the housing sector, 13 percent to infrastructure construction and 11 percent to commercial construction according to data from Invest India, an agency dedicated to investment promotion and facilitation.

The industry was expecting FM Jaitley to announce increased allocation of funds towards critical infrastructure projects that would provide a much needed boost for the sector. The sector was also hoping to get some significant Budget allocation for low-cost housing and for Smart Cities which would lead to a substantial rise in demand.

On the taxation front, the industry was hopeful of getting complete exemption from Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) under 80IA for infrastructure projects. Under the current 18.5 percent rate, companies need to pay MAT on book profit thereby negating the tax benefits it would receive under section 80IA.Here's what was announced in the last Budget:

- A sum of Rs 7060 crore is provided in the current fiscal for the project of developing one hundred Smart Cities.

- Allocation of Rs. 4000 crore through NHB for affordable housing and enhanced allocation to NHB to the tune of Rs. 8000 crore towards the Rural Housing Scheme.

- Five hundred model cities to be built via PPP route.",375,0.13534942269325256

Shares of cement stocks are under pressure as government has hiked freight rates in Rail Budget for FY16. Presenting his maiden Rail Budget, Minister Suresh Prabhu has hiked freight rate by 2.7 percent for cement companies.

The government has also hiked freight rate by 6.3 percent for coal, 10 percent for urea, 0.8 percent for iron & steel companies. However, freight rate is lowered by 1 percent for high speed diesel. The government is eyeing to rake in Rs 1.21 lakh crore in FY16 versus Rs 1.06 lakh crore in FY15.

This may spell trouble for the cement industry as it transports nearly 40 percent of its produce through rail. Earlier in June, government had hiked freight rates by a steep 6.5 percent hike for cement sector.",139,-0.998446136713028

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Cement Sector

India’s cement demand continued to languish due to dismal performance across the prominent sectors, but the disturbing feature of the current weakness was the slide in demand from rural sector. Our channel checks in rural belt suggests that demand was impacted due to poor prices for farm produce (low increase in MSPs), cut in spending in Govt run rural employment guarantee schemes and sluggishness across small-scale businesses including textile, handicraft, etc. The weakness in demand was felt in the form of subdued prices despite being a peak period for activities. However, prices remained strong in South and Maharashtra region on the back of tight discipline among producers.

Northern region- prices fell in the range of Rs10-25/bag in a month: Cement manufacturers hiked prices in January by Rs15-40/bag from 12-month low levels. However, companies had to reverse 2/3rd of the hike in February due to lack of pick-up in demand during the supposedly peak months of activity. It seems unlikely that prices would improve in rest of February and March due to tepid demand outlook, approaching month end and festival in March.

Central region-prices at Dec-lows: Given region’s high dependence on agriculture sector, manufacturers were able to hike prices by mere Rs10/bag in January. However, the entire hike was reversed in February with current prices back to Dec-lows.

Southern region- prices at all-time high: Supported by tight industry discipline, prices in the region are up by Rs40-60/bag from Dec-14 lows. Unlike rest of the regions, prices remained stable in the region during February with no impression of weak demand and overcapacity.

Western region-Maharashtra lacks stability; Gujarat prices unchanged: Thanks to strong discipline from South based producers on supplies as well as prices, prices in Mumbai/Pune/Nagpur rose by Rs25/70/30 in January. However, manufacturers were compelled to cut prices by Rs10/50/30 during last one month due to lack of demand. In Gujarat, entire hike of Rs30 undertaken in January was undone during February.

Valuation and outlook: We remain confident that cement demand would improve in Q2FY16 onwards on the back of higher budget allocation to infrastructure sector; pick-up in housing demand aided by lower interest rates and revival of investment cycle with the series of policy initiatives undertaken by the Govt. We continue to believe that the recovery in demand, slowing pace of capacity addition and exit of weaker players would drive the fundamental shift in earnings of sector. Ultratech and JK Lakshmi remains our top picks in the sector.

Aditya Birla Group firm Grasim Industries today reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 333.61 crore for the third quarter ended December 2014. The company had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 331.93 crore during the same period of previous financial year, Grasim Industries said in a filing to the BSE.

The company reported consolidated net sales of Rs 7,888.53 crore in October-December period as against Rs 7,063.43 crore during the same quarter of last financial year.

The consolidated revenue from its Viscose Staple Fibre (VSF) and Wood Pulp segment was Rs 1,607.26 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs 1,613.45 crore in the same period of last fiscal. Its consolidated revenue from cement division was Rs 5,947.15 crore this quarter. It was Rs 5,169.59 crore in third quarter of FY14.

Revenue from chemicals division was Rs 441.63 crore this quarter as against Rs 259.73 crore in same period last fiscal. Grasim Industries said ""figures for the quarter and nine months ended December 2014 are strictly not comparable with previous periods"" due to merger of Gujarat cement units of Jaypee Cement with UltraTech Cement, a subsidiary of the company. On the company's performance, Grasim Industries said: ""Implementation of growth plans led to significant capacity increase in both VSF and cement businesses.

At the greenfield VSF project at Vilayat, 99K TPA capacity has been commissioned during the year. With acquisition of Jaypee cement units in Gujarat, the cement capacity increased by 4.8 million."" On the outlook, the company said VSF sector will continue to face headwinds for some more time due to over capacity and sharp reduction in price of cotton and polyester. Moreover, cement segment would grow as demand growth in the long term is likely to be over eight per cent.

""With additional capacity coming on stream in both the businesses, the company will further consolidate its leadership position,"" it added.",325,0.361686110496521

Grasim Industries' third quarter standalone profit after tax is expected to increase 2 percent year-on-year to Rs 128 crore, according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Total income of the Aditya Birla Group company is seen rising 5 percent to Rs 1,540 crore during October-December quarter from Rs 1,470 crore in the year-ago period.

However, operating profit may fall 14 percent year-on-year to Rs 180 crore and margin may decline 250 basis points to 11.7 percent in the quarter gone by.

Consolidated numbers of the company already discounted in the share price through UltraTech earnings. Grasim holds 60.3 percent stake in UltraTech Cement. Ultratech contributes more than 70 percent to the topline and bottomline of consolidated Grasim numbers.

Factors:

Weak viscose staple fibre (VSF) price may continue to result in muted earnings

VSF business may continue to be under pressure with prices showing little strength. VSF volumes are estimated to remain flat on year-on-year basis.

Grasim may post a 2-3 percent drop in VSF realisations as global prices remain subdued.

Key issues to watch out for are:

Outlook on VSF business and strategy to utilise upcoming capacities globally

Cement business outlook on demand and pricing, and status of capacity addition.",214,-0.47917866706848145

Prabhudas Lilladher's report on UltraTech Cement

""UltraTech Cement (UTCEM) reported Q3FY15 earnings in line with our expectation but below the consesus estimates. Ultratech (UTCEM) has been the most aggressive among its peers in adding capacity through both organic and inorganic route. Thanks to its highly efficient operations and sizeable capacity, UTCEM would be the key player to benefit from the strong outlook on demand.""

""Street is extremely enthusiastic on the sector due to steep price hikes undertaken by the producers in last couple of months. On the contrary, we weigh little significance to these hikes due to lacking support from demand. However, we see the price hikes to become more constructive Q1FY16 onwards when demand would start recovering gradually on the back of lower interest rates, lower inflation and most importantly, series of initiatives undertaken by the Govt to revitalise the investment cycle. In this backdrop, we like UTCEM on the back of its strong scale of operations and quality management. We maintain our ‘Accumulate’ rating with TP of Rs 3,700"", says Prabhudas Lilladher research report.

Arihant capital markets' research report on UltraTech Cement

Ultratech’s (ULTC) 3QFY15 numbers were largely in line with the estimates largely driven by increased volume. During the quarter standalone sales volume increased by 8.2% to 10.5 MT while blended realizations increased by 6.0%. EBITDA margins increased by 58 bps to 17.1% on YoY basis, this is largely attributed to increase in realizations and lower raw material cost. EBITDA per ton increased to Rs. 885 from Rs. 820 on YoY basis.ULTCs standalone revenue came in at Rs 5,601 cr vs. Rs. 4,818 crs, a growth of 16.3% on YoY basis. However, PAT declined by 1.5% to Rs 364 crs because of higher interest cost and higher taxes.

The Company’s on-going capex is on track and capacity post expansion will increase to 71 MTPA by 2016. During the quarter ULTC acquired 2 plants of Jaiprakash with combined clinker capacity of 5.3 MTPA and cement capacity of 4.9 MTPA together with Thermal power plant capacity of 180 MW for a consideration of Rs 5,325 crs. With this the Company’s total cement capacity in India stands at 65.1 Mnt and the total power capacity (including WHRS) at 913 MW. This caters to around 80 % of the Company’s power requirement.

Outlook: ULTC volumes are expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% over next 2 years (partly attributed to acquisition of Jaypee cement). Prices are also expected to firm up as demand for cement from infrastructure projects are slated to rise exponentially. We are very positive on the prospects of the sector.

Valuations:""We expect revival in investment cycle over long term, however, over short to medium term issues like weak demand and excess capacity will continue to hit earnings of the company. We forecast ULTC’s EBITDA margins to increase to 23.7% from the current level of 18.6% over next two year on the back of expected strong pricing environment and lower transportation cost. We continue to value stock using EV/EBITDA(x) and have ascribed EV/EBITDA(x) of 12x to its FY16E EBITDA. Our fair value for Ultratech comes at Rs. 3,430 per share. We recommend ‘HOLD’ rating on the stock"", says Arihant capital markets research report.

While the market may be worried about fiscal stress in FY15, brokerage house house Credit Suisse government can raise capex by at least 1.2 percent of GDP in FY16.

“The gains pocketed from falling oil prices could be used for counter-cyclical pump-priming. A further 0.9 percent of GDP can come from the new GDP series and a slight push-out of deficit targets,” the brokerage said in its note to clients.

“This fiscal expansion could drive a 0.75-1.00 percentage point addition to growth, driving outperformance of the broader India market. In particular, rising expenditure on roads and housing should drive a pick-up in cement and paints demand,” the note said.

Credit Suisse has upgraded its ratings for UltraTech Cement and Asian Paints to outperform. It expects heavy engineering major L&T to reverse its underperformance since the elections, with an improving order visibility.

“We expect banks to benefit from improved loan growth, and raise our target price of Axis Bank,” the Credi Suisse note said.",175,0.5029015243053436

Shares of UltraTech Cement rose 5 percent intraday on Tuesday after Morgan Stanley has said, in a note, that cement companies have raised prices across region.

The brokerage said that relative to recent cement price lows, the highest increases are in the South and North, followed by the West and East. This implies an increase of around 2-10 percent relative to recent lows in various regions. However, it also added that the demand trend is still subdued across regions.

“There is an expectation of a pickup in volumes in QE March 2015, but our channel checks suggest that incremental on-ground activity remains subdued for now and visibility of a meaningful demand pickup remains low. We believe that a pickup in project-related demand is key for demand to improve along expected lines,” Morgan Stanley added.

Meanwhile, media report suggests the Kumar Mangalam Birla-run company has dropped out of race for Holcim-Lafarge assets which was perceived as a big overhang on the stock.

At 14:46 hrs UltraTech Cement was quoting at Rs 2,802.50, up Rs 101.25, or 3.75 percent on the BSE.",192,-0.33228786786397296

ICICIdirect.com's report on UltraTech Cement

""The board of UltraTech has approved the acquisition of cement assets of Jaiprakash Associates in Madhya Pradesh (MP) at an EV of Rs 5400 crore. The assets acquired include two integrated units with 5.2 MT clinker capacity (2.1 MT at Bela + 3.1 MT at Sidhi) and 4.9 MT cement capacity (2.6 MT at Bela + 2.3 MT at Sidhi) along with 180 MW captive thermal power plants. Since the higher clinker capacity would entitle the company to sell ~7.3 MT cement, this would enable the company to augment its cement capacity by 2.4 MT with capex of ~Rs 500 crore. Considering these benefits, we believe the consideration, to be paid by the company, looks attractive (i.e. an EV of $135/tonne vs. current replacement cost of $150/tonne). Further, this acquisition reinforces the company’s focus on the Indian market. Hence, we continue to remain positive on the company and maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 3240"", says ICICIdirect.com research report.

Top 10 largecap picks for 2015 by Karvy

Stellar Performance of Indian Equities

Indian equities had outperformed major global indices, barring China during CY2014, mainly driven by MODIfied political and investment scenario. Among the domestic factors, Lok Sabha elections 2014, in which BJP under the leadership of Mr Modi had got the decisive mandate removing the political uncertainty and brought hopes for good governance. Sharp drop in crude oil prices and stronger rupee had improved fiscal health and led to a turnaround in Indian macros. Globally, steady recovery in the US economy had led to the US Fed ended the QE and readying for increase in interest rates, confirming the healthy recovery in the worlds’ largest economy.

Our Wealth Maximizer 2014 performed well with Nine out of ten stocks exceeding the targets. We retain six out of the ten stocks and replaced four stocks due to expected under-performance in the next few quarters.

Outlook for 2015Economic growth to reach 6.5%-7.0% during 2015 driven by good governance under the leadership of Mr. Modi: During the year 2015, Indian economic growth could be driven by reform momentum. The government has taken the initiatives to introduce GST, land acquisition amendments, insurance sector reforms and coal blocks auction bills. Under the ‘Make in India’ campaign, Govt is opening opportunities for domestic manufacturing in Defence, Electronics Hardware & Medical equipment from the 25 sectors identified to be given priority. The ordinance route chosen by the government for three out of the above four bills indicates the urgency in reviving the economic growth.

Interest rate cuts to help in credit growth: Expectations over RBI cutting the interest rates by over 50 basis points were reflected in 10Year G-Sec yields. The reduction in interest rates coupled with the improving business climate could trigger a pick-up in credit cycle.

Subdued inflation amid softening commodity prices: Crude oil prices after falling nearly 40% in 2014, are expected to remain soft in 2015 due to supply glut and lack of consensus among OPEC countries to cut the production. Expectations over lower consumption from China, European Union and lower import demand from the US could keep the global crude oil price under check.

Up-cycle in interest rates in the US reflects confidence about the sustainability of growth: US Fed is expected to increase the interest rates by up to 75 bps during 2015, for the first time after 2006, amid expectations over strong recovery in GDP growth to around 3%. The sharp increase could result in outflow of capital from emerging markets to the US. However, rising interest rates reaffirm the health of the US economic recovery.

Improved macros could bring stability in Indian currency markets: Amid expectations over lower fiscal deficit of 4% and current account deficit of 2%, on the back of lower import bills for crude oil and gold, INR is expected to display relative strength during 2015.

Sustainability of earnings growth: Corporate earnings in India are expected to grow over 15%-18% during 2015, which is likely to be revised further based on improvement on execution at ground level, softening commodity prices and sustainability of the global growth momentum.

Large equity issuance through disinvestment: Large equity issuances either to comply with SEBI guidelines on minimum public holding or new issuances like RINL could help the Government in meeting the disinvestment target as well as keep the IPO market buoyant.

Money flows into Indian equities to remain robust during 2015: Indian equities continue to be the 2nd best performing asset in the world equity markets, as well as the best performing asset class in India. Indian equities are expected to attract FII inflows in 2015, that were around Rs 97,600 cr in 2014. Amid political/economic stability, direct participation of retail investors has increased, while retail participation through mutual funds has also risen as indicated by the increase in individual folios by 8.4 lakh during Apr-Nov 2014, reflecting confidence among the retail investors on Indian equities.

Our take on the marketWe expect Sensex to trade in the band of 27720 - 35640. There could be short-term volatility as markets have priced in growth post the elections and multiples are at the middle of the trading band. The Sensex consensus EPS for FY15E is Rs.1635 and for FY16E is Rs.1980, implying a P/E band of 14 - 18x for FY16EPS. Sensex currently trades at 14x FY16E EPS. We remain overweight on Automobiles, BFSI, Cement, Consumer Goods, Infrastructure, Metals, Software and Pharma.

We expectEarnings upgrades and in a more conducive environment for the businesses, corporate earnings are expected to grow over 18% in the next one year

On ground execution of the capex cycle to pick up

Stable currency and improved government finances along with a decline in inflation likely to present the case for lower interest rates

Growing income levels and better job prospects trigger for higher domestic consumption

Overall, the scenario is conducive for cyclicals, manufacturing and export oriented sectors. With the expected growth in corporate earnings, continued inflow of funds from FII’s and renewed interest from the domestic investors, we expect equities to outperform other asset classes in the next one year and recommend to stay invested in equities.

Wealth Maximizer 2015: Our top ten Largecap picks in the Wealth Maximizer (for a time frame of 9-12 months) are Asian Paints, Divis Lab, HDFC Bank, ITC, JSW Steel, L&T, Reliance Industries, Tata Motors, TCS and Ultratech Cement.

Shares of UltraTech Cement rose 5 percent intraday on Wednesday after it announced acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates ' two cement units and associated power plants in Madhya Pradesh for Rs 5400 crore. Shares of JP Associates jumped 6 percent.

Post this sale, JP Associates, the flagship company of the group will retain the position of the third-largest cement maker in the country by paring its debt considerably.

However, Kotak maintains a sell rating on UltraTech with a revised target of Rs 2300 per share. It states that the enterprise value of Rs 5400 crore appears to be steep when seen in the context of recent transactions, including Rs 3800 crore (USD 123/ton) paid by UltraTech to acquire the cement assets of Jaiprakash in Gujarat.

“However, the same should be seen in the context of clinker facilities that can support another 2.5 mtpa of cement grinding capacity. Adjusted for the higher quantum of clinker capacity, the acquisition appears more reasonable at USD 125-140/ton,” it says in a report.

The brokerage feels that the acquisition will likely be marginally earnings dilutive (3-4 percent) in the near term even after factoring 80 percent utilisation and profitability comparable to UltraTech. “However, in the long term it helps Ultratech further consolidate its position as the premier manufacturer of cement in India, increasing in presence in Madhya Pradesh,” it adds.

At 12:14 hrs UltraTech Cement was at Rs 2,656.10, up Rs 116.50, or 4.59 percent while Jaiprakash Associates was at Rs 24.70, up Rs 1.25, or 5.33 percent on the BSE.

Brokerage house Deutsche Securities has raised its target price of UltraTech Cement by 4 percent to Rs 3050 after the company Tuesday announced its acquisition of two cement plans of JP Associates.

The brokerage has also trimmed its target price for JP Associates by 14 percent to Rs 27.50 saying the enterprise value per tonne of around USD 130 was lower than the estimate of USD 160 factored in the earlier target price.

Three takeaways from the deal, according to Deutsche:

(excerpts from the Deutsche note to clients)

* Firstly for the industry, this deal (unlike the Holcim Lafarge transaction – with regards to the Indian assets), may not attract as much attention of competition commission given the assets are in the Satna cluster – the one major cement cluster in India where UltraTech does not have presence.

* Secondly for UltraTech, like in the case of the previous transaction (Gujarat asset acquisition), this too has happened much below the replacement cost. More importantly, unlike the previous transaction where the cement EBITDA was less than US$5, these assets are amongst the most profitable cement units of JPA

* Lastly for JPA, while the continued efforts to reduce debt augurs well, the valuation realized on sale of assets below current replacement cost is not that encouraging.",225,-0.18125040531158448

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Ajay Hans, managing director, Petron Engineering Construction shares his views on the latest order bagged by the company.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview to CNBC-TV18.

Reema: The company recently won some orders. Could you tell us the total size of the order wins and what the order book currently stands at?

A: This is a recent order that we have bagged and this is around Rs 25 crore, these two projects and the current order backlog is around Rs 1,200 crore for us which is decent considering the size of our company today.

Ekta: Can you tell us what your future bidding will look like and what is the average margin that you would be executing on these orders that you have in hand?

Related stories Ajay Hans MD|Petron Engineering Construction

A: Practically, this market is very competitive as we are operating in a very critical industry. We are working for all construction business for civil, mechanical, electrical, instrumental, refractory insulation and commissioning services and these are specifically for industries like cement, steel, power. We are carrying our quite critical works. So as the market is opening, the capital market people are investing, I see good opportunity in near future and margin should certainly be better once more opportunity comes to the market.

Ekta: What about the future bidding. What is your project pipeline in terms of bidding?

A: We are doing very specific bidding with specific clients and we are looking for long-term relationship with the industry and we have a history of getting repeat of orders, like these two orders also, its like repeat order to us, with NCC we are already executing the mechanical erection package and these are additional package which have been awarded to us for critical piping. Cement and power are two areas where we would be quite prominent in future and we have executed lot of such projects in the past with the industry. Petron is a known entity in the industry for executing these projects.

Reema: For how many more quarters do you expect a loss?

A: We expect to improve every quarter on quarter and as the capital market is going to get open, we expect from the next monsoon onwards lot of order should flow in, there are not enough competent contracts which are available currently specifically carrying out the construction activities and we are doing hardcore construction activities. So we see that good number of order should flow.

Reema: But you still likely to be loss making even through the whole of FY16?

A: Cannot say right now but we would be improving a lot and that’s what I can say right now.

Ekta: Can you tell us what your debt cost look like though your finance cost is on a low base, what is concerning is that in the previous quarter it jumped up 30 percent on year on year basis, are you seeing any working capital issues or any delay in payment which is taking place?

A: We are carrying out projects where some of these projects are Gas Authorities of India as well as Indian Oil Corporation where payment terms are back ended. Similarly we are in the stage of completion in many projects or recently completed like Lafarge, Adani Power, so all these payments are now started flowing in and all these projects almost reached at a stage of 90-95 percent completion, so these back ended payments have started coming in which has already eased our liquidity position and cash flow working capital requirement will go down in near future.

Reema: What the current receivables, if you could give us the number as well as the total working capital loans right now?

A: As of date the total working capital loans all together would be in the range of Rs 100 crore and receivables are more than Rs 150 crore as of date.

Reema: How much of these receivables would you receive by the end of this fiscal year that is March 2015?

A: I expect at least 30 percent of these receivables should come in because some of these receivables go on cyclic basis because in construction industry you carry out the work first and then you bill and then you wait for these payments, so it is not advance kind of thing. One-two month kinds of things are always available on credit.

Ekta: Can you give us a sense in terms of who your repeat clients are, for example where do you get majority of your orders from, which clients and how much of your order book comprises of repeat orders versus fresh orders?

A: We are prominent in getting repeat orders and that shows the credibility of Petron in the market like Indian Oil Corporation though this is a government concern where we get these orders through proper L1 bidding kind of system but in the private sector we are working with Lafarge, we have received orders from UltraTech around six months back we have received a repeat order from UltraTech from grinding unit in Nagpur, from Madras Cement, which is now known as Ramco Cement, we are getting continuous orders from them for almost more than last five years and we are associated with them for ten years. We target the clients and provide the services in order to get long-term association with them; we look forward for a long-term association and accordingly work for it.",923,0.20519691705703735

The downtrend could persist next week followed the disastrous October IIP figure of negative 4.2 percent announced post market Friday. While inflation continued to drift lower, weakness in industrial output during the festive season is clearly a cause for concern.

Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite, GAIL, BHEL, JSPL, Reliance and ONGC, L&T, Cairn India and Infosys slid between 6-12.5 percent lower, faring among biggest Nifty losers this week.

Sun Pharma, Coal India, UltraTech Cement, ITC bucked the trend, gaining between 1-2.4 percent this week.

Weakness was ubiquitous this week, with broader markets at the center of profit-taking. BSE Small Cap and CNX Midcap indices were down 3.4-3.8 percent, performing slightly better than the benchmarks.

Diamond Power, Bombay Burmah, HCL Info, Havells, India Cements, HDIL, Rel Comm, HCC and Unitech lost between 10-43 percent on the bourses, on a weekly basis. Investors booked profits this week amid weak global cues and mixed signals domestically. The start of the week saw India's current account deficit widen to US$10.1bn in the second quarter of 2014-15 from US$7.8bn (1.7% of GDP) in the preceding quarter. A bump in imports and slowing of exports led to the widening of the gap. The Finance Minister however said there was no cause for concern since FII and FDI flows were adequate to finance the deficit.

Globally, Chinese benchmark Shanghai Composite fell almost 6 percent sending shockwaves in the region in particular and the rest of the world in general. The blame was put on new restrictions imposed by the government on corporate bond market and subdued growth outlook for the country.

Stocks of metal companies, which depend on exports to China took a beating owing to weakness in China.

The scenario wasn't all rosy back home either as some of the founders sold their stake in the blue-chip software behemoth -Infosys- which gently rattled investor sentiment and caused turmoil in benchmark indices on that day, somewhat setting a precedent for profit taking for the week ahead.

Government's reforms agenda has taken a blow on the chin, as latest reports from CNBC-TV18 suggest that the much awaited GST Bill might be tabled in the budget session of the parliament in 2015 and not in the ongoing winted session, owing to ongoing differences between centre and states on inclusion of petroleum in the bill's ambit among other issues.

This weakness hasn't deterred Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint MD, Motilal Oswal, who in an interview with CNBC-TV18 that market could see a correction near term, but it made sense only for traders to book profits now and get in at lower prices. For those looking to benefit from the secular bull market over the next few years, it would pay to sit tight and ignore market fluctuations.

Energy stocks slumped as oil prices hit five and half year lows even as IEA lowered it's demand outlook. Brent crude which was last seen trading at USD63-a-barrel, has dropped 40 percent since July. BSE oil & gas index lost 7.3 percent owing to a weak demand.

What's Next

Investors will keep a watch on FOMC meet and US employment data next week. Better than expected job figures might prompt Fed to hike interest rates earlier, which in turn is likely to rattle stock markets globally",558,-0.4956323504447937

Motilal Oswal's report on cement sector

Weak October/November pricing dents 3Q expectationsQTD 3Q prices down INR3-10/bag QoQ; volumes picked up in November

November 2014 volumes have witnessed strong growth across regions on low base of last year and last month (both impacted by festive), with several key companies have reported strong growth (8%-30%) across regions. However, volume growth portrays different picture vis-à-vis actual weak demand momentum at the ground, as indicated by our channel checks.

There were MoM decline of ~INR6/bag in monthly average prices (range of INR2-15/bag) over October/ November 2014. This translate into ~INR7/bag QoQ decline in QTD 3Q v/s our assumption of ~INR7/bag increase (range INR2-10/bag QoQ). Regionally, there were QoQ declines of INR7-8/bag in North, Central and West; INR10/bag in South and INR3/bag in East.

Our current pricing assumptions translates into INR200/ton QoQ increase in EBITDA in 3QFY15 - largely price led and positive operating leverage. However, in the event of no major price recovery in December, there would be downside risk to our pricing assumption and EPS estimates. However, we foresee limited risk to our FY16/FY17 estimates.

Related stories

We remain positive for medium term growth outlook, we would be monitoring for real pick-up at ground level driven by commencement of investment cycle, which is essential of sustained demand growth. Near term growth would be aided by favorable base, as volume growth between Dec-13 to Apr-14 was ~2.8% YoY.

""We are positive on players with strong volume levers, efficient operations, and healthy balance sheet (or deleveraging visibility). We prefer UltraTech among large caps, and Dalmia Bharat and JK Cement among midcaps"", says Motilal Oswal research report.

Moneycontrol Bureau

JP Morgan expects GDP growth to accelerate to 6 percent by next fiscal year from the estimated 5.1 percent on the back of combined backdrop of low inflation, improved confidence and continued policy support.

In its latest report, the research firm has said the new government’s initial policy measures have been encouraging. Moreover, it views focus on fiscal consolidation, ease of doing business and diesel price deregulation as significant medium-term positives.

“We expect the policy momentum to remain favourable and expect further developments on GST, the Land Acquisition Bill and increased FDI in the insurance sector to further aid the growth revival. The sharp fall in global commodity prices has improved the inflation and interest rate outlook,” the report said.

Bullish on cyclicals, JP Morgan sees the sector benefitting from the likely revival in growth momentum and expects a relatively benign liquidity environment to support corporate profitability. It also expects financials to be a key beneficiary of the expected trend.

Its top picks are cyclical stocks, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Tata Steel, Grasim and Infosys.

Grasim

JP Morgan expects Grasim to likely benefit from a pickup in volume growth with scope of improvement in operating margin. Grasim trades at ~40 percent discount versus its subsidiary UltraTech Cement and the research firm expects the discount to narrow as the cement cycle improves. “With input costs now trending down, VSF volumes increasing from expansion and product mix improving as specialty grade picks up, we expect higher margins in FY16,” the note said.

JP Morgan prefers Grasim over UltraTech with a price target of Rs 4500 as it believes the latter is already pricing in a volume plus margin recovery in cement, while Grasim is not.

HDFC Bank

JP Morgan is overweight on HDFC Bank with a price target of Rs1,100 as it believes that the stock is best defensive play in the current environment, given its “stable margins, healthy asset quality, consistent performance and superior management”.

It feels the private sector lender’s strong rural push is likely to deepen the liability franchise further and could be a significant advantage in the longer term.

“We believe current valuations are reasonable in the context of high return ratios and consistency in performance for the bank across cycles,” the note said.

ICICI Bank

It remains overweight on ICICI Bank with a price target of Rs1,900 as it expects the bank’s revenue momentum to remain strong, driven by improving margins, robust retail fee income and strong retail loan growth. It forsees ICICI’s return on equity rising continuously through FY16 to the upper teens.

“We believe the bank’s strong capital base is a significant advantage over competitors (especially PSUs), as they may have to forsake growth to preserve capital,” the note said.

Infosys

Expecting a benefit from the new management focus and favourable growth expectations in the US, JP Morgan stays overweight on Infosys with a price target of Rs 4,200, which is based on a one-year forward P/E of 16.5x, a modest discount to TCS’s target multiple of 19.0x.

“We believe the discount is justified as TCS’s superior revenue growth and margin profile,” the note said, adding that downside risks are weakness in demand environment, pressure on realizations, an adverse US immigration bill, excessively disruptive strategy to drive growth, meaningful INR (vs the US$), and continued higher-than-expected attrition.

Tata Steel

According to JP Morgan, Tata Steel is well-positioned to benefit from demand improvement in both India and Europe with spare capacity available in Europe and new capacity being commissioned in India. It expects the company’s debt levels to come down in FY15E as EBITDA generation picks up and capex comes down.

“We believe the stock should continue to re-rate as: India and European demand cycle continue to improve and volume growth from new capacity in India drives earnings; improving FCF resulting in receding debt levels; iron ore issues in Odisha/Jharkhand being resolved,” the note said.

Arihant capital markets research report on UltraTech Cement “Ultratech’s (ULTC) 2QFY15 numbers were largely in line with the estimates largely driven by increased volume. During the quarter sales volume increased by 12.9% to 10.7 MT while realizations increased by 5.1%. EBITDA margins increased by 113 bps to 16% on YoY basis, this is largely attributed to increase in realizations. EBITDA per ton increased to Rs. 823 from Rs. 747 on YoY basis. ULTCs reported revenue came in at Rs 5,429 cr vs. Rs. 4,522 crs, a growth of 20.1% on YoY basis. However, PAT increased at a faster pace of 55.3% to Rs 410 crs helped by higher realization and lower tax outgo. The Company’s on-going capex is on track. ULTC commissioned a 1.4 MnT cement mill at Rajashree Cement, Karnataka and a 25MW thermal power plant at Tadipatri, Andhra Pradesh. With this the Company’s total cement capacity in India stands at 60.2 Mnt and the total power capacity (including WHRS) at 733 MW. This caters to around 80 % of the Company’s power requirement. Outlook: ULTC volumes are expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% over next 2 years (partly attributed to acquisition of Jaypee cement). Prices are also expected to firm up as demand for cement from infrastructure projects are slated to rise exponentially. We are very positive on the prospects of the sector.” “We expect revival in investment cycle over long term, however, over short to medium term issues like weak demand and excess capacity will continue to hit earnings of the company. We forecast ULTC’s EBITDA margins to increase to 25.2% from the current level of 18.6% over next two year on the back of expected strong pricing environment. We continue to value stock using EV/EBITDA(x) and have ascribed EV/EBITDA(x) of 10x to its FY16E EBITDA. Our fair value for Ultratech comes at Rs. 2,872 per share. We recommend ‘ACCUMULATE’ rating on the stock,” says Arihant capital markets research report.

Aditya Birla Group company Grasim Industries' second quarter profit after tax fell 27.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 299 crore on standalone basis (includes viscose staple fibre and chemicals businesses) impacted by weak operational performance and higher tax cost. Profit in the year-ago period was Rs 413.5 crore.

Total income from operations grew by 12.6 percent to Rs 1,600 crore in the quarter ended September 2014 compared to Rs 1,421 crore in same quarter last year.

The company's earnings beat street expectations on every front. Profit degrowth was expected at 40 percent on revenue growth of 7 percent while operating profit and margin were expected to fall 42 percent and 900 basis points, respectively.

Operating profit declined 22.8 percent on yearly basis to Rs 214 crore and margin dropped 610 basis points to 13.4 percent in the quarter gone by, impacted by higher power and fuel cost.

Total expenses jumped 21 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,448.30 crore during the quarter due to higher power and fuel, and raw material cost while tax expenses jumped 8.3 times to Rs 54.5 crore from Rs 6.6 crore in the same period.

Revenue from its chemicals (caustic soda and allied chemicals) business climbed 63.8 percent Y-o-Y to Rs 416 crore with EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin falling 550 basis points to 13.2 percent in July-September quarter.

Viscose staple fibre revenue increased 5 percent to Rs 1,271 crore with EBIT margin declining 780 basis points to 8.9 percent during the same period.

As far as VSF sector is concerned, Grasim said margins are likely to remain under pressure in the near term due to the overcapacity in China.

""Sharply declining cotton and polyester prices is a major challenge and may impact the growth of VSF consumption. The slowdown in new capacity additions in China should lead to an improvement in industry utilisation which augurs well for the company. The focus on cost optimisation will continue relentlessly,"" it added.

The company has commissioned two lines of viscose staple fibre with an aggregate capacity of 77,000 MT per annum at Vilayat, Gujarat during the quarter.

Above numbers were on standalone basis while consolidated numbers include cement business also. UltraTech Cement contributes more than 70 percent to the consolidated topline and bottomline of Grasim as Grasim holds more than 60 percent stake in UltraTech.

Consolidated profit fell by 7.5 percent on yearly basis to Rs 416.4 crore while revenue jumped 16 percent to Rs 7,945.5 crore during the quarter. Higher power & fuel, freight, finance cost and tax expenses hit the bottomline.

At 13:53 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 3,408, up Rs 28.10, or 0.83 percent on the BSE.",457,-0.14603960514068604

ICICIdirect.com`s research report on UltraTech Cement “UltraTech’s Q2FY15 standalone revenue of Rs 5,381.8 crore remained higher than our estimates (Rs 5190.5 crore) led by strong volumes and better realisation. On consolidated basis, its topline grew by 18% YoY to Rs5,723 crore led by capacity expansion and additional volumes from acquired unit in Gujarat. However, high input cost and additional cost relating newly plant put some pressure on margins. As a result, EBITDA of Rs 779/tonne remained lower than our estimates (Rs 859/tonne). However, it was higher by 10.7% YoY on account of better realisations. The company’s on going capex are on track. During the quarter, company commissioned 1.4MT cement mill at Karnataka and 25MW power plant at AP. With this new cement capacity along with 4.8MT Jaypee unit, its capacity has reached 60.2MT which is inline with our capacity expansion target.” “UltraTech Cement is the largest player in terms of capacity (60.2 MT including Jaypee plant) with market share of ~17% in India. The company has consistently remained ahead of its peers in terms of capacity expansion with CAGR of 23% vs. peer’s CAGR of 13% over the past five years. During the quarter, UltraTech included earnings from the recently acquired Jaypee Cement Corporation Ltd from June 12, 2014. Other than that, the company has commissioned a 25 MW thermal power plant at Andhra Pradesh and 6.5MW waste heat recovery system at Awarpur, Maharashtra. With this, the total power capacity of the company (including WHRS) stands at 733 MW, which is around 80% of the company’s power requirement. Further, the company is aiming to reach its total capacity of 70 MT by FY16E, which we believe would help it to maintain its leadership, going forward. We expect the company to grow at a higher rate than the industry in the coming years led by capacity expansion. The same has also been reflected in the current quarter result with volume growth of 13.6% YoY. Further, given the likelihood of higher spending on infra development coupled with a rebound in economic growth, we expect a strong demand recovery from H2FY15E onwards. UltraTech, being the largest pan-India player, would be one of the major beneficiaries of a demand recovery with a stronger presence in the western and northern regions.” “Being a net debt free company, UltraTech is well positioned to reap the benefit of a recovery in demand and generate healthy free cash flows in future. The stock is currently trading at 12.3x and 9.3x EV/EBITDA for FY16E and FY17E, respectively, against last four year’s average valuations of 13.0x. We value the stock at 12.0x its FY17E thereby arriving at a target price of Rs 3180 with BUY rating on the stock,” says ICICIdirect.com research report.

Sharekhan`s research report on UltraTech Cement“For Q2FY2015 the company reported a revenue growth of 19.5% YoY to Rs5,381.8 crore largely driven by a higher volume (up 12% YoY) and an increased realisation (up 7% YoY). A higher input cost (increase in pet coke price and high freight cost) limited the growth in the OPM, which improved by 76BPS to 15.4%. Additionally, a higher other income (up 112% YoY) led to a 55% Y-o-Y growth in the reported PAT for the quarter at Rs410.1 crore, which included a lower depreciation charge (adjusting for the same the earnings for the quarter grew by 37% YoY to Rs361.9 crore).” “During the quarter the company commissioned a 1.4MMT cement mill at Rajashree Cement, Karnataka and with this the total capacity of the company increased to 60.2MMT (4.8MMT of capacity added from two plants of Jaypee Cement). The company also commissioned a 25-MW thermal power plant at Tadipatri, Andhra Pradesh, taking its total capacity of power to 733MW (ie 80% of the total requirement).” “UltraTech Cement is our preferred stock in the cement space due to its strong balance sheet and pan-India presence. However, as per media reports, the company’s plan to acquire the Holcim-Lafarge assets in the developed markets can increase its leverage and hamper Ultratech’s valuation, considering lower growth potential in the developed markets. We have revised our earnings estimate for FY2015 downwards after factoring in the increase in leverage. We have rolled forward our valuation to the FY2016 estimate and arrived at a revised price target of Rs2,935. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock,” says Sharekhan research report.

Prabhudas Lilladher`s research report on UltraTech Cement“UltraTech Cement (UTCEM) reported Q2FY15 earnings above our expectation on account of higher than expected realisations, despite lower volumes and higher costs. UltraTech cement (UTCEM) ranks way ahead of its peers, ACC and ACEM, across the fronts on the back of highly efficient operations and strong management quality. Backed by aggressive capacity addition and proactive management, we maintain our ‘Accumulate’ rating with TP of Rs2,900.” “Blended realisations rose 7% QoQ/Rs330 and 6.6% YoY/Rs311 to Rs5,052, significantly ahead of our expectation of Rs4,855 on account of better grey cement realisations. Thanks to better demand and absorption of JP's Gujarat units for the entire quarter, volumes grew 12% YoY to 10.7m (PLe:11.1m) tonnes. Cost/t rose 5.6% YoY to Rs4,274, higher than our expectation of Rs4,139, on account of higher than expected freight cost. This resulted UTCEM to report EBITDA/t above our expectation at Rs779 (PLe: Rs715), up 12% YoY. Led by higher than expected other income and one‐time tax write back of Rs500m, PAT grew 55% YoY to Rs4.1bn against our expectation of Rs2.8bn.” “Stock fell by ~12% in last one month due to concerns largely attributed to company's plan for overseas acquisitions. Acquisition could potentially derail the visibility of company's earnings and hence, would result in de‐rating in valuations. However, we believe that management would be very reasonable while bidding for these assets. We continue to maintain that UTCEM will consistently outperform the sector on growth as well as quality of earnings, led by timely addition and highly efficient operations. Current valuations at EV/T of US$156/t FY16E capacity may sound expensive but its strong volume growth and dominant franchise would drive the expansion in stock's valuation to the peak cycle levels of US$170/t,” says Prabhudas Lilladher research report.

Religare Capital`s research report on UltraTech Cement

Topline soars 20% YoY: UTCEM’s topline grew 20% YoY to Rs 53.8bn led by volume growth of 12% (incl. volumes from the acquired JPA plant), while realisations soared 7% YoY. Realisations increased ~7% QoQ as well – a surprise vs. our estimate of -0.5% QoQ, led by higher volume contribution from South India (from new capacities), where prices didn’t moderate much during the monsoons. Higher realisation bolsters EBITDA/t: Led by better-than-expected realisations, UTCEM clocked an EBITDA/t of Rs 780/t (RCMLe Rs 700), up by Rs 80 YoY (down Rs 60 QoQ). Costs increased across the board with power & fuel cost/t rising 6% QoQ (on higher petcoke prices), while freight cost/t rose 9% QoQ. Other expense/t also jumped sharply by 15% QoQ. EBITDA margin for Q2 improved 70bps YoY but the higher costs led to a 240bps QoQ decline to 15.4% (RCMLe 14.9%). Better operating profits, other income and lower taxes boosted PAT by 55% YoY to Rs 4.1bn. Taxes for the quarter stood at 19% (RCMLe 29%). Interest expense jumped sharply to Rs 1.4bn in Q2 (Rs 1bn in Q1FY15), reflecting the full impact of the JPA acquisition. Maintain BUY, TP Rs 2,930: We marginally lower our estimates by 7%/6%/2% for FY15/FY16/FY17 to factor in higher costs and roll over to a new Dec’15 TP of Rs 2,930, based on 11x one-year fwd EV/EBITDA. With ~15% correction from the peak since September, valuations look attractive. Maintain BUY. ""UTCEM’s Q2FY15 PAT beat estimates at Rs 4.1bn (RCMLe Rs 3.5bn) led by better margins and lower taxes. EBITDA/t increased by Rs 80 YoY (down Rs 60 QoQ) to Rs 780/t driven by better realisations due to higher sales in southern markets, which offset the uptick in power and fuel/freight costs. We trim estimates to account for higher costs and roll over to a new Dec’15 TP of Rs 2,930 (Rs 3,020 earlier). Valuations are attractive and we remain positive on the stock given a healthy long-term industry outlook,” says Religare Capital research report.

The company has made a provision of Rs 42.7 crore for diminution in value of investment in subsidiaries, which resulted in a loss on bottomline front.

Revenue declined 11 percent to Rs 1,924 crore in April-June quarter of current financial year 2014-15 compared to Rs 2,161 crore in the year-ago period.

02:45 pm Results impact

Investors added more shares of Axis Bank on Monday as brokerage houses raised target price on the stock after the company's second quarter earnings met street expectations. The stock rallied nearly 4 percent intraday.

India's third largest private sector lender's net profit climbed 18.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,611 crore led by higher other income and net interest income but impacted by higher provisions. The CNBC-TV18 poll had expected it at Rs 1,612 crore for the quarter.

Advancing shares ountumbered declining ones by a ratio of 1593 to 1042 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

Ridham Desai, Morgan Stanley says equities look appealing because of the potential earnings upside. ""India's stellar performance this year has been driven by hopes of reform momentum following strong election results, a likely turn in the economic cycle and benign global conditions,"" he adds.

According to him, even as the market looks fair or better than fair on valuations relative to bonds and emerging markets, an upturn in the earnings cycle will likely support valuations. Over the coming two years, he sees earnings compounding at 19.8 percent and 15.5 percent for the Sensex and broad market, respectively.

UltraTech Cement rallied over 5 percent following higher-than-expected earnings in July-September quarter. Net profit shot up 55.24 percent year-on-year to Rs 410 crore on strong topline, operational and other income, and lower tax rate but impacted by higher finance, power and freight cost.

The Nifty managed to reclaim 7,750 after a choppy session on Friday. With positive global cues, a strong reform momentum and an election verdict in favour of Narendra Modi-led BJP in Maharashtra and Haryana, the market may see a gap up opening in today's trade.

The government has begun with the mother of all reforms. It has raised the gas prices to USD 5.6 per unit effective from November with a review every six months. Also, in a huge boost to public sector oil companies, diesel price deregulation finally sees the light of the day. Government has deregulated the price of diesel, linking it to global market prices. Diesel has now become cheaper by Rs 3.37.

It was a massive victory for the BJP in Maharashtra. It came out as the single largest party in the state with 123 seats in Haryana. The BJP will be forming the government for the first time. It created a record getting majority on its own in Haryana assembly winning 47 seats.

Aditya Birla Group company UltraTech Cement beat street expectations on every parameter with the second quarter standalone net profit soaring 55.24 percent to Rs 410 crore on strong topline, operational and other income but impacted by finance, power and freight cost. Profit in the year-ago period was Rs 264.1 crore.

Profit was expected at Rs 338 crore on revenue of Rs 5,150 crore for the quarter, according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Revenue during the quarter grew by 20 percent to Rs 5,429 crore in the quarter ended September 2014 compared to Rs 4,523 crore in same quarter last year driven by higher cement sales volumes.

""The combined cement and clinker sales increased by 12.25 percent on yearly basis to 10.35 million tonne while white cement and wall care putty sales rose to 3.02 lakh metric tonne from 2.94 lakh metric tonne,"" said the company in its filing to BSE.

It added that domestic cement sales volume climbed 11 percent on the back of higher demand and additional volume from the acquired units in Gujarat. UltraTech acquired two cement units in Gujarat from Jaypee Cement.

On the outlook front, UltraTech said the cement demand is slated to grow over 8 percent. The key drivers will be renewed government focus on housing and infrastructure spending, it added.

Other income doubled to Rs 74.1 crore in July-September quarter from Rs 37.6 crore in corresponding quarter of last fiscal.

Operating profit of the cement company spiked 29.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 877 crore and margin expanded by 120 basis points to 16.2 percent during the same period, but impacted by higher fuel and freight cost. According to the poll, both were expected at Rs 840 crore and 16.3 percent, respectively.

Cost

Raw materials cost increased by 16 percent to Rs 787.4 crore from Rs 677.5 crore on yearly basis. ""Costs were impacted mainly on account of increase in prices of petcoke, input material and royalty on limestone,"" said the company.

Power and fuel cost shot up 33.7 percent Y-o-Y to Rs 11,44.9 crore from Rs 856.6 crore while freight and forwarding expenses rose 30 percent to Rs 1,292 crore from Rs 994.22 crore.

Finance cost jumped 61.6 percent to Rs 143.4 crore in July-September quarter compared to Rs 88.75 crore on higher borrowings for (Jaypee) cement units acquisition. Long term borrowings stood at Rs 5,230.2 crore as of September 2014, increased compared to Rs 4,493.6 crore at the end of March 2014 and short term borrowings were Rs 2,582.4 crore at end of September quarter, up significantly compared to Rs 379.2 crore at the end of March 2014.

Depreciation cost climbed 17.5 percent Y-o-Y to Rs 302.4 crore and other expenses soared 14 percent to Rs 969.7 crore but tax expenses declined to Rs 95.4 crore from Rs 107 crore during the same period.

Capex

UltraTech said the ongoing capex is on track, adding it commissioned a 1.4 million tonne cement mill at Rajashree Cement in Karnataka and a 25MW thermal power plant in Andhra Pradesh.

With this the company's total cement capacity in India increased to 60.2 million tonne and the total power capacity rose to 733 MW (which caters to around 80 percent of the total power requirement).

On consolidated basis, profit after tax climbed to Rs 416 crore in the quarter ended September 2014 compared to Rs 283 crore in same quarter last year. Net sales during the quarter jumped to Rs 5,723 crore from Rs 4,849 crore year-on-year.

Meanwhile, the board of directors of the company today extended the term of appointment of OP Puranmalka, managing director, for a period of one year i.e. from April 01, 2015 to March 31, 2016 and appointed Atul Daga as chief financial officer in place of KC Birla, with effect from December 01, 2014.",649,0.9999118826606057

ICICIdirect.com's muhurat picks 2014

Equity markets have rallied over 25% since last Diwali, largely fuelled by improving corporate earnings, expectations of tough reforms from the new government and reviving macroeconomic variables. The government has already initiated several confidence building measures and taken key decisions like allowing FDI in several sectors, railway fare hike, online environment and forest clearance, etc.

The government’s pro-activeness is complemented by robustness in economic data points. GDP growth has revived to a nine-quarter high of 5.7% in Q1FY15, strengthening hopes of an economic turnaround and a shift to a high growth trajectory. Secondly, softening crude prices at a 27-month low of $91/barrel would cushion the current and fiscal account imbalances. At current levels, under-recoveries are expected to decline to ~Rs 80,500 crore in FY15 from ~Rs 140,000 crore in FY14. Thirdly, declining crude prices would also help soften inflation, which had remained at elevated levels for much of the recent past. Consequently, we expect CPI to reach below 7% by FY15 from the current 7.8% levels, which could pave the way for rate cuts.

Sensex earnings grew 17.1% in FY14, partly aided by suppressed cumulative growth of 6.9% in last two years. Earnings are expected to grow 16.2% in FY15E before reviving to 18.5% in FY16E. We expect Sensex to trade at 16.5x FY16E EPS of 1880 at 31000 by next Diwali.

""We recommend State Bank of India, UltraTech Cement, Rallis India, Exide Industries, SKF India, Maharashtra Seamless and Kansai Nerolac as our Muhurat 2014 picks"", says the research firm.

ICICIdirect.com's report on cement sector

The cement sector is set to move to a high growth trajectory over next three or four years (‘GDP correlation of 1.2x’) led by an improved macro outlook and through the government’s policy push. We believe the industry’s capacity utilisation bottomed at ~69% in FY14. We think low capacity addition and demand recovery should lift utilisation levels from hereon given the cyclical upturn in the economy coupled with an expected policy push to drive investments in the infrastructure sector. By driving increased cement usage in sectors like road, power and irrigation, we believe the industry can achieve the full potential of cement demand growth over the next three or four years. We forecast pan-India utilisation at 78% by FY17E. Excluding south, utilisation levels for the industry are expected at over 85% levels by FY17E that could offer pricing power to players. We continue to prefer UltraTech in the large cap space. Among midcaps, we like JK Cement, JK Lakshmi & Heidelberg Cement due to their presence in strong regions and well timed expansions while India Cement can be a major beneficiary of a strong demand revival in Andhra Pradesh.

Among large caps, we prefer UltraTech Cement due to its pan-India presence and higher cost efficiencies. In the midcap space, we like the business fundamentals of JK Cement (doubling white cement capacity), JK Lakshmi Cement (strong presence in north) and Heidelberg (operating leverage and cost efficiency measures) while India Cement can be a major beneficiary of the strong demand revival in Andhra Pradesh (AP).

Motilal Oswal's report on Cement sector

IIP data reported encouraging 16.5% YoY growth in cement production in July 2014 (the highest-ever since November 2011).

YTDFY15 production growth stood at 11.2% YoY and TTM growth bounced up to 6.1% versus a low of 3.3% in March 2014.

Recent channel interactions highlight sequential demand moderation in August as the impact of monsoon was overshadowing, with broad expectations of a subdued monsoon.

Post a strong resilience in July 2014, due to delayed monsoon, prices plunged INR10-20/ bag across regions in August (albeit up 8.7% YoY).

Related stories

Price decline in western regions (ex-Mumbai) was high at INR20-30/bag but there was a sharp rise in June-July too. Prices in southern states declined by upto INR15/bag.

Commencement of ABG plant (3mt) by 3QFY15 and Nirma (March 2015) are being seen as a threat to cement pricing by Gujarat and Rajasthan dealers.

Strength in demand in FY15YTD with 11% growth, leads upgrade in our industry volume growth estimate to 10% each in FY15-17 (v/s 6%/8%/10% earlier).

In large-caps we prefer ACC, UltraTech and Shree Cement, whereas in mid-caps we prefer Dalmia Bharat, JK Cement and JK Lakshmi Cement.

As per IIP data, Cement industry volume grew 16.5% YoY in July 2015, implying ~11% growth FY15YTD.

YTD growth of ~11% is a positive surprise, especially considering elections would have affected demand during April-May 2014.

Considering muted demand growth of 4.6% CAGR over FY10-14, and historic electoral mandate to the BJP government, we are upgrading our Industry demand growth estimate to 10% each in FY15/16 (v/s earlier estimate of 6%/8%/10%). This implies 7.2% CAGR over FY12-17E.

As a result, we now estimate capacity utilization to improve to ~70%/73%/79% by FY17 (v/s earlier estimate of ~68%/70%/75%. Based on producible capacity (based on clinker capacity), utilization levels would be 80%/85%/90% in FY15/16/17.

We estimate cement prices to improve by ~INR13/20/20 per bag in FY15/16/17.

Valuation & View

Demand recovery has being faster and higher than expected. This coupled with slowing capacity addition and higher capex and opex cost would support cement prices and profitability going forward.

Sustained recovery in demand would act as catalyst stock performance.

Any government intervention in cement pricing poses threat to our positive view.

In large-caps we prefer ACC, UltraTech and Shree Cement, whereas in mid-caps we prefer Dalmia Bharat, JK Cement and JK Lakshmi Cement.

ICICI Securities expects the demand growth in the Indian cement sector to pick up gradually on the back of recent clearances of many large projects that had been stalled.

Also Read: See total cement capacity at 10 mt by FY15-end: JK Lakshmi

In its recent note, ICICI Sec said while the outcome of the general elections in May would be crucial, better governance would lead to revival in infra spends driving demand growth, adding that the demand in South could revive post recent resolution of political issue and state elections in Q1FY15E.

The Indian cement industry has been reeling under crisis on the back of a slowdown in the construction and infrastructure segments. The rise in the prices of the raw material, domestic coal and freight costs have put pressure on the profitability of cement companies.

The ICICI Sec note further added that cement companies will focus on improving cost-efficiencies by adding more split-grinding units, increasing the usage of pet coke and alternative fuels, setting up more captive power plants / waste heat recovery plants, building logistic infrastructures like railway sidings, bulk terminals, jetties, etc.

Though margins have been at historic low, yet they are likely to improve significantly, going forward, the note said. ""We believe margins have bottomed out and expect it to improve in keeping with improvement in utilisations. We estimate average EBITDA/tonne to expand to Rs 1,100/tonne by FY16E, which is still lower than the minimum of Rs1,500/tonne required by a new Greenfield project to justify a (return on capital employed) RoCE of around 12 percent,"" the note said.

ICICI Sec maintains 'overweight' on the sector with a medium-term view, with UltraTech and Shree Cements being its top picks.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a step-up in pre-election demand however, it feels a more sustained revival is still some time away.

In a recent note, Kotak IE said the pipeline of capacity addition will remain strong with over 50 mtpa likely to be added over the next three years (5 percent CAGR), which although less aggressive than the past three years, will continue to match pace with the demand growth. It feels of the 50 mtpa of capacity addition, as much as 15 mtpa could be added as early as 1QFY15E, whereas the remaining 35 mtpa could be distributed over the next three years.

The note further added that the east and central India will remain preferred destinations for capacity addition given the continued disparity between the local supply and demand.

Though it is hopeful of demand revival in the near term, it feels utilization rates will remain under pressure. It maintains a cautious outlook on the sector.

""Although utilization rates remain under pressure on an all-India basis, regional disparities are even higher with south operating at 40 percent rates while north operates at near 80 percent capacity utilization,"" the Kotak note said.

According to a JM Financial note, cement prices have seen an uptick in most markets during the past few weeks, with northern markets witnessing higher increase owing to supply shortages, whereas southern markets have seen a marginal decline.

The note added that most market participants are not too optimistic on the near term outlook as demand growth remains non-existent.

""Dealers highlighted working capital issues like delays in payments from real estate players and inventory build-up, which makes near-term demand visibility further bleak. Demand recovery hopes are now pinned on 2HFY15, even as price hikes will provide some relief on the earnings front,"" the note said.

The brokerage expects incremental improvement in 2HFY15 led by -- likely election-led government spending (cement demand tends to improve significantly around elections), reversion to mean with cement demand tracking at least long-term GDP co-relation of c.1.2x real GDP growth, and low base effect.

""We believe the worst on the earnings front is likely to be behind for the sector and expect a steady improvement in sector profitability helped by improvement in demand... Shree Cement and UltraTech Cement are our preferred picks in the sector,"" the note said.",677,0.3327102820078532

ICICIdirect.com report on cement sector

""All-India cement prices increased during February in all regions except the southern region. While the northern region showed an exorbitant price increase due to supply constraints, the southern region registered continuance of a huge decline in prices due to high inventory pushing by regional players. Average prices settled at Rs 304/bag in February vs. Rs 294/bag in January. Though prices have increased MoM in the last two months, the recovery of the sector depends on its sustainability along with improvement in demand.""

""Overall, cement prices in the country increased by Rs 10/bag. Prices in the western, eastern and central regions increased by Rs 10/bag, Rs 9/bag and Rs 19/bag, respectively, on an MoM basis. Prices in the northern region increased exceptionally by Rs 31/bag from the last month due to stoppage of supply from Rajasthan plant of Binani Cement. News reports said at the start of the month, the Rajasthan government had issued notices to banks having accounts of Binani Cements asking them to not allow the company to withdraw money, as a tax of over Rs 185 crore is due on the company. This may have created a monetary crunch for the company resulting in supply stoppage. On the other side, the southern region witnessed oversupply by regional players at lower rates in a bid to increase their market share. This resulted in a price decline in the region by Rs 21/bag after Rs 19/bag decline in the previous month resulting in lowest price levels in the last two years in the region. On the demand front, the western region witnessed robust increase in demand after a long time while central region also registered good demand led by rural demand. In rest of the regions, demand remained subdued. Going forward, continual increase in prices and improved demand environment remain key.""

""We remain positive on operational cost leaders with competitive valuations. Shree Cements and UltraTech Cement remain our top picks among our coverage universe. We maintain our neutral rating on other large cap stocks like ACC and Ambuja Cements. Among midcaps, we remain neutral on JK Lakshmi and JK Cement despite a slowdown due to good balance sheet strength. The south remains uncertain due to ongoing uncertainty in AP. Hence, we continue to avoid stocks like India Cement,"" says ICICIdirect.com research report.

Abu Dhabi National Energy Company (TAQA) led consortium will acquire Jaiprakash Power Ventures' two hydroelectric power plants for about Rs 10,000 crore (USD 1.6 billion), TAQA said today.

""The total enterprise value of the two assets is approx USD 1.6 billion (approx Rs 10,000 crore). The amount of equity being invested by the consortium is approx USD 616 million (Rs 3,820 crore)... The remainder is primarily non-recourse project debt,"" a TAQA spokesperson said in an e-mailed reply to a PTI query.

Earlier, TAQA had said in a statement that through a consortium it will acquire Jaiprakash Power Ventures' two hydro-electric power plant, Baspa Stage II and Karcham Wangtoo, having 1,391 MW capacity.

""The equity invested by the consortium in the acquisition of the two hydroelectric plants will amount to approximately Rs 3,820 crore (USD 616 million, based on March 1, 2014 foreign exchange rate), of which 51 percent is from TAQA.

""The consortium will also acquire the assets' non-recourse project debt,"" said TAQA, which is the brand name of Abu Dhabi National Energy Company.

TAQA holds 51 per cent stake in the consortium and will have control of operations and management of both the plants under the proposed deal, it said.

Its consortium partners include one of Canada's largest institutional investors, whose name was not disclosed (39 per cent stake) and IDFC Alternatives' India Infrastructure Fund II (10 per cent stake).

The two plants have a combined power generation capacity of 1,391 MW and are located in Kinnaur district, Himachal Pradesh, within two km of each other. They share support facilities and use run-of-the-river technology to convert natural water flow to electricity, eliminating the need for a reservoir.

The plants are 35 km from the Sorang hydroelectric plant, in which TAQA acquired stake last year.

According to TAQA, the acquisition will make it the largest private operator of hydroelectric plants in India. Post completion of the deal, its gross operational power generation capacity in India will rise to 1,741 MW, comprising of 3 hydel power and one lignite plants.

TAQA's Executive Officer and Head of Global Power & Water Frank Perez said: ""India's economic growth depends on having ample and reliable energy supply. TAQA is pleased to add these two high quality hydro power assets to our growing India business and to support India's economic growth.""

The acquisition is expected to close in 2014 and is subject to regulatory and third party approvals, TAQA said.

Jaiprakash Power Ventures Ltd is a subsidiary of Indian infrastructure conglomerate Jaypee Group. In recent times, the Jaypee group has been on a debt-pruning spree.

In September 2013, it had sold a cement plant in Gujarat to Aditya Birla group's UltraTech having an enterprise value of Rs 3,800 crore.",478,0.8959349095821381

03:25 pm Macro outlook: India is ""stuck in a rut"" as weaker consumption and stalled investments prevent the economy from building any sort of momentum, global financial services major HSBC said in a report, adding “slow recovery” could start post elections.

According to HSBC, the year 2014 could thus prove to be a tale of two halves. In the latter half of the year, there would be some economic recovery and return to normal business conditions.

“Pent-up demand should be released after the elections are over,” HSBC said in a research note. It also said “given that passions are running high, the outcome could bring considerable volatility to Indian equities”.

HSBC for now is ‘underweight’ on Indian equities but some of its preferred sectors include energy which is likely to gain from subsidy changes, power (stands to benefit from distribution reform), non-ferrous metals (corporate restructuring) and telecoms (more clarity post the auctions).

Revenues are expected to decrease by 9.5 percent Q-o-Q (down 4.5 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 4,486.6 crore, according to Motilal Oswal.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are likely to fall by 22 percent Q-o-Q (down 18.6 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 818 crore.

Motilal Oswal's Report on UltraTech Cement:

Cement volumes are estimated to grow -2.5 percent Y-o-Y (-10 percent Q-o-Q) to 9.06mt. Realizations are estimated to decline by 1.7 percent Q-o-Q (-4 percent Y-o-Y) to INR 4,050/tonne. Its supplementary business of white cement and RMC are estimated to grow 5 percent and -5 percent Y-o-Y respectively in volume and 5.6 percent Y-o-Y in realizations.

Realizations decline coupled with sequential cost push (4.4 percent Q-o-Q) led by negative operating leverage and higher employee costs would result in an impact on EBITDA/tonne of INR 889/tonne (-INR 136/tonne Q-o-Q, - INR 178/tonne Y-o-Y). EBITDA margin would decline 3pp QoQ (-3.2pp Y-o-Y) to 18.2 percent.

EBITDA is estimated to de-grow 19 percent Y-o-Y (-22 percent Q-o-Q) to INR 8.2 billion, translating into PAT de-growth of 28 percent Y-o-Y (-42 percent Q-o-Q) to INR 3.9 billion.

We upgrade the EPS estimates for FY14E/15E by 1.4 percent/ 3 percent to INR 101.2/ INR130.2 respectively.

The stock trades at 13.4x FY15E EPS, 7.3x FY15E EV/EBITDA and USD114/ tonne.",264,-0.0036067465941111245

The Securities Appellate Tribunal has asked National Stock Exchange (NSE) to offer fresh hearing chance to Religare Capital Markets with respect to a freak trade in some securities earlier this year.

After a freak trade came to light in shares of Tata Motors and UltraTech Cement earlier this year, Religare had said that these unintended transactions took place due to software glitches and requested NSE to annul the trades. However the exchange refused to do so in an order dated May 3, 2013.After hearing Religare's appeal against NSE order, the tribunal said: ""Accordingly, impugned order dated May 3, 2013 is quashed and set aside by consent and the respondent is directed to pass fresh order on merits after giving an opportunity of hearing to the appellant. All contentions of both parties are kept open"".The order was passed by the tribunal on September 30. Religare had submitted to the tribunal that NSE had passed the order without hearing its side. The tribunal noted that ""since the impugned order has been passed in violation of the principles of natural justice, in our opinion, it is just and proper to set aside the impugned order without going into the merits of the case and direct the respondent (NSE) to pass fresh order on merits after giving an opportunity of hearing to the appellant (Religare)"".On February 1, certain erroneous sell orders had taken place in Tata Motors and UltraTech Cement shares, due to which they had briefly fallen by 10 percent on the NSE. After the concerned trade the brokerage firm had said that a software technical glitch caused some ""unintended transactions"" leading to the erroneous sell orders. It had also said that there was neither any broker error nor any loss caused to the clients.",302,

Motilal Oswal`s report on UltraTech Cement

“UTCEM has approved acquisition of the 4.8mt of integrated cement units at Gujarat of Jaypee Cement Corporation Ltd (JCCL), which is a 100% subsidiary of Jaiprakash Associates (JAL) at INR38b (implied EV/ton of USD124 at currency assumption of 64). Hence, UTCEM’s total capacity would increase to ~70mt (post expansion by FY16), of which Gujarat will be ~17%. Transaction structure includes (1) UTCEM assuming INR36.5b of JCCL’s debt and (2) INR1.47b of UTCEM’s equity (0.32% dilution). The deal is expected to take 7-9 months to conclude. The acquisition comprises 5,479 hectares of land and 500mt of limestone reserves, enabling strong scope to double existing capacity. The integrated plant has 57.5mw of coal-based thermal power plant and 30mw of DG sets, which are expected to serve the energy requirement of entire production.”“We expect the transaction to derive meaningful synergistic benefits -- (1) premium branding to drive improvement in realizations (~INR15/bag) and profitability, (2) savings on freight cost led by cement/clinker swap and market realignment, (3) market consolidation, with over 30% market share (~49% capacity share) for UTCEM to aid pricing power and (4) tax savings on carry forward loss of INR3.5b (as per the management).”“Management indicated that the acquisition will be EPS accretive from third year. Our ballpark estimates indicate PBT impact of -5.7%/-3.2% in FY15E/16E. EPS impact hinges on quantum and timeline for assuming tax savings on carry forward losses. Assuming equal apportion of INR5.8b of tax savings in FY15E and FY16E each, we estimate 2.3%/3.6% upgrade in FY15E/16E EPS. It leads to change in target price by -2% due to increase in net debt by INR36.5b. Based on provisional estimates, the stock trades at ~13.5x FY15E EPS, 7.8x FY15E EV/EBITDA and EV/Ton of USD115 (for ~67mt capacity). Maintain Buy,” says Motilal Oswal research report.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
