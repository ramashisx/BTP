India witnessed a remarkable 21 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in smartwatch shipments during the third quarter of 2023 (July-September), according to the latest research from Counterpoint's IoT Service. The surge was attributed to a significant inventory build-up in anticipation of robust sales during the festive season in October.

While existing top players continued to drive the market, new players like Fastrack and beatXP shipped high volumes and chipped away market share from the top three. The share of domestic manufacturing reached the highest ever at 82 percent compared to 4 percent a year ago, the report added.

While existing top players continued to drive the market, new players like Fastrack and beatXP shipped high volumes and chipped away market share from the top three.

“In the coming years, the market will continue to grow in double digits due to the brands’ efforts to expand their portfolios, offline partnerships with several large-format retailers (LFRs) and growing emphasis on local manufacturing,” said Anshika Jain, senior research analyst.

Fire-Boltt emerged as the market leader, capturing an impressive 28 percent share, closely trailed by Noise and boAt. Notably, Fastrack, a sub-brand of Titan, achieved the highest annual growth among the top five brands, showcasing its increasing prominence in the sector. Additionally, beatXP made its debut in the top five, marking a notable entry into the competitive smartwatch market.

Commenting on the price analysts noted the emphasis on budget-friendly options has led to a significant 41 percent YoY decline in India's smartwatch average selling price (ASP), reaching its all-time low. Consequently, more than three-fifths of the market now falls within the less than Rs 2,000 price range.

“This quarter, smartwatches were even available for less than Rs 1,000 to target first-time users. The shorter replacement cycles for the basic smartwatches and the maximum number of new launches being in this price segment further accelerated the trend,” said Harshit Rastogi, Research Analyst.",347,0.4838695228099823

Titan Company crossed the Rs 3 lakh crore market share on November 21. The stock has seen a strong momentum through this year, gaining 34 percent and about 6 percent in November alone. It hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 3,441.45 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on November 23. Can this momentum continue?

Most analysts are bullish on Titan, what with its impressive growth in the jewellery business and its premium position in the sector. There are, however, some cautious voices. They point out that low diamond prices might put pressure on profitability.

In its Q2FY24 results, the company’s consolidated net profit rose 9.7 percent on-year to Rs 916 crore, while consolidated revenue jumped 36 percent to Rs 12,529 crore. The jewellery business grew, driven by India operations, and domestic sales were aided by a double-digit growth of buyers and average bill value per buyer.

Outlook

Analysts believe that Titan's core domestic business has a long runway for growth. Going ahead, market expansion, buoyant gold prices, and robust demand during the wedding season, will boost profitability.

Titan has taken some price correction in solitaires and this impact should be evident in the coming 7-8 months, said Jefferies in a report.

According to the international brokerage, Titan is a structural growth story. Buoyant gold prices, share gains, higher wedding budgets for jewellery, and cost focus are among the key catalysts for the stock. However, concerns remain over steep valuations.

Margins to improve

In the quarter gone by, the benefits of low-cost inventory faded out completely and plain gold jewellery sales increased. This impacted margins. The management has allayed investor concerns on the margin impact from the recent correction in diamond prices.

""The impact would be limited to the solitaire portfolio, which has a low salience in Titan's studded business. The management, in its guidance, reiterated that it is aiming for 12-13 percent margins on an annual basis,” Jefferies added.

According to Dolal Capital, an increase in studded jewellery contribution would help improve EBITDA margin. Going ahead, the company expects 12-13 percent steady-state margins in the jewellery business (ex-bullion sales). Aggressive pricing by the company is expected to ease, leading to improved margins in the future, according to B&K Securities analysts.

Market expansion

The company continues to expand its jewellery store reach. During the quarter that ended in September 2023, Titan added 52 stores for its jewellery brands Tanishq, Mia, CaratLane and Zoya. The company also said it was looking to add 15 stores for Zoya by next Diwali.

According to analysts at CLSA, this expansion is likely to be a key source of surprise for Titan's revenue growth, opening up levers of growth that were not available even 2-3 years back.

Growth

Titan is concentrating on increasing its market share by expanding its store network, enhancing inventory, and offering competitive pricing.

The company has established ambitious long-term goals across various segments with a primary focus on profitability. With the watches and eyewear divisions complementing the jewellery business, Titan’s long-term growth outlook appears promising, according to B&K Securities. ""We remain optimistic about Titan from a stable, long-term perspective,"" the brokerage said.

Analysts at Dolat Capital expect Titan's profitability in the second quarter of FY24 to remain under pressure due to low diamond prices. The jewellery business has seen a sharp acceleration in new store additions, across formats over the past four quarters.

Going ahead, the jewellery business is estimated to post double-digit revenue growth, and will be a bedrock for growth for the company.

Valuations

JM Financial Services expects Titan to continue commanding a premium valuation, more so given the scarcity of ‘growth businesses' in the space at this point.

It maintained a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 3,705 per share. Jefferies, meanwhile, has maintained a 'hold' rating with a base case target price of Rs 2,950 per share, given the lofty valuations.

""At 43x FY26, Titan trades at a 10 percent premium to our consumer coverage. However, we believe Titan can grow significantly faster over FY23-26E and beyond as it makes further inroads into the rapidly growing luxury market as well as for the Indian jewellery market overseas,"" said CLSA as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 3,338.25.

Its core domestic business and several of its new categories have a long runway for growth. This means investors should pay growth multiples for several more years, the brokerage added.

Meanwhile, B&K Securities has maintained its 'buy' rating on the counter with a revised DCF-based target price of Rs 3,350 from Rs 3,000 earlier. Dolat remained bearish on the stock as it put a 'sell' rating on the counter with a target price of Rs 3,185 per share.

With the recent rise in the share price, the best target price for the stock has already been achieved. The stock is now just below Jefferies' upside target price of Rs 4,500 per share.

Fair trade regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI) on November 21 cleared the acquisition of additional stake purchased by Titan in CaratLane. CaratLane is engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of gems and jewellery in India.

The combination relates to the acquisition of 27.18 per cent share capital of CaratLane (a subsidiary of Titan) by Titan Company Ltd, on a fully diluted basis, from Mithun Padam Sacheti, Siddhartha Padam Sacheti, and Padamchand Sacheti, according to a release. Titan, a joint venture between the Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO), is active in several businesses through lifestyle brands, including jewellery, eye care, fragrances, and fashion accessories.

In August, jewellery maker Titan announced that it is going to increase its stake in its subsidiary and new-age jewellery brand CaratLane to 98.28 per cent by acquiring an additional 27.18 per cent for Rs 4,621 crore. CaratLane was started as a purely online brand in 2008, looking at the fast-growing affordable and accessible jewellery market.

Titan first invested in CaratLane in 2016 and over the years, in partnership with its jewellery brand Tanishq, CaratLane witnessed substantial growth. The deals beyond a certain threshold need approval from the regulator, which keeps a tab on unfair business practices as well as promotes fair competition in the marketplace.

Meanwhile, shares of Titan hit a 52-week of Rs 3,400 apiece up nearly 2 per cent on the BSE on November 21, while the company's market cap increased to Rs 3.01 lakh crore. By crossing Rs 3 lakh crore market cap, the company became the 17th most valuable company in India by market capitalisation.

Titan’s stock hit a 52-week high of Rs 3,400 on November 21 as the company’s market capitalisation increased to Rs 3 lakh crore.

The stock closed at Rs 3,392.2, up 1.39 percent from the previous day’s close.

Titan first scaled Rs 1 lakh crore market capitalisation on March 28, 2019. After that, the stock took 18 months to scale the next Rs 1 lakh crore market cap as the market cap crossed 2 lakh crore on October 7, 2021. It took a little more than 2 years for the company to reach Rs 3 lakh crore from Rs 2 lakh crore.

By crossing Rs 3 lakh crore market cap, it became the 17th most valuable company in India by market capitalisation. The company which is backed by Tata group is also the second valuable company among Tata group behind TCS.

Titan is one of the most famous stocks in the portfolio of the late big bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala. According to the shareholding pattern by September 30, 2023, Rekha Jhunjhunwala, wife of Rakesh Jhunhunwala holds 5.37 percent in the company. At the current market price, that holding translates to well over Rs 16,000 crore.

Titan group’s shares have risen 32.39 percent in the year-to-date period, beating the returns of benchmark index Nifty 50 which has risen by 8.7 percent.

“The only problem with market timing is getting the timing right.” - Peter Lynch

In India, it's the time of the year when people scour for something, if not everything, new. Frugality takes a backseat as they invest in gold, real estate, cars, appliances, and even, stocks.

Long lists of Diwali stock-picks have begun circulating in WhatsApp groups. Whether the start of a new Samvat is a good time to enter the market is any one’s call, but long-term investors need not worry. Festive cheer may keep markets buoyant this week with no dearth of positive vibes from across the world. While domestic flows keep acting as a floor for markets, hopes of return of foreign investors have firmed up as US Treasury yields have corrected sharply.

Titan

The company exceeded estimates on all fronts, underlining India’s K-shaped recovery. While staple companies have found it difficult to give more

than 7 percent revenue growth, Titan Company in discretionary has grown 37 percent on a high base. CLSA has upgraded the stock from 'outperform' to 'buy' and has hiked the price target from Rs 3,540 to Rs 3,948. “The company is selling to all consumers that can spend,” said the broker.

The management in concall said that a drop in diamond prices, particularly in higher-carat solitaires might lead to a margin dilution over the next seven to eight months. But, analysts are not too worried, it seems. The company is now expanding its market share by targeting the low-market share and luxury high-value space in domestic markets as well as overseas, which is the next growth trigger, they feel.

Luxury stocks are fancied globally right now with the rich continuing to be on a spending spree post-pandemic; so as long as the company can extract a fair share of this unfair spending, the stock will offer an unfair advantage.

Godrej Properties

With Friday's rally, the technical reasons are supportive, but fundamentally, Godrej Properties is among the most expensive bets in the listed real estate space. It has highest trailing P/E multiple, right after Brigade Enterprises. But Motilal Oswal sees it differently. The stock’s one-year forward P/E is at 38 percent discount to its 10-year average, which makes it among the top picks for the domestic broking firm in the midcap space.

The management told CNBC-TV18 that they have a significant project pipeline for the second half of FY24. The Mumbai-based real-estate developer is hopeful of exceeding its sales guidance of Rs 14,000 crore for FY24. Foreign institutional investors are also buying into this story with their holding up from 28.85 percent in June to 29.25 percent in September.

Real estate is anyway a micro market and each company follows a different path based on its business model and performance of the market it caters to. With a lull in India's Silicon Valley, this is Mumbai's time, and hence Godrej's.

Cello World

The Cello World IPO received a decent response, and analysts expect the stock to list at over 24 percent premium to its issue price today. The company's strong financials, debt-free status and big anchor names make it an attractive investment, but the concern is that it seems expensive compared to its peers. The P/E ratio is 49, which is much higher than the peer average of 38.6. Also, investors generally have a cautious view on pure OFS (offer for sale) public issues that simply provide an exit to existing investors and no money goes to the business. Cello World IPO was pure OFS.

Siemens India

There are stocks where the even the most marquee investors choose to ignore governance concerns because the business is too good to ignore. Siemens is one of them, where their tech capabilities and the growth story is makes it unbeatable. But the narrative seems to be changing a bit. Now, the stock has 15 buy, six hold and six sell calls.

One of those neutral calls is that of UBS. It has downgraded the stock from a 'buy' and lowered the target price from Rs 4,280 to Rs 3,750 on growing uncertainties about its long-term product strategy and concerns about the company's ability to win technology-based energy orders due to competitive dynamics.

Investors may also grapple with the market valuation of its energy business. Siemens Energy is now looking to sell its 24 percent stake in Siemens India to Siemens AG. This comes five months after the company’s decision to hive off its low-voltage motor business, which shareholders voted against as the valuations were ""ridiculously"" low for a good-margin, asset-light business. Seems like corporate governance issues are not done yet.

Beyond the Great Wall

China will further expand its market access and step up imports, Premier Li Qiang told a trade fair in Shanghai on Sunday, reports Reuters. This comes amid criticism from firms in the West that wanted to see more tangible improvement in the country's business environment.

Li told the opening ceremony of the annual China International Import Expo that the country was committed to opening up its economy, and that imports of goods and services were set to reach a cumulative $17 trillion within the next five years. ""No matter how the world changes, China's pace of opening up will never stall, and its determination to share development opportunities with the world will never change,"" Li said.

Time for alarm bells?

Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway has posted its first quarterly loss in a year as the prices of Apple and other stocks it owns fell, even as improved results from insurance helped boost operating profit to a record. Berkshire also signalled it remains cautious about stock valuations and the market environment. Operating profit rose 41 percent to $10.76 billion, even as Berkshire's net loss more than quadrupled to $12.77 billion.

Poor Charlie’s Almanack

Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway vice-chairman and long-time business partner of Warren Buffett, was at his usual best in an interview with the Wall Street Journal as he mused on a wide array of topics. What caught our interest, in particular, was his advice for the common investor.

“Most people probably shouldn’t do anything other than have index funds…. That is a perfectly rational thing to do for somebody who just doesn’t want to think much about it and has no reason to think he has any advantage as a stock picker. Why should he try and pick his own stocks? He doesn’t design his own electric motors and his egg beater,” he said.

Hands off hedge funds!

Ken Griffin, the founder and chief executive of the $62-billion US hedge fund Citadel, has warned regulators that they should focus on banks rather than his industry if they want to reduce risks in the financial system stemming from leveraged bets on US government debt, reports FT.

Global regulators have warned about growing risks emerging from the so-called Treasury basis trade — selling Treasury futures while buying US government bonds and extracting gains from the small gap between the two using borrowed money.

“The SEC is searching for a problem,” Griffin told the Financial Times. “If regulators are really worried about the size of the basis trade, they can ask banks to conduct stress tests to see if they have enough collateral from their counterparties.”

Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath is set to pump in Rs 100 crore into Bluestone, an omnichannel jewellery retailer, as competition heats up in the space. The investment comes as part of a funding round in which other notable participants include Zomato founder and chief executive Deepinder Goyal and CEO Amit Jain, and financial services firm IIFL, a report said.

Bluestone founder and CEO Gaurav Singh Kushwaha confirmed the development, saying the Bengaluru-based company was in the final stages of securing a funding round amounting to $65 million (around Rs 550 crore), valuing the company at around Rs 3,600 crore ($440 million), the Economic Times reported on September 23.

Moneycontrol couldn’t verify the report independently.

Ranjan Pai, chairman of Manipal Group, and Info Edge Ventures are also involved in the funding round, contributing around Rs 100 crore each. Existing investors, too, are participating in this funding round, Kushwaha told the daily.

The latest round of financing for Bluestone comes after Tata Group’s Titan acquired the stake of Mithun Sacheti, the founder of CaratLane, a rival omnichannel retailer, valuing the company at approximately $2 billion.

Bluestone earlier raised $30 million from the family office of Sunil Kant Munjal of the Hero Group, which valued the company at $378 million, the report said. These developments highlight the competitive dynamics and investment activity within the omnichannel jewellery retail sector in India.

He added that there was significant traction across cities, from tier 1 to tier 3, emphasising the vast opportunities that lay ahead for the company. A substantial portion of the newly secured capital would be allocated towards expanding the omnichannel presence and investing in technology to seamlessly integrate and optimise operations.

Avnish Anand, the co-founder of CaratLane has been appointed as the startup’s new chief executive officer (CEO) with immediate effect. The decision comes just days after his co-founder and former boss, Mithun Sacheti, made a remarkable exit by selling his CaratLane shares to Titan.

Last week, Titan, which already holds 71.09 percent in CaratLane, said it would further increase its stake to 98.28 percent by buying out Sacheti’s 27.18 percent share in the online jewellery retailer for Rs 4,621 crore. The deal valued CaratLane at Rs 17,000 crore. It also marked the second biggest e-commerce exit in India, just after Walmart’s $16 billion deal for Flipkart which gave both founders, Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, over $1 billion each.

About a week after Sacheti’s exit, Anand has now been promoted from his previous role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of CaratLane.

“Avnish (Anand)... was employee No.1 at CaratLane and an integral part of the founding team. He has played a stellar role in building CaratLane into what it is today,” the company said in a statement.

Anand has been with the company for over eight years. The press statement also said that co-founder Gurukeerthi Gurunathan will continue to play an important role as the Chief Technology Officer of CaratLane.

While Sacheti made Rs 4,621 crore from his exit, he also made sure top-level employees at the company get rewarded handsomely in ESOP payouts. About 75 CaratLane employees are set to receive about Rs 340-30 crore, Moneycontrol had reported earlier.

“Mithun has been a pillar of support and a sounding board for all my ideas these past years, so of course it’s sad to see him go.

One lesson I have learned is to make fewer decisions. Sometimes the best thing to do is to do nothing. - Lou Simpson

Strong comeback by benchmark indices was seen on Monday, but the mood remains one of cautious optimism, now that foreign funds are selling more often than they are buying. With the earnings season behind, the search is now for the next big trigger.

Tata Power

The stock gained 4 percent on Monday and is not far from its 52-week high. Subsidiary Tata Power Renewable Energy has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) for a 9-MW on-campus solar plant with Tata Motors' Pantnagar plant. Tata Power shares came close to making a 52-week high at the start of this month, but appear to be facing stiff resistance around the Rs 250 mark. The stock had a good run last year, mainly on news flow around its renewable arm. But soon the market came around to the view that power companies can only produce so much power and so there is a limit to earnings growth as well. As a result of which, the stock fell out of favour with fund managers and analysts alike.

CLSA recently retained its 'sell' rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 195 after the company’s fourth-quarter earnings, citing expensive valuations, lower coal prices in futures and the renewables frenzy being behind.

But with power very much the flavour of the season (look at REC, Power Grid, PFC), a section of the market is now beginning to feel that maybe Tata Power could do with a valuation bump-up since it has gone nowhere for the last 18 months and earnings have risen during this period. Also, if Adani Power is finding takers despite quoting at a premium valuation, then Tata Power deserves better, argue some players.

Futures positions indicate build up of long positions.

Tug of war

The stock fell over 1 percent in a rising market on Monday. Punters appear to be unable to make up its mind over the stock, which will be part of the

MSCI Global Standard Index from September 1, but will be excluded from the Nifty Next50 index from September 20. Concerns of tighter regulations hurting earnings have abated, with Sebi softening its stance on the Total Expense Ratio charged by asset management companies.

But that has now been factored in, and the market needs to see a meaningful improvement in earnings, players tracking the stock say.

Titan

Almost every analyst tracking the company has cheered the acquisition of additional stake in jewellery maker CaratLane, but investors don’t seem impressed. The move may pay off in the long run, but at the moment, the tide is not in favour of richly valued stocks in general.

AU Small Finance Bank

Short positions in the stock have been rising steadily rover the last month. Open position in the Securities Lending and Borrowing window now stand at 37 lakh shares.

Strategy

From Buoyant Capital’s latest factsheet.

“When interest rates are hiked rapidly, there are skeletons waiting to tumble out of the closet. Inflation is funny, but it permeates into consumer behaviour. Unlike 2021, corporate profits are not changing orbits, monetary policy is not decidedly loose, and there is very little fiscal space. Incrementally, we are turning to larger-cap, low beta businesses. Core (incl. cash) is up to 63 percent, and we’ve cut our Small & Mid cap position by 14 percentage points in July 2023.”

F&O ban

Of late, the number of stocks finding themselves in the NSE’s F&O ban list has been on the rise.

“The first assumed reason for stocks going into derivative ban for all of us is that there is a lot of speculation,” tweeted technical analyst and blogger Nooresh Merani. “But one big factor is the rise of arbitrage mutual funds which now have an AUM of Rs 90,000 crore.”

Arbitrage funds try to capitalise on the differential in futures and cash market price by selling futures that quote at a premium to the cash market price and sell an equivalent quantity of the shares.

A lot of Futures Open Interest has a counterparty in Arbitrage Funds which have a Stock Long and Futures Short Position.

Costly home loans

Home loan rates in the US have hit a 23-year high of nearly 7.5 percent, which is making the supply situation worse, and keeping house prices high. That is because those who would have otherwise sold their existing houses and bought new ones are reluctant to do because they are right now paying 3 percent on their current home loan. Remember, house prices too have risen sharply after Covid. So, it is a double whammy of costlier homes as well as home loans.

… and car loans

Car buyers are hurting too. An average new car loan has an interest rate of 9.5 percent, and the average rate of used cars is close to 14 percent, reports WSJ. And, despite a strong job market, defaults and missed payments on pools of auto loans made in the first half of 2022 to people with subpar credit are matching or outpacing those issued in 2008, the report said, quoting an analysis by S&P Global.

Waiting for stimulus

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has cut its one-year loan prime rate to 3.45 percent from 3.55 percent and left its five-year rate unchanged. The market was expecting deeper cuts to both rates. Global investors are eagerly awaiting a big bang stimulus that will get the economy’s engines purring again, but the Chinese government seems to be in no hurry.

“Xi is running his economy cold in a bid to finally break China’s addiction to fueling growth with speculative apartment construction and low-return projects funded by opaque local borrowing. If China is a “ticking time bomb,” (as described by US President Joe Biden) Xi’s aim is to defuse it,” says a Bloomberg analysis piece.

Titan’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Ashok Sonthalia on August 21 said that the company has no immediate plans to list its subsidiary CaratLane in the near future.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Sonthalia mentioned that there are currently no immediate plans and Titan is not actively contemplating the idea of listing CaratLane. He emphasised that Titan's strategy is to manage a collection of jewellery brands under one umbrella, and having two publicly listed companies in the same industry doesn't align with their approach.

CaratLane is expected to grow quite faster when compared to the rest of their portfolio, added Sonthlia.

""If you look at EBITDA margin trajectory for last five year up to FY23, almost minus 9 percent to plus 9 percent it has happened CaratLane is largely diamond jewellery business. So the opportunity to keep inching up margin and gradually not only equal Titan jewellery portfolio margin but be slightly better than that exists and I think we'll see them working towards that,"" he added.

The CFO places his faith in the fact that the business has a huge opportunities of growth ahead. He said: ""Like we talked about that our jewellery business with respect to jewellery industry in India is current 7 percent market share and will go towards 10 percent by FY27.""

Within the jewellery portfolio, Caratlane stands at about 6 to 7 percent, thus hoping to inch towards 10 percent, according to Sonthalia.

Tata Group's Titan also acquired yet another 27.18 percent stake in Caratlane Trading from the founder of the jewellery brand and his family for the amount of Rs 4,621 crore in cash.

Titan is also acquiring 9,190,327 equity shares in CaratLane from Mithun Sancheti and his family, post which its total stake in the company will rise to 98.28 percent, the Tata Group company said in an exchange filing.

The latest transaction is expected to close by October 31, subject to regulatory approvals, stated Titan.

Funding of the deal

Sonthalia said that this deal with CaratLane will be funded partly via debt, and the rest by cash. As of now, Titan has over Rs 3,o00 crore cash on books.

""As far as this deal is concerned, our balance sheet is pretty healthy, we have a good cash position. But we are going to do part debt funding for this deal and we are working towards that. And by the time deal comes to closer in next two months kind of horizon, we should be ready with financing plan. But part debt funding is contemplated,"" he noted.

The Tata Group had initially purchased a 62 percent stake in the beneficiary company in 2016 at a valuation of about Rs 563 crore, post which Titan bought shares of the omnichannel retailer in tranches worth Rs 440 to Rs 450 crore between 2016 and 2019, primarily through secondary purchase of shares from Tiger Global, the only venture investor in CaratLane.

Financial status

CaratLane crossed the Rs 2000 crore topline mark in FY23, thus posting a turnover of Rs 2,177 crore amounting to a 72 percent growth from Rs 1,267 crore that it had reported in FY22. In FY21, the company had recorded a revenue of Rs 723 crore.

The company has been reporting a positive profit before tax numbers for the past three years, thus increasing at 55 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over a five-year period.

Within the June quarter of the current fiscal year, CaratLane witnessed a 32.4 percent year-on-year increase in revenues amounting to Rs 640 crore, with earnings before interest and taxes that stood at Rs 35 crore - an EBIT margin of 5.5 percent.

In the same quarter, CaratLane has managed to add 11 stores, thus taking the total count of the same to 233 spread across 93 cities in the country.",669,0.9315785935946873

CaratLane has around 1,500 employees in total, of which a majority are on the retail and manufacturing side of the business and don’t have shares in the company. Instead, they are rewarded with bonuses and hikes only.

The remaining employees, about 400 of them, are part of the startup’s corporate team where giving ESOPs was a more common practice. Of the 400 employees, 75 of them have shares in CaratLane which are now worth Rs 340 crore -380 crore and account for about 1.72 percent in CaratLane.

Titan will be buying out those shares from CaratLane employees as the company intends to own 100 percent in the startup. It has already been increasing its stake. Titan currently holds 71.09 percent stake in CaratLane and is now preparing to buy another 27.18 percent stake from Sachetti and his family for Rs 4,621 crore, pushing its ownership in the jewellery startup to 98.28 percent. The deal is expected to close by October 31, 2023, subject to regulatory approvals.

For Titan to own 100 percent of CaratLane only the ESOP pool will then remain.

“The ESOP component (of 1.72 percent in the company) will also be bought out at the same time by the end of October. A bunch of it will be done by then and whatever remains, Titan will buy as and when the vesting happens,” Mithun Sachetti, co-founder and CEO of CaratLane told Moneycontrol.

The deal in a nutshell

ESOP cashouts have already led to $1.46 billion of wealth in the hands of startup employees since the beginning of 2021, according to data from Qapita.

Until a few years ago, ESOPs were not as attractive a proposition for startup employees, unless it was a blue-blooded company you were talking about, like Flipkart. Initially, startup employees were not quite sure if the options would turn into a real shareholding and then into money.

But a string of successful initial public offerings (IPOs) such as Zomato, Paytm, Delhivery and frequent ESOP liquidity events by much smaller startups has changed the narrative.",369,

Hindustan Unilever, Titan, and Asian Paints have fewer buy calls on their stock in August as compared to last month.

Hindustan Unilever had 36 buy calls in July, but this number has reduced to 26 buy calls in August. Brokerages have downgraded Hindustan Unilever stock from a ‘buy’ rating to a ‘hold’ or ‘neutral’ rating.

Prabhudas Lilladher downgraded its rating on Hindustan Unilever to ‘hold’ from ‘accumulate’ before. The downgrade was done factoring in tepid volume growth in the food and refreshment and personal wash segments in the April-to-June quarter.

Also Read: HUL Q1 disappoints on weak demand, volume growth at 3%

The domestic brokerage firm said that HUL’s price cut strategy to compete with local players will diminish in the longer run. This means that the excitement around lower prices will fade away gradually as people get used to the new prices, making it less effective in the long run. Rural markets have, however, started to improve. Prabhudas Lilladher expects erratic weather conditions to increase inflation in daily use items and disrupt Hindustan Unilever’s volume recovery path.

Yes Securities has cut its rating on Hindustan Unilever to ‘neutral’ from ‘add’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 2,890. The brokerage firm sees limited upside on the stock in anticipation of a slower volume growth in coming quarters.

Yes Securities said that even tough rural markets are showing improvement and that demand in rural areas will come back slowly as people are still using the high priced inventory in the market. Resurgence of small players and reducing stock levels in anticipation of further input price cuts will also lead to slower volume growth for Hindustan Unilever.

Titan

Titan had 27 buy calls in July, and now has 23. Phillip Capital has downgraded the stock to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 3,100. Phillip Capital expects increased advertising spends to lower margins further as Titan is investing on above-the-line and below-the-line activities to increase its market share. Above-the-line usually refers to costs above the gross profit, which includes cost of goods sold -- cost of raw materials, wages, other facilities costs which go into producing the goods. Below-the-line expenses include operating expenses, interest and taxes.

The brokerage firm expects consumer demand to moderate on account of higher gold prices and pent-up demand. The brokerage firm believes that Titan has rich valuations and the stock does not see any meaningful appreciation.

Another brokerage DART has cut its rating for Titan to ‘sell’ with a target price of Rs 2,980 as it believes the stock has become expensive. The brokerage firm said, “Although Titan’s Q1 profitability was lower than estimates, we maintain our FY24-25 Earnings Per Share estimates at Rs 42.5 in FY24 and 48.5 in FY25 as we believe that the profitability going ahead would improve significantly.”

Asian Paints

Asian Paints now have 12 buy calls, down from 15 in July. Axis Securities has cut the rating to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 3,500. The brokerage firm believes the stock has limited upside potential in the near-term as competition from the new entrants is likely to intensify. And this will keep the profitability under check. However, Axis Securities is positive on the long-term prospects of the company.

Prabhudas Lilladher has cut the rating from ‘accumulate’ to ‘hold’ earlier, given the EPS valuations of 53.5x in FY25 and increased competition from Grasim and JSW in coming years. However, the brokerage firm is positive on long-term growth levers for Asian Paints on the back of the company’s increasing market share in decorative paints and high growth in waterproofing and the wood finishes business.

An animated video depicting how the OceanGate Titan sub imploded on June 18, killing all five voyagers, has been viewed more than 6.5 million times in the 11 days since it was posted to YouTube.

The 6.20-minute clip titled 'Implosion Titan Oceangate How it Happened' was uploaded by AiTelly, a YouTube channel that posts original 4K and 3D engineering animations, on June 30.

The narration begins by explaining what implosion is. “(It) is a process of destruction by collapsing inwards on the object itself. Where explosion expands, implosion contracts.”

""In the case of the Titan submersible, the implosion was caused due to very high hydro-static pressure of the surrounding water which happened in the fraction of a millisecond,"" it added.

At the Titanic’s 12,500-foot depth at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, there is around 5,600 pounds per square inch of pressure, the video stated. “That’s almost 400 times the pressure we experience on the surface.”

The accompanying animation showed a 3D OceanGate-branded submersible being crushed and torn apart. The video blamed the Titan’s controversial carbon fiber construction for the tragedy.

“Existing technology is based on steel, titanium, and aluminum. These are what kept other submarines from being crushed. But the Titan has had an experimental design,” the narrator said.

The video received more than 4,000 comments on YouTube.

""Several people told Stockton Rush that carbon fiber might not be the best material to use to construct a submersible but he knew it all apparently. Instead of wrapping several layers of carbon fibers at angles, the whole center section was one in one direction,"" a user commented. ""Again, I guess he knew better than anyone else. When it imploded, which was inevitable, it basically self-destructed and the people inside vaporised in a couple of milliseconds. I guess he really didn't know s*** after all.""

Another commented, ""The Titanic director explained that carbon fiber composite -- the make of the Titan -- is used very very successfully for internal pressure, for vessels like say, a scuba tank. But for something that sees external pressure, all of the advantages of carbon composites go away and all the disadvantages come into play, he said.""

Titan Company on July 6 said it has registered a 20 percent year-on-year (YoY) revenue growth with all key consumer businesses exhibiting double-digit growth for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.

The jewellery maker also said that during the quarter, it added 68 stores, including CaratLane, taking Titan's retail presence to 2,778 stores.

Tanishq added a new store in Sharjah, thereby expanding its international presence to seven stores in the GCC region and one store in the US. The domestic new store additions consisted of nine stores in Tanishq and eight stores in Mia by Tanishq.

The OceanGate submersible that imploded during a dive to the Titanic wreck last month spun out of control during its dive to the depths of the ocean in 2022, a BBC documentary has revealed.

“Am I spinning?” a male voice can be heard saying as the film shows a clip of the terrified passengers cooped up inside the cramped submersible, Titan. “Yes,” a female voice says in response.

""We have a problem,” pilot of the sub, Scott Griffith said, according to one of the five crew members on Titan.

They were part of the 2022 OceanGate Titanic Expedition – a commercial initiative to explore the 110-year-old shipwreck the submersible that took five people 12,500 feet below sea level.

""You know what I was thinking, we're not going to make it,"" passenger Reneta Rojas told the BBC, according to a Mirror report.

""We're literally 300m (600 feet) from the Titanic, and although we are already in the debris field, we can't go anywhere but go in circles,” she said, recalling the heart-stopping moment the submersible started spinning uncontrollably.

At that time, Titan had faced a technical issue involving one of its thrusters which was not mounted properly, the Mirror reported, quoting the BBC film titled ""Take Me To Titanic"". Thus, while one thruster was propelling the sub in one direction, the other was taking it the other way.

The crew members reportedly had to wait inside the sub underwater for hours as OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, who was on the submersible’s support vessel, worked to fix the issue.

“This is an experimental sub. People are informed that it’s very dangerous down there,” he had said in the documentary.

Rush was among the five members who died on the ill-fated submersible during the Titanic expedition this year. Other members on board were Pakistani billionaire Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman, British billionaire-explorer Hamish Harding and French explorer Paul-Henry Nargeolet.

They presumably died instantly when the Titan sub, about the size of an SUV car, imploded under the crushing pressure of the North Atlantic at a depth of more than two miles.

UBS Group AG completed the deal to acquire former rival Credit Suisse Group AG, sealing the biggest merger in banking since the 2008 financial crisis and creating a global wealth-management titan.

The Swiss bank announced the closing of the deal in an open letter in local and international newspapers on Monday. The takeover of Credit Suisse ends the lender’s 167-year independent existence.

The announcement caps more than two months of uncertainty for employees after UBS finalized negotiations with the Swiss government over a 9 billion Swiss franc ($10 billion) guarantee against potential losses on Credit Suisse assets. The deal sets UBS up for a windfall gain in the tens of billions of dollars and begins a period of complex integration likely to involve thousands of job cuts.

UBS agreed to take over Credit Suisse in March in an emergency sale brokered by the government, after a confidence crisis and a torrent of client outflows sent it hurtling toward bankruptcy.

The same conglomerate has now announced its entry into the retail jewellery segment with Novel Jewels, but this time the Street is not too worried about market leader Titan losing its sparkle.

""It would be too soon to expect an impact on Titan at this stage,"" said Abneesh Roy, Executive Director, Nuvama Institutional Equities. ""After all, jewellery is a business of trust.""

Back in the early 2000s, when Titan entered the jewellery business with Tanishq, it won people’s trust by introducing the Karatmeter in its stores. The proposition was simple: use the machine to verify if the jewellery sold by your family jeweller is 22-carat gold or not. That strategy was to drive home the point that local jewellers were not trustworthy.

""Brand creation in jewellery takes much longer than other discretionary categories,"" said Roy.

Tanishq has managed to maintain its pole position despite competition from several new brands. The company also caters to working women with its Mia and Zoya brands, which gives it access to an additional consumer segment.

So, Novel Jewels might find it tough to make a splash in this market.

The numbers game

Aditya Birla group will be investing about Rs 5,000 crore in the new venture and set up large-format jewellery stores across India. Analysts expect Novel Jewels to open about 150-200 outlets.

""However, this is only a rough estimate. It is unclear which model the group plans to adopt, such as having franchisees or setting up its own stores. The number of stores would vary greatly depending on the group's strategy,"" said Aman Soni, Head of Operations at Prudent Equity.

In comparison, Titan has over 540 jewellery stores, including in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and the USA. ""With expansion plans outside India, Titan has little to worry about,"" Soni added.

What is Titan up to?

According to a report by Kotak Institutional Equities in April, Titan reduced franchisee incentives for Tanishq stores from Q1 FY24, indicating the management's focus on expanding jewellery EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins, or defending the same in the event of any rise in competitive intensity.

""On a blended basis, this change would aid Titan’s standalone EBIT margin by about 50 basis points over two years (slightly front-ended),"" said Kotak.

The consumer discretionary major posted a standalone net profit of Rs 734 crore for the quarter ended March, up 50 percent over Rs 491 crore reported in the same period last year. Revenue from operations surged 33 percent to Rs 9,704 crore for the quarter.

The company’s jewellery business grew 23 percent on-year, with 31 new stores added during the quarter. The stock remains a 'Buy,' with many brokerages expecting it to breach the Rs 3,000 mark soon.

At 10.30 am, Titan was quoting at Rs 2,885 on the National Stock Exchange, about 0.28 percent higher from the previous close.

HDFC Securities' research report on Titan

While Titan continued to clock healthy revenue growth of INR 103.6bn (up 33%; 4- year CAGR: 21%; HSIE: INR 98.8bn), the margin fell short of expectations. Jewellery sales (ex-bullion; standalone) grew 23.5% (4-year CAGR: 18.4%) in Q4FY23 as both the number of buyers and ticket sizes aided growth. Non-jewellery growth of 31% YoY (4-year CAGR: 13%) remained healthy too (in-line). However, overall profitability disappointed. Consolidated jewellery EBITM, at 11% (vs HSIE: 11.7%), declined 20 bps YoY as (1) competitive intensity continued to keep gold price premium in check; (2) benefits from high diamond prices continued to wear off; and (3) low-margin gold ingots increased in the mix. Non-jewellery profitability disappointed too.

Symphony

The stock could get a boost today after the company announced a share buyback at Rs 2000 apiece, more than twice Wednesday’s closing price of Rs 984. But given the small size of offer (10 lakh shares or 1.4 percent of equity), arbitrageurs may not come rushing. Retail investors would still be better off, given an acceptance ratio of 10 percent. For others, 1 out of 80 shares will be accepted. Once a penny stock-to-multibagger story, Symphony is also a cautionary tale for investors who think multibaggers can deliver forever.

Founder Achal Bakeri turned around the fortunes of his firm company which was on the edge of bankruptcy in 2002 after diversifying way beyond its core business of air coolers. The stock which was available for less than one rupee some time in 2005, went on to top Rs 2000 in 2018 (adjusted for a 5 for 1 stock split and 1:1 bonus). Since then the stock price has halved, as topline growth slowed and margins fell sharply. One of the hot market favourites during the midcap bull run of 2016-18, the stock has fallen out of favour with analysts. Maybe it is time for Mr Bakeri to script turnaround 2.0.

Tata Chemicals

Good set of fourth quarter numbers, but the talking point right now is about the impending supply overhang in the global market which could keep soda ash prices subdued. A couple of weeks back, the company cut prices by 3-4 percent in response to continuously falling soda ash prices in China. Reports suggest huge capacity addition of soda ash in Inner Mongolia from May 2023. Kotak Institutional Equities in a recent note said that Tata Chemicals’ Q4 numbers would be strong but voiced uncertainty about the second half of 2023.

Titan

Strong fourth quarter numbers that does not come as a surprise since the company had already indicated that in its business update. A flood of positive ratings from leading brokers following the numbers. JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are overweight on the stock, Macquarie has rated it outperform and Goldman Sachs and CLSA have buy ratings. The company’s operating performance has been stellar for many quarters in a row, but the same cannot be said of its stock price move. The general view is that stocks like Titan will always remain expensive, but at the moment few seem willing to overpay.

Money for jam

Low volatility in the options market is keeping most of the professional option sellers on the sidelines. The premium on options contracts is a function of volatility. More the volatility, higher the premium. However, that has failed to temper the enthusiasm of the recent entrants as well as wealthy individuals, who feel there is easy money to be made writing options. Those who have been in the game of years say that the new traders are not paying enough attention to risk management, given that the market has not seen any violent intra-day moves for some time now. As the saying goes: “Fools rush where angels fear to tread.”

“For India, the falling dollar is helpful and the recent string of positive FPI flows could keep markets from collapsing,” writes independent trader Shankar Char in his daily note. “But the market is still looking for a sustainable narrative and that has to come from this result season. Trailing twelve months Nifty earnings comes in at (Rs) 865 and multiples remain close to 21 times. FY23 earnings didn't hold up at earlier estimates, will FY24 be better?”

Over to RBI

The US Fed has raised the benchmark rate by 25 basis points, what about the RBI? Yields on 10-year government bonds have fallen more than 25 points over the last one month, reflecting expectations that RBI is unlikely to hike interest rates at its June policy meet. A section of the market feels there is still one 25-basis point hike left. But with both consumer inflation and wholesale inflation having cooled, there is no compelling reason at this point for the central to raise rates.

Bond market traders say the impact of unseasonal rains on inflation may be minimal and inflation may remain within RBI’s upper tolerance band given the high base effect. Meanwhile, commercial paper (CP) rates have also fallen 8-17 bps in last one month, as market has taken comfort from surplus liquidity in the banking system throughout April and the RBI rate pause in April.

Bank bear

Legendary bond trader Jeffrey Gundlach is in the camp that thinks the stress in the US banking sector won’t ease till the Fed starts cutting rates. His view is that small banks will continue to lose deposits making it tough for them to grow.

“I’m really turning more bearish,” he told CNBC on Wednesday, adding, “it just seems to me that deposits are going to keep drifting out. I don’t think this is the last chapter in this regional banking problem.”

Dubious distinction

What was common between Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic? Apart from their massive failures? As it turns out – KPMG.

The Big Four accounting firm was the auditor to all these lenders, raising uncomfortable questions about the quality of its work as well as its independence, reports FT. In all three cases, it was KPMG which gave the banks’ financial statements a clean bill of health. That too as recently as February-end. Thankfully for KPMG, public memory is short and fickle. Remember 2008 and credit rating agencies? Neither do we.

Titan Company on May 3 reported a standalone net profit for the quarter ended March of Rs 734 crore, an 50 percent rise over Rs 491 crore posted a year ago.

Total revenue came in at Rs 8,753 crore, rising 25 percent over Rs 6,977 crore reported in the year-ago quarter, said the jewellery major.

According to a Moneycontrol poll of analysts, the company’s revenue was seen growing 25 percent on-year, as indicated in the operational update. The poll pegged EBITDA margin at 11.6 percent improving from 10.7 percent in the year-ago period.

The analysts expected it to report year-on-year growth of 50 percent in its standalone profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 737 crore.

For the jewellery segment, total income of Rs 7576 crore, increasing 24 percent year on year (YoY). The company said its India business grew 21 percent YoY while buyer growth was at 15 percent. Titan said the wedding segment witnessed a comeback with growth rates marginally higher than the overall retail sales growth.

EBIT of the company was Rs 997 crore with 13.2 percent EBIT margin.

The watches and wearables business recorded a total income of Rs 871 crore, up 40 percent YoY backed by strong growth in analogue watches and a multi-fold increase in wearables. EBIT was Rs 98 crore clocking an EBIT margin of 11.3 percent.

Titan Company Ltd is expected to report year-on-year growth of 50 percent in its standalone profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 737 crore when it declares its results for the March quarter today.

The jewellery and watchmaker’s revenue is seen growing 25 percent year on year, as indicated in the operational update, to Rs 9,095 crore. A poll of brokerages has pegged EBITDA margin at 11.6 percent improving from 10.7 percent in the year-ago period.

""The base quarter's margin was partly impacted by an ex-gratia payout to employees,"" noted analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities.

In the Q4 business update, Titan informed investors that it had added 2,710 stores in its retail network (including CaratLane) in the three-month period.

The maximum growth was recorded in its 'emerging businesses' category, where sales shot up 84 percent YoY. This includes fragrance and fashion accessories, and Indian dress wear sold under the 'Taneira' brand.

Meanwhile, the watches and wearables segment registered a 41 percent growth YoY while the jewellery business grew 23 percent on-year.

So, the key factor to watch out for will be how demand panned out in March when gold prices scaled a new high of Rs 60,000.

""We gather that the quarter started on a strong note but demand moderated a bit in the month of March (high base + perhaps, some impact of sharp 8-10 percent increase in gold price),"" said analysts at Kotak.

However, that impact may be offset by the benefit of a shift in some wedding dates to Q4 FY23 from Q3, as per analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities.

The Street is pegging jewellery EBIT margin at 12 percent, supported by higher studded sales and operating leverage. EBIT margin for watches is seen at 11.2 percent and for eyewear at 17 percent.

Adani Ports

The company’s board will consider a partial buyback of debt this Saturday. Adani Ports is clearly among the better liked stocks in the Adani stable as far fund managers and wealthy traders are concerned. Operationally, too, the company has been doing well. The question is not so much about whether the company can service its debts, but more about how much premium the market is willing to pay for the stock.

Angel One

The stock fell close to 3 percent on Wednesday after reporting a decent quarterly earnings performance earlier in the week. Management commentary is not inspiring. MD Dinesh Thakkar says the focus will be on market share and not cost to income ratio. Meaning, margins are likely to be under pressure. The broker is trying to add clients in Tier-III cities where the cost of acquisition is higher. Besides, it does not expect average revenue per client to go up. Outlook on broking stocks in general remains cautious. The glory days of 2020-21 are unlikely to return any time soon from the looks of it.

Old is gold

Shares of gold loan NBFCs Muthoot Finance and Manappuram Finance have had a good run over the last month, rising 15 percent and 19 percent in a market that has not gone anywhere. True, the stocks are way off their peaks seen in November 2021 as banks got aggressive in gold financing, hurting Muthoot’s and Manappuram’s market share and margins. Do the stocks make a good long term bet? Kotak Securities’ Nischint Chawathe feels pessimism for traditional gold financing NBFCs may have peaked.

What gives these players the edge is that they have better experience of dealing with a downturn in gold prices, unlike banks which have only seen the upcycle so far. When gold prices fall, the loan value goes down and defaults go up as borrowers can always buy gold cheaper from the market. Chawathe feels the traditional gold loan players will make a strong comeback once gold prices decline.

Titan

The company has cut franchisee incentives for Tanishq stores, as it tries to defend margins in a highly competitive environment and grapples with demand headwinds from rising gold prices. The company’s fourth quarter update was strong, with revenues getting a lift from higher watches and wearables sales, as also from its new business lines. But the stock performance shows that investors not enthused. “The performance is good, but so is the stock price” is the signal that market is giving Titan. Hence the desperation to defend margins, it seems.

Voltas

The heatwave may have people rushing to buy air-conditioners, but investors seem guarded when it comes to buying the stocks of the company that makes them. Voltas shares have been crawling higher over the past few sessions, but are still way off the highs seen in last month when forecasts of a harsh summer started coming in.

F&O data too seems to indicate a lack of conviction among buyers. Rajesh Sriwastava, a Bengaluru-based trader, says it is not the buying by bulls but short covering by some large bears that is lifting the share price.

“For a strong up-move, lot more bullish positions need to be built, however the change in open interest is barely 80 lots. That means new positions being created are significantly lower than the median 250 lots and most of the volume is due to shorts being closed,” he told Short Call.

Downsizing @ Disney

The ‘happiest place on earth’ is about to deliver some grim news to thousands of staffers. Walt Disney Co is preparing to slash jobs across its theme parks, TV and film divisions as soon as next week. The layoffs will impact every region where the entertainment behemoth operates. The company had in February said it planned to shed 7,000 positions out of its headcount of over 2,20,000, helping it save $5.5 billion in costs. After the stomach-churning layoffs in tech, other sectors too are looking to hop on the axe express.

Tesla

Tesla’s quarterly profits fell 24 percent year-on-year, prompting investors to dump the stock. CEO Elon Musk told analysts that he expected 12 months of “stormy weather” in the economy due to rising interest rates, which could affect demand for cars. He also signalled that Tesla will continue to cut prices to boost demand, even if that meant sacrificing margins. Musk’s argument is that Tesla is better placed than its rivals to be able to withstand price cuts.

ESG in Asia: In slow lane

Asian money managers may be industry leading when it comes to juggling global and local demands, but the same enthusiasm seems lacking for environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards. In a recent report, WWF Singapore flagged that Asian asset managers were way behind their European counterparts in taking nature-related risks into account, and disclosing responsible investing actions. “Only one out of 18 Asian asset managers has a direct link between the remuneration of senior management and/or portfolio managers and ESG performance,” it noted.

Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, Titan has managed to report a 25 percent year-on-year increase in its top line for the March quarter. The company has attributed this growth to higher contributions from watches & wearables and its emerging businesses. This makes Titan the only 'buy' in the Indian consumer discretionary sector, according to Goldman Sachs.

In fact, the 'emerging businesses' category saw the maximum growth with sales shooting up by 84 percent YoY. This category includes fragrance and fashion accessories, and Indian dress wear sold under the 'Taneira' brand, which grew by 208 percent YoY.

The watches & wearables segment also did well, registering a 41 percent growth YoY. This growth was driven by strong growth in analog watches segment and almost tripling of revenues from wearables.

Jewellery segment

Meanwhile, the company’s jewellery business grew 23 percent on-year, with 31 new stores being added during the quarter. This came on a low base as Q4 FY22 was disrupted due to partial lockdowns caused by Omicron wave.

If we look at the jewellery segment’s trajectory over the last few quarters, it grew 11 percent on-year in Q3 FY23 and 18 percent in Q2 FY23. Compared to that Q4’s growth has been higher. The major reason behind this has also been rising gold prices, which in turn means higher making charges for jewellery.

The company said in its update that large ticket purchases were led by a rich mix of high value studded, solitaires and a revival in wedding sales. The purchases at entry level and lower price bands also saw normalization in buyer growth.

Analyst recommendations

The stock has been sideways for some time now, declining closed to 5 percent in the last six months. But the number of analyst ""buy"" calls for the stock keeps increasing. According to JPMorgan, Titan is a preferred discretionary play. The firm believes that Titan is well-positioned to achieve its targeted 20 percent jewellery revenue compound annual growth rate over FY22-27.

Citi has also given a 'buy' rating to Titan, with a target at Rs 3,091 per share, citing the company's impressive growth despite a relatively weak March.

Macquarie has an 'outperform' call, with a target at Rs 3,250 per share. “Demand at lower price points seems to be recovering. Additionally, the demand softening in March due to a sharp rise in gold prices is expected to reverse,” it said.

At 10:30 am, the stock was quoting at Rs 2,566 on the NSE, higher by 0.7 percent. It touched a high of Rs 2,602, soon after market open.

Celebrities who appear in Manyavar ads get married soon after – this Bollywood pop culture joke started doing the rounds after Virat Kohli-Anushka Sharma’s wedding. Just like its slick ads, parent Vedant Fashions’ formidable position in the wedding apparel market caught the eye of investors when it listed a year ago.

The popular narrative on D-Street is that Vedant Fashions is the next Titan. Titan’s Tanishq created a brand out of a largely unorganised sector, and so did Vedant Fashions’ Manyavar. Both are eyeing a piece of the Indian consumer’s discretionary spend.

The stock debuted early last year at an IPO price of Rs 866. Trading at Rs 1,100 currently, investors are sitting pretty on a 30 percent gain. Analysts continue to be bullish on the stock. Per Bloomberg, it has seven buy calls, nil holds, and only one sell call. But could Manyavar truly be the compounding machine that Titan, the storied investment of late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, turned out to be?

Do the numbers add up?

In the early 2000s, when Jhunjhunwala decided to invest, Titan was highly leveraged with a debt-to-equity ratio of over 3. Its mainstay was still watches. It was building its jewellery business, which went on to transform the company.

Today, jewellery constitutes 80 percent of its revenue. The stock has compounded 40 percent annually since 2000, on the back of sales growth of 18 percent and net profit growth of about 23 percent. It commands a market cap of Rs 2.24 lakh crore now and trades at a P/E of 70. If the market continues to give it a valuation that’s on the higher end of its historic range, it is because investors believe in its ability to maintain this pace of growth due to its track record.

Vedant Fashions hit the market in February 2022 with a market capitalisation of Rs 22,333 crore, annual sales of Rs 1,008 crore, and net profit of Rs 308 crore. One year since going public, the stock has gained about 30 percent, with an estimated 30 percent sales growth on-year, and profit growth of 40 percent, largely driven by pent-up wedding demand.

The previous two years, FY20-21 and FY21-22, were tough for Manyavar because of the pandemic, which depressed sales and profits. At its current price, it is trading at a P/E of 70, the same as Titan. Its market cap-to-sales ratio is already at a premium to Titan’s.

Manyavar was launched in 2002, and it has taken 20 years for it to get to Rs 1,000 crore in sales. Launched in 1984, Titan, too, clocked Rs 1,000 crore in annual turnover after 20 years, but it began operations at a time when the per capita consumption as well as inflation were much lower.

The big value-creation opportunity that Titan offered in its initial years when RJ bought the stock might be already over. But with both stocks trading at similar valuations, can Vedant Fashions match up to Titan in terms of growth and return ratios, as most analysts believe? That requires an understanding of the strength in the moat of the two companies.

The business of trust

Titan’s turnaround story is a famous case study. In the book Titan: Inside India's Most Successful Consumer Brand, Vinay Kamath writes how the watchmaker won people’s trust when it introduced the Karatmeter in its stores.

The proposition was simple: use the machine to verify if the jewellery sold by your family jeweller is pure 22-carat gold or not. That strategy was essentially to drive home the point that local jewellers were not trustworthy, the centre-piece of Tanishq’s strategy to capture customers.

“Tanishq’s initial years were tough. It took them some time to understand customer behaviour and the kind of value they were seeking,” said Saloni Nangia, President, Technopak Advisors.

The company also catered to working women with its Mia and Zoya brands, which gave it access to a new pool of consumers, Nangia added.

Contrast this with Indian traditional wear — there is no such pressing need for trust. Stylish designs, decent fabric, and affordability are the most important criteria.

“Nothing stops many more players from entering the market, offering discounts, and putting pressure on Vedant’s growth and margins. Brand loyalty in this segment will be limited,” said Digant Haria, Co-Founder, GreenEdge Wealth.

Manu Rishi Guptha, Founder, MRG Capital, also said that the barriers to entry are low. Multiple shops in New Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and Bengaluru sell similar designs at much cheaper prices. Ethnic wear has little long-term value, which makes it easy for customers to shift loyalties. If you ask millennials, they are happy to even rent their most-loved wedding attire than spend a bomb for a one-day event.

“Though Vedant has built efficiencies in terms of centralised design and efficient procurement, these are hardly non-replicable. Competitors have taken big strides to gain market share from the company,” Guptha added.

Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail has picked up a stake in the brand Sabyasachi. Meanwhile, Reliance Retail has acquired a stake in Ritu Kumar and Manish Malhotra. These brands are a notch higher, which can make it difficult for Manyavar to crack that market. Competition from the unorganised market, too, can eat away its share, thus limiting its ability to raise prices.

“Traditional wear purchase is not a very frequent affair for most Indians. Thus, Vedant Fashions is more dependent on finding new customers and opening new stores all the time. Titan, on the other hand, can bank on a large repeat purchase base,” explained Haria.

What do the recent numbers suggest?

Vedant Fashions’ same-store sales growth (SSSG) fell 8.7 percent in Q3FY22-23 over Q3FY21-22. Compared to Q3FY20-21, it recorded a low single-digit SSSG of 4.2 percent. SSSG for Titan grew 9 percent on-year in Q3 FY22-23.

“From the sales growth of both the companies vis-à-vis their competitors, it is evident that while Titan is holding its ground, Vedant Fashions has started to concede market share as its moat is being eroded by the competition,” said Guptha, whose fund holds Titan.

While there is no doubt that Tanishq was hugely successful in creating a formidable brand, the ever-rising price of gold has also helped the company boost profits. Making charges for jewellery are usually a percentage of the final price, which goes up with rising gold rates. That’s a huge tailwind Manyavar does not have.

If Manyavar has to ensure high growth, it needs to look at new segments or convert customers from the unorganised market faster. Both are challenging. Retail experts acknowledge that apparels is a tough business with stiff competition across segments. There have been very few companies across the world which have delivered high return on capital on a sustained basis.

Titan has also launched a women’s ethnic wear brand, Taneira, which is in direct competition with Manyavar’s Mohey. Under this brand, Titan is eyeing Rs 300 crore of revenue in the current fiscal and Rs 1,000 crore by FY27, which was Manyavaar’s annual sales last fiscal.

That should settle any debate or comparison between the two companies, though Titan, too, has its own risks. But that is another story.

Strong quarterly performance which saw a 42 percent year-on-year growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,782 crore contributed to the high upgrades over the month for Bajaj Finserv.

Brokerage Sharekhan, has given the company a buy rating with an upside potential of 23 percent over yesterday's closing price, and believes the company’s digital initiatives will drive growth.

“For the general insurance business, the company is focusing on profitability and generating sustainable RoE (return on equity) while pursuing sustainable premium growth which is a key positive. The life insurance business is growing stronger due to its focus on a balanced product mix and new product launches. We believe strong growth in the lending business and an improving outlook for both the insurance businesses will likely act as a positive trigger for strong consolidated earnings going forward,” analysts at the firm said in a note.

Adani Ports, which saw a strong sell-off triggered by the negative report by US-based Hindenburg Research on the group, did not however lose favour among analysts, who gave buy recommendations on the basis of the company’s strong business outlook and positive cash flows.

Adani Ports may generate a cumulative operating cash flow of Rs 26,100 crore in FY24-25 with a capital expenditure of Rs 12,000 crore, resulting in Rs 14,000 crore of free cash flow, substantially higher than its debt-repayment obligations of Rs 11,000 crore, as per JM Financial. The brokerage sees a 35 percent upside at a target price of Rs 800 and expects Adani Ports to remain the market leader in India with volume growth of 16 percent, translating into revenue growth of 15 percent, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) growth of 15 percent and PAT (profit after tax) growth of 13 percent, compounded annually over FY23-25E.

HDFC Life Insurance got the maximum downgrades in February, followed by Divi’s Laboratories and Grasim Industries.

The budget proposal to tax income from high-value insurance policies (excluding unit-linked products) having premiums of over Rs 5 lakh annually has weighed in on HDFC Life, with its share price tanking around 20 percent since. HDFC Life’s share of the business of non-unit-linked policies with an annual premium of above Rs 5 lakh is over 10 per cent.

According to Phillip Capital, “HDFC Life will be the most impacted, given a higher share of single-premium product (Sanchay Fixed Maturity Plan), which constitutes around 20-25 percent of NPAR (non-participating insurance plan) APE (annualised premium equivalent),” said analysts at Phillip Capital.

A single-premium product or policy carries a large-ticket premium as it is paid through a single, upfront lump sum payment while a non-participating insurance plan is one with a guaranteed payout at maturity.

“(HDFC Life has a) very high dependence on a product which may go out of fashion or may have to be revamped or relaunched based on the new budget proposals,” said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research, HDFC Securities. He added that the company was the most expensive insurance stock compared to peers, which could have also led to high downgrades.

While poor performance for the last couple of quarters has resulted in high downgrades for Divi’s, the mixed outlook towards the pharma sector, in general, has also led to the inclusion of names like Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries in the list of top 10 downgrades last month.

“There are multiple pressures, one is on non-branded generic exports which is the weakest segment of the market. There is absolutely no pricing power, in fact, just to get the volumes going, these companies are selling at either cost or even below cost. So till there is price recovery in non-branded generics, which is still a fair part of all these companies’ business, that pressure will continue. The second is that while there is a reduction in input prices, margin pressure still exists, so it’s not like they are going to benefit. So I think the non-branded generics business is what is going to keep pressures on these companies for a fair bit of time till we see price recovery there.” said Abhay Agarwal, Founder of Piper Serica Advisors, a portfolio management services firm.

Quarterly upgrades, downgrades

Bajaj Finance topped the list for the highest upgrades over the past quarter followed by Bajaj Finserv and Adani Ports.

Bajaj Finance’s move towards digital transformation to increase growth in client acquisition as well as assets under management has made analysts more confident about its business model.

“Omnipresence strategy and organic momentum building up offer comfort on growth sustainability. We revise target price to Rs 7,250 from Rs 8,650 keeping multiple at ~5.7x FY25E ABV,” said ICICI Direct analysts.

Brokerage firm IIFL believes that Bajaj Finance is building an ecosystem to preserve customer cohorts across various businesses. With its fintech platform and health-tech platform, customers may not have to look around for products that Bajaj Finance doesn’t offer directly, it said.

With all its offerings under one digital umbrella, Bajaj finance is better positioned in terms of customer acquisition, engagement as well opportunities to cross-sell.

Among the top 10 companies with the maximum upgrades over a quarter, Bajaj Auto saw the highest number of buy ratings, rising to 34 versus 31 a quarter ago. The general uptrend in the auto sector along with its resilient performance in the face of global macro challenges had analysts upbeat on the stock.

Tech Mahindra, Divi’s Labs and HDFC Life were among the companies with the highest number of downgrades over the past quarter.

The number of hold ratings on Tech Mahindra’s stock increased to 15 this quarter from 11 a quarter ago, while buy ratings dropped to 21 from 29. Motilal Oswal, which has a neutral rating on the stock, said that near-term growth remains weak and they are waiting for more comfort in margins.

“Although its current performance remains muted, the company's high exposure to the communications vertical offers a potential opportunity, as a broader 5G rollout can result in a new spending cycle in this space,” it added.

Maximum upgrades, downgrades over past year

Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) had the maximum upgrades over last year, with 32 buy calls compared to 23 a year ago. The hold calls on the company’s stock have also shrunk from 11 to 2.

The company is firing on all cylinders, said research firm Antique Stock Broking in its initiating coverage on RIL.

“While O2C (oil-to-chemicals) will benefit from the ‘platinum age of refining’, telecom is set to ride the 5G transition with significant tariff increase tailwind, robust growth in retail from aggressive investments so far, and the gas production growth driving earnings of oil and gas segment,” the brokerage said, adding that it saw an upside of 25 percent at a target price of Rs 2,900 apiece.

The O2C business stoked optimism in the light of earnings growth as well as refining margin recovery. The sector is further expected to do well with the International Energy Agency saying that oil demand will hit a record in CY23 and grow by 2 million barrels per day year-on-year.

ITC, Titan and Bajaj Finance followed RIL in terms of the most upgrades over the past year.

ITC’s stock witnessed its buy ratings increase to 35 compared to 27 a year ago on the back of consistently improving financial performance reported in the last few quarters. In its latest quarter, ITC reported a 21 percent annualized increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 5,031 crore.

“We expect the strong business growth momentum to continue across divisions. In cigarettes, we believe a pragmatic tax regime not only acts as fodder for illicit volume growth but also increases its predictability premium. We expect FMCG, hotels and paperboard to continue to witness improvement in business and margins supported by new launches and reach expansion. We increase FY23F-25F EPS by +2-3 percent to factor in the 3Q23 beat,” Nomura said in its research note.

Analysts at Motilal Oswal believe that ITC is still trading at a 15 percent discount to its January 2019 valuations of 25.4 times one-year forward earnings per share, even though valuations of ITC’s global tobacco peers have been restored to their pre-Covid levels.

“The stock has gained 45 percent since our upgrade to Buy call in Jun 2022 and we believe there is further scope for upside based on its healthy earnings outlook,” they said.

Divi’s Laboratories got the maximum downgrades in the last year followed by JSW Steel and Tech Mahindra, while Wipro saw the highest number of hold ratings at 17.

For JSW Steel the high debt had analysts doubting its steep valuation with many not seeing any upside in the stock price.

Tech Mahindra and Wipro seem to have borne the brunt of the slowdown in the IT sector in the last year of Tech Mahindra and Wipro have declined 22 percent and 32 percent, respectively, in the last year.",1510,0.5058347071920123

Zoya, the luxury jewellery brand from the house of Titan, is looking to more than double its revenue as well as the store count over the next three years from what it has done all through its 14-year history.

Since its launch in 2009, Zoya has become a Rs 200-crore sub-brand in the Titan stable which grosses over Rs 40,000 crore annually, with seven showrooms -- the latest addition being just last week at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel -- and an equal number of galleries.

If everything goes as planned, and if the demand for luxury maintains the current growth momentum, we will have at least eight more boutiques by FY27, adding to our seven stores and seven galleries at present, CK Venkatraman, the managing director of Titan Company, which is a joint venture between the Tatas and the Tamil Nadu government, told PTI.

On the investment side, he said each store commands at least Rs 40 crore, which means, they will invest over Rs 320 crore over the next three years.

The investment in each boutique is close to Rs 40 crore. Despite such high investment, the brand Zoya is profitable, he added.

When asked if doubling the number of footprints also implies doubling the topline from the present Rs 200 crore -- which is not even a per cent of the parent's annual turnover, Venkatraman answered in the affirmative.

If all goes well, yes. The top line can also be more given the projected explosion in the number of high networth individuals and the domestic luxury market, he said.

He bases his optimism on the fact that India is among the fastest-growing luxury markets globally and is forecast to be around USD 8.5 billion this year, and some estimates say it will grow to USD 200 billion by 2030. And with the number of HNIs growing very fast, we expect the demand for Zoya to grow.

When asked why such a slow expansion, Venkatraman said Zoya was not created with a focus only on numbers. ""We created Zoya with a vision of a brand as a world-class product. It was created as a very refined product for the discerning Zoya woman who is self-expressive, aesthetically astute, globally aware and well-travelled who is a sophisticated aesthete and every creation in Zoya is a meaningful piece of wearable art.""

Also, when one is marketing luxury, exclusivity is an important element. This is maintained partly by consciously limiting sales volumes and outlets. Citing the examples of Taj Palace Mumbai he said Taj is amongst the most diversified hospitality groups, with 196 hotels but only nine palace hotels which are their most luxurious.

In the same way, we have over 1,000 Titan stores, but Zoya as a luxury brand, will have a more exclusive retail footprint.

""And when our customers tell us that Zoya is India's answer to the West, we feel we are on the right track,"" he said, adding Zoya, which means 'alive', was created 14 years ago to celebrate womanhood.

He said the brand commands higher margin justifying the higher investment. With Zoya we are redefining the way fine jewellery is experienced as meaningful pieces of wearable art, offering an experience of warm luxury.

Every Zoya creation takes 9-12 months to make as they are made of the finest stones by astute craftsmen. And so are the boutiques designed and commands an investment of close to Rs 40 crore for each.

On the product side he said, Zoya introduced two signature collections last year  Samave and Aeterna, with patents in design and cut and a high-end jewellery collection Beyond.

On Titan, he said despite the market leader, its share is only less than 10 per cent in the jewellery industry, and hence there is headroom for growth. ""We will continue to be very aggressive when it comes to expansion.""",646,0.9854155108332634

Moneycontrol Budget Sensitivity index (MCBudEx) closed 0.73 percent higher on February 3, with Bank of Baroda and Titan emerging as the biggest gainers while Crompton Greaves declining 8 percent.

Bank of Baroda saw a strong move after reporting a net profit of Rs 3,852.74 crore for the December quarter, a 75 percent year-on-year increase that was helped by strong net interest income growth.

The public sector lender's interest income rose to Rs 23,540 crore from Rs 17,963 crore a year ago. Its asset quality metrics showed significant improvement, with the share of bad loans in the overall loan book falling. The gross bad loan ratio dropped to 4.53 percent in the December quarter, from 7.25 percent a year ago.

From the Budget angle, banks are set to see higher credit growth as the government pegged capex spend 33 percent higher at Rs 10 lakh crore for FY24.

Titan was the other big mover on the index. The stock is a big beneficiary of the changes in personal tax regime that will ensure more money in the hands of consumers for spending.

Despite reporting a 10 percent YoY decline in profit in the October-December quarter, brokerages are largely positive on the stock's prospects.

CLSA has maintained a “buy” rating on the stock with a target at Rs 3,000. Morgan Stanley has kept “overweigh”' rating with the target at Rs 3,030 a share.

""The jewellery market share gains and positive demand trends in January are key positives for the medium-term outlook,"" they said.

Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals was the biggest loser on the MC BudEx. It fell 8 percent after a sharp rise in employee costs and weak operating leverage weighed on the margin, which contracted sharply by 424 basis points on year, in the December quarter.

The total revenue came in at Rs 11,698 crore, rising 15.89 percent from Rs 10,094 crore in the year ago quarter, the company said in a stock exchange filing.

The Tata group company was estimated to report a post-tax profit of Rs 985 crore on revenue of Rs 10,656 crore, according to an average of estimates by five brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.

The company said its India business grew by 9 percent in the same period, backed by healthy consumer demand during the festive season. The customer walk-ins were robust and consumer preference for differentiated designs were prominent across categories, it added.

Business continued to invest in brands and digital capabilities and pursue

market share gains through competitive offers and pricing. EBIT stood at Rs 1,236 crores clocking 13 percent EBIT margin.

Tanishq opened its first boutique store in New Jersey, USA in December 2022 taking the total international count to 6 stores. A total of 22 stores (excluding Caratlane) were added during the quarter, taking the total Jewellery store count to 510 spread across 247 cities.

Though the Street is not expecting any fireworks from Titan Company’s October-December quarter (Q3) numbers, the jewellery and watchmaker is expected to put up a decent show. The Tata group company is estimated to report a post-tax profit of Rs 985 crore on revenue of Rs 10,656 crore, according to an average of estimates by five brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.

While net profit will grow 22 percent sequentially, it will be largely flat year-on-year (YoY) due to a high base. In Q3 FY22, the company’s net profit had zoomed 91 percent YoY on the back of pent-up demand after COVID-19 lockdowns.

“Titan is likely to report optically weak numbers off an exceptionally strong wedding season base of Q3 FY22 and Q3 FY21,” noted analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

In its Q3 business update, the company has already informed that combined sales for the quarter grew 12 percent, with maximum growth recorded by the 'emerging businesses' category at 75 percent. This includes fragrance and fashion accessories, and Indian dress wear sold under the Taneira brand.

A total of 111 new retail outlets were added in the quarter across businesses, taking the total count to 2,362.

Keeping the base effect aside, demand momentum continues to be robust, led by the festival season and stable gold prices during the quarter, believe analysts. The Street is forecasting 11 percent growth YoY in the jewellery segment.

The watches & wearables segment is set to register 14 percent growth, while sales from the eyecare business will grow 10 percent YoY, said MOFS.

Meanwhile, Kotak Institutional Equities is factoring in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margins at 13.4 percent for jewellery business, 13.8 percent for watches, and 15.5 percent for eyewear.

On an overall basis, operating margins will contract over 100 basis points (bps) YoY as the base quarter had a one-time gain of higher studded realisation, it added.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

As per brokerages, the key factors to watch out for will be ― outlook on international business expansion, volume growth trend, commentary on market share gains in the South, update on inventory levels, and capital base movement.

Pent-up demand after the pandemic-induced lockdowns boosted the top line of most companies – paints, quick service restaurants (QSRs), consumer electronics, and apparels.

The 290 companies that make up the BSE Consumer Discretionary Index posted an over 19 percent year-on-year growth in sales and 170 percent YoY increase in net profit.

However, FY23 has turned out to be sombre so far. For the half-year ended September 2022, the net profit of the pack fell 25 percent compared to the six-month ended March 2022, while sales grew 3 percent. The index has fallen almost 40 percent last year compared with a 21 percent gain in the year before.

Operating margins of companies catering to discretionary spending have contracted over 100 basis points on the back of rising raw material prices. And the prospects for FY24 don’t look too bright either.

“We suspect the slowdown in discretionary consumption is due to a combination of factors: possible slowdown in new hiring in the organised sector, withering of pent-up demand, especially after the festive season, elevated inflation sapping household savings, and increase in mortgages due to a sharp jump in interest rates,” Kotak Institutional Equities said.

This became evident in the Q3 numbers. Asian Paints and Pidilite both posted volume growth that was little changed against expectations of 4-5 percent growth. Both flagged demand strain in the rural and semi-urban areas.

Electrical consumer goods company Havells reported a 7.2 percent fall in quarterly profit, citing “moderating” consumer demand.

“For quick service restaurants, we were expecting same-store sales growth of 8-10 percent in FY23, but it looks like we will end the fiscal with only 5-6 percent growth,” said Karan Taurani, senior VP - research analyst at Elara Capital.

Titan’s jewellery business growth moderated to a single digit after doubling in Q2 of FY22. But negating the high base effect, the three-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in volumes is 12 percent.

D-Mart operator Avenue Supermarts reported 3-4 percent per-store revenue growth as general merchandise and apparel segments did not do “as well as expected.”

Outlook for FY24

The modest sales growth reported by discretionary companies came largely on the back of prices that were increased to offset high raw material costs and the trend of premiumisation in metro cities. For top line and bottom line to grow sustainably, sales have to be driven by higher demand and volumes, but that is a long road ahead, analysts said.

While the Street expects 15-18 percent EPS (earnings per share) growth for consumer discretionary companies, foreign brokerages CLSA and Jefferies have said they see downside risks to this number. In the consumer space, they prefer staples over discretionary.

Also Read: Consumer staples to outperform discretionary stocks in H2FY23, says CLSA

“There are concerns about further slowdown in discretionary and retail, especially after nearly two years of strong recovery and aggressive network expansion. FY24 will also see EPS growth converging for staples and discretionary stocks, with downside risk to estimates in discretionary,” according to Jefferies.

Discretionary stocks continue to trade at a premium to staples and their own history and are prone to further de-rating in 2023 if growth moderates, it added.

Challenges, budget

The downside risks are mainly low levels of disposable income and low penetration of discretionary goods in India.

“A slowdown in startup funding has driven job cuts in several cases, even as an increase in interest rates would lead to higher EMI outgo for households,” according to Jefferies. In addition, there are sector-specific challenges such as rising competition in the paints and consumer electronics segments.

The electronics industry also has to deal with high import duties on motors and components. Since January 1, ceiling fans have become 8-20 percent costlier because of new norms set by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency. This will further affect consumer affordability.

The PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry has pushed for an increase in consumption-led demand in Budget 2023 through a hike in per capita disposable income. This can be achieved by enhancing consumption expenditure rebate to Rs 5 lakh per annum, the Chamber said.

Some industry leaders are batting for the basic income tax exemption limit to be increased to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 2.5 lakh and enhancement of standard deduction of Rs 50,000 to about Rs 80,000.

The government is likely to continue with its thrust on initiatives such as Make in India and production-linked incentive schemes to boost local manufacturing and employment generation.

Companies are asking the government for a five-year extension in the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors with an increased outlay of Rs 10,000 crore in the Union Budget for FY24.

Rationalisation of goods and services tax rates is also on the wish list.

“We expect the government to look at categories like fans, which is a product of basic need and still being taxed at 18 percent. Mandatory star labelling norms have further led to price increases. We feel that the GST rate across energy efficient products should be reduced to help people switch to these products,” Rakesh Khanna, managing director of Orient Electric, told Moneycontrol.

Relief in import duties and input tax credits can help boost the health of the discretionary sector, said experts.

Leading jewellery and watchmaker Titan has recorded 12 per cent growth in its standalone business in the December quarter, led by ""healthy consumer demand"" spurred by a vibrant festive season.

""The positive consumer sentiment helped all categories clock healthy double-digit growths despite a high base in the same period of last year,"" as per the quarterly update by Titan for Q3 FY23.

The Tata group firm also continued network expansion by adding 111 stores in October-December, taking the total number to 2,362 at the end of the quarter.

During the quarter, Titan Jewellery, which generally contributes more than two-thirds of its revenue, achieved 11 per cent Y-O-Y growth.

""Healthy new buyer growths in the festive period, higher-value purchases in the studded category and unique new collections for the season helped the division achieve an 11 per cent growth YoY (excluding bullion sales),"" said Titan.

Sales from the studded category moderately outpaced the gold jewellery (plain) segment. Wedding sales grew in line with the division's overall sales, it noted.

As part of its global expansion, Titan opened its first international boutique store of Tanishq in New Jersey, US in December 2022.

""With this store opening, the international presence now spans 6 stores across Dubai, Abu Dhabi and the USA. The new store expansion (net) for the quarter consisted of 8 stores in Tanishq and 14 in Mia by Tanishq,"" it said.

Its 'Watches & Wearables' segment reported 14 per cent growth Y-o-Y. This was led by ""strong traction"" in the wearables space.

""A slew of exciting product launches in the fiscal year leading to the festive season contributed well to more than tripling sales from the wearables sub-segment in the quarter compared to the same period last year,"" it said.

In the eye care segment, the company said sales from Titan Eye+ stores and trade and distribution channel saw growth in-line with the overall division.

""EyeCare expanded its nationwide presence adding 36 new stores in Titan Eye+ (net) for the quarter,"" it said.

Fragrances and Fashion Accessories (F&FA) grew 39 per cent Y-o-Y. This was driven by 50 per cent growth in fragrances and around 21 per cent growth in fashion accessories, the update said.

Yes, the Titan Talk smartwatch packs a speaker and microphone that allows you to take calls directly from the watch so long as it is connected to a smartphone. The Titan Talk smartwatch’s price in India is set at Rs 9,995, and comes in blue, grey, gold and black colour schemes. After our brief period with the Titan Talk smartwatch, here’s our full review of the device.

Design

Our model of the Titan Talk BT calling smartwatch came in a black colour option with a black silicone strap that is easily replaceable and looks ordinary to say the least. The watch has a black aluminium case with the Titan logo on the left and two buttons on the right. The crown doubles as the back button and can be rotated to adjust volume. The other button brings up the workout menu.

The smartwatch features a 46mm dial that is protected by clear mineral glass. The 22mm silicone strap is quite comfortable and easy to replace if you want to swap it out for something more stylish. The watch also comes with an IP68 rating for water resistance. Overall, the Titan Talk smartwatch was comfortable to use and felt quite sturdy. While I couldn’t say the watch has a premium design and build, it is not too shabby either.

Display

For the display, Titan uses a 1.39-inch AMOLED panel with a pixel density of 462 PPI. The screen is quite bright and was easily readable under direct sunlight. Unfortunately, the display does not have an auto-brightness mode, while the touch response made the experience feel a little laggy, although this seems more like a software issue. Moreover, the display also has thick bezels that surround the dial. The smartwatch does have a ‘lift to wake’ mode, which works well for the most part.

Features

The Titan Talk smartwatch comes with 20 sports modes that can be easily accessed via the side button. While cycling, I found the watch accurately tracked calories burnt and covered various other metrics like average heart rate. You also get a breakdown of your activity showing the level of intensity during the workout. The Titan Talk smartwatch also monitors SpO2 or blood oxygen levels. It also supports sleep tracking, providing an overall score after breaking down sleep patterns into Deep Sleep, Light Sleep, REM and Awake.

Heart rate and sleep tracking was more or less in line with the results on the Apple Watch Series 8. There were inconsistencies with SpO2 monitoring and steps counted. Additionally, the lack of an in-built GPS also didn’t provide the distance covered while cycling or running. The Titan Talk smartwatch offers all the standard metrics and features of a regular smartwatch but doesn’t go above and beyond. Moreover, it loses out on the in-built GPS, stress monitoring and offers limited sports modes.

The Titan Talk can be paired with your smartphone using Bluetooth 5.1. The watch is pretty easy to set up and offers seamless connectivity. It can be used to make or receive calls thanks to its internal speaker and microphone. It also comes with CrystalVoice Technology, allowing you to take calls in marginally noisy environments. The microphone is positioned on the right of the dial and tends to struggle in open environments, particularly when there are vehicles around. I often struggled to get my message through to the person at the other end of the call.

I often struggled to get my message through to the person on the other end of the call. The new Titan Talk smartwatch also delivers notifications on time. Users can also take photos directly from the watch by opening the ‘camera’ option on the watch and then taping the Titan notification on your connected device. The watch also reminds you to drink water and offers breath exercises. You can also control music playback on the watch playing, pausing, forwarding, rewinding, and adjusting volume of the content playing on your connected device.

Software

The smartwatch can be paired with Titan’s Smart World app. The app is available for both Android and iOS and gives you detailed information about your workouts, sleep patterns, calories burnt, and more. You also have access to a global Titan community and a new ‘Reward’ system will be coming soon. There are 100 watch faces available for download from the app and you can also customise your watch face from pictures in your library. The watch also supports Google Assistant and a calculator.

You can also check the weather directly from the watch and there are two games installed, although I never got around to playing them. The smartwatch also has a music player that can load up to 50 songs locally. The smartwatch also has a ‘Find’ feature to locate your smartphone. Going back to the app, which allows you to turn on notifications and chose which apps you want to receive notifications from. Overall, the Titan Smart World app doesn’t provide a ton of data outside the watch, I think it could offer more in terms of activity statistics.

Battery

Titan’s Bluetooth calling smartwatch deliver solid battery life thanks to a 310 mAh cell. With all the watch’s tracking features turned on, including sleep tracking, working out for a couple of hours every day, water reminders, and doing some breathing exercises every now and then, we got around six days of battery life.

You can also use the Low power mode to extend the battery life to over a week. Titan has included a proprietary charger in the box, which attaches to the watch through pogo pins. The watch takes around two hours to hit a full charge. On balance, I think the battery life here is pretty solid on the Titan Talk watch.

Verdict

Titan takes a straightforward approach with its Talk BT Calling smartwatch. You get all the basic tracking features and solid battery life to help you live an active lifestyle. Additionally, the sleep tracking and SpO2 monitoring its pretty useful, while the watch is well-designed and doesn’t make any compromises with its build. And let’s not forget the Bluetooth calling that can be quite reliable in a jam and the bright vibrant AMOLED display. However, there are quite a few caveats here, including the lack of built-in GPS, limited sports modes, and the lacklustre interface.

The companion app also has limited features, and the third-party app support was quite poor. So should you buy the Titan Talk smartwatch? If you are looking for a good-looking smartwatch to live an active lifestyle, then the Titan Talk BT calling watch is worth considering. However, if you are a fitness enthusiast, there are quite a few options at this price that will offer more features and better tracking.",1136,0.3317738175392151

To achieve a greater technological edge, watch maker Titan Co Limited’s eye care division is looking for partners for its eye care brand. The company plans to do so by either investing in entities that bring strong technical capabilities or acquiring them, a senior executive told Mint.

Saumen Bhaumik the chief executive of the eye-care division of Titan said the company is “open to"" any inorganic opportunities it may spot in the market.

Bhaumik emphasised on the company's desire for an investment with a technological orientation and said “Our exploration would be in the space which brings in a little bit of a tech orientation. As I said, this is an exploration. We’ll continue to explore whatever fits the scheme of things"".

Titan's eye care division operates the optical retail chain Titan Eye+, which sells prescription eyewear and lifestyle products under brands like Titan, Titan Glares and Fastrack.

Titan’s eye-care brand had an annual revenue of ₹517 crore in FY22. The chief executive also spoke at length about the division's expansion plans with a focus on expanding their reach in top 20 cities.

“We have expanded across 230-240 cities and towns; to that extent, we have deep penetration. We are going further, both deeper and wider, into the market. But the immediate focus will be on the top 20 cities because there are enough and more catchments that we have not yet covered,"" Bhaumik told Mint.

The company also plans to ramp up its local sourcing and is also attempting to build a vendor base in India while reducing its dependence on China.

“In 2019-second half, we realized that we are quite dependent on China. Before that, we made an investment in a frame factory. But business was by and large still going to China. Then, we had to change gear and we decided that we have to find an alternative to China. And even if it is not 100% made by us, there are other countries we would like to explore,"" Bhaumik said.

Talking about Titan's investment plans Bhaumik told Mint that the company plans to invest 20 crores in 2023.

“In FY23, another 20 crore is going in. Significant investment is happening but we are making sure the investment is balanced with capability building. There would be continued investment for another couple of years,"" Bhaumik said.",402,0.5054166913032532

Rebound in rural demand, easing inflationary pressures and recovery in margins bode well for consumer staple companies and could see them outperform discretionary stocks in H2FY23, foreign brokerage firm CLSA has said.

“We continue to see high base affecting growth for the discretionary names. On the other hand, staples stocks, on a low volume base in H2FY22 and with gradual easing in inflation, are placed well to report better earnings,” it said in a recent report.

In the December quarter last year, HUL, Colgate and Marico reported low single-digit volume growth, while discretionary companies like Varun Beverages, Asian Paints and Titan clocked a volume growth upwards of 20 percent.

As rural markets account for nearly 69 percent of India’s population, staple companies are now pinning hopes on volume recovery backed by a good harvest, higher minimum support prices (MSP) and an increase in fertiliser subsidy, which will leave consumers with more money to spend.

Around 58 percent of the total 751 rural respondents noted improvement in income over pre-Covid levels, said CLSA, citing its proprietary survey. Rural demand has rebounded in October and companies are hopeful of the momentum sustaining.

Discretionary companies, on the other hand, witnessed strong sales in October due to the festival season but the demand tapered off in November, the foreign brokerage firm said. “Discretionary companies are cautious on demand momentum,” it added.

CLSA’s preferred picks in consumer staples are Hindustan Unilever with a target price of Rs 2,950, Dabur with a target of Rs 625 and ITC Rs 375.

From August to November, ITC gained 10.6 percent, HUL 3.52 percent, Godrej Consumer was up 2.3 percent and Dabur gained 1.3 percent. Consumer discretionary stocks also gained in the same period. Varun Beverages was up 35 percent, Titan 11.7 percent and Pidilite gained 10 percent.

The notices were issued against the individuals (notices) after Sebi received a letter from TCL, wherein the company intimated the regulator about contravention of PIT (Prohibition of Insider Trading) rules and company's code of conduct by some of its designated employees.

The regulator conducted a probe in the scrip of Titan and observed several non-compliances of PIT norms during April 2018-March 2019.

While being employed with TCL, the noticees had transacted in the securities of Titan in different quarters ended on June 2018, September 2018 and March 2019, as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

According to TCL letter, these individuals had to make disclosures as their traded value exceeded Rs 10 lakh.

However, Sebi said, the noticees were ""not designated employees"" of the company and therefore, were not obligated to make disclosures under the PIT norms.

Therefore, the adjudication proceedings against noticees stands disposed of without imposition of any penalty, it said.

Meanwhile, in a separate order, the regulator slapped fines totalling Rs 99 lakh on 21 entities for manipulating the price/volume of the scrip of Sarang Chemicals Ltd.

The order came after Sebi had conducted an investigation in the scrip of the Sarang Chemicals Ltd (SCL) during the period January-June 2011.

“We all miss Rakesh. He was a constant source of support and encouragement for all these years,” he said. Titan was the top holding in RJ’s portfolio.

The jewellery and watchmaker on November 4 reported year-on-year growth of 33 percent in its standalone profit after tax at Rs 857 crore for the September quarter, higher than analysts' expectations of Rs 713 crore.

“We remain positive on the medium-term outlook,” said the top boss, adding that the first store in the United States will come up as soon as the permissions are worked out.

However, while demand is strong in higher price points, it continues to remain sluggish in the economy-oriented price points, said the management. Economy pricing is a strategy where products have lower prices due to low production costs.

“This is because different segments of the population have been hit by inflation differently,” the management said.

In the jewellery business, the company saw demand pressure in the sub-Rs 50,000 and sub-Rs 1 lakh categories. Similarly, in the watches and wearables business, which grew 21 percent YoY, demand in higher-priced products was stronger compared to the lower-priced ones.

In terms of wedding demand in the jewellery segment, Titan’s top brass said that early signs were not clear yet, but they are hopeful of a strong season.

The company managed to post an EBIT margin of 15.3 percent in the jewellery segment, however, the management said it is not sustainable and they would like to maintain their earlier 12-13 percent guidance and not revise it upwards.

Eyewear business

The segment registered only 4 percent jump, while other businesses saw double-digit growth. “In July, we saw good demand but there was sluggishness in August and September. In H2FY23, we will be investing a lot more in advertising to drive customer acquisition and store expansion,” said the management.

The eyewear business has the highest EBIT margin among all businesses. In Q2FY23, it posted an EBIT margin of 16.5 percent while jewellery division’s EBIT margin came in at 15.3 percent and watches & wearables at 14.8 percent.

Titan Company Ltd is expected to report year-on-year growth of 11 percent in its standalone profit after tax (PAT) when it declares its results for the September quarter on November 4.

The jewellery and watchmaker’s revenue is likely to grow 20 percent year on year.

The Tata group company is expected to report post-tax profit of Rs 713 crore on revenue of Rs 8,604 crore, according to an average of estimates by five brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. EBITDA margin has been pegged at 12.9 percent.

In its Q2 business update, Titan said it witnessed a healthy double-digit growth across most businesses. “Retail network continued the pace of expansion adding 105 stores (net) for the quarter. The outlook for festive season continues to be optimistic,” it said.

The jewellery division grew 18 percent YoY on a high base of Q2FY22 with elements of pent-up demand and spill-over purchases, the company added.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect EBIT margin of 12.6 percent for the jewellery business.

Watches and wearables’ division is seen clocking its highest quarterly revenue, growing 20 percent YoY.

Titan and Fastrack smartwatches with Bluetooth calling feature were also launched in the September quarter. Kotak expects 11.75 percent EBIT margin for watches.

In the update, the company also said that sales from Titan Eye+ stores clocked a healthy double-digit growth YoY. But this was offset by lower sales across trade and distribution channel, leading to an overall growth of 7 percent YoY.

Kotak Equities analysts expect a 16.5 percent EBIT margin for the eyewear division.

In the June quarter, Titan reported a 13-time jump in standalone profit due to a low base in Q1FY22, impacted by the second COVID wave.

In the September quarter, the base remains favourable with analysts expecting strong festival and wedding season to drive growth.

India’s expected surge of rich consumers is driving the jewelry unit of Tata Group to triple its Zoya-branded stores by 2027.

“There is a lot of latent demand for luxury from India and high net-worth individuals are going to explode,” Ajoy Chawla, the chief executive officer of Titan Co., India’s biggest jeweler, said in an interview. “This is just the beginning for luxury.”

Titan gets about 90% of its revenue from the sale of jewelry and the rest from watches, eyewear and perfumes. It has four jewelry brands under its umbrella: flagship Tanishq, working women-focused Mia, online sales portal Caratlane, and Zoya, which is aimed at rich customers.

Expanding the number of Zoya stores to 15 in the next five years would cost about 300 million rupees ($3.64 million) per boutique, Chawla said. Revenues at the brand have climbed as much as five times from pre-pandemic sales figures, and the company expects this “aggressive pace” of growth to continue, he said.

India is already the world’s second-biggest market for gold used in jewelry, and demand is unlikely to waver with a report by Knight Frank showing the number of ultra-high net worth people with assets of $30 million or more growing 11% in 2021 from a year earlier. That figure is expected to jump by about 39% in 2026, while individuals with wealth of at least $1 million is forecast to surge by about 77% during the five-year period, it said.

Titan is also aiming to ramp up overseas expansion in Zoya in a bid to build a global luxury brand.

“We have forayed overseas with Tanishq in the Middle East and US recently and we will use that experience to plan a global move for Zoya,” Chawla said. “Ultimately, the plan is to create a global brand with an Indian soul.”

Chawla said he was optimistic of the potential of the Zoya brand to outperform the growth expected in Tanishq. Zoya has managed to lure in rich customers by curating experiences like romantic dinners at its sister company Indian Hotels Co.’s Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces and providing bespoke jewelry by working with the design team and artisans.",414,0.9999745190143585

""Our focus is rather more on sales growth ... gaining more competitive advantage in each of the businesses....and worrying less about the profitability suddenly in FY23"", he said in an interview with CNBCTV18.

Venkataraman also talked about the strong growth numbers posted by the jewellery and watchmaker firm and said that the number of orders placed by jewellers in the September quarter has shown strong upbeat momentum.

Last week, shares of Titan rose after the company reported strong growth in sales for the September quarter. “The Company witnessed healthy double-digit growth across most businesses with overall sales growing 18% year-on-year,"" Titan said in a regulatory filing.

Further, Venkataraman mentioned that launching Titan's jewellery retailer CaratLane was a 'fabulous decision' that the firm took in 2015 as the company's market share in the jewellery business has increased from 4-5 percent to nearly 6-7 percent in recent months.

The MD expects the company's market share in the jewellery business to go up to nearly 10 percent in the timeframe of two to three years.

He believes that jewellery by Titan's Tanishq brand is purchased mainly on customer loyalty and exceptional in-store customer experience.

The stock prices of many of the companies in which Rakesh Jhunjhuwala held large stakes saw some selling in the early trade on August 16 when markets opened after his death over the the weekend.

Aptech, in which he held 23 percent, plunged nearly 5 percent, while Star Health was down over 1 percent, and Metro Brands fell 0.5 percent. Crisil was also down marginally.

Though some stocks traded with gains as well. Nazara Tech was up 3 percent, Titan added about a percent, Fortis Healthcare was up about a percent as well. NCC also rose more than a percent.

Jhunjhunwala passed away on August 14 at the age of 62 in Mumbai following a cardiac arrest. He was battling with health problems related to heart, kidney and diabetes for many years now.

Some of these stocks have been the biggest money minting machines for Jhunjhunwala. His stake in Titan alone is worth Rs 11,000 crore, followed by Star Health and Metro Brands that cumulatively amount to more than Rs 10,000 crore.

Overall, his stake in 32 stocks is worth around Rs 32,000 crore.

“His investment style changed between 1990 and 2020, but his breakout year was 2003 when he picked Titan, Crisil and Lupin that turned into 100 baggers,” said Ramesh Damani, another ace investor and a friend of Jhunjhunwala.

In the unlisted market, barring newly launched Akasa Air in which the Jhunjhuwala family via trusts holds 45 percent stake, there are not many stocks which the legendary investor held. Most of his unlisted portfolio – including Star Health, Metro Brands and Nazara Technologies – got listed in the last couple of years.

He had admitted in the past that his unlisted portfolio made more money for him than his listed stocks. ""I am happy to inform you that my return on the unlisted portfolio is greater than the return on my listed portfolio. There also I have long investments of 10-12 years,"" he had said in March 2021.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s most talked-about bet, on Titan at Rs 40 in 2003, was made by chance, according to Ramesh Damani.

It wasn’t placed based on extensive research or any tip-off, as is largely believed, he said in an interview given to N Mahalakshmi about Jhunjhunwala, the investor and the person.

Titan’s stock has since grown nearly 62x to Rs 2,470.

Many a time, Jhunjhunwala’s approach was to invest, then investigate, then when he was convinced, add to the position, said Damani, adding that adding to a position at higher prices is an extraordinarily hard thing to do.

Damani, the celebrated value investor was a long-time friend of Jhunjhunwala, and has known the Big Bull since his early days in the stock market. They remained friends for over three decades.

“In 2003, his broker called him and said that he had some 10 lakh shares of Titan that someone wanted to sell. ‘If you buy 10 lakh of them, the price is 40. If you buy 30 lakh, the price will be 38, and if you buy 50 lakhs, the price will be 36’. He understood that at Rs 40, the market cap would come to around Rs 300 crore, with its great brand name, it was probably worth a lot more,” recalled Damani.

He decided to take a dab at it and bought the smallest lot, and then he started following the company.

“Over the next few years, he kept adding to his position and bought almost 5% of the company,” said Damani.

“There is this folklore that he bought Titan after studying it or after accessing some insider information, but that’s probably untrue. He bought it because his broker had a lot and he came to Rakesh before going to anyone else,” he added.

“Sometimes, truth is stranger than fiction,” he said.

While Titan might have come as a stroke of luck, to make the call when an opportunity is presented to you is far from easier. It is harder still to keep adding money to increase the position at higher prices.

“It is extraordinarily hard. I do that (adding position at higher prices) sometimes and generally get mud on my face. It is so hard because right at the moment we have the highest level of conviction, the stock tends to peak out and go down,” said Damani.

Obsession about trading, extra-ordinary focus, ability to take large-sized bets, and take losses in his stride differentiated Jhunjhunwala from other investors. “That (taking supersized bets) is still a work in progress for me. I had a number of those (super multi-baggers) in my portfolio but I am too caught up in middle-class (mindset) to be able to take those calls and risk the loss,” Damani said.

Jhunjhunwala wasn’t immune to the ego-bruising that comes after taking a wrong bet. But, he could take it quickly in his stride. “His attitude is best defined by the Bollywood song Main har fikar ko dhuen mein udata chala gaya,” said his friend.Also read: RJ: The king is dead, long live the king

He shared a story about Jhunjhunwala’s unwavering, 24x7 focus on trading. Once when Jhunjhunwala and the entire group of friends were in Macau, they went gambling till 2.30 in the morning. The, despite the time difference, Rakesh caught up on sleep for two hours and was up to get back to markets as Tata Motors was announcing its results that day. “Whether he was in the hospital, wheel-chair or investigation room, he was hooked to the market,” said Damani.

He got high on the adrenalin. While it resulted in his oversized success, it led him to neglect his health. “As friends, we all feel bad about his missing out on the fall of life, when you look forward to your children getting married, to retirement and spending time with your grandchildren… what greater joy is there than that,” Damani said in a poignant mood.",689,-0.08407105008761089

RJ is dead. Long live RJ.

I met Rakesh Jhunjhunwala for the first time exactly two days short of 21 years ago, on August 17, 2001.

It was a Friday. I remember that date for a reason I’ll tell you in a bit. I was a cub reporter at Business Standard, writing for their investment supplement called The Smart Investor. Markets were reeling under the aftermath of the dotcom crash. Earnings yield in India were significantly higher than the bond yield at the time. I was working on developing this idea into a story, and called on Jhunjhunwala’s landline. He was not someone easily approachable for the media in those days. He answered and said, “Yes, Ma’am”, in his inimitable style. I explained my story idea and he replied, “Come to my office.” I asked when. He said, now. I rushed to the first floor of Vittaldas Chamber.

It was a bare room, partitioned into two halves by a PVC panel. As I walked in, I passed a couple of desks with men staring into their desktops and looking mildly tense. I reached Jhunjhunwala’s cubicle and waited by the flimsy partition for a few minutes. The Big Bull was on the phone, chewing paan and talking at the same time. He did not acknowledge my presence. I waited at the corner quietly. After a few minutes, he gestured to me to sit, I did and the phone conversation continued for another 10-15 minutes. After hanging up, he first shot me a barrage of questions–what’s your name, where did you grow up, which school did you go to, and finally, “tell me, what do you want?” I explained again. All this while he is looking at his screen and screaming instructions to his boys at the trading terminals, and not looking my way.

Then he took a printout and handed it to me. He said, read it. I said, I will. He insisted I read it right then. I took a few minutes to run through the piece. It was an article Warren Buffett had written for Fortune magazine on the effect of interest rates on equity prices. It was an email sent by his friend Kalpraj Dharamsi the previous evening (that’s why I will never forget the date). He was hooked to his screen, even when he handed this out to me.

It’s a priceless piece, and the most fundamental lesson in investing. At that time, I probably did not appreciate the profoundness in that piece of writing. When I interviewed Warren Buffett for the first time in 2014, guess what my first question was. It was his thoughts on equity valuations in the context of the abysmally low interest rates. Buffett’s answer was equity valuations would seem incredibly cheap if the rates were to sustain at such low levels but that is not what he thought could be the case. That year Buffett was sitting on $100 billion of cash. It’s another matter that rates have remained fairly low for a long, long time, and equities have surged especially post-pandemic primarily driven by low rates. Even today, the debate around equity valuations hinges on where the interest rate will be in the short-, medium- and long-term.

Master of rhetoric

Post that initial meeting with Jhunjhunwala, I had become a mini celebrity in my small circle of friends and reporters. I met “Bhaiya” several times in his office and every single time, I would return with mixed feelings. For one, he would always be glued to the screen and make no eye contact while speaking, which made me feel distinctly uncomfortable. Second, his style of answering was asking rhetorical questions and then waiting for your answer, even if that took long in coming. Third, he could silence you by raising his voice to a high pitch if there was a counter question. The first few times, I was too scared to talk. But, with time, I figured that he was open to counter-questions, he was open for debate, he was vociferous with his arguments but that did not mean that he would not listen to the other side. It was up to one to muster the courage to voice one’s views. You had to be prepared. His rhetorical statements helped me learn, because I went back to dig deeper and find the answers.

Every time I asked him to talk about stocks and sectors he fancied, he would say, I work for one client – Rekha Jhunjhunwala. He always talked about the big picture, rarely the specifics. He was astute in investing, yes, but seldom does one appreciate the extent of risk he took in making those bets. Leaving aside the couple of times his trading bets could have taken him down, even his storied investment in Titan was made when the company was in considerable debt. What set him apart was his ability to take those bold calls, or take those leaps of faith, and back his conviction. That audacity worked in his favour.

Also read: Which is the one formula the Big Bull held sacred?

He called risk the four-letter word in investing! Investing is risk taking, if anything, RJ maintained. “All risk taking is associated with two human emotions, that is fear and greed – greed of profits and fear of losses. The ability to strike the right balance between fear and greed is the most vital determinant of profitable risk taking,” he said in one of the interviews I had done. Then he went on to cite a memorable quote, “In markets, it sometimes feels like being undersexed in a harem and over-sexed in a desert”, and to elaborate on it: “Good investors should feel under-sexed when there is depression and over-sexed when there is irrational exuberance.”

Then again, for every risk he took, he was keenly aware of the worst-case scenarios. “I look at the gap between the entry price and the price in a scenario in which most of the positive assumptions don’t pan out as expected. The ingredients of successful investing lie in locating gaps between current expectations and future likely performance which provide me favourable odds as an investor.” He wasn’t infallible, but he was aware of the things that could go wrong and was willing to take those hits.

Art, more than science

A CA by qualification, RJ understood investing was not just about getting the math right. It was actually a lot more of an art. “The prediction of EPS is mainly science and partly art. But prediction of PER is an art, with very little science. It is a chemistry that can be mastered only by experience. Like cooking and sex, it cannot be taught, but it has to be learnt. I learnt that understanding/predicting PEs is the most difficult of all and the most critical factor to successful investing,” he told me in that interview. Several of his long-term bets right from Karur Vysya Bank to Titan and Crisil multiplied not just because of their earnings growth but also because of a remarkable growth in earnings-multiple that contributed to the rapid compounding over time.

RJ also believed the single biggest error in the investment business is failure to distinguish between knowledge of a company’s fundamentals and the expectations implied by the stock price. “I have learnt that in investing decisions all factors are numerators but the denominator is only one which is price/value, for it is ultimately the price or value at which you buy/sell shares which determines not only your profit/gains but also the very important aspect of the risk that you take. At a value, I am a buyer of everything, including the most hated companies. It is important ‘what you are buying, but it is more important at what value/price you are buying’,” he said.. It’s unsurprising that, in his last interview, he said that his favourite bets in the market are public sector banks, public sector banks, public sector banks.

As a person, he lived life king size but had a child-like appreciation for the smaller victories. I recall another anecdote from 2005. It was one of my team-mates' birthday at The Smart Investor, and the entire team landed up at Geoffrey's. It was RJ’s favourite watering hole for a long time. He was there almost every evening. And Geoffrey’s had set the channel default to CNBC to indulge him. There were five of us, and I heard someone call out my name loudly. It was RJ. He walked up to our table, and asked, “Ma’am, can I join you for a drink.” I said, “of course.” My team was ecstatic, we are boozing with the Amitabh Bachchan of stock markets. (Rakesh would detest my saying so – he detested people calling or comparing him to anyone else)

RJ was his eloquent best – free flowing conversation, varied profanilities, his wacky quotes on death, taxes and sex, and how people think his father lives with him, but as he likes to say, he lives with his father, that you are nothing with your parents…. And every now and then, he would loudly call the server and ask him to bring those free cheeslings. “Pehle jo free ka maal hai woh lao!” “You should always demand what is due to you,” he said.

It was more than three hours of high entertainment and emotion. For several days after that we kept talking about him in the office. And yes, he picked the tab much against my protest.

Biggest lesson

Rakesh had a mercurial temperament, but he was warm. He was brash, but respectful. He was candid but unpretentious. He could silence people with his loud voice and assertions, but he had an ear for reason. He was super helpful. Gregarious. Magnanimous. Courageous. He was his own man. And, he didn’t like to be compared to anyone. Least of all to be called the Warren Buffett of India. He detested the moniker. “Learn from everyone. But do your own thing. Be yourself.”

That’s probably the biggest lesson one can draw from his life: do it your way, and be yourself.

Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has made his name a badge of honour. Maybe it is time for others to wear with pride a moniker fashioned after it. The adulation for RJ is not only because of his long-running, extraordinary trackrecord in investing but also because he did this without compromising his dignity. Otherwise, in stock markets, high fliers have often turned out to be dubious or at least to have tarnished their reputation at one point or the other. RJ made earning through investing respectable and, at a time when equities have taken off, he has become a role model to many Indians. His passionate pitch that “I am bullish on India” transfixes all who listen to him, mainly because that is something all of us like to believe -- our own great future. His conviction in the future of India never wavered. That’s why while his death leaves a big void in the stock market, his spirit will be alive forever.

Titan Company on August 5 reported a year on year growth of 1,200 percent or 13 times in its standalone profit after tax at Rs 793 crore in the June quarter. On a sequential basis, the profit increased 61.5 percent.

Standalone revenue for the Tata group company rose 176 percent to Rs 8,961 crore. On a sequential basis, revenue rose 23 percent.

“The financial year has begun well for us and we delivered a strong performance across our business segments,” said managing director CK Venkataraman. “Despite a challenging macro environment, the outlook for the remaining quarters looks positive and we continue to execute our investment plans in India as well as chosen international geographies.”

The revenues and profit surge comes on a low base of last year which was impacted by the COVID second wave. All three verticals of jewellery, watches and eyewear reported robust year on year as well as sequential growth aided by pent-up demand and strong footfall.

The mainstay jewellery business delivered a robust performance during the quarter registering a year on year revenue growth of 208 percent at Rs 7,600 crore (excluding bullion).

Growth in revenues was aided by good Akshaya Tritiya sales and a better studded mix.

EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) for the jewellery business surged 396 percent to Rs 1,027 crore year on year.

Watches and wearables business witnessed its best quarter ever in terms of sales. The income for the business jumped 169 percent year on year to Rs 785 crore. The business generated a positive EBIT of Rs 103 crore for the quarter against a loss of Rs 56 crore a year ago.

Income for the eyecare business increased 173 percent year on year to Rs 183 crore while EBIT stood at Rs 36 crore against a loss of Rs 13 crore a year ago.

Other businesses of Indian dresswear and fragrance & fashion accessories also had a strong quarter as income during the quarter jumped 300 percent year on year to Rs 56 crore. The business, however, is yet to turn positive at the EBIT level and generated a loss of Rs 10 crore compared to a loss of Rs 16 crore a year ago.

Titan Company Ltd is expected to report a sequential growth of 31 percent in its standalone profit after tax (PAT) for the first quarter when it declares its results on Friday, August 5. Revenue for the quarter is predicted to grow 12 percent quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q).

On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, growth in both PAT and revenue is likely to be more pronounced due to the COVID-impacted low base of last year. PAT is seen surging by 1,065 percent on year on a revenue growth of 150 percent y-o-y.

The Tata group company is likely to report a standalone PAT of Rs 711 crore on a standalone revenue of Rs 8,112 crore, according to an average of estimates by four brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.

The y-o-y growth is likely to be driven by robust growth across its three main business segments of jewellery, watches and eyewear, with experts expecting all three to more than double revenues from last year. Also, the Omicron wave in the fourth quarter of last financial year had the effect of demand being deferred to Q1FY23.

The company had recorded a standalone PAT of Rs 61 crore during the same period last year when it had earned standalone revenue of Rs 3,249 crore. The quarter was impacted by the second wave of COVID.

During the quarter ended March, the company registered a standalone PAT of Rs 542 crore (excluding exceptional items of Rs 51 crore) on a revenue of Rs 7,276 crore.

The company added about 120 stores across its business segments and formats.

“Expected Segmental revenue growth: Jewelry 207 percent, Watches & Wearables 158 percent, Eyewear 176 percent, and Other Businesses 455 percent,” said a report from Centrum Institutional Research.

The brokerage is of the opinion that the deferred weddings from Q4FY22 translated into a threefold revenue growth in plain gold jewellery in the first quarter of this fiscal. “We believe underlying demand continued to be strong across all business segments,” it added.

Kotak Institutional Equities models a 150 percent y-o-y revenue growth in the jewellery segment on LFL (like for like) basis (excluding sale of gold ingots/bullion) off a weak base. It expects 130 percent y-o-y growth in watches (-2 percent three-year CAGR or compound annual growth rate) and 150 percent y-o-y growth in eyewear (4 percent three-year CAGR).

Enrolments to its jewellery brand Tanishq’s Golden Harvest scheme were encouraging, while the watches business saw smart recovery across formats, especially large stores, which saw good traffic.

Eyewear and e-com sales are seen gathering traction, supported by new launches in the lenses and frames segment.

“Caratlane (72.3 percent subsidiary) continued its growth trajectory, coupled with heightened consumer demand, backed by omni-channel initiatives reporting 207 percent growth y-o-y,” the Centrum report said.

Given the strong recovery in sales, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins are likely to witness handsome gains.

“We expect 795 bps (basis points) y-o-y expansion in EBITDA margin to 12.4 percent,” said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities. “On segmental front, we expect EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) margin of 12.5 percent for jewellery business, 10.5 percent EBIT margin for watches, and 15 percent for eyewear.”

The company closed Rs 7.25 higher at Rs 2,423.65 on August 4 on the National Stock Exchange. The stock has generated returns of 34 percent during the past one year and has gained 23.5 percent over the past one month.

We have great expansion plans going forward.

The company has 25 stores across Delhi, Noida, Hyderabad, Bengaluru , Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Jamshedpur, Vadodara, Lucknow and Kolkata. ”We are in process to increase the number to 50-60 stores by this year and over the next 3-4 years it will be further ramped up to 125 Taneira retail stores chain that will cover the majority of tier-I and tier-II cities. Now, we will focus more on franchisee stores. Currently, half of the retail stores are company-owned,” Narayan said.

He said in future the company is planning to open overseas stores in markets having Indian diaspora like the US.

Titan Company – a multibagger of yesteryears and top holding of ace investor Rakesh Jhujhunwala – is in a rut. The stock fell about 9 percent last week, extending its losses to 30 percent from its 52-week high levels.

The jewelry and watchmaker has been a casualty of the market-wide selloff and a belief that people will curb discretionary spending as inflation continues to shoot higher making even basic commodities out of reach for many Indians.

On Friday, the stock fell over 6 percent to hit Rs 1,935 level. Though it is still a 14 percent drop away from the 52-week low levels. Its 52-week high level was at Rs 2,767.55 that it hot in March.

So, does it mean one should start accumulating the shares at this level? The answer from technical analysts is largely no, as they believe there is still some downside left in the stock.

Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said the correction in the recent months has led the stock to fall below the 200 DMA for the first time since August 2020. On the daily chart, it has been correcting with the ‘lower top lower bottom’ formation, indicating a prevailing bearishness.

Earlier in June, the stock has formed a Death Cross – a phenomenon when a 50-day moving average (DMA) line falls below 200-DMA on daily charts - which is a strong bearish signal. Such a movement in trendlines indicates a medium-term weakness in the stock trend.

“Coming back to the price action, the price, after consolidation has extended its fall towards lower level. Moreover, lower top in the daily RSI indicates a rising bearish momentum. Henceforth, the stock may remain in the bears' grip as long as it remains below the recent low of Rs 2,050. On the lower end, the price may drift down towards Rs 1,750/1,510 over the short to medium term,” De said.

“Looking at the current setup, one can apply the ""sell on rise"" strategy in the stock. The stock may attract selling pressure once it reaches to the Rs 2,050-2,100 level. However, a close above Rs 2,260 may induce short covering in the stock,” he said.

Shares of Titan are also affected by how gold prices move and wedding season. Gold prices have come down by 8-10 percent from March levels and are currently trading near Rs 50,000 level, despite it being a hedge against inflation. It means inflation is generally supportive of gold prices. The drop in prices is due to marriage season being almost over.

Tirthankar Das, Head of Technical Research, Ashika Group, also agrees that the main trend is downwards according to the daily swing chart. The downtrend was reaffirmed once sellers took out the psychological level of Rs 2,000.

“Prices now trading below the 200-DMA and the 38.2 percent retracement of the entire rally since March 2020, signalling further downsides. The slower pace of retracement also suggests inherent weakness and the presence of bearish ‘Head & Shoulder’ formation implies negative bias,” Das said. “Immediate support for the stock appears from 100-week EMA at Rs 1900-1915. Hence outlook continues to remain neutral to negative with a lower target of 1740-1750.”

Fundamental analysts though have a slightly different view. Most analysts have maintained their bullish outlook on the stock and believe the fall may be just a short-term blip.

Abhay Agarwal, Founder, and Fund Manager, Piper Serica – a PMS provider – said, while some of this correction can be explained as part of the overall market correction, the stock is also under pressure due to its premium valuation.

“Titan has always traded at a significant premium to the rest of the market due to its industry leadership. However, in the current market scenario, all premium valuations are under big threat. A slowdown in consumption due to high inflation and interest rates will reduce the growth of the company,” he said.

“High FPI ownership and persistent rumours of stake sale by a large shareholder have also created investor nervousness. We stay positive on the prospects of the company and advise investors to use further dips to add it to their portfolio in a systematic manner.”",693,-0.6924267283507756

Tata group company Titan on April 6 said it has finished the March 2022 quarter 'on a satisfactory note' despite the Omicron wave impact and global uncertainties. It said demand across all of its businesses continued to be strong with most segments posting year-on-year (YoY) growth.

The company, which is ace investor Rakesh Jhujhunwala’s largest stock holding, said its network expansion and campaigns have continued to progress well in anticipation of an upbeat Q1 FY23 which is expected to be normal after a gap of two years of lockdowns in the same period.

The company's jewellery division saw a four percent YoY de-growth. In a BSE filing, the company apprised that sales from the top 8 cities grew in single digits while the rest of India saw a small decline. Walk-ins saw a minor decline but the customer conversions and ticket sizes grew marginally for the quarter compared to the same period last year.

""Though the plain jewellery category bore the brunt of gold volatility in Mar'22 leading to a slight decline for the quarter, studded sales clocked in a high single-digit growth, thereby partially cushioning the impact"", read the statement.

During the quarter, Titan also acquired a minority stake in Great Heights Inc. (through its wholly-owned subsidiary TCL North America Inc.) to deepen its understanding of the ""Lab-grown Diamonds"" space.

The firm's 'watches and wearables' division saw a good momentum with a 12 percent YoY growth. The company reported sales increasing across all offline channels, while sales from Retail and Large Format Stores (LFS) clocked higher growth as well.

West and north regions saw much higher growth amongst geographies, while the segment also had new launches in the quarter.

The eyecare segment witnessed a five percent rise, led by frames and sunglasses. “Network expansion continued in line with ambitious growth plans for the next year. Product innovation continues to be the core focus area and the centerpiece of Titan Eyeplus offerings.""

As regards Titan’s revenue from ‘other businesses’, which jumped 23 percent in the March 2022 quarter, it said the increase in sales from departmental stores and e-commerce led to a healthy 21 percent YoY growth in fragrances and 67 percent YoY growth in fashion accessories businesses, respectively.

The company’s automation solutions business saw large dispatches in the quarter triggered due to postponement of deliveries on the back of supply chain disruptions earlier. The inquiries have shown gradual improvement but are still below normalised levels. The aerospace business achieved moderate growth with a good recovery in orders.",460,0.6397004290060564

However, Titan is also making a splash in the smartwatch space, one of India’s fastest-growing markets. The latest offering from the company is the Titan Smart Pro.

While the Titan Smart Pro was initially launched at Rs 14,995 in India, it can now be purchased for Rs 11,995. The smartwatch comes with an AMOLED display, GPS tracking, SpO2 tracking, and lasting battery life. But with the smartwatch market rifled with competition is the Titan Smart Pro worth its price tag; let’s find out.

Design and Build

The Titan Smart Pro boasts a circular dial encased in an aluminium body. But despite the aluminium construction, the watch is relatively light and feels comfortable on the hand. Additionally, the 42.75mm case makes the watch suitable for all wrist sizes, although it is on the smaller size. The watch does have two buttons on the side, while the bezels are quite large.

The Titan Smart Pro comes with the standard 22mm removable silicone strap in multiple different colours, although the strap can be traded out for a custom one. The watch also comes with a 5ATM water resistance, so you can use it while swimming. The overall design and build of Titan’s smartwatch are pretty good, but it is more suitable for those who prefer using smaller watches.

Display

The Titan Smart Pro comes with a 1.19-inch AMOLED touch display with a resolution of 390 x 390 pixels. The touch response on the display is pretty good, we didn’t experience any lag while navigating through the watch’s features. The screen has 2.5D curved glass and Gorilla Glass 3 on the front to protect the screen. It also comes with over 100 watch faces to suit your style.

The AMOLED display is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the Titan Smart Pro and is easily visible under direct sunlight. You can adjust the brightness on the watch manually, while you can set the watch to life-to-wake or use the Always-on display option to keep the screen throughout.

Features

When it comes to features, the Titan Smart Pro wasn’t found lacking. The watch offers SpO2 monitoring, heart rate monitoring, in-built GPS, a compass, and a Barometric altimeter. SpO2 and heart rate monitoring worked well, although this isn’t a medical device and shouldn’t be relied on in case of an emergency. The built-in GPS was also accurate when tested alongside the GPS on the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic (Review).

The Titan Smart Pro can track your temperature and also offers Period tracking. While temperature monitoring is accurate at times, we weren’t able to test the Period tracking feature. The Barometer can be utilised while hiking to figure out the exact height, although we weren’t able to test its accuracy. There are 14 sports modes in total on the watch, including hiking, indoor and outdoor cycling, rowing machine, trail running, workout, and more.

The watch also has sleep tracking and stress monitoring features. Sleep tracking was pretty accurate, but the watch also tracks deep and light sleep individually. The Titan Smart Pro has a stress monitoring feature that measures stress over time and gives you an average score. Stress monitoring is a good feature to have but by no means can be considered accurate and it is always best to get professional help.

The Titan Smart Pro also allows you to set breathing and hand wash reminders. You can check the weather and control the camera on your smartphone directly from the watch. The watch also has playback controls for music. You can also set daily fitness goals and check your activity history on the watch. The Titan Smart Pro has a ton of essential smartwatch features, although the one major disappointment was the lack of calling support. You do get call notifications on the watch and can reject or silence them directly from the Smart Pro.

Battery

The Titan Smart Pro is touted to deliver up to 14 days of battery life on a single charge. In our experience, we got closer to 10 days of battery life with average usage, which is excellent in itself. However, turning on the Always-on display and increasing the brightness to the max will kill the battery much faster. You do get a magnetic charger in the box, which can be hooked up to a laptop or watch to charge it.

Software

The watch also comes with the Titan Smart Pro companion app. The app can be used to do everything from tracking your fitness activity to monitoring your heart rate and oxygen saturation levels. The watch can be paired to the app through Bluetooth. You can also check temperature, sleep monitoring, and stress monitoring through the app. The app's Settings page gives you access to the other features on the watch including notifications, daily goals, hand washing reminders, and more.

Controls

The Titan Smart Pro has two buttons to the side. The top button can be used to access the features of the watch, while the bottom button lets you select one of the 14 activities. A top swipe on the watch brings up the quick settings menu, while a bottom swipe shows you notifications. You can also swap left or right to access some of the watch features, like music playback.

Verdict

The Titan Smart Pro is an excellent fitness watch with a ton of features to compete with smartwatches from Xiaomi, Realme, OnePlus, Amazfit, and several others. The Smart Pro has unique features like temperature monitoring, a barometer, and period tracking. Additionally, the watch also comes with accurate GPS tracking, a bright AMOLED display, a solid design, and superb battery life. However, you cannot answer calls on the watch due to the lack of a speaker and microphone and the sports modes are rather limited.

I would’ve also preferred a larger dial size, although that’s a personal preference. Additionally, a stainless-steel case would have given it a more premium vibe, although it is a rarity at this price. The Titan Smart Pro shines in a lot of areas and while it does lack a few key functions, there are a host of features that make up for it. Titan Smart Pro is a good smartwatch from a veteran Indian brand that could be better, but it still earns a recommendation owing to the myriad of features it possesses.",1067,0.773702897131443

Digital marketing solutions provider Brightcom Group on Wednesday said its board of directors had approved a resolution to issue bonus shares in the ratio of two for every three existing shares of Rs 2 each.

This is the second bonus issue by the Hyderabad-based company in eight months. Brightcom rewarded its shareholders in July last year with one bonus share for every four existing ones.

“The move will not only improve liquidity but also unlock value,” the company said in a statement on the latest bonus issue.

Stock markets were shut on Wednesday on account of Republic Day. Brightcom shares hit a lower circuit of Rs 160 on Tuesday and closed at Rs 163.75, a fall of 2.76% from the previous close.

The ad-tech company’s board, which met on Tuesday, also allotted 132 million shares to seven non-promoter entities on a preferential basis at a price of Rs 37.77 each to raise Rs 498.56 crore to be deployed for financing organic and inorganic growth plans.

On December 7, Brightcom Group had announced the acquisition of digital consulting and operations provider MediaMint for Rs 566 crore in a cash and stock deal, considered one of the largest purchases in the space.

In July last year, the company resolved to offer a 12.5% stake to foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and others, valuing the $350 million company by revenue at around Rs 3,000 crore.

Brightcom Group chairman and managing director M Suresh Kumar Reddy informed stock exchanges that the latest allotment of shares on a preferential basis expands the company’s share capital to Rs 236.33 crore divided into 1181.6 billion equity shares of Rs 2 each, fully paid-up.

For the quarter ended December 2021, the company reported year-on-year growth of 168% in post-tax profit at Rs 371 crore and an increase of 130% in consolidated revenue at Rs 2,021 crore.

“The overall performance was impressive owing to increased consumer usage of digital media and digital channels to conduct commerce across the world, post the pandemic,” the company said in a statement.

Ltd and Kalyan Jewellers India Ltd’s stocks have put up a good show on the bourses in the past one month, rising by around 25 percent and 18 percent, respectively.

The September quarter (Q2FY22) updates of both firms are encouraging. Titan's mainstay jewellery business saw a 78 percent year-on-year revenue growth, excluding bullion sales. Kalyan’s revenue growth was comparatively lower at about 60 percent year-on-year, although that is nothing to sneeze at.

ICICI Securities Ltd analysts said in a report on October 9, “Kalyan’s performance, though optically lagged Titan, needs to be seen in the context of (1) a different base: last year non-south was more impacted (better recovery on a year-on-year basis); in 2QFY22 Kerala was more impacted and (2) lower store expansion benefit.” The broker explained, “We believe Kalyan has a lower benefit of store addition in revenue growth versus Titan. Even as both Titan and Kalyan have seen same % growth in store-count in the last 12 months, Kalyan didn’t expand (store count) much during FY19-21.”

According to Kalyan, the non-south markets saw higher same-store sales growth (SSSG) of around 70 percent in Q2 vis-à-vis south markets, which recorded around 40 percent growth. SSSG is a measure of comparable sales growth. “This differential was predominantly due to the temporary closure of showrooms in Kerala during the recent quarter,” Kalyan said in its update. The company’s overall India SSSG in Q2 stood at about 50 percent.

Meanwhile, Titan’s other businesses, watches and eyewear, have also seen good recovery. However, these account for a smaller portion of the company’s overall revenues and, thus, do not move the needle significantly as far as the company’s valuations are concerned. When the September quarter results are announced, it goes without saying that investors will keep a close eye on how margins behave. Even so, strong revenue growth would boost profitability to that extent.

Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd has increased its FY22/FY23 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 7.9 percent and 3.9 percent to Rs21.70 and Rs31.58 on the back of Titan’s broad-based growth in Q2. “Long-term structural story remains intact on account of market share gains, strong balance sheet, franchisee-based model and omni channel across product segments,” the brokerage said in an October 6 report.

To be sure, the sharp appreciation in Titan’s share price suggests investors may be factoring in a good chunk of the optimism on the improved demand environment. After all, the Titan stock has substantially outperformed the broader markets in the last one year. The key thing to watch ahead is the momentum in demand recovery. In the near term, festival season demand would augur well for jewellery companies.",443,0.934835169996534

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban of Shark Tank fame was hit after the cryptocurrency token Iron Titanium crashed to zero dollars following a panic selloff from a high of over $64 within hours.

""I got hit like everyone else. Crazy part is I got out, thought they were increasing their TVL enough. Than Bam,"" Cuban tweeted.

Cuban had revealed his investment in Iron Titanium coins earlier this week in his blog post, displaying his enthusiasm for it and for QuickSwap. ""I provide 2 different tokens (DAI/TITAN) that enable QuikSwap to offer swaps between these two tokens,"" he said.

However, TITAN crashed after large investors started dumping their holdings, which was followed by panic-selling among small investors, too, leading to an excess of coins that hammered its price. By 726 pm ET, the tokens were worth just a cent, Fortune reported.

While Cuban didn't reveal the value of his investment, he told Bloomberg that as a percentage of his cryptocurrency portfolio, his investment was small.

""But in a larger context, it is no different than the risks I take (in) angel investing. In any new industry, there are risks I take on with the goal of not just trying to make money but also to learn. Even though I got rugged on this, it's really on me for being lazy,"" he told the publication.

He further added that DeFi (decentralized finance) was about ""revenue and math"" and he was ""too lazy to do the math to determine what the key metrics were"".

Cuban had earlier said he had invested in over 10 blockchain startups and was bullish on the future of cryptocurrencies. His crypto portfolio comprises 60 percent Bitcoin, 30 percent Ethereum, with other coins accounting for the rest.

The race to create ultra-thin watches, it seems, is a never-ending one. Every decade has had its champions. The current leader is the Piaget Altiplano Ultimate Concept, which measures just 2 mm and is the world’s thinnest mechanical watch.

Last week, Titan Company, the world’s fourth-largest watchmaker, announced its ambitions to be counted among the very best with the launch of the Titan Edge Mechanical. This limited-edition collection of 200 watches is powered by the Edge Calibre 903 that measures just 2.2 mm and has a power reserve of 42 hours. Designed by former Titan design chief Michael Foley, the watch, which costs Rs 1.95 lakh, is available in both stainless steel (6 mm) and rose gold (5.85 mm).

In an interview to Moneycontrol, Suparna Mitra, the CEO of the watches and wearables division at Titan, takes us through the genesis of the movement, Titan’s ongoing “premiumisation” journey, and the direction the company is headed in. Edited excerpts:

When did the work on the Edge Mechanical begin?

In a way, the project started over five years ago. That’s when we thought that we should extend the Edge proposition of ‘slimness’ to mechanical movements. Back in 1987, we came in and conquered the Indian watch market with quartz technology. This time, we wanted to see what we could do with mechanical movements. Our internal team took that up as a challenge.

Has the Edge Calibre 903 been entirely developed in-house?

The Calibre 903 is among the slimmest commercially produced mechanical movements. Out of its 106 precision parts, 81 are manufactured at our Hosur facility. The rest of the parts are manufactured by our suppliers in Switzerland. The movement is assembled and qualified in Switzerland. So, it is a movement that has been kind of designed and conceived in India and partially sourced from Switzerland.

Would it power other premium watches from Titan?

Yes, that’s the idea. We are looking at building on this. This is just the first step to create and build a collection of exclusive timepieces.

What did your research on the premium segment in India tell you?

The last five to six years have seen renewed interest in high-end mechanical complications. There are a lot more people with an interest in fine watches. There are customers who want technical brilliance in their timepieces and are willing to pay for it.

Was there a reason why the watch was branded Titan rather than Xylys?

The Titan brand itself has been on a journey of premiumisation. For example, we’ve been doing very well with the Ceramic Edge. While it is an inclusive brand, Titan has also stood for the best in watch-making and it is the flagship brand that has been part of the Make in India story.

The Titan Edge itself has been an iconic line. At the time of its launch, in 2002, it was a breakthrough technology. We launched the Edge Skeletal Series in 2014, which was followed by the Edge Titanium, and then we had the Edge Ceramic in 2017. Some of these products have won Red Dot design awards.

The Edge has a fairly large customer base in India, and these customers were asking for watches with high-end mechanical movements. These are the loyalists who are in the loop on all the new releases, enjoy the whole experience and have the whole collection.

Do you see its appeal extending beyond the Titan Edge loyalists? There are some fine watchmakers operating in the same segment as the Titan Edge Mechanical.

People with an interest in fine watch-making will be open to the Titan Edge Mechanical. Some of them would be collectors and connoisseurs with other premium watches and we see them appreciating the craftsmanship that has gone into it and the fact that it is an Indian brand.

We also see a market for us abroad and we would be open to shipping it to our customers abroad. That is another customer group we are actively targeting — the successful global Indian who would be proud of what an Indian brand has achieved.

Tata group firm Titan on Wednesday said its jewellery division has recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic jolt, entering the growth phase, and other divisions have moved closer to full recovery led by festive season sales in the third quarter of the current fiscal.

The company had reported an unprecedented net loss of Rs 297 crore in the April-June quarter due to the pandemic. Its standalone net profit declined 37.81 percent to Rs 199 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 as against a net profit of Rs 320 crore in the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal.

""The company had been expecting a good festive season given the fact that there were signs that customers wanted to feel good by stepping out and shopping after 6 months of being restricted primarily to their homes.

“Q3 did not disappoint. The jewellery division has crossed the recovery phase to growth phase and other two large divisions have also moved much closer to the full recovery,"" Titan said in its quarterly update.

Titan said the company continues to focus on the creation of a combined digital and physical experience by which the customers can discover, engage, and buy products of their choice through the channel of their preference. Brand websites of Tanishq and Titan Eye Plus have added augmented reality for virtual try-out of certain products by customers.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""The company is setting up its processes and is expected to commence its activities in the very near future,"" the company said.

Elaborating on jewellery business, Titan said: ""The jewellery industry saw a resurgence in the festive season along with a pent up demand for wedding jewellery as most of the weddings in the first half of year 2020-21 were deferred.

“The company already announced the 15 percent growth in the 30-day festive period from Dussehra to Diwali. Fortunately, the growth trend was visible even after the festive season ended and the division has recorded close to 15 percent growth (excluding sale of raw gold of Rs 334 crore) in Q3.”

Titan said, while ticket size continues to be higher due to higher gold rates and higher share of wedding related products, 100 percent recovery in buyers (number of invoices) is yet to be seen.

Titan's watches and wearables division had a recovery rate of around 88 percent in Q3, compared to the revenue of the same quarter in last year.

""The e-commerce channel is leading the recovery with very strong absolute growth of over 30 percent. The festive period saw a surge in footfall in the shopping zones and the recovery rate improved in metros in Q3.”

The recovery rate for all the retail channels had been steadily increasing month-on-month primarily due to higher consumer walk-ins and also complemented by the selling of multiple products/ higher ticket size product in a single invoice, it said.

Titan said its other businesses had a revenue recovery of around 80 percent, compared to the revenue of the same quarter in last year.

The company’s eyeware division had a recovery of 92 percent in Q3, compared to the revenue of the same quarter in last year.

The recovery rate for fragrances and accessories continued to be muted due to the slow recovery of two of the biggest channels, trade and large format stores (LFS), the company added.

Significant jump in gold prices impacted sales in July, however, August and September witnessed gradual recovery, helping the jewellery segment to recover 89% of its sales. Other expenses remained high due to increase in ineffective hedges. Going ahead, ineffective hedges are likely to reduce substantially with normalization of demand scenario.

Motilal Oswal

Despite a relatively higher base for 3QFY21, outlook for the quarter remains positive due to (a) bunching up of postponed wedding demand, in addition to traditionally strong demand for wedding jewellery in 3Q, and (b) encouraging festive demand, which has already seen positive growth in the first 10 days of the festive season.

While FY22E multiples at 55x may appear expensive, it is primarily due to temporary impact of the pandemic in FY21, from which the rebound would be sharp over the next couple of years. Maintain Buy with target price of Rs 1,400 (55x Sep'22 EPS).

Tata group firm Titan on Thursday said it will end its five-year joint venture with luxury firm Montblanc in December this year, to focus on its primary business and proprietary brands.

Titan holds a 49 percent equity stake in the joint venture (JV) –Montblanc India Retail Private Limited.

Titan entered into the JV with Montblanc Services BV, the Netherlands, for the operation of retail boutiques in India for Montblanc products.

""By mutual agreement, Montblanc and Titan Company Ltd, a consumer retail company within the Tata Group, announced today the ending of their joint venture partnership in India. The decision enables Montblanc to become a wholly owned subsidiary in the country,” Titan said in a regulatory filing.

Titan said its decision to exit the joint venture agreement was driven by the company’s consolidation strategy to focus on their primary business and proprietary brands. No financial details were disclosed.

During the five-year partnership which began in 2015, Montblanc opened 12 boutiques in major cities across the country and established a fast-growing e-commerce business through the luxury online portal TataCliq.

Today Montblanc is a leading global luxury Maison with the largest footprint in the country, Titan added.

Commenting on the next stage of the business in India, Nicolas Baretzki, CEO of Montblanc International, said: ""This is a market that holds strong long-term potential for Montblanc, and it is a mark of confidence that we now become a wholly owned subsidiary.”

Gold prices rose by Rs 85 to Rs 50,498 per 10 gram in the Mumbai retail market on rupee depreciation and tepid global cues on October 5.

Gold’s glitter seems to be taking the sheen off the diamond. Despite high gold prices, Titan has witnessed robust demand for gold jewellery, leaving behind woman’s best friend.

Diamonds are clearly not in favour as such, Subramaniam, Chief Financial Officer, Titan Company Ltd, told Moneycontrol in a telephonic interaction. Most customers who used to buy diamonds earlier are looking at buying gold at this point, he added.

“People are looking at buying gold more as a store of value, asset allocation and also as a safe haven. If you look at the stock market, people are wary of the market direction ahead; debt markets are yielding very low returns. Therefore, in the context of that, gold seem to be a safe-haven investment for most people,” Subramaniam said.

Jewellery rules

On a like-to-like basis, Titan is looking at reporting at least 80 percent of last year’s July revenue and is getting traction back in the jewellery segment. In August, so far, the company is ahead of last year, Subramaniam said, without revealing any numbers.

In Q2 (July-September) of FY20, Titan had reported revenue of Rs 3,528 crore against Rs 3,582 crore. Its jewellery business had done better than most players in the industry then.

Titan sells jewellery under the brand name Tanishq. The jewellery business is Titan's mainstay and accounted for 83 percent of its revenue in financial year 2020.

Apart from gold jewellery, Titan has also seen demand for gold coins in the past few months.

Gold seen as a safe haven

Since January 2020, gold prices have surged nearly 40 percent, tracking a rally in global rates and depreciation in the rupee against the US dollar.

Also, the rise in safe-haven demand and expectations that central banks and governments will maintain support for economies hit by the coronavirus have pushed gold prices to record highs.

On August 7, gold hit a record high of Rs 56,191 per 10 grams in the Mumbai bullion market. On August 19, the gold price closed at Rs 55,360 per 10 grams.

Subramaniam envisages gold prices will rise in the coming months and expects demand for gold jewellery to continue. The company will also open 20-30 new jewellery stores in the current financial year.

Down time

Titan suffered a loss in the quarter ended June as stores remained shut during the Covid-19 lockdown and consumers spent less on discretionary items.

The company said 83 percent of its stores had opened by the end of June. But even then, many were not operating on all days.

“With the negative consumer sentiment prevailing in the quarter, discretionary spends were very low and specifically impacted our watches business,” Subramaniam said.

The watches segment, which usually accounts for 12-15 percent of revenue for the company, was the worst hit as demand for the accessory drastically fell after the Covid outbreak. The segment recorded an 89 percent decline in revenue in the June quarter. The watches division comprises brands such as Fastrack, Sonata, Raga, Octane and Xylys.

Subramaniam indicated that demand for watches has not picked up in Q2 as well. Again, he did not share any numbers.

The disappointing earnings did not deter the company from launching new products. Titan announced the launch of its full-touch smartwatch ‘Connected X’ on Amazon India during Prime Day on August 6. The product has garnered a good response so far, Subramaniam said.

Outlook

Subramaniam expressed concern that overall numbers by the end of FY21 will be hit badly due to the pandemic.

However, he was quick to add that at least by the fourth quarter (January-March) of FY21 things may start getting back to normal.

“We may see a decline in our revenues for FY21 but hopefully by the fourth quarter, we may get into a sense of normalcy. So, FY22 should be a normal year with the hope that the vaccine will possibly come out by the end of this calendar year, which looks very, very probable now,” Subramaniam said.

The company also slashed its advertising spend in Q1 of FY21 by 86 percent. Even in Q2, ad expenditure is likely to remain muted. Subramaniam said, adding: “If the revenue starts ramping up from Q3 and Q4, we will increase ad spend.""

For the remaining quarters of FY21, Titan is pinning its hopes on a revival in demand during the festival season and weddings as people are likely to get used to the new normal.

“The festive season should be decent as most people have been cooped up in their homes since March. They would want to go out, shop, explore and enjoy during Diwali and Christmas. Additionally, weddings, which were to take place in Q1 and Q2, are being pushed to Q3 and Q4 (of FY21). So, lots of occasions coming up for us to take advantage,” he said.

Titan Company Ltd, a joint venture between the Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO), commenced operations in 1984 under the name Titan Watches Ltd. Titan is the fifth-largest integrated own-brand watch manufacturer in the world.",851,0.22303974001031174

HDFC Securities' research report on Titan

Titan’s demand across categories was severely impacted in 1QFY21 due to the COVID-led nationwide lockdown. Topline declined 62% YoY to Rs. 19.8bn. The road to recovery remains hazy as weak consumer sentiment meets rising gold prices. Jewellery sales (ex-bullion sale of Rs. 6bn) declined 71% YoY to Rs. 12.2bn (HSIE: Rs. 10.5bn). Impact on profitability was even more severe across categories, courtesy unfavourable operating leverage.



Outlook

Titan reported a Rs 2.5bn EBITDA loss in 1Q – a first! We largely maintain our FY22 EPS estimates and arrive at a DCF-based target price of Rs 950/sh (implying 48x Jun-22 P/E). Note: DCF rolled over to Jun-21.

Kumar Jain, Vice President Mumbai Jewellers Association and proprietor of UT Zaveri, told Moneycontrol that in normal time during Akshay Tritiya the turnover is around Rs 200 crore in Maharashtra on gold jewellery, diamond jewellery and bullion sales but this time sales are likely to come around at 10-20 percent.

Jain said he is offering customers 30 percent discount on labour charges on gold jewellery, 40 percent on diamond and 5 percent discount on certain banks credit card.

The festival of Akshay Tritiya that falls on April 26 this year is associated with wealth, prosperity and happiness and a day on which Hindus and Jains purchase gold, schedule marriages and start new ventures as the day is considered auspicious.

Suvankar Sen, Executive Director, Senco Gold & Diamonds told Moneycontrol that he expects sales to be down by 80 percent from last year as customers are likely to opt for token purchase this time of 2, 5 and 10-gram gold coins.

Traditionally, Indian customers prefer to see and verify jewellery in stores before deciding to purchase them – so no big-ticket jewellery sales may take place this time.

Sen further said that businessmen and the salaried class are impacted by the lockdown as businesses are shut and pay cuts in various industries have impacted the sales sentiment this time.

Sen said that people shouldn't expect that the bullion price will come to down to last year's level of Rs 30,000-35,000 per 10 gram. He advises that one should accumulate gold in the price point of Rs 43,000-45,000/10 gram as a good entry point as they won’t regret the price the end of the year.

He sees gold prices touching Rs 53,000-55000 per 10 gram by Akshay Tritiya 2021.

To cater to customers demand and recover some loss of business, many jewellers have taken the online route this time and are offering various schemes and discounts. Below is the list of some jewellery brands who are selling gold online this year and their offers:

Senco Gold and Diamonds

The largest jewellery retail chain in Eastern India is offering a discount of Rs 400 per gram on gold rate and making charges this Akshay Tritiya which is valid for the period April 22-27.

The jewellery industry is looking at a dark Dhanteras and Diwali as it expects sales to decline at least 30 percent over last year in spite of the ongoing price corrections.

The industry's only hope is in falling prices, which had scaled a record of Rs 4,000 a gram last month, to get better footfalls. Currently, the metal is trading at around Rs 3,800 to a gram.

In 2018, the industry managed to close with flat sales over 2017 Diwali season.

""Gold prices have soared to Rs 40,000 per 10 gram last month, just in the beginning of the festival season and still remains high. This has further dampened the already weak consumer sentiment.

""But if prices continue to correct during this week there may be some improvement in retail demand. However, the overall business will still be 30 percent lower than last year,"" All-India Gem & Jewellery Domestic Council chairman Anantha Padmanaban told PTI on Tuesday.

World Gold Council managing director for India Somasundaram PR said this Diwali is not going to be very shiny following very high prices and already poor consumer sentiment dented by the deepening all-round gloom in the economy with every key indicators contracting or plunging month after month for nearly a year.

""Buying is still happening at the very high-end, but bulk of purchases, that is the low-to-mid range, are affected badly. Looking at the current trend we may have to revise the overall 2019 demand target, which was earlier predicted at 750-850 tonne,"" he said.

Somasundaram said imports were much higher than demand over several quarters since Q1 of 2017, but July and August saw imports plunging 60 percent, reflecting the already weak trade sentiment.

""Gold continues to be at a significant discount on account of muted demand and an active grey market, impacting organised manufacturers, refiners and jewellers,"" he added.

However, jewellery retailers are optimistic trying to attract consumers with offers and schemes.

According to Kalyan Jewellers chairman TS Kalyanaraman, ""after steeply rising in July and August, impacting buying sentiments prices have steadied now, and we are hopeful that this Diwali will be good. Moreover this is the start of the wedding season when big-ticket purchases take place.""

Sandeep Kulhalli of Titan said their flagship brand Tanishq has been witnessing substantial growth throughout the year so far and does not see why this should not continue during the festive season.

""Higher bonuses to Central government employees will also help boost demand. Another enabling factor is the beginning of the wedding season when big-ticket purchases take place and we are already receiving positive response to our new Diwali collection,"" he said.

On higher prices, Gnanasekar T of Comtrendz said the news on a US-China trade deal can strengthen the dollar further and keep gold prices under pressure.

""But if the rupee depreciates further, more price correction is unlikely otherwise we see prices heading south tom some extent,"" he said.

Gold is ruling at around Rs 38,000 per 10 gram now primarily due to lack of follow-through buying as safe-haven demand has dried up following the likelihood of a US-China trade deal, US Fed hinting at pause and a likely last minute Brexit deal, he said.",542,-0.1905482808748881

At the end of the September quarter, Rekha held 1.41 percent stake in Titan against 1.30 percent holding she had at in the previous quarter.

Earlier in its filing to the exchange, Titan’s management shed some light on what investors could expect in Q2 FY20.

The company's jewellery sales declined sharply in July, as gold became costlier and the consumption sentiment in most parts of India remained subdued, thus resulting in lower discretionary spends on high-value products.

Some green shoots were visible in August and September. During these months, retail (secondary) sales grew 15 percent year-on-year (YoY) due to increased impetus towards advertising. On the flip side, experts say this would impact margins.

Titan Company, one of the favourite stocks of India's ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, has jumped almost 2,000 percent in the last 10 years against a 134 percent gain in the market benchmark Sensex.

Since 2010, Titan, which leads the jewellery business in the country, has outperformed the Sensex seven times, clocking a cumulative gain of 1,994 percent against 133.8 percent jump in the index as of September 23.

At the end of the June quarter of FY20, Jhunjhunwala had seven percent stake in Titan, the company whose top asset is its well-diversified business that ranges from jewellery to watches to eyewear.

It has registered a CAGR of 13.5 percent in the last five years.

The company had a subdued FY-16 due to several factors, including regulatory pressure on the jewellery industry. But, it managed to gather momentum from FY-17 and has since been clocking a strong double-digit revenue growth.

The above set of data shows the stock has been consistently giving returns to investors. But, what is the way ahead?

Brokerages are positive on the stock

Morgan Stanley has upgraded the stock to overweight, with a target price of Rs 1,300.

""Ongoing marketing and promotion spends are unprecedented by the company, and the good news is that consumers are responding. Strong growth in a difficult macro environment should be rewarded by re-rating,"" said the foreign brokerage.

""We continue to see a long runway for growth in the jewellery segment, with an opportunity for share gains ahead of market estimates.”

The brokerage has raised its FY20, FY21 and FY22 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 3 percent, 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, to reflect a potential sharp recovery in consumer demand, offset by marginally lower operating margin.

Brokerage Anand Rathi also believes that Titan remains a strong play.

""We expect Titan to grow at a CAGR of 16.3 percent in the next two years. We estimate the company to report revenues of Rs 23,205.7 crore in FY-20E and Rs 26,731.1 crore in FY-21E,"" the brokerage said in a recent report.

It said the operating margins for the Tata group company should continue to improve with its estimate of around 128 basis points over two years. It expects the company’s EBITDA margins to be around 11.1 percent in FY-20 and 11.3 percent in FY-21.

Anand Rathi has a buy recommendation on Titan, with a target price of Rs 1,350 per share. At the current market price, the stock is trading at 56.8 times FY20E and 48.7 times FY21E consolidated earnings.

ICICI Direct also has a buy recommendation on Titan, with a target price of Rs 1,250.

""Titan has consistently displayed its ability to gain market share amid a tough industry scenario. With the long-term story intact, we believe the recent stock price correction offers a good entry point,"" said the brokerage in a recent report.

Even though the brokerage has revised its revenue and earnings estimates marginally downwards, factoring in the company's Q1FY20 performance, it has remained positive about long-term prospects.

""We continue to like the company given the healthy balance sheet (over 32 percent RoCE & virtually debt free status) and sustained market share gains driven by healthy store additions,"" ICICI Direct said.

Delhi High Court gave Tata Group company Titan ad-interim relief against e-tailers and restrained them from selling, marketing or otherwise dealing in goods bearing the marks Titan and Fastrack of Titan.

A Tata press release said the court order dated 29th July, 2019 also directs e-commerce player Snapdeal to take down within 24 hours of the order, the URLs against which Titan had lodged complaints.

The court also directed Snapdeal that in case Titan raises complaints of other or further URLs that sell counterfeit goods of Titan, these too shall be immediately removed.

Titan had filed a civil lawsuit in Delhi High Court against certain sellers and Snapdeal, alleging that they were selling counterfeit/infringing Fastrack watches on Snapdeal. It also alleged that Snapdeal did not take down various listings of counterfeit Fastrack/Titan branded watches despite being notified about these by Titan.

Commenting on the ad-interim relief, S Ravi Kant, Chief Executive Officer, Watches and Accessories division, Titan, said: “In the recent past, numerous cases of rampant trademark infringement and counterfeiting have come to light, and we believe this can only be countered through strong legal measures.”

“We have been heard by the Hon’ble High Court, which passed the above said order. We remain committed to our customers and will pursue the same approach in the event if similar instances occur in the future,” he said.

Snapdeal said it welcomed the order.

The retail sector is not yet out of the woods as brokerage firms are not too optimistic about the first quarter (Apr-June 2019-20) earnings of retail companies.

According to research reports from brokerage houses, most analysts expect moderation in sales growth and flat demand across apparel segment.

According to brokerages, consumption (both staples and discretionary) slowdown across the board is likely to result in lower-than-anticipated revenue growth, particularly in case of apparel.

Furthermore, there is no festive season push this time around either. Extended end-of-season-sale, coupled with sluggish same-store sales, could impact margins.

However, within the apparel space, Emkay in its recent retail preview report, expects Future Lifestyle Fashions and Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail to sustain healthy top-line momentum on the back of strong expansion of retail formats, while expects subdued sales growth for Shoppers Stop and Raymond in the April-June quarter.

Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail will announce its first quarter numbers on August 6 while Future Lifestyle Fashion, Shoppers Stop, and Raymond are yet to inform the exchanges on the result date.

For instance, Titan’s stock witnessed a sharp downfall in recent days owing to a subdued management commentary (on the Q1 FY20 performance).

IIFL stated that high gold prices in June and weak macros hurt demand for jewellery, which constitutes roughly 80 percent of revenue and happens to contribute towards operating leverage. In this parlance, it is pertinent to note that elevated valuations of retail stocks may be hard to sustain if earnings growth doesn’t pick up pace as the fiscal progresses.

Titan will annpounce its quarterly numbers on August 6.

Phillip Capital believes that retail companies may outpace staples companies in terms of volume growth, as the larger theme of formalization remains intact.

Notwithstanding the short-term roadblocks that lie along the path, analysts expect the long-term outlook for this sector (in terms of revenue accruals) should remain promising considering India's large population base.",320,-0.3333312405480279

- Network augmentation and product launches will drive growth

- Consumer sentiment remains weak

- Post-correction, the stock offers a good entry opportunity

-------------------------------------------------

Titan, one of the crown jewels of the Tata Group, released its quarterly preview. While the management did not sound too upbeat on the jewellery front, top-line growth in watches and eyewear are positive takeaways. We remain bullish on the company in spite of its steep valuation.

Here's a snapshot of how things are likely to pan out across segments.

Jewellery

In spite of market share gains amid robust Akshaya Tritya sales, very high gold prices in June took a toll on overall demand. Wedding and studded jewellery saw decent traction.

For the quarter, top line grew by 13 percent year-on-year, below the management's expectations. Though seasonality also had a major role to play, it is pertinent to note that the rate of growth of jewellery sales has slowed quite a bit, both sequentially and year-on-year (YoY).

Titan launched the 'Swayahm' collection of plain and studded jewellery, to be sold through the company's 'Tanishq' outlets.

Under 'Mia', the company's new products (Birthstone Pendant, Facets, Florets) have garnered good customer response.

As many as 12 Tanishq stores, spanning a total of 34,000 square feet, have been added to Titan's existing store count of close to 287 stores. Most of these additions took place in tier 2 and 3 cities of India.

Boosting institutional sales like gifting undertaken by corporates and generating online traction (for Tanishq) will be among the new priority areas, going forward.

Watches

In Q1 FY20, revenue grew 19 percent year-on-year. This was attributable to the following.

- A large institutional order from TCS (Tata Consultancy Services)

- Strong momentum in e-commerce channels and large format stores

- Sustained smartwatch demand

- Product launches at regular intervals

- Store additions

- Customer additions under the 'Fastrack' and 'Titan' brands

In comparison to Q1 FY19, this segment has done visibly better in Q1 FY20.

Furthermore, barring a few quarters in the past, this segment’s contribution to Titan’s consolidated revenue has been steadily increasing. As a result, any margin expansion could have a positive impact on the overall EBITDA margin.

Eyewear

Turnover in this segment grew by 13 percent year-on-year. This was on account of

- An uptick in sales across trade channels

- Store additions (27/9 stores were opened/closed during Q1 FY20, respectively)

- Buyer activations (i.e. more number of buyers enrolling for memberships, schemes/offers, loyalty programmes etc)

- Introduction of the 'Floatables' range of 'Fastrack' sunglasses

Owing to heavy investments in brand-building, this segment is unlikely to break even this time as well.

Lifestyle products

Titan's 'SKINN' perfumes are being made available at more points of sale across India, especially in department stores and e-commerce marketplaces.

'SKINN' has been gaining market share gradually. To accelerate this process and grab the attention of first-time buyers, small-sized packs may be introduced.

'Taneira', Titan's saree brand, is gradually expanding its reach as well. The company added one store in Hyderabad during the quarter, thus taking the total count to 5. New product variants will be launched periodically.

Despite the good margin profile, the contribution of this segment is too minuscule (barely 1 percent) to meaningfully enhance the consolidated profits of the company.

What should investors do?

Lack of operating leverage in jewellery (80 percent of sales) and losses in eyewear (3 percent of sales) will offset the margin improvement in watches. Therefore, we expect earnings to remain subdued when Titan announces its actual Q1 FY20 numbers in August.

The management's cautious Q1 commentary, coupled with a hike in basic Customs duty on gold from 10 percent to 12.5 percent (in the Budget), resulted in a price correction for the last 6 days. Even after this bout of corrections, Titan trades at rich valuations (at 42 times its FY21 earnings). At such elevated multiples, a revenue or margin miss in the upcoming quarters may trigger a further downfall.

Given the weak consumption sentiment, the possibility of an appreciable re-rating in the foreseeable future appears bleak. Nevertheless, in the consumer discretionary space, Titan remains one of our top picks, given its superior brand positioning. Investors looking to build a defensive portfolio may want to consider taking advantage of the current weakness.

Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the US-China trade conflict, uncertainty around Brexit and the global slowdown have driven gold's spot prices to all-time highs.

The yellow metal surpassed Rs 35,000 per 10 gram in some Indian states on June 25. On the global front, it breached the $1,400-mark to reach its six-year peak.

Some analysts expect a further surge in gold prices on the expectations of aggressive rate cuts by the US Fed, while others see a slump in the near future on the expectations that the ongoing G-20 Summit will provide some respite in regard to the US-Iran and US-China relations.

Titan and Muthoot Finance are two stocks that could be impacted by the surge in gold prices, said investment management firm JM Financial.

According to the company, the price movement of gold will have no material impact on the margins of Titan, as the compan’s making charges are now linked to the underlying value of jewellery pieces.

""From a jewellery demand perspective, consumers typically work with a budget and these are rarely based on grammage. As a result, higher gold prices would mostly be offset by lower grammage purchased and vice-versa, though, in the initial stages of a highly price-inflationary phase, consumers may adopt a wait-and-watch approach,"" said JM Financial in a report.

This is also evident from FY17 and FY18 results as average gold prices were 12 percent higher in FY17 but dropped by 1 percent in FY18, while Titan’s jewellery segment posted more than 20 percent revenue growth coupled with operating margin expansion in both years.

As for Muthoot Finance, the rise in gold prices would enable a rise in credit of 8 percent from existing customers by providing them top-up loans, which would also enhance asset quality, said the brokerage.

""If the company wants to maintain a moderate LTV level of 62 percent, then it can grant around top-up loans which alone could result in an 8.3 percent YoY growth in FY20. The asset quality will strengthen further,"" said JM Financial

During FY13 to FY 16, gold prices declined 8-9 percent. In this period the firm’s loan-to-value (LTV) increased by 400 bps to 68 percent. After FY16 till FY19, gold prices increased by 10 percent and the firm’s LTV was at 62 percent.

""The gold finance companies by maintaining an average LTV of 62-65 percent (despite the maximum limit of 75 percent) have been able to lower the risk of a sharp decline in gold prices. The recent surge in gold prices will further reduce the risk of defaults by existing customers,"" the report added.

In the recent spike in gold prices, LTVs have reduced to 57 percent, down from 62 percent as of March 31, 2019.",463,0.25220679491758347

Titan traded near its record high on February 25 on the back of the government's decision to call for a meeting later this month to discuss the mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery.

Compulsory hallmarking will benefit branded players like Titan, the company's CFO S Subramaniam told CNBC-TV18 while sharing his outlook for the future.

Subramaniam said this will help the organised players although it may be tough to implement. ""The prices are extremely high at this point in time, and we can see that coming from the entire industry as sales have been muted. Also, it will be difficult to implement hallmarking as a mandatory process because of all the infrastructural changes that will take place.""

He said, ""We have been doing decently. March is where we hope to do better than what we have done. In fact, we are planning to come with demand generating activities in March.""

Dolat Capital's research report on Titan

Net revenues grew by 34.3% YoY to ` 56.7bn – came ahead of our estimate. Jewellery business reported a robust 36.8% sales growth mainly led by grammage growth of 20%. The segment benefited from strong growth in both plain and studded jewellery. The plain jewellery segment was driven by a large order from institutional order of ` 2bn. The studded jewellery contribution remained stable at 25%, indicates that the category also posted +35% growth during the quarter. Though margins in the jewellery business expanded during the quarter, overall margins declined due to high A&P spends in watch business. We believe the growth in jewellery category would continue, despite unfavorable base benefiting from new store additions and new customer acquisition. Further, Titan, being one of the largest players in the organized industry with attractive offerings, we believe that it would emerge as a clear winner of the shift from unorganised to organised. Furthermore, changing trend of buying jewellery for fashion instead of investment would enhance premiumization.

Outlook

We have revised our estimates upward to factor in Q3 performance. Upgrade to BUY with TP of ` 1,139 (48x FY21E).

Titan’s robust top-line year-on-year (YoY) growth in the December quarter was led by the jewellery segment. The onset of the wedding and festive season, new product launches and 27 new store additions under the ‘Tanishq’ brand in 9M FY19, have kept its sales going strong.

The company’s watches and eyewear segments didn’t disappoint either. Revenues in these categories grew sharply on account of the availability of new product variants, higher traction across retail formats and larger volumes.

The company's lifestyle products such as SKINN perfumes and Taneira sarees, have also seen a good response.

A healthy same-store sales growth and market share gains helped derive operating leverage in the jewellery segment. High advertisement spends impacted the profitability of Titan's watches segment, whereas its eyewear segment failed to break even.

Lower gross margins and a steep increase in other expenses resulted in EBITDA margins remaining flat YoY.

Depreciation and interest costs increased YoY by 10.2 and 43.5 percent respectively. There was an increase in tax rate from 29.2 percent (in Q3 FY18) to 31.4 percent too. Notwithstanding this, a major spike in other income prevented its bottom-line margins from declining.

At 47 times its FY20 estimated earnings, the stock already trades at demanding valuations. We advise buying on corrections.

Luxury goods giant Titan, that has already made a mark in the watches, jewellery, fragrances and eyewear segment, has now ventured out into sarees with the launch of its brand called Taneira.

After testing the market with a pilot project, the brand has now opened doors to its flagship store in Delhi. Ajoy Chawla SVP, strategy and business incubation at Titan Company Limited spoke to Moneycontrol about Taneira's brand proposition and plans ahead.

Q: After testing waters in Bengaluru, you launched the flagship store in Delhi. How was the response in the southern city and what prompted you to set shop in Delhi?

A: We have been running two small stores in Bengaluru for the last 18 months and the response was extremely encouraging. We finally thought of setting the flagship store at South Extension Part 1, which is a reflection of the brand's philosophy – the store has been designed using purely natural material, handmade by artisans from across India.

Q: Tell us what Taneira is all about.

A: The anchor product is sarees, but the product range is not restricted to them. We are working with 55 weaver clusters from across the country to put together a range of traditional Indian natural handmade, hand woven and hand crafted saris ranging from Mugas from Assam, Ikats from Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, Jamdhanis from Bengal, Chanderis and Maheshwaris from Madhya Pradesh and a vast collection of Tussars.

The brand also has a range of ready-to-wear blouses and we offer customisation and tailoring services to complete the perfect ensemble. The collection includes sarees for all occasions, bridal lehengas, stoles, dupattas and dress material.

At Taneira we have products starting at Rs 1000 and going up to Rs 3 lakh.

Q: What is your target audience?

A: For now we want to invite our existing 10 million Encircle customers, which is our loyalty programme launched by Titan. It rewards members who shop from our brand stores including Tanishq, Zoya, MIA, World of Titan, Helios, Fastrack, Titan Eye Plus. It allows the members to earn reward points and exclusive privileges on every purchase, all with one simple membership and Taneira is going to be added to the programme.

That apart, we are looking to target modern women as well.

A: Do you have an online existence?

Q: We have started Taneira's own digital platform along with some of our sarees on Tata Cliq's Indie lux section.

Q: What are your plans to take the brand ahead? Do you have more stores in mind?

A: We have just started out so it's a new experience and we will wait and see how the store performs. Expansion is definitely on the cards and we want to be present in the top 20 cities in the country.",472,0.9753067791461945

Titan Company, a joint venture between Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO), which has been in the business of watches, jewellery, and eyewear, had last year launched a saree brand called 'Taneira'

The Indian equity market has seen some healthy correction in high quality names, which provides investors a strong opportunity to reassess their existing portfolio and build-up new positions. After careful assessment of the defensive portfolio’s performance, we are replacing NLC India with Titan.

Why exclude NLC India ?

Despite attractive dividend yield and valuations, the market continues to penalise NLC due to lack of growth and declining profitability, which is attributable to lower power generation. We would like to close our call owing to lack of near term visibility.

Why consider Titan ?

About the company

Titan, a part of the Tata conglomerate, is among India’s leading home-grown jewellery companies that derives 80-85 percent of its annual revenue from sale of gold, diamond and studded jewellery. Watches and eyewear products are also a part of the company’s product portfolio.

The opportunities

Titan aims to compound its FY18 jewellery revenue (Rs 13,256.9 crore) by over 2.5 times in the next five years. This will be driven by high-value wedding variants, market share gains from unorganised players and store additions in Tanishq.

To facilitate margin accretion, impetus will be laid on increasing the contribution of studded jewellery variants to total sales. About 75-80 percent of new Tanishq outlets will be opened under the franchise route to keep the business asset light, limit capex and derive higher returns on capital invested.

In the watches segment, higher Fastrack activations, product launches, e-commerce sales and improved product presence in large format stores will be pivotal to revenue growth. Consolidation of distributors and stockists, coupled with cost efficiency initiatives, should help improve margins.

Challenges

Titan’s eyewear segment remains a sore point as far as profitability is concerned. Investments in developing omnichannels, promoting prescription eyewear and launching Fastrack lenses will be high in the near term. Returns from this segment, if any, will take time. The management said Q1 FY19, which is typically a weak quarter for jewellery sales, is expected to remain soft. This is on account of declining gold imports, weak consumer offtake and a high base last year (purchases were brought forward from Q2 FY18 to Q1 due to rollout of Goods & Services Tax).

Valuation

Historically, Titan has always traded at a steep premium to its peers such as PC Jeweller and Tribhovandas Bhimji Zaveri (TBZ), and rightly so. We don’t forsee any change in this trend given Titan’s robust fundamentals and brand appeal (trust factor), in addition to the opportunities listed above.

PC Jeweller has been mired in several corporate governance issues for quite some time, thus causing the stock to correct. TBZ’s margins and return ratios are nowhere closer to Titan. From an investment perspective, there is very little to choose besides Titan in the jewellery space.

Notwithstanding a few temporary blips, we remain bullish on Titan’s ability to maintain its premium valuation. The stock has corrected significantly in the past few days too. At 39 times FY20 projected earnings, despite the expensive valuation, we recommend investors to capitalise on the downfall by going long on the counter.

In the quarter gone by, Titan (market cap: Rs 71,334 crore) reported moderate year on year (YoY) revenue growth, largely led by jewellery sales. Gross margin improvement was due to a higher contribution of studded jewellery variants to overall revenue (25 percent in Q3FY18 versus 21 percent in Q3FY17). Higher advertisement spends curtailed EBITDA margin expansion.

The transition of India’s jewellery industry from unorganised units to tax-compliant entities will work considerably in favour of Titan, one of the largest organised branded players in the country. The stock has been a little weak in recent times, thereby giving investors an opportunity to accumulate for the long-term.

The path ahead?

Going forward, studded and high-value diamond jewellery are likely to remain the key drivers for Titan. The company is confident of achieving 25 percent year on year sales growth by the end of FY18, a large chunk of which will be apparently driven by the seasonally strong Q3 and Q4.

Introduction of new collections in the wedding category, coupled with an increase in the number of new customers, has enabled Titan to gain market share in the past few months. As per the company, this traction is expected to continue as the product mix shifts from non-bridal jewellery varieties to bridal ones.

In the near future, Titan’s jewellery segment margins are expected to hover in the range of 11-14 percent, whereas margins for the watches segment may increase up to 12 percent (mainly on the back of an optimistic trajectory for the ‘Fastrack’ and ‘Helios’ brands).

To facilitate aggressive asset-light expansion in FY19 and FY20, 80-90 percent of Titan’s new stores will be opened through the franchise route. This, in turn, will strengthen the company’s bottom-line performance and yield incremental returns on capital.

Titan’s eyewear (glares brand: Titan Eyeplus) and grooming (perfume brand: SKINN by Titan) segments remain sore points owing to their inability to break-even. Furthermore, reintroduction of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act provisions in due course could also dampen consumer sentiment.

At 37.6x FY20 projected earnings, investors may consider accumulation on price dips.

Titan on Tuesday announced that it witnessed around 50 per cent jump in its sales during Akshaya Tritiya period in the first quarter of this fiscal. It has a successful gold exchange programme in June 2017 resulting in ""an exceptional growth on topline for the division.""

""The year started off for the division with a great AT, with 50 per cent growth over previous year's AT period as well as a very successful gold exchange programme in June 2017,"" it said in a filing to the exchanges.

However, the company also added that in the first quarter, there was a strike of jewellers for 15-20 days, hence ""the base for Q1 FY 2017-18 is also more favorable to that extent.""

The company has also welcomed 3 per cent GST imposed on the jewellery segment by the government and said: ""It should not create any disruption in sales as well as gold exchange.""

Moneycontrol takes a look at what brokerages are talking about.

Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target Price: Rs 540

Driven by a strong growth for the jewellery division, the research firm said that Titan noted an encouraging start to the fiscal. Strong growth was seeing during Akshaya Tritiya as well as the gold exchange program in June 2017 aided the sales momentum.

Higher salience of gold jewelry during Q1 would imply lower operating margins for the jewellery division.

JPMorgan also believes that Titan will be a key beneficiary of any improvement in consumer sentiment in the current fiscal. This could be due to its dominant positioning in leading lifestyle categories of jewellery and watches.

The research firm also said that the Tata Group firm would benefit from higher market share as jewellery purchases shift to organised players and unorganized segment becomes less competitive. “Titan will also benefit from the transition to GST given the accelerated shift to organized trade,” the brokerage house said in its report.

Risks

Key downside risks to its rating and price target include: 1) a slowdown in sales growth, 2) increased competitive activity, 3) adverse regulatory measures including a high GST incidence, 4) high gold price volatility, which depresses gold jewelry demand, and 5) significant margin deterioration.

Brokerage: Goldman Sachs | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 552

The brokerage house believes the strong performance of the jewellery segment continues to reflect Titan’s brand strength, which drives its ability to win market share from competition especially in the GST regime, it said in a report.

The watches segment recorded healthy retail growth, but topline for segment is likely to be flat as Titan delayed promotional offers due to GST.

It also increased long term margin forecast as it expect higher operating leverage from faster sales growth.

Slower sales growth and adverse regulatory developments could be the key risks to the stock.",479,0.3638743281364441

India Inc. is already feeling the heat of goods & services tax (GST) which will come into effect on July 1. The countdown has already started for the ‘One Nation One Tax’ reform to transition on the midnight of June 30 to July 1.

After the launch of GST, the next big trigger which will be tracked by market participants will be June quarter results from India Inc. which most experts think could be muted especially for FMCG and auto stocks amid implementation of GST.

The GST Council had last month fixed the rates for over 1,200 goods and 500 services -- at the slabs of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent.

“GST rates have come out and we expect automobiles, FMCG and Building material products like Laminates manufacturers are set to gain in long run,” A.K.Prabhakar, Head -Research at IDBI Capital told Moneycontrol.

“However, due to lower tax rate we expect these companies are expected to see a negative impact on earnings as no tax benefits on its existing inventories which may dent its earnings in the current quarter,” he said.

Prabhakar further added that companies like Maruti, Bajaj Auto, Hero Moto Corp, Colgate-Palmolive and Greenlam may face a tough time in near term but expect to have a positive impact on the long run.

Even though GST will be a disrupter in the short term because of lack of clarity about the procedure, but experts think that any disruptions could be an opportunity to get into quality stocks.

Speaking at a Press Conference, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that over the medium and the long term, GST will usher in a more efficient system as it will “check evasion, revenues will grow and the spending capacity of governments will increase.

To further ease the procedure, the GST Council on Sunday extended the deadline for filing the first set of returns, a move that will likely soothe frayed nerves of millions of traders ahead of the new indirect tax system’s rollout from July 1.

“GST implementation will provide a fresh entry point into the market as there will lot of chaos after the implementation. Some sectors like real estate where there is no clarity on the actual impact of GST will see a slowdown in activity,” Naveen Kulkarni, Co-Head Research at PhillipCapital India Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

We have collated a list of companies which could report muted Q1 amid implementation of GST:

Analyst: D K Aggarwal, Chairman, and MD, SMC Investments and Advisors Ltd

Bajaj Corp:

During Q4, it has reported weak financials due to gross margin pressure and lack of volume. According to the management of the company, GST could be short term hurdle but performance would improve in half year FY2018.

Arvind:

It has reported weak financials due to demonization and increase in cotton prices and after GST, man-made apparel above Rs 1,000 will attract a 12 percent levy, higher than the existing 7 percent, which would clearly impact the profitability of the company.

Analyst: Abnish Kumar Sudhanshu, Director & Research Head, Amarapali Aadya Trading & Investments

Voltas:

As per the GST, prices of televisions, refrigerators and air-conditioners are likely to go up by 4-5 percent from July as GST counsel has proposed 28 percent GST on consumer electronics and durables as compared to the current tax rate which is around 23 percent.

Currently, most of the companies are clearing their inventories at the low prices, taking the pressure on their margins and realisations. Hence, we expect Voltas to feel the pinch in the June quarter.

Indian Hotel:

Earlier pre-GST rates for Hotel were ranging from 18 percent to 25 percent, but in the GST panel has decided to classify rates into four buckets based on tariff bands and taxed at 5 percent, 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent.

As we know, premium and luxury hotels, where room tariffs exceed Rs 5,000 per day would now be slapped with a 28 percent GST. Hence, Indian Hotel being the largest Hotel chain in India is likely to be impacted in the June quarter.

Havells India:

GST Panel has decided to put GST rates on cable on the higher side than expected i.e. 28 percent from the earlier 18 percent. And the company does not have any plans to pass on the rate hike to mitigate the price increase.

Hence, we expect sales growth would come at the cost of margin, so the company could witness some pressure in the month of June quarter results.

Titan:

Though, company’s stock price has rallied significantly on the back of lower tax of 3 percent as against the expectation of 5 percent tax in GST. But, the panel has also put the taxes on making charges, which were earlier not there present in the making.

Currently, gold jewellers pay one per cent excise and 1.2 percent value-added tax (VAT) over and above the 10 percent customs duty on bullion, which effectively works out to 12.43 percent.

However, after the introduction of GST at 3 percent for gold and 18 percent for making charges, and keeping customs at 10 percent, the effective rate comes to 15.67 percent.

So, the effective price escalation on gold jewellery comes to 3.24 percent. Hence, we believe the initially, company to bear the margin pressure which could be reflected in the June quarter results.

Marico:

This has recently acquired male grooming brand Beardo that sells hair and face care products including waxes and creams, which will also be taxed at 28 percent in GST. Hence, we believe the company to reported muted earnings in the coming quarters.

Analyst: Naveen Kulkarni, Co-Head Research at PhillipCapital India Pvt. Ltd.

Kajaria Ceramics, V-Guard, and Finolex:

Post GST implementation many sectors will provide opportunities to build fresh positions as the impact will only be transitory. Stocks which will get impacted include companies because of de-stocking and discounts offered include names like Kajaria Ceramics, V-Guard, and Finolex.

Titan

Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 620

CLSA upgraded Titan Company to buy from outperform earlier over the weekend and has also raised its 12-month target price to Rs620 from Rs 555 earlier as the goods & services tax (GST) rate was lower than expectations which remove an overhang from the stock.

Months of speculation and suspense is finally over as the GST rates on gold and diamond jewellery have been finalised at 3 percent. “Titan currently pays an over 2 percent effective tax rate, so this is only a marginal increase but the outcome is much better than expectations of as much as 6 percent,” said the CLSA report.

Improved compliance under GST will also create a level playing field and help the organized sector, including Titan. “We remain positive on the stock and upgrade our rating from outperform to BUY and lift our target price from Rs555 to Rs620 (45x March 2019),” added the note.

Larsen & Toubro

Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 2,120

The brokerage observed that Larsen & Toubro’s digital initiatives could expand its margin by 100 basis points. It believes that the infrastructure major has a credible strategy to improve its growth and return on equity (RoE).

Coal India

Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Sell | Target: Rs 240

The brokerage firm expects operating performance to remain weak in the current fiscal. It sees rise in cost as full impact of wage hike will come through. Further, it believes that the earnings downgrade is not over yet.

HPCL

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 640

The brokerage believes that an uncertainty around merger or acquisition involving ONGC is an overhang. It sees a stake sale of the company to ONGC as the most likely outcome. This stake sale will have no adverse impact on business.

Page Industries

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 15,000

The research firm believes that the GST rate for garments below Rs 1,000 at 5 percent will be beneficial for the manufacturer of Jockey brand in India.

“This is a reduction of 3-4% for Page compared to the current taxation, as opposed to the risk of an increase, which was expected. We expect Page to pass on the lower rates to consumers, and the lower prices should lead to an uptick in volume growth for the company,” the global research firm said in a report.

With the GST rate risk ceasing to exist along with 15 percent underperformance by the stock, Credit Suisse sees no downside. It also increased the target price to Rs 15,000 from Rs 12,800, implying an upside of over 17 percent. The earnings estimates were also increased by 4-5 percent.

Critics of Titan have often asked if the company should rename itself as Tanishq as sales of jewellery today account for a large part of its sales. But as you set foot into Titan's headquarters and the focused approach that it has on different categories, you realise the criticism is not rooted in fact. In an interview with Moneycontrol's Malini Bhupta, Titan's Managing Director Bhaskar Bhat talks about the company's plans in FY18, the categories they will focus on and how they are all about lifestyle. Edited excerpts:

How do you expect FY18 to shape up after a rather challenging FY17?

This year is going to be better. We had begun the year confronted by a 43-day strike in the jewellery business, which forced us to close stores. The effect of demonetisation was devastating on unorganised players. Consumers have realised that Tanishq's way of doing business is the right way of doing business and many are migrating to organised sector players. In a small way it also affects watches as there are unorganised players in watches, too. But over the last 10 years, a lot of foreign companies are operating in India.

Since jewellery now accounts for more than 80 percent of sales, should you rename the company as Tanishq?

We are a lifestyle company and not a jewellery or watch company. We have chosen three categories and our job is to excel in each of them. We are using our competence for new areas of opportunity like fragrances and eye wear. We have chosen categories where unorganized play is big. Our watch business is bigger than Trent in value and profit terms. We are a Rs 13,000 crore company and jewelry itself is Rs 10,000 crore. But the other business is Rs 3000 crore and how many companies do you have in any category of that size?

The name of the company is Titan Company, so why should we change the name. Watches touch 14 million customers a year and jewellery touches 2 million. The number of consumers who buy watches is seven times more. There is a certain size for an industry. Unless you separate all of them and make them separate companies. Market share is 4.5 percent for jewellery and 65 percent in the watches.

What made Titan enter the sari business?

If you look at the sari business it is much like the jewelery business and is unorganised. There are many categories where there are no organised players and no scientific way to assess what you are getting. Our research told us that while sari is not the in-thing, women have a longing to wear saris. It is a complex affair to buy a sari. Our research told us that here is a category to be explored and exploded. We have a huge customer base of women and they like our products. We have no competitor to Raga. We are clear about our categories. So long as you excel, you create excitement in the company. If you go to a start-up you won’t ask this question. I am saying that we are simply customer-oriented and our loyalty programme has 10 million members.

How do you choose the sectors you want to enter?

We keep looking at unorganized sectors where lifestyle products are manufactured and sold. If we find the opportunity is big enough, then we look at the category. Research tells us people are investing in themselves – like wellness, fitness, leisure travel etc. Investing in the self is a higher order drive. We choose categories where you can serve millions. Also, women have become a segment by themselves.

Typically, one would hear women are making decisions for family but now they are a force to reckon with, independent of the family. They are making their own choices, influencing and advocating. Our understanding is better than others of this segment.

We believe the fragrance market will explode provided the marketer brings value. Eye wear is still at Rs 400 crore as a category and saris is again early days. We have two years and we are still experimenting. We are not a retailer. We are a category player and we dive deep into it. Just special occasion wear saris is Rs 24,000 crore.

About 12 women from our factory in Hosur went to pick up saris after completing 25 years. They chose Bhagalpuri Tussar. We opened up the process of exploration to the whole company. We told people within the company to dream of categories that we could enter and we will evaluate and fund good ideas. The project is called “Ignite.” I had it as an idea for a long time but 700 ideas came. It got filtered to 14 and then three. At every level the ideas got filtered down by a hard-nosed jury. The jury had people like CEO of Tata Tea, a non-business head at Titan, and a professor from IIM Bangalore. Sari emerged as one of the ideas through Ignite.

Why do you have so many brands in jewelry?

You should go back to our watches experience. India is no longer a single market. Watch business started as a single brand, now we have multiple brands. That is how we have a 65 percent marketshare. The point about brands is that you cannot stretch brands across geographies. For instance, Mia is targeted at working women. The idea is lighter and simpler with lower price points. Tanishq is the jeweller. Zoya is an exclusive design with diamonds.

Can you sustain the phenomenal growth in jewellery business?

We think it can only get better. Our focus was productivity for people and by people. At the start of the year, they took lower hikes than industry standard, but we made it up with a bonus towards the end. We expect jewellery sales to grow 2.5x sales in five years.

How do you see GST impacting the jewellery business?

We expect GST to be 5 percent on jewellery. The biggest change that the GST will bring about is that the formal sector will benefit. And the jewellery industry is dominated by the informal sector. Government will like to formalise the entire jewellery industry so that the generation of unaccounted income is eliminated. Bringing them under the tax regime and follow practices of any other industry will benefit those who are formal players. A higher GST rate would make jewellery more expensive to the investment-oriented customer. If taxation is high and it is not subsumed in the price of gold then the investment angle will disappear.

How will GST give you an edge over unorganized players?

I think the field will become more level. The beauty of this system is that every member of the value chain has to cheat, for the system to go back to the earlier system. Everybody will have to fall in line.

Do you expect sales to be impacted in the first few months of GST?

We are already getting queries from trade asking us what will happen to the stock. I think companies have to make choices on whether they will pick up the difference in tax or not. Which means reimburse the GST component in the stock. If I am giving 25 percent margin to the dealer and if I have sold him a product to him at Rs 750, it has the tax component in it. But at the consumer’s end the tax is on Rs 1000. The dealer will be forced to pay 28 percent but the question is who will bear the difference. If we are not willing to pay then dealers will not buy new stock. We have to make an assessment and see if we are willing to pay the difference as it will be a large sum of money. They will seek compensation for the stock leftover on June 30.

Any new product categories will Titan enter?

A slew of new products. Jewellery will become a bigger wedding jewellery player. Watches will be a bigger and smart watch player. Company will become more active online, whether it is influencing people digitally or making people buy online.",1363,0.6638583838939667

The sharp growth in Titan’s jewellery business has prompted many to ask if Titan should rename itself as Tanishq. The reason behind this is the sheer value of jewellery sales, which today account for Rs 10,000 while other categories account for Rs 3000 crore.

But the company’s leadership is not affected by such comments. Bhaskar Bhat, Managing Director of Titan, says: “We are a lifestyle company and not a jewelry or watch company. We have chosen three categories and our job is to excel in each of them. We have chosen categories where unorganized play is big.”

Given the high value of the gold in the jewelry business, its share is significantly high in overall revenues. But in terms of marketshare, Titan has a marketshare of 65 percent in watches. And the company’s watch business is bigger than Trent in value and profit terms, adds Bhat. He says: “We are a Rs 13,000 crore company and jewelry itself is Rs 10,000 crore. But the other business is Rs 3000 crore and how many companies do you have in any category of that size.”

Justifying the company and the categories it is present in, he says: “The name of the company is Titan Company Limited so why should we change the name. Watches touch 14 million customers a year and jewellery touches 2 million. The number of consumers who buy watches is seven times more. There is a certain size for an industry. Marketshare is 4.5 percent for jewelery and 65 percent in the watches.”

Titan’s Managing Director Bhaskar Bhat is no novice when it comes to the protestations of analysts and investors. But that has never deterred him from doing what he believes is best for the company, consumers and employees. If his customers – internal and external – are a happy lot, the rest takes care of itself. It is this conviction that made the company enter the jewelry business more than a decade ago when family jewellers were the order of the day.

In an interview with Moneycontrol at its headquarters in Bangalore, Bhat says: “We keep looking at unorganised sectors where lifestyle products are manufactured and sold. If we find the opportunity is big enough then we look at the category. Research tells us people are investing in themselves – like wellness, fitness, leisure travel etc. Investing in the self is a higher order today. We choose categories where you can serve millions.”

The company has a deep understanding of customers, retailing and lifestyle categories. It is this understanding that drives the company to enter unorganised categories and conquer them. Long before the others woke up to it, Titan realized that women were expected to emerge as a force by themselves as they became financially independent. That thinking drove the company to enter the jewelry business. Also, women have become a segment by themselves.

Typically, women have been making decisions for family for a while now but Titan imagined years ago that they would become a force to reckon with, independent of the family, says Bhat. They are making their own choices, influencing and advocating.

And Titan’s understanding of them is better than others. While many naysayers have raised eyebrows on Titan entering the sari segment, the company believes that in every category where it can unearth value and offer transparency is terms of quality, pricing, quality and branding, the company will enter.

Even if the category is small, Titan will explore it before the category explodes like it is doing with fragrances. Says Bhat: “We believe the fragrance market will explode provided the marketer brings value. Eyewear is still at Rs 400 crore as a category and saris is again early days. We have two years and we are still experimenting. We are a category player and we dive deep into it.” Given that the occasion-wear saris category is worth about Rs 24,000 crore, Titan stands a strong chance of capturing a large share of the market with its understanding of consumers.

Some of the other unorganised categories that could offer ample opportunity in future could be handbags or even luggage as these too are not as organised as in developed markets and there are a few mid or mass market players.",464,0.8365693887074789

If there is one thing that Bhaskar Bhat, the Managing Director of Titan, understands better then it is his consumers. And, women form a significant portion of his 10-million customer base. His understanding of his consumers comes from the direct connect that he has built with them. So much so that women consumers often call him on his direct line if they have a problem and not only does he patiently hear them out but also solves their problem.

And, it is this deep understanding of the consumer that drives the company to enter the hitherto unorganised lifestyle category. The company has already done it with watches and jewelry and now it is dipping its toes in the occasion-wear sari space, which is a Rs 24,000 crore market.

Taneira, the youngest brand from Titan, opened its first store in Bengaluru in February this year, and will showcase the best hand-woven saris from across the length and breadth of India. Currently, there are two stores in Bengaluru. Once the company has tested the concept, it will scale the business. Even though Bhat had been toying with the idea of entering the category for a while, he decided to invite ideas from across the company by polling employees. He says: “If you go to a start-up you won’t ask this question as to why we entered the category.”

But the company has followed an interesting approach similar to a start-up's in identifying this new category rather than making it a top-down decision. The process by which in-house ideas are generated is called “Ignite” wherein employees across the board are asked to dream of new categories that the company can enter with justification. Then, a jury comprising insiders and outsiders scrutinized each of these categories and zeroed in on “occasion-wear saris” as a new category.

Choosing a sari is a complex process and currently this category is largely unorganised with no national player. Explains Bhat: “If you look at the sari business, it is much like the jewelry business and is unorganised. There are many categories where there are no organised players and no scientific way to assess what you are getting. Our research told us that while sari is not the in-thing, women have a longing to wear saris. It is a complex affair to buy a sari. Our research told us that here is a category to be explored and exploded.” Taneira is not a business yet and the company is still experimenting with it but has every intention of excelling at it.

And, Bhat is hands-on when it comes to even the smallest thing about this nascent category. Upon completion of 25 years in the company, women employees of Titan were sent to Taneria to choose a sari. And when they came back, Bhat asked them what kind of a sari they had chosen and all of them had uniformly opted for Bhagalpuri Tussar. He says: “So long as you excel, you create excitement in the company.”",507,0.9490278661251068

""Per boutique we should be able to do a business of Rs 20-30 crore. So for 25 stores we should be able to do Rs 400-600 crore,"" he added.

Bhat said the JV is adequately funded to open 25 stores and is also looking at online presence this year.

""MontBlanc globally is looking at online as an omni-play but online in India will start very soon. It could start by this year. It will be most likely in partnership (with other e-commerce players),"" he said.

The boutiques sell writing instruments, watches, men's accessories and leather goods.

The JV will focus on the metros for retail outlets while online will help it to cater to the non-metro customers.

""Large cities are our primary thrust for stores. We will explore some online because the non-metro customer certainly has an allure of MontBlanc. We are not considering physical stores in non-metros right now.

""Till we have established presence in metros we won't go to the next tier because luxury is still very much a metro phenomenon. People in non-metros want it but providing access would be expensive because per store investment is very high,"" he said.",325,0.1632339060306549

Infosys

Deutsche Bank has maintained a hold rating on the stock with a lower target of Rs 970. The research firm has cut its earnings forecast by 8-9 percent owing to slow growth and a drop in margin. Furthermore, it said that the weak Q4 and guidance are disappointing, but not conservative. The company’s FY18 constant currency guidance implies that it is adding incremental revenue of USD 6-80 million per quarter.

The research firm expected Infosys to deliver 7 percent constant currency revenue growth in FY18 with EPS of Rs 61.4. Moreover, the increased dividend payout does little to mask the frailties in business performance. There could be a further upside based on meaningful improvement in growth outlook and execution.

Jefferies has a buy call on the stock with a lower target price of Rs 1,100 from Rs 1,220. The global research company believes that the IT major’s guidance implies that recovery was still a while away and translates into revenue growth of 6.1-8.1 percent year on year.

Growth could be stable for the firm, but a recovery in growth is not implied in guidance, it said. The downward resetting of EBIT margin band to 23-25 percent is a bigger disappointment, it feels.

Infosys’ payout policy is not a major change and that the buyback will provide support, Jefferies said. On risks, it feels that weakening macro, higher competition and stronger rupee are key risks.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has reiterated its neutral rating on the stock with a lower target of Rs 1,000 from Rs 1,050. It cut FY18/19 earnings per share by 8 percent and believes that the consulting segment is likely to remain a drag on FY18 growth.

The company’s cash return announcement is now a key support at current price amid muted earnings growth in FY18. The USD 2 billion buyback/dividend program implies a further yield of 6 percent in FY18.

Titan

Morgan Stanley has reiterated its overweight call on the stock with an increased target price to Rs 550 from Rs 530. Analysts at the firm remain 11-13 percent above consensus for FY18-19 earnings. It also raised FY17-19 earnings by 4 percent each, incorporating strong Q4 results.

The research firm forecasts FY17 jewellery segment revenue growth of 18 percent against 15 percent. It sees an overall FY17-19 earnings CAGR of 21 percent.

Among key policies, it expects the government to levy a 5% GST on Jewellery.",412,-0.0010902732610702515

Shares of Titan glittered on Dalal Street as investors cheered the company’s positive comments on its performance in the fourth quarter.

Consumer sentiment as well as demand scenario have recovered ""quite significantly"" in the January-March quarter, the Tata group firm said. The company witnessed sales traction during the period across all divisions, including jewellery, watches and eyewear, and is expecting a good year ahead.

""Consumer sentiment as well as demand scenario recovered quite significantly (post demonetisation) by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016-17 and sales were good for all divisions by varying degrees,"" the company said in a filing to the exchanges.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, the company's management also elaborated on cash transactions. Bhaskar Bhat, the company's MD said that the proportion of cash transactions is coming down significantly and government's focus on digitisation and capping of cash transaction will benefit the company, he added. The level of cash transactions were at 40 percent before demonetisation, may now stabilise around 20-25 percent, he said.

The stock has rallied over 38 percent in the past three months and nearly 10 percent in the past one month. The strong momentum continued in the recent past as well, with the scrip posting gains of over 5 percent in the past three days.

At 11:25 hrs, the company’s stock was quoting at Rs 482.45, up Rs 22.05, or 4.79 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week high of Rs 486.50.

Consumer sentiment as well as demand scenario have recovered ""quite significantly"" in the January-March quarter, says Tata group firm Titan.

The company has witnessed sales traction during the period across all divisions, including jewellery, watches and eyewear, and is expecting a good year ahead.

""Consumer sentiment as well as demand scenario recovered quite significantly (post demonetisation) by the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2016-17 and sales were good for all divisions by varying degrees,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.

Control on costs along with strong growth in top line and gross margins will ""enable the company to show a very good growth in bottom line for the quarter and consequently for the year as well"".

Titan, which sells jewellery under the Tanishq brand, reported a strong quarter aided by studded jewellery.

""The division has achieved a new milestone in terms of sales as well as profit. The division had a favourable base this quarter as in the last financial year,"" it added.

In January-March, its jewellery division added 16 new Tanishq stores.

The watch division also hit a home run during the quarter on the back of ""good sales growth in the domestic watches and spares sales"" and added new collections under its various brands.

Its eyewear unit had a ""turnaround in sales"" in the last quarter on account of a revival in sales of the sunglass business. The prescription eyewear business experienced retail growth in excess of 10 percent.

However, in 2016-17, the company closed down 12 Spexx stores, its eyewear retail format. The division added 59 Titan Eye Plus stores during the fiscal.

According to Titan, 2016-17 was an ""exceptional year for the company on many fronts"" although it struggled for growth in the first half due to uncertain consumer sentiment and impact of the jewellery industry strike.

""The second half of the year, however, exceeded expectations on all counts despite the serious regulatory impact in the form of demonetisation,"" it said.",352,0.6553282499313354

In a large, well-lit Kalyan Jewellers store in suburban Mumbai, a salesperson assists a couple pick out designs for their soon-to-be-married daughter. Elsewhere, a lady preens into a mirror, holding up glittering hoops against her ears. A red necktie-wearing salesman looks on intently. Amid the neatly arranged rows of necklaces, bangles, rings and earrings, what Kalyan Jewellers is really selling is trust. “Integrity is everything in the jewellery business,” says TS Kalyanaraman, 70, the founder and CMD of the company. “That was the most important lesson I learnt from my elders.”

Trust isn’t something new to the businessman. Over two decades ago, it’s this reputation that helped Kalyanaraman segue from his family business of textile manufacturing and retailing (set up in 1903) to his current calling. He recalls the overwhelming number of customers who would come to the family store—mostly to shop for weddings—and ask him to sell jewellery that would go with their clothes. If he sold ornaments, they would certainly buy from him, they would tell him. Their confidence inspired Kalyanaraman to open his first store in Thrissur, Kerala, in 1993. Today, Kalyan Jewellers has 82 showrooms in India, and 23 in the Middle East. Revenues stood at Rs 9,834 crore in FY16, up by 15 percent from the previous fiscal and well ahead of the Rs 8,700 crore notched by the country’s biggest listed jeweller, Titan, a Tata group company.

Right from the beginning, Kalyanaraman changed the play in a sector riven by malpractices. He stocked ready-to-wear ornaments at a time when made-to-order was the norm, introduced detailed rate tags and educated customers on how to verify the purity of gold. Even his first store, at 4,000 sq ft, was more than ten times the size of a regular jewellery store at that time. It is this “customer-centric model” that defines Kalyan Jewellers’ leadership position, says Vishal Mahadevia, managing director and co-head, Warburg Pincus India, which picked up an undisclosed minority stake in the jewellery chain for Rs 1,200 crore in 2014, representing the largest such investment in the jewellery industry in India. “They have successfully challenged conventional beliefs and created a strategy that has brought a noticeable shift in industry standards while expanding their geographical footprint,” says Mahadevia.

Kalyanaraman made sure the expansion didn’t come at the cost of quality. He opened his second showroom, also in Kerala, seven years after the first. “My father wanted to be steady with the first showroom before expanding,” says older son Rajesh, 41, who entered the business in 1993 and looks into procurement and finance. Younger son Ramesh, 39, got involved with the business in 1998 and oversees marketing. Kalyan Jewellers went on to open showrooms across South India, and, in 2012, expanded into the western and northern regions of the country, roping in superstar Amitabh Bachchan as brand ambassador.

Over the next three years, the trio is targeting revenues of around Rs 15,000 crore as well as about 170 stores across India and abroad. The figures may sound ambitious, but with trust and professionalism continuing to be their bedrock, the future, clearly, glitters for Kalyan Jewellers.

The company launched its first smartwatch Juxt in January this year.

""After the launch of Juxt, we ran out of stock, and we had to re-introduce it. Then we launched Juxt Pro and that is also doing very well. We are planning to launch quite a few smartwatches. Both (Juxt & Juxt Pro) are under the Titan brand but we will be seeing products coming out across our brands like Fastrack and Sonata,"" Titan Watches and Accessories CEO S Ravi Kant told PTI here.

He maintained smartwatch is an area of focus for Titan and said the new models will be in the below Rs 10,000 range.

""Fastrack smartwatch will command a little premium over a basic Fastrack watch. Similarly, a Sonata smartwatch will be a little more expensive than a Sonata watch, because of the technology involved. Both will have to be sub-Rs 10,000, while these (Juxt and Juxt Pro) cost around Rs 19,000- 20,000 and Rs 22,000,"" he said.

Worldwide smartwatch market size is expected to touch 500 million by 2020, according to analyst firm IDC.

Titan commands over 50 per cent market share in the wrist watch industry, estimated at Rs 6,000 crore. The watch unit contributes under 20 per cent to the company's turnover.

The leading watchmaker has over 600 outlets across its retail formats of World of Titan, Fastrack and Helios, and will be adding another 40-50 stores next year.

Kant said despite subdued sales for watches over the last few years, the category of expensive models in price range of above Rs 4,000-5,000 is growing faster than the other segments at 12-14 per cent.

On the impact of demonetisation on the business, Kant said, ""We had an impact certainly, after the first week, immediately after November 8, in retail and across all channels. Now retail has more or less bounced back.

""We are seeing some impact on the trade cycle because dealers, for them a lot of business is on cash as their customers pay in cash and they in turn pay in cash to their distributors. So, the whole channel is getting a little choked. The trade part hasn't recovered but on retail side a much higher percentage of customers are paying via credit cards."" Meanwhile, Titan today announced it has partnered US- based fashion brand Kenneth Cole to exclusively distribute the latter's watches in India.

""We partnered with Kenneth Cole in June but the formal launch is happening now. It is part of our strategy to bring international brands to India,"" Kant said.

The new product range, which the company terms internally as 'Titan', would have trucks ranging between 6-9 tonnes.

""We will start in India with the product called Titan next year. We will start the products below 9-tonne from India to India and also to the world. That's very very important because now it's the third product,"" Daimler Trucks Asia Head Marc Llistosella told reporters here.

Stuttgart-based Daimler AG is present in India through a 100 per cent subsidiary -- Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV).

The Chennai-based company currently sells medium duty and heavy duty trucks ranging between 9 and 49 tonnes in the country under the brand name BharatBenz.

Besides, the DICV-built FUSO trucks from Oragadam plant near Chennai are exported to markets in South East Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

Llistosella said, since starting operations in India four years ago, the company has so far sold 42,000 units in the country and exported another 7,000 trucks.

Besides, it has produced around 52,000-53,000 truck units till now from the same plant. The company exports its products mostly to Africa, Middle East and South America.

""We are going step by step to some countries in South America like Peru, Chile and Colombia. We are picking some good markets with good size where we can position ourselves exactly where new Fuso needs to be, "" Llistosella said.

On sales network he said :""We have over 100 sales points currently. Now, we have started our third wave of dealerships which are smaller because we need to be in the rural areas, this is where India is growing."" He also said that DICV is one of the biggest solar power producer entity in India.

""Roughly 35 per cent of our energy supply is from solar panels..in two years from now, we will be self-sufficient in energy which is really remarkable,"" Llistosella said.

Daimler has already invested Rs 5,000 crore at the Oragadam plant which is spread over 400 acres.

The company has a production capacity of 36,000 trucks per year from the plant, which can be doubled.

In June this year, it exported 5,000 units, less than three years after the start of overseas shipments in 2013.

DICV and Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation (MFTBC) jointly operate in an organisational union under the umbrella of Daimler Trucks Asia (DTA).

""We believe this (e-commerce) shake-up may intensify further, leading to the emergence of one or two strong companies within each sub-sector,"" said the research report by Kotak Institutional Equities.

A lack of fresh funding as well as stricter focus on profitability by investors is leading to swift business model changes by companies, it said.

Further, the current wave of consolidation among e-commerce players may intensify, leading to fewer, stronger players emerging within each category.

""Low valuations may prompt brick-and-mortar companies to take over some e-commerce rivals, in a bid to make an online presence for themselves like Titan's purchase of Caratlane and Future Retail's purchase of Fabfurnish,"" it said.

Further, recent government regulations clamping down on discounts and dependence on single large vendors may necessitate further changes in strategy and could impact sales growth in the near term, the report added The hyper-valuations seen in successive funding rounds in 2014-15 also seem to be correcting, it said.

Fidelity had marked down its holding in Flipkart by about 40 per cent as of February 2016 (compared to August 2015), implying that the firm's valuation may now be significantly lower than peak valuation of USD 15.2 billion attained in 2015.

Valuation of Rocket Internet's Global Fashion Group (parent company of Jabong) plummeted by about 67 per cent during its last fund raise in April 2016, while Fabfurnish was acquired by Future Group at a substantial discount for USD 3 million, the report noted.

The report also indicated that hyper-local category seems to be the worst-hit among e-commerce players.

With its listed firms adding over USD 100 billion to market capitalisation in the last 15 years, the Tata Group is looking at an increase of nearly USD 250 billion by 2025, including through acquisitions.

The group will not shy away from global buyout activity and will continue to make significant investments in both existing as well as new businesses, including in the digital space to meet its vision 2025 targets.

It is looking to build on the platform set up by its previous Chairman Ratan Tata, who made ‘the difference’ and transformed the group from a largely India-oriented entity into a global multinational.

“At the turn of the century, we had a relatively small market cap of just under USD 8 billion. We have added a 100 billion dollars plus to that in the last 15 years. I am quite confident that this will continue to grow,” Member — Group Executive Council and Brand Custodian, Tata Sons, Mukund Rajan told PTI.

The Tata Group has over 100 independent operating companies out of which 29 are publicly-listed. The listed entities had a combined market capitalisation of about USD 134 billion as on March 31, 2015. It has presence in over 100 countries across six continents. The main listed Tata group companies, include Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Power, Tata Chemicals, Tata Global Beverages, Tata Teleservices, Titan, Tata Communications and Indian Hotels.

2025 vision

When asked about the target M-cap under the group’s 2025 vision, Mr. Rajan said: “Today we are well over USD 100 billion.

By 2025, if we want to be amongst the 25 most valuable companies in the world, the number we would need to hit would be around USD 350 billion.”

As per its 2025 vision, Tata group aims to be amongst “the 25 most admired corporate and employer brands globally, with a market capitalisation comparable to the 25 most valuable companies in the world.” Recollecting how the Tata group has grown, Mr. Rajan said: “In 2000, we were principally an India-based group with 20 percent of our turnover generated outside India. Fast forward 15 years, and we are now substantially a global group with USD 108 billion of turnover, 70 percent of it generated outside of India.”

The group has been growing both in the publicly listed space and also in the unlisted space, he added.

“If you look at the true valuation of Tata enterprises (today) as a group, it would in fact be substantially higher than what the additional USD 100 billion of market cap represents,” he said.

Elaborating on the role played by Tata Sons Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata in transforming the group, Mr. Rajan said: “Where we are today, owes much to the critical strategic choices that Mr Tata made after India started liberalising and opening up its market.” Tata had decided to benchmark the group with the best in the world and “not just confine the group to the domestic market but to become an international player”.

“What was clear to Mr.Tata in the 1990s was unless we were able to hold our own against the best in the world, foreign competition would come into the domestic market and encroach on our market share and business,” he added.

Underlining Tata’s risk-taking ability and strong leadership, Mr. Rajan said: “Very often you say that one man can make the difference. I can confidently assert that for Tatas that one man was Mr. Ratan Tata. If we had not had him as our leader, I do not believe we would be in the position that we are in today.”

With the group taking the acquisition route successfully, such as Tetley, JLR and Corus to expand globally, it will not shy away from such activity again.

“I can’t predict what the future will bring to us but what I can certainly say is that thanks to Mr.Tata we have the courage to make such acquisitions and when opportunities present themselves, we will appropriately deploy our learnings from the past in any future acquisitions,” Mr. Rajan said when asked if there could be as big an acquisition as Corus or JLR by the Tata group again.

Clearly stating the group’s appetite for inorganic route of growth, he said: “We have significant cash on the books of many of our companies. When we contemplate acquisitions, the timing will have to be picked carefully and we will need to pick the right moment in the economic cycle to close those acquisitions.”

Mr. Rajan, however, said apart from acquisitions the group would need to continue to make significant investments in both existing businesses and some of the new businesses, including in the digital space to meet its vision 2025 targets.

“There are new markets that we need to expand our footprint in. Obviously, markets like China will continue to grow in stature and size and we need to correspondingly ensure that our focus in those markets is also enhanced,” he said.

Besides, Mr. Rajan said: “We need to see growth in multiple domains, and multiple markets, including India. India also offers dramatic growth opportunities, and with the kind of projections being made for India, a significant part of our growth will come from this market also.”",881,0.7212236970663071

In 2006, Yogesh Mahansaria was turfed out of the business he had built, Balkrishna Tyres. That’s when PE player Warburg Pincus took him on board to give him a second crack at success. Seven years on, with Alliance, he has come back with a bang. And Warburg is counting its shekels38If you want to be a good steward of the business, you cannot let family come in the way. “I would not let my personal ownership stake get in the way of building a global, world class business.”Deeply religious. Stays opposite Mahalaxmi Temple in Mumbai and visits a temple four times a week. “I thank god for choosing me to be so lucky. And ask that my good luck continues.”Other than tyres, it is watches and pensAround December 2012, there was an unusual buzz in the private equity (PE) industry. Warburg Pincus, one of the world’s largest PE players, was selling its 80 percent stake in Alliance Tire Group (ATG), the world’s sixth largest off-highway tyre manufacturer with revenues of over USD 500 million and profits of around USD 100 million. A company promoted by Yogesh Mahansaria.Yogesh who? Exactly. Not that ATG is any better known. As one PE investor put it: “Off-highway tyres are not on anybody’s radar. It is not the typical consumption story in India; not the typical infrastructure story either.” But interest was high. Blackstone, Advent International, Temasek and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) were among the suitors lining up to make a bid. After almost five months, KKR emerged the winner.In April 2013, KKR bought a 90 percent stake in Alliance at an enterprise value of about USD 650 million. The Mahansaria family kept a minority stake. This was the biggest PE transaction in India since Bain Capital paid about USD 1 billion for 30 percent of Genpact, the business process and technology services provider, in August 2012. Sanjay Nayar, CEO of KKR in India, says “One had heard about Alliance but we didn’t know Yogesh or the company very well. We got involved because Warburg was running a sell-side process. But when we met the management team we realised there was a niche, which ATG had done a terrific job of capitalising on. There is a pretty big opportunity in helping Alliance penetrate that segment further.”According to PE industry sources, Warburg may have reaped almost four times the amount it invested in Alliance. This would make it the firm’s most successful investment after its Bharti Tele-Ventures exit in 2005. Obviously, no one could have predicted this in 2006.If Alliance Tire was another feather in the cap of Warburg, which tops this year’s Forbes Dealmaker 50 list, it was also the vehicle used by Mahansaria for his second coming. Over the last 20 years, Mahansaria has built not one but two large global businesses from scratch. On both occasions, he has made money for his investors without bothering about his own stake in the company.Yogesh Mahansaria’s career hit a low in 2006, when he made an unceremonious exit from Balkrishna Industries (BKT). Seven years on, it is still a sensitive subject. Broach the topic and he winces.“That’s a personal issue I would not like to comment on,” he says. We try again, rephrasing the question. Was the family settlement amicable? There is silence. Mahansaria searches for words but with little success. What he does not deny is the sense of something left half-done. “When I exited the company, there was the feeling that my journey was only half complete. There was a lot more to be done which, due to circumstances, we could not do. Obviously, after such a long tenure, when one leaves, there is always a little bit of…” he tails off, leaving it to you to imagine what he felt when he got turfed out of BKT as part of a family understanding.The attachment is obvious. In 1993, Mahansaria was just 18 when he entered BKT, then a loss-making company manufacturing two-wheeler tyres that nobody wanted. He formulated a gameplan that, over the next decade and more, took BKT global with revenues of Rs 632 crore and profit of Rs 70 crore. And this was the company he had to bid farewell to because someone else had a claim to the throne.On July 8, 2006, Mahansaria resigned from his position as executive director of BKT, India’s largest off-highway tyre manufacturing company. His father, Ashok Mahansaria, also stepped down from his position as the company’s vice-chairman and managing director. The duo had put in 12 and 30 years, respectively, at BKT. But they were minority shareholders with a stake of 5.4 percent. The Poddar family, also owners of the Siyaram Group, were the majority shareholders and wanted the Mahansarias out of the way. Arvind Poddar and his son, Rajiv, wanted to take over. The Mahansarias resisted, but they had neither say nor stake. So they walked.In the process, they set the stage for a bigger comeback.If there was ever a list of non-sexy businesses in the world, manufacturing off-highway tyres would certainly figure somewhere near the top. Mahansaria says he doesn’t mind that as long as there’s money to be made. The way he looks at it, there’s a billion-dollar opportunity in off-highway tyres, and he’s only halfway there.Off-highway tyres are a USD 9 billion industry globally, about 10 percent of the global tyre market. These tyres are big—from two to 10 feet high—and heavy, ranging from 15 kg to 1,000 kg per tyre. Manufacturing is labour-intensive. Companies need to have a huge number of stock keeping units (SKUs, or the number of size variations in the same basic product). Alliance, for instance, has more than 2,000 SKUs. Compare that to a passenger tyre where, with just one SKU, companies can churn out a million units. This industry comprises several verticals: Tyres for agricultural, construction, forestry, mining, ports and aviation equipment. ATG operates in three of these, agriculture, construction and forestry.__PAGEBREAK__Take agriculture. The world’s population is growing. The land area available for agriculture is shrinking. Productivity needs to increase. Which can only happen through more farm mechanisation. And, as Mahansaria puts it, “more machines mean more tyres.” A similar story is unfolding in the construction industry. If you look beyond business cycles, the infrastructure needs of countries like India, Russia and Brazil, among others, are only growing.Further, very few people in the world are interested in making off-highway tyres. The Bridgestones and Michelins of the world prefer to focus on passenger, commercial and mining tyres. “In the last five years, the market share of the big players has dropped from close to 50 to 35 percent. And because this is a low-volume, high-SKU business, no Chinese players are interested. So this is a great opportunity for companies like Alliance and BKT,” says a mutual fund manager who has invested in BKT but does not want to be quoted.Even if the industry’s compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) is of just 2-3 percent, for a USD 9 billion industry that means a USD 160 million incremental market every year. Take a five-year compounding and that’s another billion dollars. Mansaria says, “So if Michelin, Bridgestone and Goodyear are not increasing their capacity, it is a big addressable market for us. In five years, the incremental market opportunity is twice my current revenues.” And that’s his destination: Alliance as the largest off-highway tyre manufacturer in the world.Ironically, none of this ambition or wisdom would have dawned on him if he hadn’t joined BKT in the first place.At 5’7, Mahansaria looks every bit the Marwari he is. Born and brought up in Bombay (Mahansaria never says ‘Mumbai’), he was a bright kid in school but his academic performance at Sydenham College was unflattering. “I completed [a Bachelor of Commerce degree] with a lot of persuasion from my parents. I don’t even know what my marks were. I joined the family business while I was studying.”BKT had a small plant in Aurangabad which made scooter and motorcycle tyres. “I spent three years [while still in college] there, learning about tyre production, machines, technology and all the things that go into the production process.”Business, though, wasn’t doing all that well. BKT’s turnover was around Rs 40 crore in the early 1990s, but it was barely profitable. Things turned for the worse, though, when tyres went into an over-supply scenario. BKT didn’t have the size or the money to compete with the larger companies like MRF. “That was when the family was thinking about what to do. We had lost money for 10 years.”There was a glimmer of hope after the government announced tax incentives and duty waivers: Mahansaria was asked to travel and scout for export potential. “Pretty soon I figured out that nobody wanted scooter tyres from India… because there were very few scooters outside of the country.” What the world wanted, instead, was small, farm tyres. As long as it was tyres they wanted, Mahansaria says, it felt like a good opportunity.BKT’s 1995 foray into farm tyres started with a small project for a customer in the UK and for another in the US. “We were lucky we had people willing to take that punt on us. We were able to deliver to their satisfaction but it is not like the floodgates opened immediately.”Then tragedy struck, in 2000, when Mahansaria’s uncle, Pramod Poddar, the then-CEO of the company, passed away in an air crash. Mahansaria was just 25 at the time. He had to run the business himself for a while. He had his first brush with strategic choice when he discovered that the money earned from exports was being lost in serving the domestic market for two-wheeler tyres. “I realised we were too small as a company to ride two horses at the same time. We took the decision to close the business. It was challenging, dealing with customers who had been with you for a long time and to let go of people.Those weren’t easy decisions but I think it was the right path for the company.”The strategy paid off handsomely. “It took us five years to go from zero to USD 10 million and another five years to go from USD 10 million to USD 120 million.” And in less than 10 years BKT went from the smallest and most inconsequential to the largest and most profitable business within the Siyaram group. This didn’t escape the attention of its founders, the Poddar family; and the next generation was keen and ready to take control. A family member told Forbes India on the condition of anonymity that Mahansaria’s departure was anything but amicable: “He was basically asked to go. We were in our teens then, and I remember the elders saying that what was happening was not right. But there are certain decisions that have to be made.”Mahansaria himself says only this: “The family was expanding and other members were coming into business. Everyone had their own aspirations. My father and I thought it was the right time for us to move on.”After BKT, Mahansaria says he was clear about just two things. One, he wanted to build a large, global business. Two, he would prefer to build tyres. The question was, how?__PAGEBREAK__Just as the Mahansarias were moving out of BKT, Warburg Pincus reached out to them.Vishal Mahadevia, co-head along with Niten Malhan at Warburg Pincus, India, says, “As a firm we have known Yogesh, and we followed him as he built BKT. We couldn’t do anything with him then for a number of reasons. Once he quit BKT, we had a chance to sit with him and his dad.”In Mahansaria, Malhan and Mahadevia found a man absolutely clear that he wanted to build a scale business, preferably in off-highway tyres. Unlike other entrepreneurs, Mahansaria wasn’t worried about ownership or stake. As Malhan says, “He understood that to [build a scale business], the capital could not come only from him. There is often a case for not-strapping, starting up and, over time, getting there, but in his case he said, ‘Look, I see an opportunity, and it is not going to be there forever because someone will fill it; if I can accelerate that process through accessing capital, it can help getting there more quickly.’”Both Warburg Pincus and Mahansaria needed a platform on which to build. That opportunity presented itself when a rich man in Israel found himself in trouble.The year 2006 was a tough one for Eliezer Fishman, the owner of Fishman Holdings and one of the richest men in Israel, with investments in real estate, media and a tyre company called Alliance Tire. In May 2006, he suffered losses of about USD 400 million when the Turkish lira plunged 20 percent and forced him to sell many of his assets. Alliance, listed on the Tel Aviv stock exchange and the only off-highway tyre company in Israel, was on the block. It had made a loss of USD 7 million that year. Its business model, though, was similar to what BKT had evolved to under Mahansaria: It was an offshore producer, specialising in agriculture tyres and exporting to Europe and the US. The only difference, though, was that while India has remained low-cost, Israel over a period of time went from low to high-cost.“I got to know about the Alliance situation from an industry colleague,” says Mahansaria. “I had known the company over the years, because they were our role model. We realised that buying Alliance and coupling it with a greenfield plant in India de-risked the strategy. In one shot you would get the brand, distribution, the product library, each of which is a significant competitive barrier in this business.”This wasn’t the easiest decision to make. Israel was in the middle of a war with Lebanon and nobody knew what shape it would take.An unexpected saviour appeared in the form of Warren Buffett. In 2006, Berkshire Hathaway paid USD 4 billion to buy an 80 percent stake in Iscar, a metalworking company in Israel. Mahansaria says, “I remember Warburg telling me, ‘Why are you worried? If Warren Buffett can spend billions of dollars buying a company in Israel, you know he has done his homework; the country is not going anywhere.’ To my mind, to have a risk appetite like that when it was just a plan, it is gutsy.”In August 2006, Warburg Pincus and Mahansaria made a bid for Alliance. The company turned it down saying the offer was too low. They bid again, this time about USD 48 million, plus Alliance’s debt of about USD 100 million. It sailed through but it wasn’t before July 2007 that the deal was finally closed.It came with its fair share of challenges.Mahansaria, who had never made an acquisition before, says the process was a huge learning.The first lesson was patience. Delisting the company and dealing with lenders, because it was a highly leveraged company, was painstakingly long. “It was frustrating because you are sitting in this room, with all these lawyers and all the blah, blah, blah going on; it is so non-value-adding. If we had tried to do this on our own without Warburg, then we would have given up in a couple of months because we would have felt it was a waste of time.”The second lesson: How to restructure a business in a foreign country. Mahansaria says that when he first went around the plant in Hadera, Israel, he could see that the people were mostly home-grown talent who weren’t experts. There was no benchmarking of operations against world-class locations. People weren’t forthcoming either. “The first time I walked in the plant, I asked the plant manager about the efficiency at which the plant was running. He said 80-85 percent. It didn’t feel like that to me. I asked for data rather than debate in the absence of it.” That didn’t arrive for almost a month. “I had to literally coax that paper out of them because when they put the data on paper, it was clear that the efficiency was 60-65 percent. That is the biggest challenge we faced there: These were people with a very defensive mindset.”Over the next three years, he replaced a significant chunk of the senior management with experts from Turkey and India. Almost 300 people were asked to go. Manufacturing of high-volume, low-margin products was moved to India, thereby freeing capacity to make only high-margin products.And even as Mahansaria was getting Alliance back on its feet, another opportunity came along in 2008, in the form of GPX International in the US.__PAGEBREAK__In 2007, when Craig A Steinke took over as CEO of GPX International Tire Corporation, a Massachusetts-based tyre manufacturer and importer, he could scarcely have foreseen that in just about two years’ time, his company would be hurtling towards bankruptcy. GPX started life as a scrap and surplus tyre dealer in 1922 but, by 2008, it had grown into a large corporation with a turnover of over USD 500 million.It was then that its journey was interrupted.In late 2007, trade battles between China and the US had intensified. GPX, with a plant in China, found itself in the middle of the dispute.Titan International, one of the largest off-highway tyre manufacturers in the US, filed a petition with the US Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission against GPX, alleging that the company was dumping its products in the US. Eventually, the Commerce Department slapped a 44 percent duty on GPX in 2007. This spelt disaster for the company.In mid-2008, Steinke reached out to Warburg Pincus to check if Alliance would be interested in buying the company. He had worked with Warburg in his earlier assignment, as CEO of Eagle Family Foods Holdings. Warburg checked with Mahansaria if it was worth a meeting. As things turned out, Mahansaria knew of GPX and its founders, the Ganz family. It was a great fit. The Alliance acquisition had already got him into agricultural tyres in Europe; GPX would give them a strong US presence in forestry and construction.A meeting was set up. Mahadevia says, “Niten and I, when we were in New York, met the CEO [Steinke] to get to know him personally, understand his views on the business and his plans. Yogesh set up a meeting separately with the founders at the same time. The whole dialogue was, ‘Here’s what I like, here’s what I don’t like; how can we structure a transaction?’”Even as negotiations were on, the world was hit by the Lehman Brothers crisis in September 2008.Things slowed down; Mahansaria wasn’t sure if he should go ahead with the buy. “I told Warburg, look the world is coming to end, should we be doing something like this right now or should we be focusing on the existing business? They said it was a great opportunity: Let’s just go ahead and do it. We will have some bumps along the way but we will deal with those,” he says. In October 2009, GPX filed for Chapter 11, with Alliance Tire as the stalking-horse bidder for its US operations. (A stalking horse bidder is an initial bid on a bankrupt company’s assets from an interested buyer chosen by the company itself.)However, the bankruptcy court asked GPX to get competitive bids. As fate would have it, Maurice ‘Morry’ Taylor Jr, a former Republican presidential candidate—and, incidentally, CEO of Titan, whose lobbying for anti-dumping duties on GPX led to its bankruptcy—made a bid. On December 8, 2009, Alliance Tire and Titan International arrived at the GPX auction in Boston.Mahadevia says, “We sat in the courtroom with our counsels and the other bidder’s counsels arguing.” The judge finally asked Mahansaria and Taylor to sit side-by-side and start bidding.Mahadevia says that this is the time when a fully aligned partner helps an entrepreneur. “Ultimately, Yogesh has to take the decision to bid X million more and win this because it is strategically important. We had five minutes to decide. Then the judge comes out and says your time is up and we are like come on, just one minute!” In the end, Alliance won the bidding war and acquired GPX for USD 54 million. Of course, Taylor was anything but pleased. He stormed out of the room. “I think they have overspent for what they’re getting, which is good for us since they won’t have much left over to spend on other activities,” Taylor told Tyre Business later in an interview.Mahansaria was happy when the whole episode was over. More importantly, all the pieces had come together: He now had a global company in his preferred business.As far as Warburg was concerned, it had done everything it could to help Mahansaria get to where he wanted. “Basically this was a startup where there was a vision. And we were buying platforms. The first three years of this was, for the lack of a better word, scrambling the egg. We were building the foundation of what would eventually become ATG and, in 2011, we started to see it all come together,” says Mahadevia.Both Warburg and Mahansaria believe the story of Alliance holds an important lesson for entrepreneurs: Build value over shareholding.Mahansaria says that when he quit BKT, there was a choice before him: Build a small company with a majority stake; or go with Warburg and create a large global business.“I have built two businesses. The first time round, my journey was interrupted. I want to take Alliance to where it should be: The world leader in its business. As long as my partners are aligned with that vision, I would not let my personal ownership stake get in the way.”Unlike the high-stepping banker types, PE investors like to stay detached, even blasé. They tend not to celebrate transactions; a quiet little dinner at most. But with the Mahansaria story, perhaps the folks from Warburg will unbend a little and break out a magnum of Champagne?

If the Budget disappoints the market, Nifty may break 5800, says Sudip Bandyopadhyay, MD & CEO, Destimoney Securities. In such an eventuality, he says, the level of 5500-5600 is likely.

Bandyopadhyay helps investors out with their investment queries as part of moneycontrol.com's initiative Know Your Investment.What is a target of Tinplate in six months? Will it cross Rs 55?A: Tinplate is India's largest indigenous producer of tin coated and tin free steel sheets providing packaging solutions to the food processing industry and also caters to other industries like Chemicals, Paints, Electronics and Defense etc. It enjoys around 35% market share in India. The company reported strong performance in Dec quarter with 65% growth in topline & 33% in bottomline. Since you are looking for a short term horizon - I believe that in the short term it might move upto 55 levels but one should keep a strict stop loss.What are your views on Cochin Minerals and Rutile A: CMRL's main product is Synthetic Rutile, which finds application as raw material for the Titanium pigment and titanium sponge/metal industry. Other products are by products. Ferric Chloride has applications as an etching agent and is an effective coagulant for drinking water and effluent treatment. Ferrous Chloride is coagulant for drinking water and effluent treatment. Iron Hydroxide (Cemox) clay used for brick and tile making.During H1FY12, net profit rose by 224% to Rs35.0 crore on 50% higher sales of Rs138.6 crore. OP and NP margin stood at 39.6% and 25.3% Vs 20.4% and 11.7% respectively in H1FY12. H1FY13 EPS works out to Rs44.9 Vs Rs13.8 in H1FY12.”There has been improvement in the global demand for Synthetic Rutile/and Ferric Chloride in the sea water desalination plant in Gulf countries and for Ferrous chloride in sewage treatment plants in African Countries. It exports more than 80% of its production and in the current scenario where the Rupee is weakening against the USD, the company could benefit out of higher Rupee realization. These give strong visibility to revenue going forward. At the CMP of Rs267, the share is trading at a P/E of 3.2x on FY13E and 2.8x on FY14E.What is your call on Titan A: Titan is a good buy for medium / long term. This is fundamentally a very strong company and will continue to deliver excellent results and growth over the next few years.I am new in market and want to invest in currency and gold. So please suggest me should I wait some more time to buy gold or should I start buying now?A: If you are a long term investor, you can start buying gold now. Gold price will keep fluctuating based on multiple factors in the short term. However, in the long run, we believe that there is a secular up trend. But it should also be kept in mind that the return from Gold will not be as spectacular as it was during the last few years. Gold will provide a steady return of 8-12% over the next 12 months.I have 50 shares of L&T at Rs 1690 a share? What should I do, hold or sell?A: L&T is an excellent company. We believe that prospect of L&T is good in medium / long term. India’s infrastructure story will help L&T. Being efficient and well managed provides it with an edge.As soon as the investment cycle starts in India, L&T will be the biggest beneficiary.What is your call L&T Finance A: L&T Finance is a strong candidate for a banking license. However, this expectation is already factored in by the market and this reflects in the price. Considering the parentage and it’s fundamental strength, we believe that L&T Finance is a good hold for medium / long term.What is your call on Madhucon Projects A: India’s GDP growth has clearly slowed down and both infrastructure and capital goods sectors are suffering the most. The pains points are yet to be removed. From the value perspective, the infrastructure companies look attractive. However, we believe that the time for value buying in these sectors haven't yet come. It is better to avoid Madhucon Project in short / medium term.What's your view on JP Associates A: JP Associates is a fundamentally strong company. However, the problem ailing the infrastructure and capital good sectors, may also affect JP Associates. At current levels, JP Associates can be acquired for a medium / long term. However, in the short term, till the economic environment improves, JP Associates may continue to struggle.What your view on TV18 and Mirza International ? Also can you tell me about Shalimar Paints A: TV18 has corrected significantly in the recent past. At current levels, this looks good. Exposure can be taken in TV18.Mirza International has improved performance over the last few quarters. However it is better to stick to established large cap and mid cap stocks.Shalimar Paints is one of the leading paints manufacturing companies of India, reported its financial results for the quarter ended 30th Dec, 2012. The Third quarter witnesses a healthy increase in overall sales as well as profitability of the company. The company’s net profit jumps to Rs.46.90 million against Rs.37.90 million in the corresponding quarter ending of previous year, an increase of 23.75%. Revenue for the quarter increase 14.63 percent.At the current market price of Rs 136, the stock P/E ratio is at 14.87 x FY13E and 12.99 x FY14E respectively. Earnings per share (EPS) of the company for the earnings for FY13E and FY14E is seen at Rs.9.15 and Rs.10.47 respectively. Net Sales and PAT of the company are expected to grow at a CAGR of 16% and 19% over 2011 to 2014E respectively. On the basis of EV/EBITDA, the stock trades at 6.87 x for FY13E and 6.03 x for FY14E. Price to Book Value of the stock is expected to be at 3.18 x and 2.55 x respectively for FY13E and FY14E. We expect that the company surplus scenario is likely to continue for the next years, will keep its growth story in the coming quarters also.IT majors held out during this recent turbulent ride. Should one go ahead n buy or be at sideline and wait for a dip? Also, I bought drowning Tata Steel at Rs 366. Should I wait for a upswing or get out? Please suggest stop-loss, time horizon?A: Large cap IT companies have been performing well inspite of the global turmoil. We believe that TCS and HCL will continue to outperform and deliver good results. Exposure can be taken whenever there is a correction.Regarding small and mid cap, one needs to be extremely careful. While opportunities exist in the market place, performances of these companies are not assured.TATA Steel has probably seen the worst. We expect that performance will improve hereon. Domestic production is increasing as a percentage of overall production. This should significantly help in overall margins. The long term investor can explore entering or remaining invested TATA Steel at current levels.",1167,0.0

Brokerage house CLSA has reiterated its 'sell' recommendations on retail chains Titan Pantaloon Retail and Shoppers Stop , saying the profit margins would be under pressure in the foreseeable future because of sluggish economic growth.According to the brokerage, valuations of the three stocks are expensive because demand is unlikely to pick up any time soon, and market may be expecting too much from the recent approval for foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail sector. Retail shares have rallied between 14-52% over the the past month.Here are 7 reasons why CLSA feels retail shares cannot sustain current valuations.* A strong rebound in retailers' profitability needs to be driven by an acceleration in same store growth.* Past trends suggest that happens in periods of high real GDP growth(8%+); something that is unlikely in the next year.* Same store sales growth has been hovering in low single digits or even negative for leading formats.* Segments like jewellery facing headwinds. Broader indicators of discretionary demand like car and two wheeler sales also subdued.* FDI in retail a broad positive for the sector, support from limited states will cause deals in existing formats to be substantially delayed* Valuations are stretched at 28-39 times FY14(estimated).* Expect September quarter earnings to be tepid for the sector with Shoppers Stop and Pantaloon like to report 43-74% declines in profitability and Titan's earnings growth at 11% on an already soft base.",245,-0.9994404911994934

Motilal Oswal has come out with its earnings forecast report on retail sector for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 (first quarter of FY13).

Brokerage firm expects their retail universe to post 27.9% YoY growth in sales, 33% YoY growth in EBITDA, and 26% YoY growth in PAT, led by strong growth in

Jubilant Foodworks

and

Titan

. However,

Shoppers Stop

is likely to report a modest 5% YoY growth in PAT.

Excerpts from the report

Consumer sentiment remains subdued; QSR leading growth

As in the last few quarters, consumer sentiment remains weak. Apparel sales have been not been exciting post the discount season. Sales remain weak post the weak performance in 4QFY12. Also, home retailing and electronics have failed to show any improvement. Jewelry volumes remained under pressure, as higher gold prices continued to deter buying. Watch sales have been in line with previous quarters. However, growth in Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) remains steady on the back of more store openings and higher pricing.

Overheads remain a drag on cash flows; low offtake post discount season

Sales for apparel retailers remained weak. Retailers had offered aggressive discounts in 4QFY12. Post the discount season, sales have not been exciting. This coupled with committed capex plans will put strain on financials and increase debt in a high interest rate environment. Shoppers Stop is likely to add two more stores during the quarter while Jubilant Foodworks is likely to add ~18 stores. Titan is expanding Fastrack, Eyeplus and Helios at a quick pace.

On-off noise on FDI in multi-brand retail

During the quarter, there was again a buzz on foreign direct investment (FDI) in multibrand retail. A favorable outcome is likely post the Presidential elections scheduled in July 2012. Many states have formed a positive consensus while some are still against FDI. We believe letting in FDI will go a long way in increasing fund flows to the sector and enhancing growth rates.

Cautious view - weak demand and expensive valuations

We remain cautious on the sector in the near term. We believe segments like apparel, home retailing and jewelry will take some time to recover from the slowdown. High gold prices have become an overhang on jewelry sales volumes for Titan. Shoppers Stop will face pressure on profits due to slack demand and sharp increase in overheads, led by higher store openings. Jubilant Foodworks has strong cash flows; we would watch out for same store sales (SSS) growth trends and revenue from the newly opened Dunkin Donuts. We maintain our Neutral rating on Jubilant and Shoppers Stop. Titan has corrected in the recent past - we would watch for jewelry sales volumes.",451,-0.33735225598017377
