Despite growing awareness and a trend towards healthier lifestyles, a vast majority of Indian consumers continue to buy packaged food products that are deemed unhealthy. So much so that this category accounts for a third of total packaged foods revenue.

According to a report by Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI), a global not-for-profit organisation backed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Gates Foundation among others, of 1,901 products currently being sold by top 20 food companies in India, only 24 percent qualify as ""healthier"" products. These firms collectively represent 36 percent of the overall sales in the processed packaged foods sector in India.

ATNI's index methodology assessed companies using 58 indicators across seven categories, providing a comprehensive evaluation. The categories include product profile, governance, accessibility, marketing, workforce nutrition, labelling and policy engagement. In terms of “healthiness” scores among Indian companies, ITC emerged as the leader, followed by Hindustan Unilever, Nestlé India, PepsiCo India and Coca-Cola India.

A 'healthy product' is one that scores 3.5 or more out of 5 on a 'health star rating' model that rewards higher levels of fruits, vegetables and fibre, and penalizes higher sodium, saturated fat, and sugar content.

However, the overall healthiness of companies' products presents a concerning picture. The mean healthiness score was found to be 1.9 stars out of 5.0, consistent with the 2020 figures. Notably, substantial variation exists among companies, with over half (55.6 percent) of all products scoring 1.5 out of 5 stars or below. The report also highlighted that 12 percent of products were eligible for marketing to children, based on the WHO South-East Region criteria.

To conduct this evaluation, the index used the internationally recognised Health Star Rating (HSR) nutrient profiling model, endorsed by various governments. Products scoring 3.5 stars or more out of 5 in the HSR can be confidently promoted as healthier choices in public settings, according to ATNI's findings.

“This India index will serve as a powerful catalyst for driving positive change within the food and beverage industry in India. By focusing on private sector contributions to diet, nutrition and health, the index sheds light on what is working and what is not among the food industry.” said Greg S Garrett, executive director, ATNI.

This insight comes from a deeper dive into the efforts of seven out of the 20 indexed companies currently undertaking transformative journeys, aligning (re)formulation targets with dietary guidelines for sodium, saturated fat, and sugar.

Hindustan Unilever, ITC and PepsiCo India distinguish themselves by establishing targets to decrease salt, sugar and saturated fat in their products. Additionally, Hindustan Unilever and ITC have set goals to boost beneficial ingredients like fruits, vegetables and whole grains in relevant product categories, the report added.

Despite these initiatives, the study brings attention to a notable challenge—the absence of a universally agreed-upon definition of what qualifies as healthy food. Companies, it seems, are left to rely on their own interpretations, which may not align with each other or with internationally-recognised standards. The intricacies of defining and measuring healthiness in food products add a layer of complexity to the industry's journey toward offering healthier options to consumers.",564,0.33727224667867023

Growth will be seen in the consumer industry, however this will be split across a number of players, said Sanjeev Prassad, managing director at Kotak Institutional Equities in a conversation with CNBC-TV18.

“Established consumer brands of FMCG companies will probably not have the same level of dominance in terms of brand and visibility, which they have in the shelf place of the kirana stores currently,” said Prassad. Hence one will see some displacement volumes, if it's split across more number of players, he added.

Consumer companies have been seeing new entrants entering the market due to easing raw material costs. During a period of high inflation, small players often reduce their volumes due to a limited profit margin. In this period, when raw material costs rise, unorganized players often suffer from reduced margins if they avoid passing on the increased costs to customers. Organized players, with stable businesses, can absorb growing costs without immediately affecting customers.

Maximum new entrants are seen in the category like tea and detergent.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL), the market leader, after its Q2FY24 earnings said that with increased competition from regional and local players, the company is witnessing market share loss in the mass end of the segment.

""The number of local players that have come in the market have just increased. In tea, small players' market value has grown 1.4 times that of large players. In detergent, small players' market value has grown 6 times that of large players,"" said Rohit Jawa, Chief Executive Officer of Hindustan Unilever.

HUL has suffered the most downgrades among Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies in the last quarter, behind only Britannia Industries due to a slower-than-expected rural recovery and rising competition in mass portfolios are among the factors bothering analysts.

Consumer goods companies observed a slow recovery in rural demand during the September quarter. While urban markets performed better, rural areas are expected to improve gradually, balancing the overall picture.

Demand in the FMCG market remained subdued in the July-to-September quarter. Volumes in rural markets declined 1 percent on a two-year CAGR basis, while urban volumes increased by 3 percent on a two-year basis.

The demand was weaker than expected, with “limited upward movement, contrary to our and other companies' expectations”, said Ajay Thakur, analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional Equities. “While there was some improvement in Quarter 1, Quarter 2 did not show the anticipated growth, partly due to uneven rainfall. The hope was for better numbers, but challenges persist in the rural sector,” he added.

In a post-earnings call, Varun Berry, Executive Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of Britannia Industries Ltd, noted that the FMCG sector is experiencing a slowdown, which is particularly evident in rural areas. Despite the company’s ongoing efforts to expand into these regions and reach more villages, there has been a noticeable deceleration in the rural economy, he added.

Increasing competition from smaller players

Rohit Jawa, CEO of Hindustan Unilever, noted a surge in the number of local players in the market. In the tea segment, the market value of small players has expanded to 1.4 times that of large players, while in detergents, it has surged to six times that of larger counterparts. Jawa highlighted that during an inflationary cycle with rising raw material prices, regional players tend to withdraw from the market. Conversely, in a deflationary environment, they make a comeback.

“The impact of this heightened competition from regional and local players is evident, affecting larger counterparts. However, it's crucial to note that these smaller entities, largely regional or local, are not significantly eroding market shares.” said Thakur. The personal care segment, which includes toothpaste, hair oils, and other personal care items, has witnessed a modest improvement, outperforming the overall market, he added.

Outlook

Analysts noted that there is optimism, particularly with the upcoming festive season and the harvest, which is expected to contribute to improved rural demand. The focus is on the crucial Q3, which is anticipated to indicate if an upswing is on the anvil. Several companies have a positive outlook for H2 over H1.

For instance, Titan is aiming for mid- to high-teen growth in the jewellery business, with a focus on sustainable and consistent margins, CFO Ashok Sonthalia told CNBC-TV18 on November 6. “…the second half of October has started pretty well for us—our jewellery business and some of the other businesses. So, we are pretty hopeful that we will have a good Quarter 3. Even on the solid base of last year’s Quarter 3, we should be able to deliver some healthy group numbers,” he added.

With retail inflation hitting a four-month low, there’s optimism about aiding the recovery. “The overall decline in inflation is expected to boost consumption. The previous challenges in the rural sector, largely attributed to inflation, may see improvement.” said Preeyam Toila, senior research analyst at Axis Securities. However, the speed and extent of this rural recovery remain to be seen, he added.

HUL highlighted the importance of monitoring uneven monsoons and global commodity volatility. Despite a decline in raw material prices, there may be fluctuation, influenced by the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, it said.

The company also pointed at a resilient consumer trend in urban metros. Numerous premium categories present significant opportunities, it noted.

“The focus in Q3 is projected to be more on urban-led growth, with rural areas showing a gradual improvement, better than Q1 and Q2,” said Toila. The outlook for Q3 suggests urban areas will likely outpace rural areas in terms of growth, he added.",655,0.34721041123072305

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has lost favour with several brokerage firms, suffering the most downgrades among Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies in the last quarter, behind only Britannia Industries. A slower-than-expected rural recovery and rising competition in mass portfolios are among the factors bothering analysts.

Bloomberg data reveals that HUL's buy recommendations decreased from 29 to 26 in the last quarter, while hold calls rose from 13 to 16 during the same period. However, sell recommendations have slightly declined from 3 in the previous quarter to 2 currently.

HUL's volume growth in the July-to-September quarter was at 2 percent. Volumes in rural areas declined 1 percent on a two-year CAGR basis. While rural recovery continued to be weak for many FMCG companies, the consumer leader is in a far worse position. “HUL has to depend on overall demand to return in order to strengthen its rural base,” said Preeyam Toila, equity research analyst at Axis Securities. He added that unlike its peer Nestle India, HUL has already penetrated rural India, leaving limited scope for further expansion to drive growth.

“HUL is likely to see a muted near-term show, given the rural slowdown hurting its volume growth and pricing turning flat-to-negative,” brokerage Emkay Global said in its result update.

The FMCG major missed analyst estimates in the July-to-September quarter. Its net profit increased 3.86 percent YoY to Rs 2,717 crore, while revenue grew marginally by 3.53 percent YoY to Rs 15,027 crore.

Competitive intensity also remains a problem for HUL amid easing raw material costs. HUL is seeing an emergence of small and regional players, mostly in the detergent and tea categories. Small detergent bars players are growing at 6x the rate of larger players. While small players are growing at 1.4x as compared to organised players, said the company in its investor presentation.

“We have argued in the past that in a rising inflationary scenario HUL could grab market from local/ regional players across its portfolio, but with easing of commodity inflation there is a risk of such competition to hit back,” Centrum Institutional Research wrote in its result update.

While HUL’s detergent business is witnessing competition from small players, its skin care business is facing competition from new-age companies such as Mamaearth, said Nitin Gupta, senior research analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services.

Moreover, the company remains watchful on crude prices, geopolitical instability, and the effect of the monsoon on crop output for the next quarter. Crude derivatives account for almost 40 percent to the overall raw material costs of FMCG companies, an increase that will impact margins for HUL.

Many brokerage firms have also cut estimates for the Surf Excel detergent maker. ICICI Securities has reduced its earnings estimates by 2 percent for FY24-25, while Centrum Institutional Research has cut its earnings estimate by 1.7 percent for FY24-25.

India has a huge amount of opportunity in growing consumption and we can see that happening in different tiers of the market, said Rohit Jawa, CEO of Hindustan Unilever during an address at the 19th edition of the India Business Leader Awards jury deliberation.

Jawa expressed his optimistic outlook for India's future, calling it the ""consumption decade"". Highlighting the driving forces behind this growth, he pointed to factors such as digitization, access to information, and aspirations of the consuming class. He said that these factors would lead to a significant rise in the quality of life for many in India, stating, ""All of that hunger to have a better quality of life, all of that is in scale in India.""

Talking about the impressive advancements India has achieved, especially in the growth of its middle class, he pointed out that over the past five years, the middle-class population and those above it have doubled, with expectations of a similar growth trajectory ahead. This expanding middle class plays a significant role in propelling India's economic growth due to their elevated consumption patterns.

Recognising the significance of economic fluctuations, Jawa stressed the need for a more comprehensive outlook. He emphasised that concentrating solely on short-term shifts in inflation or deflation represents just a small fraction of India's overarching trajectory. With a 90-year legacy in India, HUL maintains its confidence in the future. Jawa expressed his belief that the company has witnessed India's business landscape continually improving over the years, and he anticipates that even greater opportunities lie ahead.

In terms of the company's approach to work culture, Jawa emphasised trust and flexibility. He said, ""We judge people by outcome and not the number of hours they put in."" Mental well-being was highlighted as a crucial aspect of a healthy workplace, with extensive support in place for employees. He emphasized that they are open about these discussions and have resources to assist those who might need help.

Summing up their approach, Jawa stated, ""It is having an open culture, trusting our people, driven intrinsically by their own desire to do well, and we are blessed in that sense at Hindustan Unilever.""",380,0.9816493391990662

Geojit's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL), a subsidiary of Unilever PLC, is India’s leading FMCG company. It has over 35 brands across 20 categories, such as soaps, detergents, shampoos, and skin care. HUL reported a revenue growth of 3.6% YoY in Q2FY24, backed by growth across all segments. Gross profit was up 19.2% YoY, owing to a significant fall in raw material cost (down 15.1% YoY). EBITDA rose 9.4% YoY. EBITDA margin expanded ~130bps YoY. Net profit increased 3.9% YoY.

Outlook

HUL reported a resilient performance in Q2FY24. Recovery in volumes and continued improvement in market share will add to the topline. Also fall in input cost prices will aid in expansion of margins. We remain optimistic and reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs. 2,820 based on 54x FY25E adj. EPS.

Consumer staples companies have largely met Street expectations in the current earnings season, though a granular look at the numbers reveals some stress points in the sector.

Companies managements and analysts have been flagging near-term challenges facing the organised FMCG segment for quite some time and many of these concerns are clearly there to see in the September quarter numbers.

India’s largest FMCG firm Hindustan Unilever — considered a proxy for the broader consumer trends in the country — raised a huge red flag at the start of the earnings season after it reported an anaemic volume growth of just 2 percent in the September quarter.

“Volume growth recovery was below expectations due to subdued rural performance and increased competitive intensity from small players in select categories,” analysts at ICICI Securities said.

Also read: HSBC says HUL 'five-year market laggard' now, downgrades to Hold

HUL CEO and MD Rohit Jawa, too, highlighted the rural-urban imbalance in demand recovery.

“Urban and within that modern trade and large packs are leading growth for the FMCG market. On the other hand, rural demand remained subdued, with volumes continuing to decline marginally on a two-year basis,” he said during HUL’s earnings call.

The company’s management also said the full benefit of product price cuts was yet to be reflected, given the high-priced inventory (both channel and household).

The fact that lower product prices are yet to induce customers to consume more partly reflects a tough macro environment, analysts at Jefferies said.

This is not to say the problem is limited to just HUL.

Colgate-Palmolive’s Q2 volumes were flat against analysts’ expectations of mid-single-digit growth.

Nestle India, too, had a weaker-than-expected topline trajectory, with domestic revenue growth slowing to 10 percent YoY compared to 15 percent in the previous quarter and more than 20 percent in Q1 CY2023.

As per Jefferies' calculations, even this 10 percent revenue growth was price-led, with the underlying volume mix at just 3 -4 percent, similar to the previous quarter but weaker than historic trends of high-single digits.

Win Some, Lose Some

They say no good deed goes unpunished. Tweaking this aphorism for the FMCG market — no good news is without some negative consequences.

Take raw material prices.

While the topline growth was muted for FMCG firms across the board, cooling commodity prices led to a hefty jump in their gross margins (280 basis points QoQ for HUL, 180 bps for Nestle and 40 bps for Colgate).

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

But lower raw material costs had an unintended consequence – the re-entry of many smaller and regional brands.

Regional brands have been eating away the market share of the listed players for the some time now. However, the Covid pandemic and subsequent disruptions in the supply chain forced many of these smaller players out of the reckoning.

But with input price inflation declining and many consumers prioritising affordability, the regional brands are giving a tough fight to the industry giants.

“The FMCG market continues to witness heightened competitive intensity. As we spoke during June quarter results, we are seeing the resurgence of small and regional players in select categories and price-points, many of whom had vacated the market during the peak of inflation. For instance, when you look at tea or detergent bars, smaller players are growing significantly ahead of large players,” HUL’s Jawa said.

The price of palm oil, a key ingredient for FMCG products like soap, has fallen more than 33 percent from a year back. Crude oil, a raw material for detergents, is also trading at less than $90 a barrel compared to a high of $112 last year.

The rising competition has fanned another headwind for FMCG players – rising advertising spends.

In a note on HUL, ICICI Securities said while raw material cost pressure continued to decline meaningfully for most of the commodities except milk, coffee and barley, leading to gross margin expanding by 690 bps YoY to 52.7 percent, “these benefits have been re-invested towards higher advertising and promotion spends… due to increased media intensity and to support new product launches.”

HUL’s advertising and promotion (A&P) spends vaulted 65 percent YoY in the September quarter.

Similarly, ITC, too, said that competition from regional players was up as commodity prices eased and it stepped up investments in marketing.

Road Ahead

Managements have exuded confidence that volumes will recover and the domestic FMCG industry has a long runway for growth.

“India’s per capita FMCG consumption when compared to other similar economies is significantly low and within that rural is highly under indexed,” Jawa said.

Penetration levels for many of HUL’s large categories were still very low. Premiumisation would accelerate as India becomes becomes more affluent and more urban. “The more affluent population is expected to double by 2027, naturally their per capita FMCG consumption is much higher at about 1.5 to 2 times compared to the national average,” the HUL chief executive added.

For the near term though, raw material prices will be the key monitorable.

“Uneven rain and rain deficit is expected to impact production of maize, sugar, oilseeds and spices that may have an adverse impact on pricing. Coffee continues to be volatile because of the global supply deficit.

""The weather during the harvest of Indian robusta crop may impact production. Upcoming winter weather may impact wheat production. Healthy milk flush is expected in winter which is expected to keep prices stable,” Nestle India said in its earnings statement.

Companies are also relying on innovative product launches (like millet-based items) and expanding distribution networks to achieve accelerated growth.

But for some players, including the industry bellwether, the road to recovery is expected to be long and tortuous. “We expect HUL to see weak earnings growth in the near term, as volume growth recovery is gradual, price growth comes off, and margin recovery is capped by a ramp-up in ad-spends and higher competition,” Jefferies said.

HSBC has downgraded its rating on Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) to ""Hold"" and reduced the target price from Rs 2,950 to Rs 2,700 per share. HUL has been a five-year market laggard now, in part due to unwinding of a significant past re-rating phase, HSBC said.

HSBC's target price indicates 8.6 percent upside from HUL's last closing price of Rs 2,486 on the NSE. Over the past five years, HUL share price has appreciated by 59 percent while other consumer staple stocks such as Britannia and Nestle have given higher returns.

Its lackluster performance in the second quarter of the year has further contributed to its struggles, and the weakness continues to persist in its portfolio. HSBC sees limited upside potential for HUL unless there is a significant shift towards risk-averse market sentiment.

Why HSBC sees limited upside?

HUL's price-to-earnings ratio jumped from 40x in 2017 to 60x, which is now unwinding. ""Growth has come down and structural margin expansion prospects have waned. Hence, this de-rating phase will persist,"" wrote HSBC analyst Amit Sachdeva.

With increased competition from regional and local players, India's largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company HUL is also witnessing market share loss in the mass end of the segment.

""The number of local players that have come in the market have just increased. In tea, small players' market value has grown 1.4 times that of large players. In detergent, small players' market value has grown 6 times that of large players,"" said Rohit Jawa, Chief Executive Officer of Hindustan Unilever after Q2 FY24 earnings.

To this, chief financial officer Ritesh Tiwari added that they are passing on the benefit of declining raw material costs largely by cutting prices on its packs, rather than increasing grammage.

""Homecare’s growth, which steered HUL’s overall performance until now, has peaked due to a high base and rising competition from local/regional companies and is creating a growth overhang,"" said HSBC.

Meanwhile, foods growth hasn’t been encouraging for many quarters, and beauty and personal care segment has its own challenges, added Amit Sachdeva.

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s Q2FY24 numbers were mixed with revenues and PAT (excluding one-offs) growing by 3% and 7%, y-o-y respectively. OPM improved by 91 bps to 23.8% driving better PAT growth. Volume growth at 2% was a slight miss on expectation. Moderation in inflation, stability in price cuts in key product categories and festive season will help in gradual pick in volume growth. Urban demand remains steady while rural demand is witnessing a slow recovery. Lower input prices would keep gross margin healthy. A large part of savings will be invested in higher ad spends given increased competitive intensity. Impact of global uncertainly needs to be monitored in the near term.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever’s (HUVR) 2QFY24 performance was in line with our volume, sales and PAT estimates. Volumes grew only 2% YoY (est. 3%) as smaller/regional players outperformed larger rivals during the quarter. The rural market delivered a volume decline in two years’ basis. However, we expect rural sentiment to improve during the upcoming festive season as a moderation in inflation should lead to an increase in disposable income. Key factors to watch out for include heightened competition, volatile global commodity prices and the impact of an uneven monsoon on crop output. HUVR has increased its A&P spending to revive volume and bring it back to pre-Covid levels. The management plans to utilize gross margin gains for brand investments and ad spending to drive volume growth.

Outlook

The outlook for HUVR remains balanced as lower commodity costs and a gradual recovery in rural demand could be offset by reduced leverage on pricing and increased competition from smaller players in some categories. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR 3,015.

India's largest FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever (HUL) posted earnings that were in line with expectations for the quarter ended September. The earnings felt the impact of subdued rural consumption, delayed festive season, and increased market rivalry.

On October 19, Hindustan Unilever announced a standalone net profit of Rs 2,717 crore for the June-September period, marking a 3.86 percent rise year-on-year. The company's revenue climbed 3.53 percent to Rs 15,027 crore compared to the previous year.

Volumes growth sputters on increased competition

HUL’s volume slowed to 2 percent, falling short of estimates. Brokerages said that volume growth recovery was below expectations due to subdued rural performance, inflation, and increased competitive intensity from small players in select categories.

“The volume growth in categories such as health food drinks and coffee remains weak due to continued high price inflation,” said Jefferies. However, with moderating raw material prices, the competitive intensity increased, taking the market share away from the FMCG player.

According to segments, home care delivered 3 percent revenue growth as it undertook price cuts in fabric wash and household portfolio. The beauty and personal care segment grew by 4 percent while food and refreshments also grew by 3 percent, impacting modest volume growth in the tea segment which was impacted by consumer downgrading due to higher inflation, said Axis Securities.

Gross margin

Raw material cost pressure continues to decline meaningfully for most of the commodities except milk, coffee and barley. As a result, gross margin expanded by 690 bps YoY to 52.7 percent. “These benefits have been re-invested towards higher A&P spends - 420 bps YoY - at 11.3 percent in 2QFY24 due to increased media intensity and to support new product launches,” said ICICI Securities.

While this might impact near-term margins, analysts expect that this will benefit in the long run as it will help HUL in further market share gains; overall margins are likely to improve gradually and will be led by falling raw material prices.

Outlook

Jefferies said that their view is below consensus on FY24-25E earnings. ""We expect HUL to see weak earnings growth in the near term, as volume growth recovery is gradual, price growth comes off, and margin recovery is capped by a ramp-up in ad-spends and higher competition,"" said the global brokerage, with a 'hold' rating.

On the other hand, Axis Securities said, “We believe HUL’s overall Q2 result was decent and we expect the company’s performance should start seeing improvement as 75 percent of its business continued to gain market share through premiumisation and driving operational efficiency.”

""FMCG demand is likely to continue a gradual recovery with tailwinds from the upcoming festive season, sustained buoyancy of services and Government’s thrust on capex. At the same time, we need to be watchful of volatile global commodity prices as well as the impact of monsoon on crop output and reservoir levels,"" said Rohit Jawa, CEO and Managing Director, HUL.

The rural market delivered a volume decline in two years’ basis. “However, we expect rural sentiment to improve during the upcoming festive season as a moderation in inflation should lead to an increase in disposable income,” said Motilal Oswal.

Competition hits volume growth

Despite the industry seeing an uptick in volume growth, HUL’s volume growth slowed to 2 percent. The management discussed increased challenges with rising competitive intensity, especially on the mass-end, as local players re-enter the markets in tea, laundry, and other segments on moderating RM costs.

“The full benefit of product price cuts has yet to be reflected given high-priced inventory. The volume growth in categories such as health food drinks and coffee remains weak due to continued high price inflation,” said Jefferies, in a report.

Outlook

Most analysts maintained their ‘Hold’ call on the counter. “HUL is likely to see a muted near-term show, given rural slowdown hurting its volume growth and pricing turning flat-to-negative,” noted Emkay Global.

With increased competition from regional and local players, India's largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is witnessing market share loss in the mass end of the segment.

""The number of local players that have come in the market have just increased. In tea, small players' market value has grown 1.4 times that of large players. In detergent, small players' market value has grown 6 times that of large players,"" said Rohit Jawa, Chief Executive Officer of Hindustan Unilever.

In an inflationary cycle, when raw material prices go up, regional players exit the market. But, in a deflationary environment, they make a comeback, he explained.

That said, the company is gaining volume share and value share in over 75 percent and 60 percent of its business, respectively.

Going ahead, the management sees moderating inflation and the government's focus on increasing capex, resulting in more disposable income in the hands of rural India. This can boost rural volumes.

Rural demand in the FMCG market remained subdued in the July-to-September quarter. Volumes in rural declined 1 percent on a two-year CAGR basis, while urban volumes increased by 3 percent on a two-year basis.

Furthermore, HUL said that uneven monsoons and global commodity volatility that should be watched. Though raw material prices have fallen, commentary on their volatility remains in focus on the back of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

India's largest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company Hindustan Unilever is passing on the benefit of declining raw material costs largely by cutting prices on its packs, rather than increasing grammage, said the management on October 19.

For the quarter ended September 2023, HUL reported 4 percent growth in its topline to Rs 15,027 crore. Of this, about 2 percent was underlying volume growth, while pricing growth was more or less flat.

""With raw material prices coming down, we have passed on a large portion of this benefit in terms of price reduction on single packs and multi packs in soaps and laundry. We also have to run consumer promotions. While we have done some grammage recalibration, but that is not too significant,"" Ritesh Tiwari, chief financial officer, Hindustan Unilever said in a post earnings concall.

On the back of these cuts, HUL management also sees price growth to be marginally in negative territory if commodity prices remain where they are. The company's focus remains on driving 'competitive volume growth'.

""There are parts of the portfolio where we have increased prices as well. For instance, coffee and dairy prices have gone up so we too hiked prices in coffee and health food drinks (HFD) portfolio,"" Tiwari added.

To cope with rising raw material costs, largely palm oil, the company had taken several price increases over the past two years. The FMCG market's cumulative price growth over the last three years stands at 25 percent.

""Consumers especially in the rural areas, and even the urban poor, who are income constrained are looking at such high levels of inflation. Looking forward, we have a cautiously optimistic outlook,"" said Rohit Jawa, chief executive officer, HUL.

""FMCG demand is likely to continue a gradual recovery with tailwinds from the upcoming festive season, sustained buoyancy of services and Government’s thrust on capex,"" Jawa added.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is expected to see a mild revenue growth in Q2FY24 as inflation woes limited volume growth in the quarter.

However, the FMCG giant’s net profit is expected to fall as price cuts, royalty payments, and ad spends hit margin expansion. HUL will announce its quarterly result on October 19.

Brokerages estimate that HUL might see a 3-5.5 percent revenue growth year on year (YoY) to around Rs 15,000 crore, supported by a modest volume growth of around 3 percent.

On the other hand, most analysts projected that the consumer goods player will see a declining profit after tax (PAT), down around one percent YoY -- at around Rs 2,500 crore.

The recent price cuts, continued weakness in certain segments and high inflation are to weigh on the company’s bottom line. Additionally, the delayed festive season this year could play a role in the moderation of the expected revenue. Revenue growth will be primarily led by volume growth (low to mid single-digit), which will be driven mainly by price cuts.

Margin projections

HUL is expected to see a gross margin expansion of ~450 basis points (bps) YoY to 50 percent on stable raw material price conditions and moderating input costs. However, EBITDA margin will be flat, rising around just 15 bps quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to 23.5 percent. This is owing to a 45 bps increase in royalty, which will impact the earnings for the full quarter. The higher intensity of advertisement and promotional spends, to around 10.3 percent of sales, will also affect EBITDA margin.

Segment-wise expectations

The home-care segment will see a moderation in growth to 4-6 percent, compared to a growth of 10 percent in Q1, led by price cuts in the FMCG major’s laundry portfolio. The beauty and personal care segment will see a revenue growth of 2 percent, and the continued weakness in the food and refreshments segment will limit the growth to 4 percent YoY.

“We expect high inflation to weigh on demand in the health foods drinks segment (exacerbated by dairy inflation) and consumer downtrading to loose tea. We expect the weakness in volume growth to settle down by Q2/Q3 as channels fully reflect low-price offerings and consumers see the benefits of price cuts,” said Kotak Institutional Equities.Key monitorables

Brokerages and analysts point to several monitorables to watch. The demand outlook between rural and urban areas will be eyed, especially as consumers grapple with inflationary pressures.

The recovery in the personal-care segment will also be closely watched, as will be pricing strategies, product launches, and the sustainability of cost-saving initiatives. The shifting trends in key raw material prices will also be monitored.

“Easing inflation, a strong festive season, higher government spending ahead of the general election, and increased urban remittances will define future growth momentum,” said Axis Securities, discussing the outlook for the FMCG sector as a whole.

One can buy between Rs 3,825 and Rs 3,850; the upside target is expected near Rs 4,100, and the stop-loss would be Rs 3,700 on a daily close basis.

Hindustan Unilever

After making the high of Rs 2,769 in July 2023, it has been making lower tops and lower lows, which resulted in a 11.73 percent cut in price. At the current juncture, the said counter has halted near its support of Rs 2,440–2,450 since the last 12 trading sessions.

Also, there is bullish divergence spotted near the support zone (refer to the chart). A decisive close above Rs 2,500 will lead to fresh long entries, so one can buy only above Rs 2,500 for a target of Rs 2,650 with a stop-loss of Rs 2,425 on a daily close basis.

HDFC Bank

After making the high of Rs 1,670 on September 15, 2023, it has been making lower tops and lower lows, which resulted in a 11 percent cut in price. At the current juncture, the said counter has halted near its support of Rs 1,485–1,500.

Additionally, in the previous session, it made a Bullish Piercing candlestick pattern (possibly can become Bullish Engulfing) near the support zone, followed by bullish divergence near the support zone (refer to the chart), which is looking lucrative.

So, one can buy only above in the range of Rs 1,510–1,530 for a target of Rs 1,600 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,450 on a daily close basis.

Unilever said the Indian market is seeing a lot of aggression from small players in the FMCG sector after raw material prices cooled off forcing its subsidiary Hindustan Unilever (HUL) to focus on volumes and price cuts. The FMCG major shared the observations at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference on September 6.

“The larger players take time to pass on the raw material prices benefits immediately. The smaller players have that bandwidth and capability because they cater only to the small market,” said Preeyam Toila, Senior Research Analyst at Axis Securities.

Analysts also noted that fundamentally, things remain the same. High commodity prices last year challenged smaller businesses due to limited working capital and insufficient inventory. “We're witnessing a trend reversal from last year when these players weakened,” said an analyst requesting anonymity. Now, the trend is stabilising and smaller businesses are regaining their lost market share in this adjustment phase, he added.

During the performance call for the June quarter, Britannia also mentioned that their market share in biscuits remained unchanged as local competitors increased their presence.

“The competition varies by category. For Britannia, numerous local competitors exist, especially in the biscuit sector, unlike HUL,” said Toila. In their Q1 conference call, HUL pointed out competition at the lower end of their product range. While their mass-market products face challenges, their medium and premium ranges remain less affected, he added.

Analysts noted that some consumers prioritizse price over brand. Recently with local brands dropping prices significantly, some consumers might revert to cheaper options after upgrading the previous year.

“While there's always a premium attached to global brands over local ones, if this premium becomes excessively large, consumers might opt for more affordable choices.” said an analyst requesting anonymity. “This doesn't imply a diminished brand loyalty but reflects a reaction to a widened price gap, especially in times of high inflation and budget constraints,” he added.",355,-0.8260791699091593

Advertisement spends of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) Companies amped up in FY23 as compared to FY22, however, advertisement spends as a percentage of revenue has held its ground, showing no stark difference, according to data compiled from Bloomberg.

Advertisement spends as a percentage of revenue were lower in FY23 as high raw material prices in the first half of FY23 restrained FMCG companies from splurging on advertisements. “FMCG companies had reduced advertising spends in FY23 to maintain their EBITDA margin levels,” said Alok Shah, consumer analyst at Ambit Capital. He further said that advertisement spends are under the control of the company and can be altered unlike employee costs, or raw material costs.

Prices of key raw materials like palm oil, wheat, and sugar were up in Q1FY23. According to Incred Research, palm oil prices surged 54 percent year-on-year (YoY), while wheat costs were up 21.5 percent on a YoY basis. Sugar prices increased 6.5 percent YoY in the same period.

Another reason for reduced advertising expenditures was the diminished competitive landscape from local businesses. During periods of rampant inflation, local players often withdraw from the market due to their inability to transfer the burden of soaring raw material costs onto consumers – a move that larger players can effectively execute. “If there is no competition, there is no need for branding and advertising,” said a consumer analyst who wishes to not be named.

In FY23, raw material costs were easing but the demand was weak, so there were hardly any new product launches, said Shah. “There is no use launching new products, when the demand for existing products is stagnant,” he added.

Interestingly, while many were tightening their advertising budgets, Britannia Industries and Godrej Consumer Products chose a different path, cranking up their advertising investments. The secret behind this? Britannia Industries unleashed new products in the second half of the year. The company launched Winkin Cow rich milk shakes and coconut water in Q4FY24. It also launched a new orange flavour in croissants. Britannia Industries’ advertisement spends increased 61 percent in FY23 as compared to FY22.

Godrej Consumer Products Limited increased its advertisement spends after the acquisition of Raymond’s FMCG business. The company’s advertisement spends increased 20 percent in FY23 as compared with FY22.

Has it reached pre-COVID 19 levels?

Advertising spends as a percentage of revenue are near the pre-COVID 19 levels, but have not reached that point.

“As raw material costs are easing, the companies will spend more on advertising going ahead,” said the consumer analyst on condition of anonymity. He also said that the number in FY24 would be greater than FY23.

Hindustan Unilever, Titan, and Asian Paints have fewer buy calls on their stock in August as compared to last month.

Hindustan Unilever had 36 buy calls in July, but this number has reduced to 26 buy calls in August. Brokerages have downgraded Hindustan Unilever stock from a ‘buy’ rating to a ‘hold’ or ‘neutral’ rating.

Prabhudas Lilladher downgraded its rating on Hindustan Unilever to ‘hold’ from ‘accumulate’ before. The downgrade was done factoring in tepid volume growth in the food and refreshment and personal wash segments in the April-to-June quarter.

Also Read: HUL Q1 disappoints on weak demand, volume growth at 3%

The domestic brokerage firm said that HUL’s price cut strategy to compete with local players will diminish in the longer run. This means that the excitement around lower prices will fade away gradually as people get used to the new prices, making it less effective in the long run. Rural markets have, however, started to improve. Prabhudas Lilladher expects erratic weather conditions to increase inflation in daily use items and disrupt Hindustan Unilever’s volume recovery path.

Yes Securities has cut its rating on Hindustan Unilever to ‘neutral’ from ‘add’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 2,890. The brokerage firm sees limited upside on the stock in anticipation of a slower volume growth in coming quarters.

Yes Securities said that even tough rural markets are showing improvement and that demand in rural areas will come back slowly as people are still using the high priced inventory in the market. Resurgence of small players and reducing stock levels in anticipation of further input price cuts will also lead to slower volume growth for Hindustan Unilever.

Titan

Titan had 27 buy calls in July, and now has 23. Phillip Capital has downgraded the stock to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 3,100. Phillip Capital expects increased advertising spends to lower margins further as Titan is investing on above-the-line and below-the-line activities to increase its market share. Above-the-line usually refers to costs above the gross profit, which includes cost of goods sold -- cost of raw materials, wages, other facilities costs which go into producing the goods. Below-the-line expenses include operating expenses, interest and taxes.

Also Read: Titan Q1 results: Net profit falls 4.3% to Rs 756 crore; revenue up 26%, misses estimates

The brokerage firm expects consumer demand to moderate on account of higher gold prices and pent-up demand. The brokerage firm believes that Titan has rich valuations and the stock does not see any meaningful appreciation.

Another brokerage DART has cut its rating for Titan to ‘sell’ with a target price of Rs 2,980 as it believes the stock has become expensive. The brokerage firm said, “Although Titan’s Q1 profitability was lower than estimates, we maintain our FY24-25 Earnings Per Share estimates at Rs 42.5 in FY24 and 48.5 in FY25 as we believe that the profitability going ahead would improve significantly.”

Asian Paints

Asian Paints now have 12 buy calls, down from 15 in July. Axis Securities has cut the rating to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’ earlier and revised the target price to Rs 3,500. The brokerage firm believes the stock has limited upside potential in the near-term as competition from the new entrants is likely to intensify. And this will keep the profitability under check. However, Axis Securities is positive on the long-term prospects of the company.

Also Read: Asian Paints net profit jumps 52% on double‐digit volume growth in Indian decorative business

Prabhudas Lilladher has cut the rating from ‘accumulate’ to ‘hold’ earlier, given the EPS valuations of 53.5x in FY25 and increased competition from Grasim and JSW in coming years. However, the brokerage firm is positive on long-term growth levers for Asian Paints on the back of the company’s increasing market share in decorative paints and high growth in waterproofing and the wood finishes business.

Hindustan Unilever witnessed a soaring top line, fuelled by price growth since the June quarter of last year. As a fresh chapter unfolds, the company's management anticipates a paradigm shift, expecting volumes to drive sales in the upcoming quarters, shedding reliance on price hikes.

“If commodities remain where they are, I do expect our price growth to be either flat, or marginally negative and growth for next couple of quarters will be fully led by volume,” says Ritesh Tiwari, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director of Hindustan Unilever, in its Q1FY24 earnings conference call.

Since the June quarter of the last financial year, Hindustan Unilever’s sales are growing on the back of price growth. Contribution of price growth to the top line was, however, seen declining over the quarters. Here is a chart that shows the trend:

Hindustan Unilever expects sales growth to be led by volumes on the back of easing raw material costs. In Q1FY24, key components like palm oil, mentha oil and coffee exhibited significant price reductions. Palm oil prices dropped 39 percent compared to the same period last year. Mentha oil, essential in soap manufacturing, witnessed a 6 percent year-on-year decline in Q1FY24, while coffee prices dipped by 18 percent over the same period. Sugar prices however increased 3.8 percent year-on-year during the same period but the commodity has eased since Q1FY23.

“Hindustan Unilever is increasing its distribution reach, penetrating in the rural markets, in order to derive volumes for the next few quarters,” says Kaustubh Pawaskar, Director Vice-President of Fundamental Research at Sharekhan. The positive trend in rural demand is visible, with rural volumes increasing by around 3 percent in the June quarter this year, compared to a 10 percent decline in the same period last year.

“Hindustan Unilever’s increased spending on advertisements will bring more volume growth for the company,” says another analyst who wishes to not be named. He further says that in the last one year, Hindustan Unilever was cutting on advertisement spends to minimise costs, but now has a chance to ramp up those spends and gain volumes. The company’s advertising and promotional spends increased 40 basis points on a year-on-year basis and 110 basis points sequentially in Q1FY24.

Pawaskar says the company’s focus on premiumisation would drive volumes for the company in the next few quarters. Hindustan Unilever’s premium portfolio, which makes up almost 33 percent of the total product portfolio, is garnering most of the growth for Hindustan Unilever, and is growing 50 percent faster, the company said in its Q1FY24 conference call.

Hindustan Unilever’s fabric wash portfolio grew in double-digits on the back of premium products like ‘comfort’- fabric softener. The skin care and cosmetics portfolio also grew on the back of premium products during the quarter.

Hindustan Unilever's strategic approach, involving increased investments in advertising and promotions, expansion into untapped markets, and a focus on premium products, is poised to drive significant volume growth.

Hindustan Unilever's tea volumes fell marginally in the April-to-June quarter, and now, a resurgence of small and unorganised players in the tea industry delivers a fresh blow, which might further dent the company’s tea volumes.

Hindustan Unilever, a market leader in the Indian tea industry, is seeing many small and unorganised players entering the tea powder business after tea leaf prices have started easing in the country. The company in its investor presentation for the April-to-June quarter said small players in the tea powder segment have increased 1.6 times during the quarter.

Will the unorganised players hurt Hindustan Unilever’s tea volumes? Here’s what analysts Moneycontrol spoke to said:

“The emergence of small and unorganised players in the tea business will increase the competition for Hindustan Unilever however its impact on the company’s volumes will be lower,” said Abhijeet Kundu, senior vice-president at Antique Stock Broking.

There would be pressures on the company’s tea volumes in the July-to-September quarter, however it won’t be much as Hindustan Unilever has more business towards the premium end of the tea segment, said another analyst on the condition of anonymity. Taj Mahal and Brooke Bond Taaza are the products towards the premium end.

Kundu said that if competition in the tea powder business between unorganised players and Hindustan Unilever intensifies, the company will take price cuts or increase grammage or start giving promotions and offers to drive volumes and to match the price that unorganised players are offering.

Hindustan Unilever’s tea business showed a modest growth in the April-to-June quarter. In the January-to-March quarter the company’s tea business declined marginally in value. The lower growth in tea business was on account of consumers downgrading tea due to inflation differential between premium and loose tea, said the company in its QIFY24 investor presentation. People move to loose tea powder or unbranded tea powder in times of inflation as the commodity is still discretionary for Indians, said analysts.

Why are unorganised players in tea segment increasing?

“During period of high inflation, small players often reduce their volumes due to a limited profit margin,” said Alok Shah, vice-president at Ambit Capital. During high inflation, when raw material costs like tea leaves rise, unorganized players often suffer from reduced margins if they avoid passing on the increased costs to customers. Organized players, with stable businesses, can absorb growing costs without immediately affecting customers. However, when prices ease, more unorganized players enter the market due to the improved profitability conditions. More unorganised players have entered the tea segment only, because tea powder has a huge market in India and is available in every nook and corner, said Shah.

Inflation rate in India was increasing post the Russia-Ukraine war, where it went from 6.04 percent in February 2022 to 7.41 percent in September, after which it started easing. Hindustan Unilever in its Q4FY23 investor presentation had said that tea leaf prices fell by 1 percent in the January-to-March quarter year-on-year.

Analysts pointed out that the entry of unorganized players into the tea market during low inflation is a regular occurrence, but it has recently happened after a prolonged interval in the tea segment in India.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUVR)’s 1QFY24 performance fell slightly short of our expectations. During the quarter, volumes grew 3% YoY vs. expectation of 7% growth, as higher inflation is adversely impacting consumer spending. In 1QFY24, rural market delivered volume growth. While we expect this momentum to continue; however weather patterns remain a critical factor to monitor. The company is normalizing A&P spends to revive volume and bring it back to pre-COVID levels, which represents 9.8% of sales. Management mentioned about funnelling the gross margin expansion towards adspends to drive volume growth. However, the 120bp YoY increase in ‘other expenses’ is due to a step-up in investments, the impact of new royalty incentives, and favorable benefits in the base quarter.

Outlook

The outlook for HUVR remains balanced with lower commodity costs and gradual recovery in rural demand offset by reduced leverage on pricing and increased competition from smaller players in some categories. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR 3,100.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We cut our FY24/25 EPS by 5.3%/4.8% and rating to HOLD factoring in 1) tepid volume growth in 1Q in F&R and Personal wash 2) waning impact of pricing as HUL cuts prices to ward off competition from local/regional players and 3) higher tax rates (26% v/s 24.5% earlier). Although 73% of sales (HPC) are growing volumes in mid-single digits, market dynamics & trade and consumer inventory will enable gradual increase in volume growth. Although rural markets appear to have bottomed out, erratic weather conditions can increase inflation in daily use items and impact volume recovery. Although long term growth story led by lower penetration and superior value proposition remains, near term pressure on growth can’t be ruled out. We expect GM/EBITDAM improvement of 460/100bps over FY23-25 as benefits of lower RM will be partly neutralized by higher ad spends, royalty and lower operating income due to closure of marketing agreement with GSK Asia (Eno, Iodex, Crocin and Sensodyne) post Oct23.



Outlook

We estimate 8.7% Sales and 9.3% PAT CAGR over FY23-25 and assign a DCF based target price of Rs2775 (Rs2825 earlier). HUVR trades at 53.1xFY25 EPS. Downgrade to Hold.

HUL’s revenue growth of 6% YoY was below our expectations (HSIE: 9%), as inventory de-stocking by trade (1-3 days) in anticipation of price cuts led to a 3% volume growth (2% four-year CAGR, HSIE 6%). Home care & BPC saw midsingle-digit volume growth while F&R volumes were flat. Benefits of GM expansion (+255bps YoY) were largely offset by (1) higher A&P spends; (2) capability building (restructuring in HFD portfolio); and (3) an increase in royalty rate which limited EBITDAM expansion to 55bps. In the near term, in a stable commodity scenario, growth will largely be volume led with pricing remaining flattish to slightly negative. With the resurgence of small players given softening RM inflation, HUL will continue to focus on (1) rebalancing price and volume growth; (2) building back gross margins; (3) stepping up A&P investments; and (4) defending market share. We model a gradual recovery in demand given the 2-3 quarter lag seen between price cuts and demand upticks.



Outlook

We cut our FY24 estimates by 2% to reflect near-term pressure. We value the stock on 47x P/E on Jun-25E EPS to derive a TP of INR 2,550. Maintain REDUCE .

Hindustan Unilever posted an 8 percent increase in its standalone net profit to Rs 2472 crore in the April to June quarter as compared with the same period a year ago. However, the net profit numbers missed average analyst estimates by 4 percent. Total revenue of the company increased 6.4 percent to Rs 15,333 crore year-on-year in Q1FY24 but missed average analyst estimates by 0.9 percent.

The stock was down 2.8 percent at Rs 2647.20 at 9.16 am on the NSE.

Jefferies has downgraded the stock to a hold rating. The target price is cut to Rs 2700 from Rs 2875. The brokerage firm said that volumes were at a five-quarter low as food segment sales remained weak in Q1FY24. It further said that volume growth will be gradual for HUL, and outlook is cautious as recovery will take time due to macro-headwinds.

Morgan Stanley maintained an equal-weight rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2408. The brokerage firm said that HUL faces headwinds from weak volume growth, lower pricing strategy, and media investments. The firm further said that there would be gradual recovery in consumer demand over the next two-to-three quarters.

HSBC has a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 2950. The brokerage firm said that Q1FY24 volumes were low on account of channel destocking and expanding advertising and promotional spends.

JP Morgan has an overweight call on the stock with a target price of Rs 2850. The brokerage firm said that HUL is positive on quarter-on-quarter improving trends.

Revenues from the homecare division grew the most at 10 percent year-on-year in the April to June quarter. Beauty and Personal care segment revenue grew by 4.4 percent year-on-year in Q1FY24.

In a fast-paced changing market such as India, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) needs to evolve with the emerging trends, the FMCG major's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Managing Editor Rohit Jawa said in the post-earnings press conference on July 20.

Talking about changing markets, he said: “we should be ahead of the curve, rather than behind the curve”. Jawa added that it will depend on how fast HUL is responding to the changes — channel changes, portfolio changes. Speaking about strategies, Jawa said that successful strategies should not change with every leader, rather they must try to widen the opportunities and keep discipline and focus.

Having started his journey here as a trainee, this company holds not just professional significance but also a strong personal connection for him, Jawa said. “I have a sense of obligation, honor and privilege to carry that responsibility forward. I feel very privileged.""

Rohit Jawa took over as Hindustan Unilever's new Managing Director and CEO on June 27, replacing Sanjiv Mehta who retired after serving as the company's head for a decade. Over the years, Jawa has taken on significant roles, including serving as Unilever's chief of transformation.

During his tenure as Chairman of Unilever China, Jawa made the country the third- largest market of Unilever globally. Similarly, his leadership as Chairman of Unilever Philippines elevated the business to one of Unilever's top 10 markets.

Jawa said that the excitement stems from the notion that what is beneficial for India aligns with the core values of Hindustan Unilever, which acts as a driving force for everyone in the organization.

HUL introduced the 'Winning in Many India’s' (WIMI) model, categorizing the country into 15 consumer clusters to gain product development and marketing insights. Additionally, 16 category business teams act as micro-organizations, accelerating innovation implementation. He wants to leave a business that’s stronger, better, sharper for his successor.

Speaking about the Brand HUL, he feels very proud of the people he works with and the value driven culture of the company. The company needs to be more agile and disciplined going forward. “We are a great business, but we have a greater time ahead of us.” he added.",411,0.550306522846222

Hindustan Unilever, on July 20, said that if commodity prices remain where they are, its price growth will be flattish-to-negative in the coming quarters. The company expects topline growth to be purely volume-led in the next 2-3 quarters.

Fast-moving consumer goods companies take price hikes when raw material costs spike. This helped HUL post double-digit sales growth till Q4 FY23.

Now that input costs have tempered down after the sharp surge during the Ukraine-Russia war, HUL has been passing on the benefit to consumers by cutting prices. HUL's pricing actions have mainly come in the personal care and home care portfolio, i.e., soaps and detergents.

For the quarter ended June 2023, HUL reported a standalone net profit of Rs 2,472 crore, up 8 percent year-on-year. Revenue grew 7 percent YoY to Rs 15,333 crore, of which 3 percent was volume growth, and the rest was price-led.

However, the 3 percent volume growth was below Street expectations of 5-6 percent. ""Consumption usually recovers after a lag when we are coming out of tough times. That said, we are laser-focused on volume growth,"" said Rohit Jawa, chief executive officer, and managing director of HUL. Jawa took over as the top boss of India's largest consumer company on June 27.

Breaking down the volume growth in different categories, Ritesh Tiwari, chief financial officer of HUL, explained that home care, as well as BPC (beauty and personal care categories), saw mid-single-digit volume growth. It was the food and refreshment portfolio that dragged down overall volumes. The F&R segment saw near-flat volume growth as consumers downgraded from premium tea to loose tea.

Focus on volumes

To focus on volumes, the company is looking at increasing penetration in categories such as health and well-being, health food drinks (HFD) and masstige. Masstige stands for mass-produced, relatively inexpensive goods that are marketed as luxurious or prestigious.

""It is not that HUL has under-penetration in these categories. The market itself has to be developed first,"" explained Tiwari in a press conference.

To this, Jawa added that HUL is over-indexed on premium products, which contributes one-third of the top line. ""This segment is growing at least 50 percent faster,"" he said.

In the masstige category, HUL scaled up the reach of some Love Beauty and Planet, and Simple. The company took Simple to offline shops as well. Meanwhile, in the HFD category, Boost was taken nationally.

Rural demand

For HUL, rural volume growth finally turned positive in the June quarter, albeit on a soft base. ""Weather-related risks continue and El-Nino's impact on inflation and rural demand has to be monitored. However, increased government capex and growing remittances keeps us positive on rural demand,"" said Tiwari.

To ensure sustainable volume growth in rural markets, HUL continues to play the price-value equation. This comes at a time when small, regional players have re-emerged in select categories like tea and detergent bars.

The bottom line is the company remains positive that volume growth will drive topline in coming quarters as the trade channels gradually de-stock all high-price inventory. As low-price inventory comes on shelves, they expect volumes to increase.

""Competitive volume growth is our goal,"" said Jawa.",544,0.777051055431366

Hindustan Unilever is expected to report a net profit of Rs 2,581 crore on July 20 in its financial results for the April to June quarter.

While the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant is likely to record a 13.6 percent on-year and 5.2 percent on-quarter rise in bottomline for the first quarter of this fiscal, its revenue is pegged at Rs 15,477 crore, with a likely growth of 9.1 percent over the last year and 4.6 percent over the last quarter.

The Earnings Before Income Tax Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) margin for the company is expected to be 23.48 percent in Q1FY24, up 55 basis points year-on-year. However, it is likely to fall marginally by 1 basis point sequentially.

Hindustan Unilever's volumes are estimated to increase 5.3 percent, while the standalone net profit may be around Rs 15,448 crore in Q1FY24, representing an 8.2 percent surge over the last year and 3.7 percent over the last quarter.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects growth to moderate in the homecare and beauty and personal care segments to 12 percent and 8.5 percent because of price cuts taken in the laundry and soaps portfolio, the domestic brokerage firm said in its Q1FY24 preview.

""We expect the ice-cream portfolio to see the impact of unseasonal rains and weak summers, and tea to experience some downgrading,"" said Nuvama Institutional Equities in its Q1FY24 preview.

According to Incred Equities, palm oil costs have fallen by 40 percent year-on-year in the April to June quarter. Palm oil is a key raw material for making soaps. Sugar and wheat prices have increased by 4 percent and 5 percent, respectively.

Rohit Jawa took over as the chief executive officer and managing director of Hindustan Unilever on June 27, replacing Sanjiv Mehta, who had been running the company for almost 10 years.

Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are expected to report moderate revenue growth in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. This is due in part to companies’ cutting prices and in part, to lower rural demand.

Nuvama Wealth expects a 5 percent growth in revenue and 15 percent in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (EBIDTA) for companies under its coverage.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 12 percent revenue growth for ITC, 10.2 percent for Britannia, 7 percent for Dabur and 9.1 percent for Hindustan Unilever (HUL). “We expect Nestle to lead the pack on revenue growth and Britannia or Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. on earnings growth (off a low base),” Kotak Institutional Equities says. Analysts expect Marico Ltd. to have a weaker growth.

In terms of performance, Britannia, Nestle, and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. are expected to do well, while Dabur, ITC, HUL and Bajaj Consumer are predicted to be in the middle tier, Nuvama Research says. Emami and Marico will likely struggle in the first quarter of FY24, the firm adds.

Nuvama’s report says Britannia’s rural performance is expected to help despite an overall weakness for the company, as biscuits have remained more resilient than other segments. For Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. the India business (organic business) is expected to grow by 9.5 percent with a volume growth of 11 percent year-on-year due to negative pricing in soaps.

Nestle is expected to perform better due to strong demand for milk and Infant nutrition. The company’s rural demand is also strong due to expansion in distribution and resilience in the noodles category.

ITC is expected to have a consolidated revenue dip by 4.3 percent year-on-year due to a very high base in wheat in their agriculture business.

Hindustan Unilever’s ice-cream portfolio is expected to see the impact of unseasonal rains and weak summers. The tea business is expected to see a fall. Milk inflation also remains a challenge for the company.

Marico, in its quarterly update of Q1 FY24, says that anticipated pickup in rural demand remained elusive, dampening overall growth prospects. The company is expected to report a revenue dip of 2.3 percent year-on-year on the back of sharp price cuts in Saffola edible oil, Nuvama notes.

Margins and Volume growth

Revenues are expected to be moderate as companies pass on the benefit of lower raw material costs to customers, but margins are set to expand as price cuts in select segments will likely increase prices.

“Easing inflationary pressures would drive gross margin improvement, but ad spends are likely to go up. El Nino is a key risk for the entire sector, but government stimulus programmes in an election year are likely to mitigate the former’s potential fallout,” Nuvama Research says.

Most companies will report healthy EBITDA growth led by gross margin expansion (off a low base). The increase in gross margins is primarily caused by decreasing raw material costs.

The companies under Kotak Institutional Equities are expected to report a 16.9 percent EBIDTA growth. After reaching their highest point in the first half of FY23, the prices of raw materials have been gradually decreasing, although they are still higher than they were before the COVID pandemic.

“The FMCG sector seems well poised in 1HFY24 with a raw material cost tailwind. However, in 2HFY24 we expect revenue growth to be moderate as pricing benefits should fade and growth would have to be volume-led.” said BNP Paribas.

Discretionary

The larger players in the paints industry are expected to experience moderate volume growth, although on a very high base. Indigo Paints is expected to outperform with twice the industry's growth rate. Most paints and adhesives companies are likely to see strong margin expansion, as per Nuvama Research.

The Health & Immunity sector is expected to bounce back and show decent growth after a few quarters of disappointing performances. However, the summer portfolio, which includes beverages, cooling hair oils, ice cream, and talcum powder, is likely to be weak due to unexpected rainfall, the research firm notes.

Demand for Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) continues to be soft but steady due to inflationary pressures. In this segment, Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 7 percent revenue growth led by 4 percent same store sales decline for Jubilant FoodWorks which would imply a marginal deceleration in the growth trajectory.",733,0.04204748492491873

Unilever intends to increase its involvement in the Indian beauty and personal care market. At the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference 2023 held on June 6, the company said that it is focusing its core hair and skin segment towards India, its largest market after the United States.

Speaking at the conference, Graeme Pitkethly, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Unilever, said that nearly 60 percent of Unilever’s business comes from emerging markets. Based on population growth, increased affluence and the potential for market development, India and China are among the company's top priority markets, he added.

“India will be in the next 10-15 years what China has been for our competitors in the last decade or so.” said Fernando Fernandez, President, Beauty and Wellbeing Business Group, Unilever. He added that India is one of the company’s key markets of the future with Unilever’s relative market share in hair and skin care more than four times the size of its closest competitor.

Beauty and personal care accounts for 37 percent of Hindustan Unilever’s (Indian subsidiary of Unilever) revenues. In financial year 2023, the segment grew competitively, at 12 percent, led by a strong, broad-based performance across categories, the company said in its annual report.

The company is focusing to strengthen its core with brands such as Lux curating products according to local needs, thereby gaining market share and increasing penetration. With brands like Lakmé, Dove, Pond’s, and TRESemmé, the company is tapping into emerging demand through innovations such as Dove Hair Fall Therapy, Lakmé Vitamin C, Pond’s Light Hydration, Lakmé Sunscreen, and TRESemmé Pro Pure.

“Around 85 percent of Hindustan Unilever’s portfolio is consistently gaining market share. That is what is giving enthusiasm to a parent company like Unilever to invest more into the Indian market.” said Kaustubh Pawaskar, Deputy Vice President, Fundamental Research. The parent company is not just investing into the market but also creating categories and adding new and innovative products, trying to move up from masses to premium. These strategies will help the FMCG giant to maintain consistent growth, he added.

Opportunities in the Indian market

The Indian market provides a lot of opportunity as hair and skin care product penetration is lower in Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns, where most of the domestic and global consumer goods companies have been focusing. “The beauty and personal care market in India offers unique growth opportunities — it is poised to grow at a CAGR of 11 percent. This market is continuously evolving, driven by changing consumer preferences and digital advancements. While the pandemic may have accelerated certain trends, the overall appeal of the Indian market was already established,” said Aseem Kaushik, Managing Director, L’Oréal India.

The demand for premium products in the segment has also been growing due to digitisation and awareness. The COVID-19 pandemic has made people aware and they are moving towards more healthy options that are free from chemicals.

“Growing internet penetration is making the world a smaller place and making information more accessible for consumers in India. In this context, consumers are being more discernible and want the best product for their needs. To meet this need, one big focus for us has been to grow the category, by driving awareness regarding various benefits consumers can seek and experience.” said a Proctor & Gamble (P&G) spokesperson.

Demand for customized products

The disparity in spending power between rural and urban consumers requires brands to make products that target a certain class. Brands need to tailor their products to suit various socio-economic classes based on their affordability.

“We have got onion-based shampoo for the elite and also henna-based shampoo catering to the masses,” said Abhishek Jugran, Vice President, Marketing, Dabur. The company has different propositions for the urban market, like hot oil treatment and head serums but a very different segment for the mass India.

Growing competition in the market

Global companies will drive in competition for the domestic brands as India becomes a hotspot in the hair and skin segment. Speaking on whether the global brands will overshadow domestic brands, Pawaskar said more players coming into the segment will help the market grow and would not overshadow existing ones. The growth prospects of categories where the penetration is low are bright, he added. “However, categories where penetration is high will take time to grow. There the competition will play a major part.” said Pawaskar.

Domestic companies are also trying to strengthen their global portfolio with Dabur testing out a popular Arabian hot oil treatment in Indian salons. The company will also launch a number of international portfolios in India, said Jugran.

However, international brands will have an edge over domestic companies in the premium segment because consumers of luxury products in India have global exposure, with Nykaa and Ajio, said analysts.

Analysts also noted that the majority of global players will find it difficult to make a difference in the mass end due to pricing. “The basic product in the US is a premium product in India, and a premium product in the US is a luxury product in India. The mass products of India do not exist in the US,” said an analyst, asking to remain anonymous.",920,0.8128661025654186

Gandhar Oil Refinery has received the green light from the Securities Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to float its initial public offering (IPO). The issue constitutes both, fresh shares and an offer-for-sale (OFS).

The company is yet to disclose the price band and the issue date to exchanges. According to the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), the IPO comprises a fresh issue of equity shares worth Rs 357 crore and OFS of 1.2 crore shares by promoters and existing shareholders.

If fortune favours the brave, Hindustan Unilever shareholders who have stayed put must be happy.

For a stock trading at 62 times its trailing earnings, the FMCG giant’s sales have compounded at only 8 percent over the last 10 years. But despite expensive valuations, shareholders who have held on are sitting on 4.5x returns today.

In the past decade, CEO and managing director Sanjiv Mehta steered India’s largest consumer company through several ups and downs. During Mehta’s tenure, the stock appreciated over 300 percent, from Rs 600 levels in October 2013 to Rs 2,600 now.

He led the ‘historic merger’ of GSK Consumer Healthcare with HUL, bringing Horlicks and Boost into its fold.

Torch passes on

On June 26, Mehta retired and passed on the torch to Rohit Jawa.

So today, June 27, marks Day Zero of Jawa’s tenure. When you are at the helm of a behemoth, expectations run high and the margin of error is little. We spoke to market participants to understand the tall tasks that await him.

Bringing back volumes

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has pointed out that higher retail inflation in the country has slowed down personal consumption expenditure, which, in turn, is leading to a moderation in corporate sales. HUL is also a victim of this.

Jawa takes over at a time when rural market volumes are still in the negative. In FY23, overall rural volumes, for the categories in which HUL operates in, declined 7 percent, while in Q4 FY23, the de-growth was ~3 percent.

The El Nino effect hitting rural spend further are also high possibilities, believe most analysts.

According to Nomura, there is some way to go before rural markets can come out of the woods. ""Urban markets will continue to grow faster. While rural market demand is witnessing a better trajectory, it is still not out of the woods and the pace of recovery is gradual. We note the full benefit of the harvest money is yet to be seen, translating into product consumer demand,"" said Nomura.

As price-led top-line growth tapers off, the focus now turns to volumes. While rural slowdown has been a reality, other consumer companies have not seen as sharp a decline, which raises the question of why HUL is lagging its peers, especially smaller contenders.

The outperformers in terms of volume growth in Q4 were Nestle at 7 percent, Britannia at 12 percent and Tata Consumer at 8 percent, whereas HUL clocked 4 percent.

Premiumisation

HUL has managed to move consumers from detergent bars to powder to liquid and now even pods. In order to cater to Gen Z and beyond, the company needs to stay at the forefront of innovation and ramp up R&D spend.

“The disruption is actually happening outside the realm of mainstream companies, from the startup world,” said Dr Vikas V Gupta, smallcase manager and chief investment strategist, OmniScience Capital.

Especially in highly profitable categories like cosmetics and personal products, smaller brands have mushroomed, and are clocking high growth rates.

Emboldened by their online growth, they are also expanding their presence to offline channels. “Pharmacies and local stores are inundated with newer brands. So, the challenge is not only in the digital world, but also in HUL’s main turf,” adds Gupta.

While startups may be caught up in a funding winter, consolidation in that space will embolden the survivors to go for the kill, and the trend will accelerate. To keep up, HUL will have to devise a strategy to counter and orchestrate buy-outs.

The company has already entered the D2C space, with acquisitions of Love, Beauty and Planet, Acne Squad, Find Your Happy Place, Oziva and Wellbeing Nutrition. Experts believe these brands need to be scaled up aggressively to make a mark in the highly disruptive market.

Growth in mature categories

According to BNP Paribas analysts, mature categories like hair oil and oral care have seen only 3-4 percent revenue CAGR over the last 7 years. “To us, this indicates growth challenges as penetration levels increase,” they added. HUL has Indulekha and Pepsodent brands in these categories.

Moreover, HUL already has over 95 percent penetration in some of its categories like detergents. “So distribution-led growth will be a challenge from here on,” believes Shirish Pardeshi of Centrum Broking.

HUL now has 19 brands with a turnover exceeding Rs 1,000 crore per annum. In FY22, this club had 16 members. In fact, Surf Excel became the first home and personal care brand in India to clock over $1 billion annual sales in FY23. As saturation settles in, all eyes are now on how other brands can be scaled up to these levels.

Jawa, who has been credited with transforming Unilever China and Unilever Philippines, surely has a tough task cut out for him. It is also perhaps the most exciting opportunity, as the funding winter may, in due course, present buy-out opportunities that may come handy in gaining presence in new, growing segments.

Jawa will need a multi-pronged approach to move the needle for HUL, and “win in many Indias”. The Street will be eagerly waiting for Jawa to articulate his strategy.",893,-0.253097014767783

Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) Chairman Nitin Paranjpe told the FMCG major’s 90th AGM that the company needs to stay vigilant about the evolving competition with changing consumer needs.

“As a company, we may be leaders but we remain very vigilant because, in the consumer goods industry, we cannot afford to take our eye off the ball,” he said while addressing shareholders’ questions about the competition on June 26. He said that the company can continue to grow well and give good returns even with competition. HUL will continue to focus relentlessly on the consumer and serve them well, he added.

Speaking about the competition, the chairman said that it is intense and the company will keep an eye on it and respond as required in the competitive challenges.

The FMCG giant has been facing competition from Patanjali, Reliance Retail as well as many digital firms. Analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities have noted that the price points for Reliance Retails's soaps, dishwashing bars and detergents were 30-35 percent lower than the market leaders across these categories.

With commodity prices and inflation coming down, in the short-term there is uncertainty and volatility as there is a shift from high inflation, which led the company to take high price rises, Paranjpe mentioned. In the coming months, the balance between volume growth and pricing will undergo change. “We will see less pricing and much more volume growth coming in,” he added.

The chairman said that the world will move towards digital and it will change the companies’ business strategy. Speaking about digital adaptation he mentioned that about 30 percent of Hindustan Unilever’s turnover is captured digitally through applications like ‘Sikhar’ and other B2C applications.

Talking about the FMCG industry, Paranjpe said that the industry is in an attractive position and the company is well placed for the opportunities it will provide. He mentioned that with 50 brands operating in 16 categories Hindustan Unilever is a clear market leader.

""This is not a zero-sum game. The market is large enough for several companies to co-exist. The per capita FMCG consumption is only $50 in India. This number will grow leaps and bounds in coming years,"" he noted.",380,0.5000190138816833

India stands at the focal point for growth globally, said Hindustan Unilever chairman Nitin Paranjpe at the company's 90th annual general meeting. And, HUL stands at the forefront to contribute to this growth.

""In the last decade alone, HUL has added nearly Rs 33,000 crore as incremental turnover and over Rs 9,500 crore as incremental EBITDA, strengthening our belief that sustainable growth is the only way to grow in the future,"" he said in his speech titled 'Transforming to Win in the New India’.

This was Paranjpe’s second AGM after taking over as the chairman of the company. He said the young demographic, rising consumption, digital public infrastructure and favoured investment destination will help the India journey, going ahead.

""The share of the middle class, with an annual income of Rs 5-30 lakh doubled to over 30 percent between 2004-05 and 2021-22, and is projected to double again to over 60 percent by 2047,"" Paranjpe said.

According to Bain and Co, India, already with a booming online shopper base, is all set to overtake the United States in the next couple of years. This means that India has both the infrastructure and the audience to ride the digitisation wave, he added.

To capitalise on this, India needs to address challenges like employability, low contribution of agriculture to GDP and participation of women in the workforce. It is also imperative that the nation decouples its growth from environmental impact, he explained.

Speaking about how HUL leverages data to stay relevant and agile, Paranjpe said, “Through our People Data Centre, we are capturing insights and consumer trends faster. Our ‘Agile Innovation Hub’ is helping us speed up product design, development, and testing, in order to launch innovations faster.""

Till date, the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company has been able to create a collective and cumulative water conservation potential of more than 2.6 trillion litres. To put it into perspective, he said, 2.6 trillion litres of water is equivalent to the drinking water needs of the country for nearly two years.

At the same time, HUL has also generated over 1.7 million tonnes of additional agricultural and biomass production, and created more than 110 million person-days of employment.

As markets flirt with all-time high levels, the Nifty FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) index has also been on a roll.

The index hit its peak of 52,540.50 on June 16 and is now 2 percent below that level. Since March, the index has rallied almost 18 percent. Heavyweights ITC, Hindustan Unilever and Britannia have also gained close to 15 percent. ITC, which commands over 30 percent weightage in the index, has contributed to most of this rally.

But now, technical indicators suggest that the rally is done and dusted. ""At the current juncture, the index has given a bearish divergence pattern in the weekly time frame. Weakness is possible till 48,000 if it fails to hold 50,500. Currently, it has huge resistance around 52,500,"" technical analyst Dinesh Nagpal told Moneycontrol.

On the higher side, the index may fail to sustain above 52,500 levels. ""Many components of the index are in the overbought zone, including Britannia and ITC. Only a decisive move beyond 52,500 will have bullish medium-term implications,"" believes Anuj Dixit, Executive VP- Equity Research, Sovereign Global said.

Not just technical levels, fundamental factors too are not working in favour of the consumer pack. Here's why:

Price growth tapers off

FMCG companies clocked double-digit sales growth in FY23 as they hiked prices to mitigate the rising cost of raw materials, especially palm oil. Volume growth took a backseat as price hikes helped FMCG companies protect their topline.

Now, raw material prices have tapered off. Palm oil prices are down over 20 percent from the highs hit after the Ukraine-Russia war. According to Elara Capital, palm oil comprises 10 percent of HUL's raw material cost, 23 percent of Godrej Consumer's and 16 percent of Britannia.

This means margin comfort is here but price-led benefits will fade. ""The FMCG sector seems well poised in H1 FY24 with raw material cost tailwind. However, in H2 FY24 we expect revenue growth to moderate as pricing benefits should fade and growth would have to be volume-led,"" according to Kunal Vora, Head - India Equity Research.

Moreover, mature categories like hair oil and oral care have seen only 3-4 percent revenue CAGR over the last 7 years.

Can volume growth show the way?

Over the past few years, rural volume growth has remained elusive for FMCG companies. Premiumisation and urban markets have led the way. Going forward, the picture for rural volumes does not look too bright.

""Commentary on rural remains underwhelming, and pick-up

may take time, with El Niño also posing a threat in the short term,"" according to Jefferies.

The FMCG market (urban and rural) registered flat volume growth in the March quarter, as per Nielsen data. In a Q4 earnings concall, Hindustan Unilever's managing director and chief executive officer Sanjiv Mehta said that the overall FMCG market's volume growth should be 4-5 percent while commodity prices remain steady, only then the volatile scenario can turn a corner.

The risk of El Nino

When it comes to the impact of El Nino, surveys conducted by different brokerages suggest different results. For instance, ICICI Securities did an empirical study of 4 decades of monsoon patterns and came to the conclusion that discretionary demand (car and especially tractors) is more linked to rainfall than agri and consumer staples.

According to economists, an intense El Nino that severely disrupts the monsoon could push inflation up by 15-20 basis points by boosting food prices. A slight delay in monsoon has already pushed Kharif sowing by 10 to 15 days, as per Skymet.

In this regard, it is important to monitor the management commentary of FMCG companies after Q1 FY24 earnings.

HDFC Securities' research report on Hindustan Unilever

Our interaction with HUL management reinforced our thesis that demand pickup will be more gradual than margin recovery. The FMCG industry continues to witness MoM improvement, led by urban markets with rural sustaining its gradual recovery trend. With HUL initiating price cuts to adjust for a softening commodity basket, value growth will continue to tail off, thereby reducing the divergence between volume and value growth. Moreover, with a 1-3 quarter lag usually seen between price cuts and demand upticks, we expect volume recovery to be back-ended. In price cuts, with retailers are also lowering the inventory levels, primary growth will lag secondary growth in the near term. With falling RM inflation, regional and unorganised players are becoming competitive (vs. last two years). Inadequate pricing action (18% vs 30% cost inflation) negatively impacted GM (-600bps last two years); HUL has already recouped 300bps of the gross margin. The incremental expansion will be slower as the company is also passing off benefits to consumers. Moreover, A&P spending will also see a stepping-up in FY24.

Outlook

We maintain our EPS estimate for FY24/25. We value HUL at 47x P/E on Mar-25 EPS to arrive at a TP of INR 2,450. Maintain REDUCE.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR remains confident about its ability to achieve Consistent, Competitive, Profitable, and Responsible (4G) growth while maintaining double-digit EPS growth. The recent increase in royalty and central service fees has not affected its commitment to invest in business growth and its ability to deliver growth in revenue and profit. HUVR has consistently reinforced the fundamental factors that have contributed to its success in India. They include (a) embracing technology to gather valuable data and enable informed decision-making, (b) adopting the ‘Winning in Many Indias’ (WiMI) strategy that emphasizes decentralization and tailored approaches, (c) identifying emerging trends and proactively investing in them, (d) reinvesting cost savings into the business, and (e) showcasing exceptional execution capabilities that have resulted in a consistent earnings growth. We also believe that HUVR is the best prepared among peers in terms of technology and e-commerce strategy to deal with potentially significant disruptions going forward. HUVR’s performance has been even more impressive in the last 3/5 years, with an EBITDA CAGR of 12.4%/13.4% and a PAT CAGR of 14.1/13.6%.



Outlook

With the expectation of a normal monsoon, a gradual recovery in rural areas, and a reduction in commodity costs, HUVR is expected to regain its mid-to-high teens earnings growth trajectory it exhibited for the four years before Covid. We maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a TP of INR3,100.

Ye dil maange more - That's what foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are saying to Pepsi bottler Varun Beverages. They don't want Pepsi; they want the shares. From 19.82 percent in March 2020, FII stake in this consumer stock increased to 26 percent by the end of March 2023.

According to a Moneycontrol analysis of the top 10 consumer companies by market capitalisation, FIIs have increased stakes in seven. The biggest jump has come in Varun Beverages, Britannia, and Tata Consumer Products.

For Varun Beverages, the optimism largely comes from the company expanding its high-margin businesses. One example is Sting. The energy drink Sting has been positioned at a favourable price point, attracting the masses.

Due to the higher mix of Sting, the company's net realisation per case came in at Rs 174 for Q1 CY23, up 10 percent year-on-year (YoY). Sting, along with other energy drinks, will soon be 15 percent of the portfolio, said Chairman Ravi Jaipuria in the latest earnings concall.

""VBL has seen 15 percent organic volume growth in the last three years, led by distribution expansion in underpenetrated territories and new launches (Sting, milk-based beverages, etc.),"" according to ICICI Securities.

For Britannia, FIIs seem to have taken heart from the fact that the Good-Day biscuit maker managed to defend its margins during the pandemic. While the operating margins of most FMCG companies slumped due to high raw material prices, Britannia's remained consistent at 16-17 percent over the past three years.

Morgan Stanley, which has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 5,300, said Britannia's March quarter beat on estimates was entirely margin-led. The management’s focus is to build for the next 100 years, unlike investors who may overemphasise short-term margins, it added.

Moreover, consumer preference is towards large, trusted, and organised brands in times of hyperinflation.

""Investors with long-term bias and patience are likely to be rewarded as formalisation will be more visible in the food space, given a higher share of the unorganised sector, who are themselves grappling with supply chain challenges,"" according to analysts at Philip Capital.

Tata Consumer Products, too, saw a jump in FII stake over the past three years ― from 18.15 percent in March 2020 to 25.04 percent in March 2023. During this period, the stock gained over 150 percent.

While the company's international coffee business was reeling under inflationary pressure, its India food business held fort. The India business has a higher margin, especially the branded business at around 14 per cent and international business at 11 per cent.

Recently, the company's Chairman N Chandrasekaran said that they are open to acquisitions and expanding into new categories. ""India’s business growth would continue to outpace that of the international market, with the percentage of revenue from the Indian market expected to increase,"" he said.

What about ITC?

FII stake in retail favourite ITC has remained steady at about 14 percent, despite the 150 percent rally in the stock price over the past three years. While the company is firing on all cylinders ― cigarettes, FMCG, and hotels, the perception of a 'sin stock' is hard to shake off. That said, FIIs' stake in the company is at a historically high level.

Nifty FMCG was under pressure on June 8 afternoon after RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das flagged uncertainty about the impact of El Nino in the bi-monthly Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting.

At 12.13 pm, the index was down 0.8 percent at 51,199.

""Uncertainties, however, remain on the spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon and on the interplay between El Nino and the Indian Ocean dipole,"" Das said as he share the growth and inflation outlook.

Das talked about uncertainty over the prices of sugar, rice and crude oil, which are the major commodities used in FMCG products, as he said that RBI won't no take its eyes off the inflation trajectory.

El Nino, or the little boy in Spanish, is marked by warmer ocean temperatures across the Pacific, which have a bearing on weather patterns around the world. It has often been linked to lower monsoon rains in India, hurting agricultural production that push up food prices as well as create further pressure on rural consumers.

For an FMCG company, around 30-40 percent of the revenue is derived from rural markets, as per analysts’ calculations. Rural demand has been weak for FMCG companies for some time now.

“Commentary on rural remains underwhelming, and pickup may take time, with El Niño also posing threat in the short term,"" Jefferies recently said in a review note on fourth quarter earnings.

Rural demand in Q4 was weak for Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Dabur, Marico, Tata Consumer Products Limited and Colgate, Jefferies said. Rural demand across FMCG companies lagged on account of high inflation in the country.

""When wallet size is small, the impact of inflation is big,” Sanjiv Mehta, CEO and managing director, HUL, said after reporting its fourth quarter earnings. While HUL outpaced industry growth with a 4 percent increase in overall volumes, its rural volumes continued to remain under pressure, declining close to 3 percent in Q4.

Hindustan Unilever’s execution, product superiority and digital investments are yielding better-than-industry growth and widening its lead against peers, brokerage and research house Nomura said on June 7.

The firm has set HUL's target price at Rs 3,025, betting on a 15 percent earnings per share CAGR over FY23-25F.

""Home-care category growth is likely to remain strong on the back of buoyant urban market demand; and, the price cuts/grammage increases in its laundry portfolio will likely aid in improving volumes in Q1 FY24,"" Nomura's analysts Mihir Shah and Anshuman Singh said.

They have pegged home-care segment's growth at 15 percent year-on-year YoY for Q1 FY24, and beauty and personal care vertical’s growth at 8 percent.

However, the food and refreshments category is expected to have a tepid growth at 4 percent YoY. The ice-cream portfolio should benefit from seasonality, while the tea portfolio may face some challenges due to delayed market availability, they said.

HUL's gross margin recovery is expected to continue in Q1 FY24 as key raw material prices remain soft or range-bound. The full benefit of deflationary input costs will, however, be recognised over the next two quarters as the company carries certain high-cost finished goods inventory.

Nomura estimates a gross margin of 48.5 percent Q1 FY24. ""Operating margin expansion will be limited as HUL continues to invest in advertising and brand building activities to counter increased competition from unorganized players,"" according to the Nomura report.

Rural demand and volume growth

A major pain point for FMCG companies has been sluggish rural demand. While urban markets continue to drive premiumisation, rural India is reeling under inflationary pressures.

""Urban markets will continue to grow faster. While rural market demand is witnessing a better trajectory, it is still not out of the woods and the pace of recovery is gradual. We note the full benefit of the harvest money is yet to be seen translating into product consumer demand,"" said Nomura.

HUL's volume growth was 6 percent in Q1 FY23, 4 percent in Q2, 5 percent in Q3 and 5 percent in Q4, driven by urban markets.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, HUL reported standalone net profit at Rs 2,552 crore, registering a growth of 9.66 percent from Rs 2,327 crore in the same quarter of the previous financial year. Total revenue came in at Rs 15,053 crore, rising 10.81 percent from Rs 13,584 crore in the year-ago quarter.

A 3 pm, the stock was quoting at Rs 2,718.45 on the NSE, higher by 1 percent from the previous close. The stock is 6 percent in 2023 so far.

Between price hikes to boost earnings, tepid sales volumes, a sluggish rural recovery and the naming of a new boss, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) had a truly eventful FY 2023.

And there was more in a year the economy returned to normal after being hit by COVID-19.

“As economic activities normalised after a couple years of the pandemic, in a high inflationary environment, we witnessed consumers prioritising essentials over discretionary spends,” outgoing Chief Executive Officer Sanjiv Mehta noted in HUL’s annual report.

At the same time, trends such as digitisation and sustainability continued to play a major role in purchase decisions by consumers, he added.

Here are five interesting takeaways from the FY23 annual report of HUL, India’s largest maker of Fast Moving Consumer Goods.

Rs 1,000 crore club: HUL now has 19 brands with a turnover exceeding Rs 1,000 crore per annum. In FY22, this club had 16 members. In fact, Surf Excel became the first home and personal care brand in India to clock over $1 billion annual sales in FY23.

HUL’s home care liquids portfolio that includes fabric conditioners, liquid detergents and dishwashers, exceeded Rs 3,000 crore in annual turnover. Meanwhile, Lux and Pond’s joined the Rs 2,000 crore club.

Top boss’s salary: Mehta, who will hang up his boots in June, took home Rs 22.36 crore in annual remuneration in FY 23, indicating no significant jump from the previous year. In FY22, Mehta had received Rs 22.07 crore, a 47 percent rise from Rs 15 crore in FY 21.

Rohit Jawa, who will succeed Mehta as CEO of HUL, will take home Rs 21.43 crore in FY24.

Gender diversity and inclusivity: The company achieved 40 percent women’s representation in FY23. It aims to have 10,000 women in sales outer core by 2026 and 1,500 women on the shop floor by 2025. Till date, it has empowered over 190,000 women in rural India to become Shakti entrepreneurs. Shakti is the name of HUL’s women’s empowerment project. Moreover, five percent of HUL’s workforce will be made up of people with disabilities by 2025, the annual report said.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG): HUL collected and processed over 100,000 tonnes of plastic waste in 2022. Sixty-nine percent of tea and 82 percent of tomatoes used were sourced sustainably, said the company.

“We are decarbonising our operations and have achieved 97 percent reduction in CO2 emissions per tonne of production across our manufacturing operations, when compared to 2008 baseline,” chairman Nitin Paranjpe said.

Premiumisation: As volume growth remains tepid, the company’s focus remains on premiumisation to expand its topline. From detergent bars to powder to liquid to pods, HUL has been aggressively driving this strategy. In Skin Cleansing, too, it drove premiumisation from soap bars to bodywash liquids.

“We addressed emerging demand spaces through on-trend innovations such as Dove Hair Fall Therapy, Lakmé Vitamin C, Pond’s Light Hydration, Lakmé Sunscreen, and TRESemmé Pro Pure,” the annual report said. ​",513,-0.047086799144744874

After a week of consolidation, the market flexed muscles and made more than a percent gains in the week ended May 12, with the Nifty50 forming a bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts after the formation of a shooting star kind of pattern in the previous week.

The index has also continued with higher tops formation for the seventh consecutive week and closed with 246 points gains at 18,315, the highest closing level since last December.

Even the momentum indicators RSI (relative strength index 14) showed bullish bias and MACD (moving average convergence divergence) giving a positive crossover above zero line on the weekly scale. Hence, the momentum can take the Nifty50 towards 18,500-18,700 in coming sessions, if it sustains 18,200 mark which can be near term support, followed by 18,000 being crucial support, experts said.

""The sustenance of Nifty at the higher band of the consolidation zone for most of the trading sessions indicates inherent strength. As far as levels are concerned, 18,200 is likely to cushion any short-term blip, while the sacrosanct support lies around the 18,100-18,000 zone in the comparable period,"" Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.

On the flip side, he feels 18,500 is very much in the vicinity and with ongoing momentum, it is strongly anticipated to get tested soon. At the same time, an authoritative breach beyond the same could trigger the next leg of rally in the upcoming weeks, he says.

Going ahead, he remains sanguine with the current momentum and would advocate the traders to utilize the dips to add long positions in the index.

Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio also feels the coming week is of extreme importance as it will decide the trend for the next leg. ""18,200 levels are expected to act as a strong support zone and if held in the forthcoming week, Nifty will start moving towards 18,500 levels.""

""Highest open interest is at 18,300 on the Call side and 18,200 on the Put side and hence, till the time Nifty is in this range, it is expected to remain sideways,"" Karwa said.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 12 closing prices:

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

Hubtown: Buy | LTP: Rs 45.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 40 | Target: Rs 55 | Return: 22 percent

Hubtown has shown relative strength last week. While the Nifty has gained 1.34 percent last week, Hubtown has gained a healthy 12.8 percent. In the process, the stock has closed above its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average). Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 44-46 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 40 and target of Rs 55.

LT Foods: Buy | LTP: Rs 113.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 108 | Target: Rs 126 | Return: 11 percent

After correcting from a high of Rs 122 tested in January 2023, Daawat found support around Rs 90 levels in March 2023. These are strong supports as they also roughly coincide with previous intermediate lows.

The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. Last week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and -day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 112-114 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 108 and target at Rs 126.

Grindwell Norton: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,990.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,900 | Target: Rs 2,150 | Return: 8 percent

Grindwell has bounced back from a low of Rs 1,725 touched in March 2023 where it made a 6-month low. The stock has since then gradually climbed higher and made a higher bottom in the process. The rise was accompanied with healthy volumes, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which suggests potential for more upsides.

With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 1,980-2,020 levels, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,900 and target at Rs 2,150.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 910.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 890 | Target: Rs 950-970 | Return: 6.5 percent

In the past week, the stock rallied over 5 percent and also formed long bullish candle. After a short term correction, the stock consistently forming higher bottom formation and comfortably trading above 20 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average) which is largely positive.

For the positional traders now, Rs 890 would be the important support level to watch out. If the stock manages to trade above the same then we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 950-970.

Bata India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1524.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 | Target: Rs 1,600-1,650 | Return: 8 percent

After a long correction eventually, the stock took the support near Rs 1,400 and reversed. Post reversal formation, it comfortably trading above 20 and 50-day SMA (simple moving average).

In addition, a promising reversal continuation formation on weekly charts and higher high higher low series on daily and intraday charts indicating further uptrend from the current levels.

Unless it trading below Rs 1,450, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 1,600-1,650. Fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 1,525 and Rs 1,490 levels with a stop-loss below Rs 1,450.

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | | LTP: Rs 1,275.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 | Target: Rs 1,315-1,335 | Return: 5 percent

On last Friday, the stock rallied nearly 2 percent and after a long time it succeeded to close above 200-day SMA level. Technically, on weekly charts it has formed bullish candle and on daily and intraday charts it is holding uptrend continuation formation.

We are of the view that, the short term texture of the stock is bullish and uptrend wave is likely to continue in the near future.

For the trend following traders now, Rs 1,240 or 10-day SMA would act as a sacrosanct support level. Above which, it could rally till Rs 1,315. Further upside may also continue which could lift the stock till Rs 1,335. On the flip side below Rs 1,240 uptrend would be vulnerable.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 910.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 877 | Target: Rs 945-964 | Return: 6 percent

The uptrend in Bank Nifty index remains positive and hence we expect the private banking stocks to continue the upmove. Axis Bank has given a breakout from its previous swing high resistance on Friday and the RSI oscillator is also indicating a positive momentum.

Traders can buy this stock in the range of Rs 910-900 for potential targets of Rs 945 and Rs 964. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 877.

Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,623.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,520 | Target: Rs 2,680-2,730 | Return: 4 percent

The stock prices consolidated in a range in last few months and have formed a support base at recent swing lows. During the week gone by, the prices have given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance.

The volumes have picked up gradually and the short term momentum also seems to be bullish. Hence, short term traders can look to buy the stock on dips towards Rs 2,600-2,580 range for potential targets of Rs 2,680 and Rs 2,730.

The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 2,520.

Returns matter a lot, yet there are always scenarios where analysts and investors are at odds. Sometimes analysts are gung-ho over a stock despite investors dumping it; there are also occasions when investors lap up a stock that analysts seem to loathe.

With the Indian market climbing higher in the past one month, a cluster of stocks has stood out prominently where investors and analysts are at a variance.

Contrarian downgrades

Bajaj Auto, despite a rally in its share price, has stood out like a sore thumb when it comes to analyst views, with the ‘buy’ recommendations decreasing to 27 in April, from 33 in the previous month and 40 in the past one quarter.

The shares of the largest domestic three-wheeler original equipment maker have risen 17 percent over a month, 12 percent over a quarter and 16 percent in a year.

Post the recent rally, Kotak Institutional Equities believes most of the positives are already baked in the current market price of Bajaj Auto, prompting it to maintain its ‘reduce’ rating on the automobile stock with a hike in target price to Rs 4,000 from Rs 3,625 earlier.

Besides this, a cut in export volumes and market share loss faced by the second-largest motorcycle manufacturer has led to the downgrades.

“Concerns on the export volumes continue (around 50 percent of sales) with Bajaj Auto delaying the recovery timelines led by uncertainty on unavailability of USD and lower affordability. Also, lack of market share gains in the domestic motorcycles market over the last few years, and increase in competition could lead to further pricing actions,” said brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher.

Meanwhile, Jefferies slightly differed from the view. Even as the capital markets firm is concerned about Bajaj Auto's market share loss in premium bikes and exports, it sees multiple tailwinds—improving domestic demand, gradual export recovery, the launch of Triumph bikes, and the scale-up of EVs.

UltraTech Cement

Over the quarter, another stock that caught the eye was UltraTech Cement where ‘buy’ ratings dropped to 39 from 42 but the share price rose 12.5 percent during the same period.

Gains in the stock price were on the back of the cement manufacturer’s leadership position in the industry with a market share of around 26 percent in FY23, coupled with robust expansion plans without leveraging the balance sheet. Strong demand, cement prices likely remaining stable and power and fuel costs treading lower also supported the buying sentiment for the cement stock.

However, the only thing that seems to be ticking off analysts is the limited upside potential in the stock. Dolat Capital said that the current market price leaves limited upside.

At Rs 7,704 on the BSE, UltraTech Cement’s stock is about a percent away from scaling its 52-week high.

Coal India

Other stocks that analysts seem to dislike are Coal India and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.

For Coal India, 7 brokerage firms have downgraded their ratings on the state-owned mining company’s stock to 15 ‘buy’ recommendations from 22 over the past one year. This is in contrast to the coal major’s near 23 percent rally in the share price, which was largely due to attractive valuation and high dividend yield. The company’s board gave in-principle approval to divest a 25 percent stake in Bharat Coking Coal and some analysts believe a stake sale along with a potential listing could help unlock value, which also triggered the rally.

At Rs 237, the stock trades at an inexpensive valuation of 3.9 times FY24 EV/EBITDA, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Among other things that made analysts wary is a likely fall in e-auction realisations. CLSA believes e-auction realisations will fall further on a decline in global prices.

Lower-than-expected e-auction realisation of Rs 4,525 per tonne, down 10 percent QoQ, played a spoilsport during the March quarter. Sharekhan by BNP Paribas highlighted that lower realisations, especially for e-auction, could affect margins and earnings outlook.

Dr Reddy’s Labs

As for Dr Reddy’s, ‘buy’ ratings have slipped to 31 from 37 over a year. Analysts take it that the ongoing United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) plant inspections and a few companies being issued Form 483 with observations pointing at apparent regulatory concerns, may drag the performance of pharmaceutical players, prompting them to stay selective in the space.

Recently, Dr Reddy’s has been issued a Form 483 with one observation by the US FDA following an inspection of the company’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility in Bollaram, Hyderabad.

Sharekhan cautioned that increased scrutiny from the US FDA, leading to production delays, and rising guidance around research and development and promotion and marketing costs in the near term, could act as headwinds against a potentially strong operating performance for the drugmaker.

Despite the downgrades, the scrip of the pharmaceutical major has shot up 20 percent during the past one year given the superior product portfolio and strong product pipeline of Dr Reddy’s.

Dr Reddy’s has outperformed the Nifty Pharma index over the past one year. The pharma major’s scrip has climbed 26 percent higher in comparison with the 0.5 percent drop in the index.

Contrarian upgrades

On the other hand, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) was the only stock on Nifty50 where the share price declined for over a month, yet analysts upgraded their ratings on the scrip.

Volume growth for India’s largest FMCG company seemed to be a worry for investors, which triggered a small drop in the stock price over the past one month, but analysts paid heed to the upbeat management commentary. The HUL’s management believes overall volume growth will likely recover gradually as consumption comes with a lag. It also reiterated that the rural slowdown has bottomed out and the company should start seeing volume recovery provided the macro environment and raw material prices remain stable.

What analysts also like about HUL — that houses brands like Lux, Pond’s, Red Label, Bru, Dove, Fair & Lovely, Horlicks, Kissan, Pepsodent, Surf Excel, and Vaseline — is the company’s continued market share gains in a challenging consumption environment and its focus on driving premiumisation across categories.

The company’s premium portfolio continues to significantly outperform both the market and HUL’s overall growth, pointed out ICICI Securities.

Besides HUL, analysts also have a fondness for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Wipro despite the negative stock trajectory over a quarter.

Tata Consultancy Services

Even as the stock price is down 6 percent, ‘buy’ calls on TCS shares have bumped up to 24 from 21.

The technology company reported robust deal Total Contract Value (TCV) wins with order book TCV of $10 billion as compared with $7.8 billion in Q3 FY23 and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 times recording an all-time high number of large deals, highlighted Sharekhan.

Meanwhile, PhillipCapital expects TCS to continue to command a valuation premium over its peers, on the back of its strong diversified profile, superior return profile (Return on Equity of 46 percent in FY23), management stability, strong margins and market leadership position.

Despite the strong deal pipeline, the TCS management indicated caution and uncertainty among clients in the near term, which could further impact revenues as well as slow down margin improvement.

Sharekhan has cautioned that the near-term outperformance would be restricted for TCS owing to uncertain earnings outlook, CEO transition and global macro headwinds.

Wipro

Meanwhile, Wipro has also seen an increase in upgrades over a quarter with ‘buy’ recommendations topping up to 13 from 11 despite a 3 percent drop in share price.

Besides, the pricey stock valuation, March quarter earnings had made investors cautious, yet the announcement of buying back shares worth Rs 12,000 crore looked like the saving grace.

“At 15X FY2025E EPS, the stock is not yet cheap enough to warrant a re-look. The stock may hold up in the short term courtesy of buyback,” said Kotak Institutional Equities.

Multiple analysts believe that the current stock valuation fairly captures the risk from the slowing macroeconomic environment that Wipro is facing along with lower-than-expected revenue growth. Wipro has guided for a sequential decline of 1-3 percent in revenue in 1Q FY24, essentially implying no growth in FY24.

Reliance Industries

Over a year, a contrarian upgrade that stole the show is Reliance Industries which saw brokerage firms stepping up their ‘buy’ calls to 33 from 26. Much of the optimism among analysts for RIL’s stock stems from the likelihood of Jio and retail business listings. However, the share price of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate has slumped 14 percent over a year.

CLSA explained that a lack of launches and growth areas has kept the stock subdued over the past 18 months. This, according to the foreign brokerage firm, could change in the second half of FY24 as it sees the Mukesh Ambani-led company start offering its portable 5G device (Jio Airfiber) to ramp up wireless broadband additions and launch its affordable 5G smartphone as it monetises its pan-India standalone 5G launch by end-2023. Further, recent brand launches (Independence, Campa Cola) suggest could ramp up Reliance’s FMCG foray in 2023.

Most importantly, CLSA highlighted in its research report in March that with three years having passed since the stake sale to PE investors, it sees a good chance of a Jio and/or retail IPO in the next 12 months.

Bajaj Finance

Another stock that put the others in the shade was Bajaj Finance. The financier’s stock saw ‘buy’ calls spiralling up to 24 from 19.

The management has guided for healthy loan growth going forward aided by healthy demand as well as new segments, while some fall in net interest margins will be compensated by operating efficiencies. Hence, according to Jefferies, earnings growth and ROA (Return On Asset) can stay high which will support the stock valuations.

“It is also awaiting RBI's approval to foray into credit cards, which we believe can add 5-10 percent to profit pool opportunity,” the global investment banking firm said.

Despite the liking, investors sold the stock over a year with the share price declining around 7 percent during the period. The stock had been consolidating for the last one year.

Some market participants have expressed concern that the lagged effect of rate hikes will likely temper margins. Besides, Kotak Institutional Equities believes the overall business outlook remains strong although rich valuations cap any upside in the stock.

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s Q4FY2023 performance was below our as well as the street’s expectation, with revenue/PAT growing by 11% and 8% y-o-y, respectively (with 4% volume growth). OPM declined by 80 bps q-o-q to 23.3%. Volume growth will recover gradually as falling input prices and a recovery in rural demand will drive growth in the coming quarters. FY2024 revenue growth will largely be volume-led. Falling input prices led to sequential improvement in the gross margins in Q4. The management is confident posting better OPM ahead if commodity prices continue to moderate from current levels.

Outlook

The stock has underperformed broader indices and is trading at 53x/46x its FY2024E/FY2025E earnings. The management is confident of achieving consistent and profitable growth in the medium term. We retain Buy with a reduced PT of Rs. 2,810.

India's largest fast moving consumer goods company Hindustan Unilever has reported a 16 percent growth in FY23 revenue at Rs 58,154 crore, with 5 percent underlying volume growth. While the topline surge outpaced the overall industry growth, the Q4 volume growth of 4 percent failed to match Street estimates.

The fourth quarter operating margins at 23.3 percent also missed the Street estimate of 23.9 percent. On a year-on-year basis, margins were lower by 80 basis points.

At 10am, Hindustan Unilever shares were trading at Rs 2,425 on the NSE, lower by 1.74 percent. The stock had closed 1.6 percent lower on April 27 too, after the results were announced.

""The overall FMCG market volume growth should be 4-5 percent, while commodity prices remain steady, only then the volatile scenario can turn a corner,"" chief executive officer Sanjiv Mehta said after Q4 earnings.

The FMCG market (urban and rural) registered flat volume growth in the March quarter, Nielsen data shows.

The marginal slip in fourth quarter numbers has led to slight trimming of EPS (earnings per share) estimates. Jefferies has cut EPS estimates by 1-2 percent to factor in the miss. Noting the sharp sequential slowdown in home care segment, the broking firm has cut its target on the stock to Rs 2,875, while retaining its 'buy' rating.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services has also maintained the 'buy' tag with a target at Rs 3,010 but cut its EPS estimates by 2-3 percent for FY24/FY25. ""We believe that HUL will get back to the mid-to-high teens earnings growth trajectory it exhibited for the four years before Covid,"" it said.

The key for HUL is now growing its rural volumes. ""When wallet size is small, the impact of inflation is big. Moreover, subsidy schemes have been slashed and free food grain programme has been halted,"" Mehta said in the press meet.

That said, he takes heart in the fact that the rural volume decline is moderating. For FY23, HUL's rural volumes declined 7 percent, while in Q4 FY23, the de-growth was 3 percent.

As ad spends are ramped up further, operating margin is expected to go back to the pre-Covid level of 25 percent with a lag. Thus, Elara Securities has pared its FY24/25 earnings estimates by 3.7 percent/2.5 percent.

""HUL continues to guide for sequential gross and EBITDA margin improvement with stabilising inflation, narrowing cost price gap and calibrated price cuts to restore price-value equation,"" according to Amnish Aggarwal of Prabhudas Lilladher.

As focus shifts to volume led growth, he has cut the FY24/25 EPS estimates by 6.9 percent/5 percent and has a target of Rs 2,785 on the stock with an Accumulate rating.

Hindustan Unilever's outgoing Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Sanjiv Mehta said that volatility will wane only when overall FMCG market volumes grow in mid-single digits.

""Overall FMCG market's volume growth should be 4-5 percent while commodity prices remain steady, only then the volatile scenario can turn a corner,"" he said after HUL's Q4 earnings while maintaining his 'cautiously optimistic' stance.

Also Read: HUL Q4 result: Net profit jumps 10% to Rs 2,552 crore, revenue rises 11%

FMCG market (urban and rural) registered flat volume growth in the March quarter, as per Nielsen data.

Meanwhile, HUL outpaced industry growth with 4 percent increase in volumes. However, rural volumes for the company continued to remain under pressure, declining close to 3 percent.

""When wallet size is small, the impact of inflation is big. Moreover, subsidy schemes have been slashed and free food grain programme has been halted,"" he said.

That said, Mehta takes heart in the fact that the rural volume decline is moderating. For FY23, HUL's rural volumes declined 7 percent while in Q4 FY23, the de-growth was ~3 percent.

On commodity inflation

HUL' net material inflation was 12 percent in the March quarter, while the company took only 7 percent price hike. For the entire fiscal year, it saw top line grow by 16 percent, of which 11 percent was price-led.

""Price-led growth is slowly moderating. But to go back to the days of volume-led growth, we need deflation in commodity prices. While raw material prices are coming down, they are still above 10-year median level,"" he said.

Soda ash, caustic soda, crude palm oil, tea, barley and skimmed milk powder are some key inputs for the company.

""When commodity prices come down sharply, we will definitely pass the benefit to consumers,"" Mehta added.

On margins

For Q4 FY23, the company's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin came in at 23.3 percent versus the Street estimate of 23.9 percent. On a year-on-year basis, it was a decline of 80 basis points.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

""As announced earlier, the company has taken a 80 basis point hike in royalty payment to Unilever, of which 45 basis points was in this quarter,"" explained HUL's Chief Financial Officer Ritesh Tiwari. This impact showed in EBITDA margins.

Plus, the company ramped up its advertising and promotion (A&P) spend. The expense stood at 9 percent of sales in the March quarter compared to 7.9 percent in Q3.

""Our focus remains on right price-value equation for competitive growth for which we have to spend on ads,"" said Mehta.

On competition

""The more competition, the better for consumers. It is not a zero-sum game. Per capita FMCG consumption is still low in India and has lot of room to grow,"" said Mehta.

Good competition brings out the best in HUL, he said.

Reliance Consumer Products in March announced the launch of Glimmer beauty soaps, Get Real natural soaps, Puric hygiene soaps, Dozo dishwash bars and liquids, HomeGuard toilet and floor cleaners and Enzo laundry detergent powder, liquid and bars. These are in direct competition with HUL.

Total revenue came in at Rs 15,053 crore, rising 10.81 percent from Rs 13,584 crore in the year-ago quarter, the FMCG major’s said in a regulatory filing.

Profit was largely in-line but revenue missed the mark. According to a poll of brokerages, HUL’s standalone Q4 revenue was seen at Rs 15,277 crore and net profit at Rs 2,584 crore. Estimates suggested price-hike led revenue growth at 9 percent and volume growth at 5 percent. In the previous quarter, too, volume growth was 5 percent.

Underlying volume growth during Q4 was 4 percent, lagging the expectations.

The company’s Board also recommended a final dividend of Rs 22 for the financial year ended 31st March 2023. The Company had earlier paid an interim dividend of Rs 17 per share on 17th November 2022.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the quarter was at Rs 3,471 crore growing by 7 percent. EBITDA margin was at 23.7 percent and declined by 90 bps YoY. The EBITDA margin was 23.3 percent versus the estimate of 23.9 percent.

HUL said the home care division delivered another quarter of solid performance with 19 percent revenue growth. Both fabric wash and household care grew in strong double digits. Beauty & personal care grew 10 percent with broad-based performance across categories.

Foods & refreshment grew 3 percent led by foods, coffee and health food drinks (HFD).

Gross margin improved by 120 bps QoQ with a reduction in price vs. cost gap.

“We continue to make steady progress in future-proofing our business through portfolio transformation and building distinctive capabilities,” said Sanjiv Mehta, CEO and Managing Director. “Looking forward, the near-term operating environment is likely to remain volatile. With inflation easing due to lapping of high base and sequential softening in a few commodities, price and volume growths will rebalance.”

“Market volumes will recover gradually as consumption habits readjust. We remain focused on managing our business with agility and growing our consumer franchise whilst maintaining margins in a healthy range.”

India’s largest fast moving consumer goods company Hindustan Unilever is expected to see a 13 percent on-year jump in both topline and bottomline for the quarter ended March 2023. The company will announce its Q4 FY23 results on April 27 during market hours.

According to a poll of brokerages, HUL’s standalone Q4 revenue is seen at Rs 15,277 crore and net profit at Rs 2,584 crore. Estimates suggest price-hike led revenue growth will be about 9 percent and volume growth will be close to 5 percent. Last quarter, too, volume growth was 5 percent.

“We expect continued strength in home care revenue growth on the back of price hikes in laundry. There will be some improvement in beauty and personal care segment, as the spillover in winter portfolio gets offset by price cuts in skin cleansing,” as per Kotak Institutional Equities.

Home care segment’s sales is seen rising 22 percent YoY and personal care products by 10 percent, on the back of festivities and increased outdoor activities.

On the margin front, EBITDA margin is expected to decline marginally on a year-on-year basis due to higher advertisement spends. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

In Q3, too, the company had not passed on the full impact of cool off in palm oil prices and had upped ad spends instead. BNP Paribas expects A&P spends to be 8.5 percent of Q4 sales.

The key factors to watch will be how rural markets are faring vis-à-vis urban areas. HUL derives 40 percent of its sales from rural India, where consumers have been downtrading to cheaper alternatives thus impacting volume growth.

The Street is also waiting to hear from CEO designate Rohit Jawa, who takes over Sanjiv Mehta in June. This will be Mehta’s last earnings concall with HUL.

Other key factors to watch: Outlook on nutrition business, discretionary consumption and out-of-home demand.

Eight of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 1,17,493.78 crore in market valuation in an overall weak trend in equities last week, with Infosys taking the biggest hit.

Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank were among the eight companies that suffered a decline in their valuation. ITC and State Bank of India were the only gainers.

Last week, the 30-share BSE Sensex fell by 775.94 points or 1.28 per cent.

The market valuation of Infosys plummeted by Rs 66,854.05 crore to Rs 5,09,215 crore. Infosys Ltd on April 13 reported lower-than-expected growth in the fourth quarter net profit and gave a weak 4-7 per cent revenue growth guidance for FY24 amid tightening of IT budgets by clients following turmoil in the US banking sector.

HDFC Bank's valuation tumbled Rs 10,880.5 crore to Rs 9,33,937.35 crore.

ICICI Bank lost Rs 10,462.77 crore from its valuation which stood at Rs 6,17,477.46 crore and the market capitalisation (mcap) of TCS tanked Rs 10,318.52 crore to Rs 11,56,863.98 crore.

The mcap of Hindustan Unilever declined by Rs 8,458.53 crore to Rs 5,86,927.90 crore and that of HDFC fell by Rs 5,172.27 crore to Rs 5,06,264.24 crore.

The market valuation of Reliance Industries went lower by Rs 4,566.52 crore to Rs 15,89,169.49 crore and that of Bharti Airtel dipped Rs 780.62 crore to Rs 4,26,635.46 crore.

However, ITC's valuation jumped Rs 15,907.86 crore to Rs 5,07,373.82 crore and that of State Bank of India climbed Rs 8,746.11 crore to Rs 4,84,561.80 crore.

Fast moving consumer good (FMCG) companies confront the risk of below-average monsoon rainfall hurting rural incomes and, consequently their sales, but Jefferies remains overweight on the sector.

Reason: a silver lining in state government budgets that the securities firm says are “exhibiting a populist trend” although overall state expenditure may decline.

An analysis of the budgets of 15 states, which make for 85 percent of India's Gross Domestic Product, shows that spending growth is set to decline from 21 percent in FY23 to 11 percent in FY24.

“But, the bias towards populist spending is visible in the state budgets with a surge in income transfer schemes in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh etc. Big promises have also been made ahead of Karnataka state elections,” Jefferies said in a recent report.

Such announcements can help revive rural consumption and so its conviction on the potential of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies stays firm. Thus, the overweight rating on the FMCG sector.

El Nino

To be sure, not all on the Street share the optimism about FMCG companies, who have been battling steep consumer price inflation that prompted many households to tighten their belts and cut spending.

On top of that, concerns abound about the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon that causes a warming of temperatures in the Pacific and is associated with lower-than-average rainfall in the subcontinent.

Weather forecaster Skymet predicts a “below normal” monsoon in India at 94 percent of the Long Period Average (LPA) rainfall. In the backdrop of the prediction, many fund managers are turning underweight on FMCG stocks.

“Base-level FMCG consumption is stressed. On top of that, valuations are still expensive across the board,” said Mayur Patel, who manages IIFL Focused Equity Fund.

Also Read: Daily Voice | This fund manager is overweight on autos with EV capabilities, and underweight on FMCG

State sops

Jefferies is unfazed.

It cites the fact that Rajasthan has announced a doubling of free units of electricity to 100 units for all households. Maharashtra has announced Rs 6,000 per farmer direct income transfer at an expenditure of Rs 6,700 crore.

Madhya Pradesh is providing Rs 1,000 per month income transfer to women at Rs 8,000 crore annual cost. And, Chhattisgarh will give Rs 2,500 per month to educated unemployed youth and Rs 6,000 per annum to landless laborers, Jefferies noted.

These announcements, it says, can help revive rural consumption, reinforcing its conviction about the potential of FMCG companies. Rural consumption which makes for 45 percent of the sector’s revenue.

In an earlier report dated January 4, Jefferies analysts had noted that government's focus on launching large new social schemes in pre-election years. Be it the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) scheme in the last election cycle or the national food subsidy scheme prior to that.

“Given the greater presence of the economically weaker sections in rural areas, these schemes tend to benefit the rural economy disproportionately,” the analysts said.

This, coupled with rising activity in the construction sector, the largest employer of unskilled labor, can boost sales volumes in the rural market. Cooling of raw material inflation is also set drive gross margin expansion by 200 basis points and Jefferies expects about 18 percent Earnings Per Share growth for consumer staple companies in FY24, the highest in nearly a decade.

Another quarter, and the same script for consumer companies. The Street is expecting between 8 and 11 percent revenue growth for packaged consumer goods makers in the quarter ended March 2023 on subdued sales by volume as rural demand continues to lag.

“With no clear signs of recovery in rural demand, sales growth in staples would be led by value growth and premiumization, both of which are also tapering down,” analysts at securities firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services wrote in a note.

Business updates of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies are a clear indication of the trend. Dabur, to whose sales rural India contributes 47 percent, said the segment has “fallen short of a full recovery”.

Marico’s management says a visible and sustained recovery is expected only in the coming quarters.

That said, analysts believe Hindustan Unilever, Britannia, ITC and Godrej Consumer Products are expected to outperform peers.

Hindustan Unilever’s revenue growth at 15 percent is expected to be driven by its laundry segment. HUL said on Friday that n February, its Surf Excel brand had crossed the $1 billion turnover mark.

Britannia’s solid run is set to continue on the back of demand resilience in the biscuits category. For ITC, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities are modelling a 15 percent year-on-year increase in volume growth and 17 percent cigarette growth on an Earnings Before Interest and Taxes basis.

Godrej Consumer Products is expected to report good growth on a low base and its entry into low unit packs of hair color cream and premiumization of air freshners.

Volume growth and margins

Sales volume declines may be behind FMCG companies, but projections for growth are not gung-ho. Most companies are expected to post mid single-digit volume growth in Q4, with Kotak pegging the range at 0-6 percent.

In Q4, consumers in rural India remained cautious before buying staples or a discretionary products as has been the case in previous quarters, analysts said.

To bring back volume growth, advertising and promotional spending has been ramped up by most consumer companies and this, in turn, will affect operating margins.

Companies did not have the liberty to increase ad spending over the past few quarters because high raw material inflation was pinching their gross margins. With palm oil prices and Brent crude prices having dipped in Q4, companies took a step ahead in this direction.

There is a huge divergence in EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization margin growth across companies, Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

Nine of nineteen stocks under its coverage are likely to report flat or lower EBITDA margins year-on-year. ITC, Asian Paints, Britannia and Nestle are likely to report margin expansion of 180 basis points-250 basis points Year-on-Year (YoY). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Discretionary

Elara Securities’ checks indicate muted demand for paint companies post January and a slowdown in the Business-to-Business (B2B) business vertical.

“Industrial paints, too, are likely to be muted due to flat auto OEM production,” wrote Elara analysts. Asian Paints is expected to report 9 percent YoY sales growth with 6 percent domestic decorative volume growth.

In the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) space, revenue is expected to have declined sequentially since the previous quarter was a festival season. Prices of dairy and flour, two key raw materials for fast food chains, remained elevated in the quarter, which will cause margins to contract further. Jubilant Foodworks’ Same Store Sales may have contracted 2.5 percent.

The one company where analysts are projecting strong double-digit volume growth is Varun Beverages. Kotak Institutional Equities expects 27 percent revenue growth and 20.3 percent volume growth for the company, once again propelled by the energy drink Sting.

In the alcobev segment, United Spirits, Radico Khaitan and United Breweries are seen reporting average growth, but elevated ENA (extra neutral alcohol) prices, which make up 65-70 percent of raw material costs, will adversely affect margins in the quarter. ​

These fees are paid by companies like Hindustan Unilever, Colgate Palmolive, Nestle India, Page Industries, and Jubilant Foodworks to get access to their knowledge, R&D, and intellectual properties.

As a part of the Finance Bill 2023, the government has decided to double the rate of tax on royalties and technical fees to 20 percent.

The change will apply to entities whose parent companies operate in jurisdictions without a tax treaty with India, noted Nomura, including those registered in tax havens like the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands.

The tax rate will be 15 percent on royalty and fees for technical services from countries like the US and the UK, which have a tax treaty with India.

Entities with parent companies registered in countries such as Switzerland and Japan, which have double tax avoidance trade treaties with India, will still be subject to 10 percent withholding tax rate.

""While we await further clarity, our initial assessment suggests an increase of 15-30 basis points,"" Nomura said.

The payment of any royalty in the first place is a matter of contention for the Dalal Street. The Street verdict is that royalty fees eat into the earnings available to shareholders, and solely benefits the parent. In February, Hindustan Unilever decided to increase its payment to Unilever Plc by 80 basis points after which the stock closed 4 percent lower.

FMCG conglomerate Hindustan Unilever on March 10 announced that Rohit Jawa will take over as the Managing Director and CEO of the company from Sanjiv Mehta on June 27.

The 56-year-old, who is currently serving as the chief of transformation for Unilever in London, had written a post on LinkedIn, in 2017 titled, ""5 Principles of effective leadership in an uncertain world"".

In the post, Jawa offered five suggestions for progressive leadership amidst global uncertainty:

Be Agile: The first point that Jawa focused on, in the post, was the need to constantly evolve and realise that the path towards the required destination would not be straightforward. ""I have taken many roads in my career, across different countries and market conditions. I am currently based in China, which has its own vast and complex dynamic that I must not only respect and understand, but master, if I am to provide valuable leadership to my team. How do I do this? By understanding that as a leader, my learning is never truly complete, that to succeed I must evolve and adapt to a constantly changing landscape. Ultimately, success in changing environments is about forming mental flexibility, adaptability and understanding the value of educating oneself. While we work towards a stretching destination in the future, we must accept that the path will not be straight and predictable,"" he wrote.

Need to Create Strong Team: The second point that Jawa wrote was to develop a strong team, which is competent and offers stability. ""An organisation is only as strong as its weakest link and when dealing with times of unpredictability it has never been more important to secure a stable, competent workforce. Fundamentally success is about the ‘who’ far before the ‘what’. As a leader, it is important to ask: Who are the people going on this journey together? Do you trust them? Do they connect with the core values and purpose of your business? At Unilever, we champion sustainability, fairness in the workplace and inclusivity, so it is paramount that our team advocates the same ideals,"" Jawa wrote in his post.

Simplify the Complex: In the third point, Jawa wrote about how important it was to understand the complexities involved and emphasised the need to simplify them. ""When we learn to simplify the complex, and we communicate in simple terms, we can come up with a set of clear priorities for our team. This helps clarify things and allows them to see their role in the bigger picture. I call this ‘sense making’ – the art of joining dots and keeping business simple,"" Jawa wrote in his post.

Celebrating Success: In his fourth principle, Jawa wrote about the need to celebrate success, even during volatile times. He felt that recognising achievements would help create happiness in the team and develop confidence. ""Recognising achievement is vital in building confidence and a sense of joy within your team – it speaks volumes in ensuring your employees understand their value within the company and this positivity is a fantastic motivator. This recognition need not be elaborate, sending simple thank-you notes or congratulating people with a little gift serves the objective to ensure the team feel valued. This spreads a widespread feeling of positivity within the company and curates a culture of generosity.""

Developing Resilience: In his fifth and final principle, Jawa wrote about the need to remain positive and mindful amidst volatility and by developing resilience, one could help gain trust and create reassurance which could inspire the rest of the team. ""Finally, when trying to navigate a constantly changing world, one of the most valuable pieces of advice, and something I live by in all areas of my life, is the increasing importance to stay mindful and positive. Be it during personal struggle or dealings within the business, finding a mental balance to accept the negatives and knowing that these lows are temporary, are vital skills when leading a team. Keeping this resilience and calm has never been more important in leadership; it helps to gain trust and reassurance while inspiring your team to follow your example,"" he concluded.

Jawa graduated from St. Stephen's College in Delhi in 1986 and later completed his MBA in marketing from Delhi University.",732,0.9996910293896993

The weapons of choice? Advertising and promotion (A&P) spends. But as they launch their campaigns, FMCG companies must also navigate the fine balance of the need to promote products and maintain market share, with their obligation to maintain margins and return value to shareholders.

Going by the trend seen in the third quarter of financial year 2022-23 (Q3 FY23), FMCG companies have spent more on advertising compared to the previous quarter, but it is lower on year-on-year (YoY) basis as well as pre-COVID levels. In Q3, companies spent a little over 8 percent of their revenue on ads, compared to 9 percent in Q3 FY22 and 10.5 percent in Q3 FY20 (pre-COVID).

Market leader Hindustan Unilever, which is the biggest spender on ads, shelled out 8 percent of its revenue on A&P costs for the December quarter. This is higher than the 7 percent spend of the September quarter, but lower than the 11.5 percent outgo in the pre-COVID time.

""Ad spends by fast-moving consumer goods companies are inching back to pre-COVID levels. With learnings from the pandemic-phase marketing, companies are now employing newer and innovative ATL (above the line) and BTL (below the line) mediums to engage consumers,” Sameer Shah, Chief Financial Officer, Godrej Consumer Products, said.

ATL marketing is used when print, television or any other mass media is deployed, while BTL spends allow marketers to tailor their message in a personal manner.

For instance, Godrej Consumer had set up fragrance zones for Aer Matic in Durga Pujo pandals of Kolkata, Mumbai and Delhi. On the other hand, Emami made the direct consumer connect for its Vedic oil by samplings in fairs and festivals.

“It’s crucial to involve customers in on-ground activities like exhibitions, village fairs, food expos and RWA (Resident Welfare Association) activities,” said Rakhee Yadav, Senior Marketing Manager, Pansari Group – a New Delhi-based food products company.

Getting back volumes

According to the report released by data analytics firm NielsenIQ, in October-December, the FMCG industry grew 7.6 percent in terms of value but urban volumes grew 1.6 percent YoY while rural volumes declined 2.8 percent. Some consumers have downtraded to lower unit packs and others to unbranded regional alternatives, analysts said.

Historically, growth in rural markets has always outpaced growth in urban markets when it comes to staples. With rural India constituting about 36 percent of the sales pie for a typical consumer company, the industry is fighting to get back volumes, which has been on a downward trend for over a year now.

“The expectation was that inflation will subside by the end of the year, demand pressures will ease, and FMCG companies will start seeing volume growth. Since that has not played out exactly, A&P spends will have to be done judiciously, with increased focus on BTL activities,” said Shirish Pardeshi of Centrum Broking.

Foreign brokerage firm Jefferies also noted that the focus has shifted to consumer/trade promotions versus ATL brand advertising, given a weak demand environment and high inflation.

As FMCG companies explore new and innovative ways to engage with consumers and win back volumes, only time will tell how effective their A&P spends will be.",560,-0.9831693887710571
2023-02-22 06:34:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-indias-consumption-story-10135991.html,"“People are buying luxury cars but not chappals and underwear.” The joke was everywhere on Twitter recently. But, jokes apart, it shows the grim reality of India’s ""K-shaped"" recovery.

A K-shaped recovery occurs when different parts of the economy recover at different rates, times, or magnitudes. Though SBI’s economists dismissed the 'K-shaped recovery' critique in a report in January, the Q3 earnings trend flies in the face of that view.

Here’s how India’s consumption story is panning out:

FMCG staples

This segment is a true indicator of a country’s economic health. In India, revenue for the FMCG pack has been on an upward trajectory due to the price hikes to mitigate raw material inflation. But this has come at the cost of volumes.

Rural India constitutes about 36 percent of the sales pie for a typical consumer company and this segment has been reeling under inflationary pressure. So much so, that Nestle India reported a loss in volumes for its Maggi Chotu pack, which costs Rs 7. Except for biscuits, demand in all other FMCG segments has taken a hit.

While Hindustan Unilever’s Sanjiv Mehta said that he has been seeing “green shoots” in rural demand, there is still a long way to go. According to the report released by data analytics firm NielsenIQ, in October-December, the industry grew 7.6 percent in terms of value but urban volumes grew 1.6 percent year-on-year while rural volumes declined 2.8 percent. Some consumers have down traded to lower unit packs and others to unbranded regional alternatives, analysts noted.

Encouraging winter crop sowing and indications of higher farm income came as good news for the industry but now fears of a subdued monsoon due to El Nino pose a new challenge for the industry.

Consumer discretionary and QSR

“The slowdown in discretionary spends is visible” Not our words. That’s what Uday Kotak said. Be it Asian Paints, Havells or Domino’s operator Jubilant FoodWorks, most discretionary companies have taken a hit on their bottomline as inflation has burned a hole in the low-to-mid income Indian’s pocket.

In Q3, Asian Paints and Pidilite both posted volume growth that was little changed against expectations of 4-5 percent growth. Both flagged demand stress in the rural and semi-urban areas. Electrical consumer goods company Havells reported a 7.2 percent fall in quarterly profit, citing “moderating” consumer demand. Whirlpool India also flagged similar concerns in its earnings statement.

Same-store sales growth for quick-service restaurants came in below Street expectations. Analysts believe startup layoffs and the slowdown in IT hiring are impacting spending and sentiment, with the fast-food category also witnessing down trading now. Though the festive season was a good time for the entire discretionary space, the slowdown that has crept in since shows no signs of a turnaround.

Retail

Nykaa’s top boss Falguni Nayar said lower consumer spending impacted the beauty-tech platform’s margin and revenue. It reported a 94 basis points margin contraction in Q3.

Page Industries, which is the exclusive licensee of Jockey, also cautioned that demand is not as buoyant in the ongoing quarter. “We are not seeing any recovery in the market,” managing director VS Ganesh said in a recent earnings call.

Avenue Supermarts’ earnings also disappointed as the higher-margin general merchandise and apparel segments underperformed the FMCG and staples segments. “Discretionary non-FMCG sales did not do as well as expected in this quarter,” said Neville Noronha, CEO & managing director, Avenue Supermarts Limited.

Footwear retailer Relaxo’s Q3 was no different from the industry. Revenue from operations fell 8 percent on-year weighed down by subdued demand in mass segment articles. It also lost market share to unorganised players. On the flip side, luxury shoemakers such as Metro Brands have emerged stronger.

That brings us to the other end of the spectrum.

Hotels and tourism

The hotels and tourism sector is the brightest beacon in the gloomy consumption story. Ever since the pandemic ebbed, the sector has been a major beneficiary of the recovery. In November 2022, the Indian hotel industry recorded its best performance since the pandemic began, with occupancy at 68-70 percent and average rates exceeding Rs 7,000.

The third quarter, which is a seasonally strong quarter thanks to a number of festivals, was strong for hotel companies as they saw sharp jumps in revenue and margins. The management of hotel companies is bullish on the near future as well.

“The outlook is very strong, albeit it is all built mostly on domestic (tourism) because foreign inbound is still lagging behind 2019-20 numbers,” said Puneet Chhatwal, Managing Director & CEO, Indian Hotels, in the chain’s recent analyst call.

He added that there are a lot of events happening this year, “including G20 and the Cricket World Cup, which should further boost demand or provide the necessary buffer should there be any form of headwinds coming from anywhere”.

Analysts concur. In a note, HDFC Securities said that with demand outpacing supply, which the latter is unlikely to catch up with over the next 2-3 years, it expects both average room rates (ARRs) and occupancy to remain strong, leading to higher RevPar for the industry.

Automobiles

Another silver lining in the consumption bucket has been automobiles, especially electric vehicles and sports utility vehicles (SUV). The sector has seen strong growth led by a number of model launches in the mid- to high-end segments.

For some models, such as the Mahindra Scorpio N, Tata Nexon, Maruti Suzuki Brezza and Hyundai Creta, the order backlog is as high as 12 months. The demand is such that the 5-door Jimmy, which Maruti Suzuki launched in January, has already garnered about 17,000 orders, and the count is increasing.

Shares of auto companies have also performed well. BSE Auto, a benchmark index of auto and auto ancillary companies, has returned 17 percent in the last year. Mahindra & Mahindra and TVS Motor are two of the best performing stocks from the sector, with one-year returns in the 50-70 percent range.

(Graphics: Upnesh Raval, Rajesh Chawla)

One worry has been the poor sales of two-wheelers, which are largely bought by low- and mid-income riders. Motorcycle sales have stagnated, putting pressure on shares of Hero Moto and Bajaj Auto. Eicher Motors has been spared from the selloff as it sells motorcycles in the mid-range, demand for which remains strong.

Sin goods

The so-called sin goods — alcoholic beverages and cigarettes — have also seen strong growth despite challenges. The reason is that they are adapting to inflation, which is hitting the lower economic strata of society.

Some distilleries are banking on premiumisation of their products, targeting mid and high-income consumers, and this portfolio has seen double-digit growth. Cigarette makers, meanwhile, have introduced new sizes that are priced lower and are banking on formalisation of the market.

Hina Nagarajan, MD & CEO of United Spirits, which sells Johnnie Walker branded liquor, said the company continues to witness good growth post-COVID, particularly in the mid-upper segments of the Prestige & Above (P&A) portfolio. That is reflective of the consumption revival in the broader economic context, with the festive season adding further momentum, as mentioned earlier.

“Our premium Indian whiskeys and scotches continue to drive category expansion on the back of the sustained trend of premiumisation. Inflation and the larger global macroeconomic headwinds may act as a bit of a drag, but we believe that consumer demand will continue to be robust,” said Nagarajan.

Cigarette volumes have also been strong, with double-digit growth recorded across makers. ITC, the biggest cigarette seller, recorded 17 percent growth in revenue from this portfolio.

“Several differentiated variants continue to be launched to further strengthen the range of offerings and ensure future-readiness of the product portfolio,” ITC said in a statement.

El Niño, which occurs every three to six years, could derail the recovery in the rural FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) market, believes Nuvama Institutional Equities.

El Niño is the abnormal heating up of surface ocean waters that lead to changes in wind patterns and impacts weather across the world. The US government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has indicated the possibility of El Niño conditions developing this year.

In India, the last El Niño event of 2018 coincided with below-normal rainfall, notes Nuvama.

""Since then, India witnessed four good monsoons in succession. Hence, the probability of a fifth normal monsoon looks a bit challenging at this stage,"" it added.

Rural recovery underway?

Rural demand has been reeling under inflationary pressures in the post-pandemic era. This is evident from the declining volumes for FMCG companies.

According to a report released by data analytics firm NielsenIQ, in October-December, the FMCG industry grew 7.6 percent in terms of value but its volume growth declined 0.3 percent.

Of this, urban volumes grew by 1.6 percent year-on-year while rural volumes declined by 2.8 percent.

Things were slowly taking a turn as inflation started cooling off gradually from its peak in the later part of CY22. Hindustan Unilever said the company saw some green shoots in the rural market in Q3. Dabur's Mohit Malhotra also said that the demand slump had 'bottomed out'.

Also Read: Worst of inflation behind us, seeing some green shoots in rural market, says HUL's Sanjiv Mehta

The El Niño Effect

Now, the adverse weather conditions could be a roadblock to this recovery. Rainfall deficit is a major cause of the rural slowdown because it affects crop sowing and farm income.

In FY23, states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Jharkhand reported rainfall deficit that affected paddy sowing. ""Hence, the El Niño conditions remain a key monitorable that can hinder rural slowdown turnaround in India,"" believe Nuvama analysts Abneesh Roy and Rushabh Bhachawat.

Since rural India constitutes about 36 percent of the sales pie for a typical consumer company, FMCG fortunes could be in danger. In the present calendar year so far, Nifty FMCG has gained 3 percent, outperforming the Nifty50, which is down 1.9 percent.

Hindustan Unilever's stock price has remained under pressure after the FMCG major along with its December quarter results announced a hike in the royalty payment to parent company Unilever by 80 basis points to 3.45 percent.

While the Q3 numbers met Street estimates, investors were disappointed with the hike in royalty payment.

However, there is potential for the rate to be revised downwards in the next review, a recent report by Jefferies has said. The foreign brokerage firm recently spoke with Hindustan Unilever's management about the royalty issue.

""An adjustment to the royalty will likely result in an increase of only about €20mn for the parent, which is miniscule in the context of its scale. Hindustan Unilever also does not rule out the possibility of a lower rate in the next review, if situation warrants so,"" Jefferies said in the report.

This report follows an earlier warning by the brokerage firm that the royalty hike would hurt the company, which is operating at its peak margins.

The fineprint

The agreement between Hindustan Unilever and Unilever has two components: a royalty for trademark and technology for 1.95 percent of turnover, and fees for central services for 1.5 percent of turnover.

""As per regulations, changes in central service fees will require a minority vote, but brand and technology royalty do not require a vote,"" Jefferies said.

There is no brand or technology royalty charged on revenue from acquired brands such as Horlicks, Boost, and Indulekha, as HUL owns these brands and there is no technology provided by Unilever.

The current royalty agreement is for five years, compared to 10 years for the previous one. The management is of the view that the rates would be reviewed after five years and re-evaluated based on the context and scope at that time, Jefferies added.

Target price

Jefferies' base case target for Hindustan Unilever is Rs 3,100, a 35 percent increase from current levels. Its bull case target is Rs 3,530, and the brokerage sees the stock at Rs 2,020 in a downside scenario.

Some key risks for the counter include rising raw material costs, rural demand affected by inflation and a pullback in consumer sector multiples, according to the report.

At 12.03 pm, HUL was trading 0.44 percent down at Rs 2,537.30 on the National Stock Exchange.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR’s operating performance in 3QFY23 was in line with expectations. PBT and PAT beat our estimates by ~8%, driven by higher-than-expected other income. On the effective 80bp increase in royalty (effective for the next five years) from 2.65% to 3.45%, we are not particularly perturbed if HUVR receives commensurate benefits from the parent. The decision also requires a majority of minority shareholders’ approval and is not a CG risk in our view. Even at 3.45% royalty by CY27, HUVR’s royalty rate will be well below that of NEST/CLGT/PGHH (close to ~5%). While rural recovery and commodity cost declines are taking longer than expected, management believes that the worst is over and HUVR will be a clear beneficiary on both fronts. Maintain Buy.

Outlook

Maintain Buy with a TP of INR3,100 (55x FY25E EPS).

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s Q3FY2023 performance was ahead of our as well as street expectation, with revenue/PAT growing by 16% and 12%, respectively (with 5% volume growth). OPM expanded by 33 bps q-o-q to 23.2%. Moderating inflation will aid recovery in volume-led growth in the coming quarters, while price-led growth will taper off. The board has approved an 80-bps increase in royalty charges to 3.45% for a period of five years from 2.65% earlier (done in 2013). This will lead to increased other expenses and moderate margin expansion.

Outlook

The stock is trading at 55x/47x its FY2024/FY2025E earnings. Overhang of royalty hikes after five years would reflect in some trim down on the valuation multiple. Long-term growth story remains intact. We retain Buy with a reduced TP of Rs. 2,900.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We change FY23/24/FY25 EPS by 1.3%/-1.0%/-2.5% factoring 1) staggered 80bps increase in royalty rates beginning Feb23 2) 50bps cut in ad spends and 3) increase in other income. HUL continues to guide for QoQ GM/EBITDAM improvement in 4Q23 with stabilizing inflation, narrowing cost price gap and calibrated price hikes/cuts. 3Q23 saw another quarter of midsingle volumes led by double digit volume growth in Home Care, mid-single digit volume growth in Tea & high-teens volume growth in Foods. While HUL gained 10ppt margins between 2013 to 2023, however given current margin band of 23-25%, 80bps royalty rate increase over 3 years will curtail margin expansion. In the absence of meaningful margin expansion beyond FY24, sales and PAT growth will move in tandem which will prevent meaningful re-rating of the stock.



Outlook

We estimate 12.9% Sales and 15.7% PAT CAGR over FY22-25 and assign a DCF based target price of Rs2800 (Rs2798 earlier). We expect moderate returns in near term given valuations of 45.2xFY25 EPS. Accumulate on declines.

HDFC Securities' research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL reported marginally better revenue growth at 16% (HSIE 14%), with volume growth of 5% (HSIE 5%). Three-year revenue and volume CAGRs stand at 11% and 3.5%. Home care remained the showstopper, revenue/EBIT grew by 32/23% YoY. BPC clocked revenue/EBIT YoY growth of 10.5 %/flat and F&R reported 7/2% YoY growth. Consistent above-the-par delivery of home care has been helping the company register better than the industry show (reeling with a single-digit volume decline in the last nine months). GM and EBITDA margin improved sequentially (largely in-line) but tepid YoY, resulting in EBITDA growth of 8% (HSIE 7%). The company also announced an increase of 80bps in the royalty rate (to 3.45%) to be carried over the next three years (an increase of 45/25/10bps each year). With RM softening phase, the royalty increase will not pinch much but will limit the margin expansion.



Outlook

Our view remains the same: demand pick-up will be gradual while margin recovery will be faster. We cut EPS estimate for FY24/25 by 1/2%. We value the stock on 47x P/E on Dec-24E EPS to derive a TP of INR 2,400. Maintain REDUCE.

The rural market is showing some signs of improvement on easing inflation, robust sowing of winter crops and an increase in farm incomes, Hindustan Unilever’s brass told mediapersons after announcing better-than-expected numbers for the December quarter.

Value growth in rural markets was 5 percent year-on-year in the December quarter while volumes declined by 7 percent. “There is a long way to go before rural volumes come back, but we are definitely seeing some green shoots. In the July 2022 quarter, value growth in the rural market was negative 2 percent,” HUL chief executive officer Sanjiv Mehta said.

The FMCG behemoth's net material inflation (NMI) in the December quarter came down to 18 percent. In the June quarter it stood at 20 percent and , climbed to 22 percent in the September quarter. “The worst of inflation is behind us,” Mehta said.

As raw material prices eased, the company cuts soap and tea prices in the December quarter. “As inflation moves southwards, our gross margins improved but we did not pass it all to the bottom line and we increased our ad spends,” he said.

The management said the company was witnessing three key consumer trends: downgrading to lower unit packs in rural areas, a shift to larger packs by people with more disposable income and premiumisation in urban areas.

“Ice cream business has bounced back strongly. This is an indicator of people stepping out and out-of-home consumption increasing,” Mehta said.

That said, the company’s near-term outlook is ""cautiously optimistic"". “We remain focused on managing our business with agility, continue growing our consumer franchise whilst maintaining margins in a healthy range,” the top boss added.

HUL’s main focus will be to protect consumer franchise while protecting its business model of growth-led double-digit earnings per share model, the management said.

Sharing his expectations from the upcoming Budget 2023, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) CEO Sanjiv Mehta said he would like to see a further extension in timeline for the concessional 15 percent corporate tax rate for manufacturing companies.

“India is a fabulous place for manufacturing. Increasing the concessional tax rate for companies by another five years will help India capitalize on the China+1 and Europe+1 opportunities,” HUL's Mehta said in a press meet.

In September 2019, the government had said that any new domestic company incorporated on or after October 1, 2019, making fresh investment in manufacturing, would have an option to pay income-tax at the rate of 15 percent if they commenced their production on or before March 31, 2023.

This deadline was later extended till March 2024, and going by Mehta’s wish list for Budget 2023, it should be extended till 2029.

Second on his wish list is the simplification of capital gains tax. Currently, shares held for more than one year attract a 10 percent tax on long-term capital gains.

Gains arising from sale of immovable property and unlisted shares held for more than 2 years and debt instruments and jewellery held for over 3 years attract 20 percent long term capital gains tax.

“This complex structure must be simplified,” said Mehta.

Reportedly, the revenue department is looking at rationalising the rates as well as the holding period for calculating these taxes and an announcement is likely on February 1.

Last but certainly not the least, Mehta wants the government to improve India’s innovation quotient. “For this, the government will have to spend and encourage more research and development (R&D) in the country. This can make India an innovator,” he said.",323,0.999992847442627

Hindustan Unilever, India’s biggest fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, is expected to post double-digit growth in topline in the October-December 2022 quarter but its operating margins are likely to decline year-on-year (YoY) due to increasing advertising spends. HUL will report its numbers on January 19 after market hours.

According to a poll of brokerages, standalone revenue may come in at Rs 14,904 crore, a 13.8 percent YoY growth while profit after tax (PAT) is expected to increase 8.3 percent YoY to Rs 2,481 crore.

Sequentially, revenue will be more or less flat while net profit may rise 4.3 percent.

Revenue growth is expected to come on the back of further price hikes taken in laundry products. HUL is the maker of Surf Excel, Rin, Wheel and Breeze in this segment. Meanwhile, price cuts of 5-11 percent were taken in Lifebuoy and Lux soaps after a fall in palm oil prices, which will drive volume growth in soaps.

Volumes growth

HDFC Securities expects overall volumes to grow 5 percent YoY on a base of 2 percent YoY growth. Meanwhile, Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE) has pegged volume growth at 4 percent.

According to analysts, rural demand that plagued consumer companies in Q2 did not improve at all in Q3. “It has not improved structurally, but would look optically better only due to base effect. Rural demand for FMCG remains weak across the board,” as per Nuvama Research.

After Q2 results, the company’s CEO Sanjiv Mehta had said the FMCG market continued to remain “challenging”.

Coming to the segment-specific performance, KIE forecast a 28 percent YoY growth in home care, 6.8 percent growth in beauty & personal care and 7 percent growth in the food & refreshments portfolio. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) margin has been pegged at 23.5 percent, which indicates slight improvement sequentially due to the liquidation of high-cost raw material inventory.

However, margins are expected to contract on a YoY basis as the company has upped its advertising and promotion (A&P) spends. Plus, the food & refreshment segment continues to be impacted by high inflation in sugar, milk, barley and wheat, noted analysts at Nuvama Research.

This is largely thanks to the Indian economy being in a much better shape compared to the other economies globally. Unlike other developed markets, recession is not yet on the horizon in India, and inflation too is under control for now. Most broking firms expect this trend to continue in 2023, but with a rider: strong macros may not necessarily translate into big upsides for the stock market. They expect domestic-oriented sectors and companies to do well.

Below are the top picks from broking firms for 2023.

UBS on India Market Strategy

UBS has a target of 18,000 for the Nifty, as expensive valuations could limit upsides. India is still trading at a hefty premium to other emerging markets even after the recent underperformance vis-a-vis China.

UBS does not expect the government to step up spending in the run-up to the 2024 elections. The brokerage remains overweight on the Banking, Consumer Staples and Auto sectors. It is neutral on Telecom, Industrials, Energy and Utilities. On the underweight list are Metals and Mining, IT Services, and Consumer Discretionary.

Nomura on Indian Market Strategy

The broking firm sees Nifty at 19,030 in 2023 in the backdrop of uncertain global cues and sticky inflation. It expects the medium-term growth in earnings from a high-margin base to be largely dependent on broader economic growth.

The brokerage expects flattish market return through 2023 on the back of earnings risks and elevated market valuations, and prefers sectors with a domestic focus.

The brokerage remains overweight on Financials, Consumer Staples, Infra/Construction and Telecom. It remains neutral on Healthcare, Oil and Gas. It has retained underweight rating on Metals, Consumer Discretionary and IT Services.

Credit Suisse

The brokerage prefers domestic cyclicals: Financials (SBI, BoB), Cement, and Construction (L&T). It prefers Staples over Discretionary, and are underweight on Industrials, IT and Metals.

The brokerage has focused on sectors that are cheap, based on two-year forward earnings estimates, and has a lower risk of earnings per share (EPS) downgrades. It continues to remain overweight, both on banks and NBFCs. State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, IndusInd Bank and ICICI Bank are its top picks. The brokerage also is overweight on cement despite negative impact of USD/ INR, primarily due to the expected turnaround in construction.

Motilal Oswal

HUL has announced twin acquisition of OZiva & Wellbeing Nutrition which are present in the premium segment of Health & Wellness with presence in Vitamin, Minerals and Supplements space with potential market size of Rs300bn over the next 5 years.

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL remains a preferred pick among large consumer goods companies because of its leading position in 85% of the portfolio (helps it take pricing actions in highly penetrated categories), gain in market share (consistent market share improvement despite demand slowdown), expanded distribution reach of 9 million outlets, strong cash flow generation and consistent dividend payouts. The company is focusing on premiumisation, market development, distribution expansion and digitalisation to drive consistent double-digit earnings growth in the medium to long run. However, a large focus will be on strong topline growth with moderate expansion in OPM. A gradual revival in the rural economy, good traction to winter care portfolio and price cuts post raw material price correction will help posting better volume growth in H2FY2023 compared to H1. Significant decline in prices of key inputs (including palm oil) will help the OPM to improve from Q3FY2023.

Outlook

We re-iterate a Buy on Hindustan Unilever (HUL) with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs. 3,005. The stock trades at 53x/45x its FY2024/25E EPS, which is at a discount to its last five-year historical average.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We attended HUVR’s analyst meet where the management reiterated its strategy to grow the consumer franchise through 1) competitive growth in core offerings 2) premiumisation initiatives 3) market development activities 4) winning in future channels like MT/E-com. HUL continues to leverage its WIMI strategy to drive penetration by providing differentiated products across regions. The company continues to nurture future categories which includes body wash, liquid detergent, hair conditioners, face wash, body lotions, sunscreens, BB/CC creams etc. We believe market development initiatives in emerging categories and higher share in MT/E-com can result in growth acceleration in coming years. HUL will continue to compete at the bottom of pyramid as large mass of customers will take time to graduate to more premium products. We believe this will continue to provide competitive growth to the company. Adoption of technology across the organization continues to help the company predict demand patterns, take pricing decisions, reduce time for innovation amongst other benefits.



Outlook

HUVR’s long term story remains intact (24-25% margin guidance) with input costs having peaked out. We estimate 16.6% PAT CAGR over FY22-25 and arrive at DCF based target price of Rs2798 (unchanged). Maintain Accumulate.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

The new sub categories, created over the last 10 years, now contribute ~20% to sales and are much more profitable than the base business. The company’s Premium portfolio contributed 33% toward sales in FY22, up from 22% in FY12. Yet, there still lies significant opportunity for growth. In the last 12 months alone, the Premium Beauty Business Unit has grown 2x the market rate. India’s per capita FMCG spend of USD46 is extremely low compared to other emerging markets such as Indonesia, China, Thailand, and the Philippines, all of which have a per capita FMCG spend ranging between USD100 and USD440. As highlighted in our FY22 Annual report note, the company is building an extremely strong technological backbone. Its B2B app, “Shikhar”, now covers over half of its direct reach outlets. The company’s digital demand capture is growing rapidly and stands at 25% of total demand. The management also indicated Winning in Many India (WiMI) based customization with different formulations of Brooke Bond tea, Lux Soap, and Surf Excel to cater to various parts of the country. With the uncertainty in rural recovery and no significant correction in commodity costs, barring palm oil and crude derivatives, earnings growth for the next few months is expected to remain muted. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock on account of superior moats over consumer staples peers. We believe the moats will help drive healthy mid-teens to late-teens earnings growth, similar to the levels in the five years before Covid.



Outlook

There is no material change in our forecasts. In view of near-term challenges for all staples, we bring down HUVR’s target multiples to 55x from 60x. We reiterate our Buy rating with a TP of INR2,900 (55x Sep’24E EPS).

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

While headline numbers were close to expectations, this was aided by lower ad-spends and employee costs, which somewhat offset the lowest gross margin levels since 4QFY12. Management commentary indicated that material cost pressures may have peaked out, but with ad-spends reviving, we expect EBITDA margin improvement to earlier levels to arrive with a lag. Post this, we expect HUVR to get back to the erstwhile pace of mid-teens earnings growth that it consistently demonstrated in the five years before covid. We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock.



Outlook

While the pace of earnings recovery to double digit and then to mid-teens will be gradual, improving narrative will keep multiples high for the bellwether FMCG company. Rolling forward to Sep’24E EPS and maintaining our target multiple of 60x result in our target price of INR3,080 – 16% upside to CMP. We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock.

Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is still struggling with inflation in key raw materials even as it sees the price of palm oil stabilise, an important commodity for the soap manufacturer. Given the scenario, the company’s management is “cautiously optimistic in the near term.”

“Except palm oil, which has seen a meaningful correction from its peak, most commodities remain volatile and elevated. The surge in the US dollar is adding to further inflation. CPI inflation continues to remain above the RBI threshold. In the near term, we are cautiously optimistic,” said Ritesh Tiwari, executive director, finance and IT and chief financial officer, HUL, said while addressing a media briefing after reporting the company’s second quarter (Q2) results.

According to the company’s management, the growth in the quarter ahead will continue to be price-led, while softening in some commodities, largely, palm oil will help marginally narrow the price versus cost gap leading to sequential improvement in gross margin.

HUL’s net material inflation (NMI) in the June quarter stood at 20 percent, while it climbed to 22 percent in the September quarter. The company’s CEO and MD Sanjiv Mehta indicated that its NMI in the December quarter is expected to be a bit lower than the September quarter.

The CEO also said that the manufacturers will reduce the prices of their products only after prices subside.

“The net material inflation was 22 percent in the quarter that has gone by….which is pretty significant. And so, once that starts going down, then the manufacturers and marketers will start passing down the benefit of lower commodity price to the consumers,” Sanjiv Mehta added.

HUL slashed the price of its soap brands such as Lux and Lifebuoy by about 5-11 percent in October in the Western region of the country. The price cut, as per the management during the media briefing, came on the back of a reduction in palm oil prices. Palm oil is a key ingredient for soap manufacturers and contributes as much as 40 percent to the cost of making soap.

The company, however, during the quarter also took calibrated price increases across fabric wash and household care portfolios on account of inflation in other raw materials.

HUL reported a standalone net profit of Rs 2,616 crore in Q2, a year-on-year (YoY) climb of 20 percent as compared to Rs 2,187 crore reported in the same period last year. The company’s standalone revenue from operations jumped 16 percent during the period and stood at Rs 14,751 crore. The company reported volume growth of 4 percent during the period. But its gross margins dipped 588 basis points YoY to 44.9 percent and EBITDA margins dipped 176 basis points YoY to 23.3 percent.",485,-0.046562532583872475

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on October 21 declared a 20 percent year-on-year rise in standalone profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 2,616 crore for the September quarter (Q2FY23). In the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, net profit stood at Rs 2,187 crore.

Sequentially, net profit grew 14 percent from Rs 2,289 crore in the June quarter.

Standalone revenue from operations came in at Rs 14,751 crore, an increase of 16 percent from the year-ago period. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the quarter stood at Rs 3,377 crore, growing 8 percent from Rs 3,132 crore in the same quarter last year.

EBITDA margin declined 170 basis points YoY to 22.9 percent. While revenue and profit beat Street estimates, the EBITDA margin was sharply below.

""In H1 2022-23 we have added an incremental turnover of more than Rs 4,000 crore,"" Sanjiv Mehta, CEO and Managing Director said.

Along with Q2FY23 numbers, HUL's board also declared an interim dividend of Rs 17 per equity share of the face value of Re1 each for the financial year ending 31 March, 2023.

The company reported underlying volume growth of 4 percent, lower than Street's expectation of 5 percent.

Home Care

Revenue grew 34 percent YoY to Rs 5,143 crore with volumes growing in double-digits. ""Both Fabric Wash and Household Care grew in high double-digits with all parts of the portfolio performing well,"" said the company.

The FMCG major took calibrated price increases across fabric wash and household care portfolios as input costs remain inflated at significantly high levels.

Beauty & Personal Care

Segment revenue grew 11 percent YoY to Rs 5,561 crore driven by outperformance in the premium portfolio. Skin cleansing delivered strong double-digit growth led by Lux, Dove and Pears, the company said.

In Skin Care and Color Cosmetics, the premium portfolio outperformed delivering double-digit growth, and Hair Care further strengthened its market leadership, informed HUL.

Foods & Refreshment

Segment revenue grew 4 percent YoY to Rs 3,755 crore driven by good performance in Foods, Coffee and Ice-cream.

""Ice Cream had another strong quarter with double-digit growth on a very high base led by robust performance across brands and formats.

According to an average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol, revenue is expected to rise 15 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 14,678 crore. Net profit is expected to jump 10.5 percent from corresponding quarter of last fiscal to Rs 2,417 crore. Sequentially, net profit is likely grow by 5.6 percent.

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect continued strength in home care revenue growth on the back of price hikes in laundry products. They have also factored in improving trends in beauty and personal care (BPC) segment as skin cleansing products witnessed a pause in price hikes. Their forecast stands at 29 percent YoY growth for home care, 13.5 percent YoY growth for beauty and personal care and 9 percent YoY jump in the foods and refreshments portfolio.

Price hikes taken by the company was around 12 percent to combat inflation, said Nuvama Research, adding that it will help boosting HUL's revenue.

Despite the muted performance from rural markets, experts have pegged volume growth at 5 percent. Meanwhile, EBITDA margins are seen declining by 110 basis points YoY to 23.5 percent this quarter due to consumption of high-cost inventory. The decline in margins would have been steeper, had it not been for management’s cost rationalization on advertising and other discretionary spends, according to experts.

According to brokerage firm BNP Paribas, margins will improve from H2FY22 as crude and palm oil costs moderate further and price hikes start reflecting fully. In the first week of October, the company also took a price cut in its popular brands Lifebuoy and Lux to drive demand and volume growth.

FMCG firms Hindustan Unilever Ltd and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) have cut prices of some soap brands by up to 15 per cent amid palm oil and other raw materials turning relatively cheaper.

HUL has reduced prices of its offerings under popular soap brands Lifebuoy and Lux by 5 to 11 per cent in the western region.

Godrej Group arm GCPL, which owns soap brand Godrej No 1, has also reduced prices of soaps by 13 to 15 per cent. Analysts opine that the reduction in prices would help drive growth in volumes in the second half of current fiscal year, especially since overall demand remains sluggish due to high inflation.

One of the reasons for the price reduction is the decline in global prices of palm oil and other raw materials, they added. Commenting on the development, GCPL CFO Sameer Shah said:"" With commodity prices coming down, GCPL is one of the first FMCG companies to pass on the price reduction benefit to consumers.""

""For soaps specifically, GCPL has reduced prices between 13 to 15 per cent. We reduced the price of the bundle pack (five units of 100 gm each) of Godrej No.1 soap from Rs 140 to Rs 120,"" he added.

An HUL spokesperson told PTI:"" For Lifebuoy and Lux, there has been a price drop in the West region,"" he said without elaborating on the quantum of reduction and whether similar cuts will be made in other regions also.

However, according to reports, prices of these soap brands have been reduced by 5-11 per cent. The spokesperson however denied reports about reduction in prices of other brands such as Surf, Rin, Wheel, and Dove.

Commenting on the price cut by HUL, Edelweiss Financial Services Executive Vice President Abneesh Roy said it is a proactive step by the company to retain a market share in an era of falling raw material prices. ""When raw material prices fall, regional players tend to come back."" He expects this to drive volume growth for HUL in H2FY23 and FY24.

""In the past one year, volume growth for HUL was impacted due to grammage cuts and price hikes. Now the reverse is happening with grammage increase/price cuts,"" Roy said. FMCG companies continued to face challenges of high retail inflation and slowdown in rural areas in September quarter 2022.

The weakness in global peers following rate hike by the US Federal Reserve weighed on the Indian equity markets on September 22. While the benchmark share indices fell half a percent each, the broader markets performed better with Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices rising a third of a percent and six-tenth of a percent respectively.

The BSE Sensex declined more than 300 points to 59,120, and the Nifty50 fell 89 points to 17,630, dragged by banking & financial services, and select IT stocks.

Stocks that were in action and performed better than broader markets included Tata Chemicals which was the second largest gainer in the futures & options segment. The stock rose nearly 5 percent to settle at Rs 1,150 apiece. It has seen a robust bullish engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above average volumes.

Schneider Electric Infrastructure shares surged over 9 percent to Rs 166.70, the highest closing level since November 1, 2016 and formed strong bullish candle on the daily charts with above average volumes. On monthly charts, the stock has seen a breakout of long downward sloping resistance trend line adjoining June 1, 2015 and April 1, 2022, and the uptrend has been maintained for third consecutive month.

Hindustan Unilever was up 2.6 percent at Rs 2,693, the highest closing level since October 5, 2021, continuing uptrend for fourth straight session and formed bullish candle on the daily charts with healthy volumes.

Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Hindustan Unilever

After a short term correction, the stock took the support near Rs 2,500 level and reversed sharply. In this week so far, the stock rallied over 6 percent and formed long bullish candle on daily and weekly charts, which is broadly positive.

We are of the view that, as long as the stock is trading above 50 days SMA (simple moving average) or Rs 2,610, the uptrend texture is likely to continue.

Above which, the stock could move up to Rs 2,750. Further upside may also continue which could lift the stock up to Rs 2,800. However, below Rs 2,610 uptrend would be vulnerable.

Tata Chemicals

After a short term correction, the stock has formed double bottom formation near Rs 1,100. On last Thursday, the stock bounced back sharply, rallied over 5 percent.

On daily charts the stock has formed long bullish candle and currently it is comfortably trading above 20 days SMA (simple moving average) level of Rs 1,127.

Unless it is trading below Rs 1,105, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target Rs 1,195-Rs 1,225 fresh buying can be considered now and on dips, if any between Rs 1,155 and Rs 1,125 levels with a stop-loss below Rs 1,105.

The stock has rallied nearly 10 percent on September 22. On last Thursday, it quickly cleared the short term resistance of Rs 160 with a strong volume activity and after a promising intraday rally, it succeeded to close above the same.

Despite weak market conditions the stock maintained its strong momentum throughout the day. On the short term time frame, the stock has formed strong price volume breakout pattern.

The texture of the pattern suggest breakout action will continue in the near term if stock succeeds to trade above Rs 158 level.

For the swing traders, Rs 158 would be the sacrosanct level, trading above the same we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 180-185.

Non-durables companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) and ITC Ltd expect inflation to disrupt business for another quarter unless the monsoon revives the rural economy and spurs consumption. Top executives of both companies recently indicated that while the prices of some inputs have eased in June, those of several others remained elevated and were even at 10-year highs.

“There are some early signs of moderation but the situation is dynamic and we need to monitor it,” ITC chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said while addressing a virtual press conference last week after announcing the results for the first quarter.

Puri indicated that the trajectory of cost increases is difficult to predict given the supply-side challenges and green inflation as agri-commodities are being diverted for biofuel.

“I sense that there will be some moderation as the signs show but inflation will remain at an elevated level as compared to the past,” he added.

HUL, another fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant, also expects inflation to persist for at least another quarter. According to the company’s management, the commodity markets have inflated further sequentially in the June quarter and prices of most commodities are at very high levels.

“While the correction in some commodities like palm oil happened in the end weeks of June, we had already secured our inventory and incurred high costs on it,” said Ritesh Tiwari, executive director of finance and chief financial officer, HUL.

“Due to consumption of this inventory (in Q2) and many other commodities like crude oil, caustic soda and plastics, whose prices remain elevated, our September quarter net material inflation will be higher than June quarter,” he added.

The price of crude oil, according to HUL, was up 60 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in the June quarter, while caustic soda was 125 percent costlier. The prices of two other key commodities—palm oil and polyethylene—were up 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively, y-o-y in the June quarter.

Margins to remain impacted

Given the challenges the inflationary trend pose, margins of these companies will remain under pressure in the coming quarters, indicated HUL and analysts. FMCG companies for several quarters now have been struggling with dented margins as inflation kicked up costs but a tepid demand scenario made it difficult to pass on the increase to consumers. HUL’s gross margins and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins for the quarter gone by were down by 327 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

“In the June quarter, the net material inflation was about 20 percent of our total cost. In the September quarter, the impact on the books would be based on the inventory that we have booked already and if the prices taper down going ahead, then we will see an impact coming in our books from the December quarter onwards,” Sanjiv Mehta, CEO and MD, HUL, said last week.

HUL’s top management has indicated that the second quarter will see more inflation than the first quarter and margins will remain under pressure and softening of some commodity prices will positively impact sequential margins from the third quarter onwards.

Eye on the monsoon

FMCG companies are now relying on a good monsoon now, which they hope will revive the rural economy, a big catchment area for these firms. Demand has been tepid for several quarters cityside as well.

The annual rainfall season, however, so far has remained below expectations in some parts. “There are still pockets of the country, especially, the central belt, where the monsoon has not been good so far. But if it covers up, going ahead then it will be one good factor,” said Mehta.

According to data from analytics firm Nielsen, sales volumes of the FMCG segment fell 5 percent in the quarter gone by. While value growth came in at 7 percent for the first quarter of FY23, it was, however, mostly price-led. While the urban segment is faring slightly better than rural India, indicated an industry executive, when seen over a three-year period, the volume growth of both segments has been flat.

Government initiatives such as fertiliser subsidy should also benefit the economy and help the country out of this crisis, said HUL’s Mehta.

On his part, Puri of ITC indicated that better realisations by farmers can help revive the economy.",748,-0.2028610843878526

Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) beat market expectations with a 14 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit and a 20 percent YoY increase in net revenue

The company’s performance in the quarter was backed by a number of factors, but most notably by market share gains in various categories and a jump in sales by volume even as reduced the weight of some packaged products.

According to securities firms tracking the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, HUL’s performance is an indication that the big FMCG companies are set to gain from the inflationary scenario given their ability to better navigate the challenge.

“HUL’s superior performance is a sheer outcome of market outperformance, which in turn is a result of (1) large players benefitting from inflation in commodity-sensitive categories and (2) continued work on category development (both formats and premiumisation). There was some benefit of (impacted) bases albeit not altering the underlying trend,” said a note by ICICI Securities.

Despite consumers switching to cheaper and generic products from more expensive brandnames, HUL gained market share in over 75 percent of its portfolio during the quarter. Sales volumes jumped 6 percent YoY even as it reduced weights of of several of its packaged products to protect margins given the steep inflation in commodities.

HUL’s Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) grew 14 percent, Jefferies wrote in a note, adding that the performance beat its own as well as consensus estimates.

This was led sales volumes and came despite a 2-3 percentage point impact of “grammage reduction in the low unit products,” said Jefferies.

HUL reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,391 crore in the June quarter (Q1), a jump of 13.85 percent YoY over the Rs 2,100 crore profit it posted in the same period last year. The company's revenue rose 19.46 percent YoY to Rs 14,331 crore.

The company's EBITDA margin during the period was 23.2 percent and declined by 110 basis points YoY and 144 basis points QoQ. The gross margin dropped 327 basis points YoY and 212 basis points QoQ.

One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Cost cutting, reducing pack sizes

Smaller players in the FMCG are expected to gain in an inflationary scenario as consumers switch to cheaper products as they trim household budgets.

Yet, several small FMCG companies suffered a decline in sales volumes in recent months, showed data from data analytics and brand consulting firm Kantar. For instance, South Indian detergent bar brands Ponvandu and Oorvashi lost 17 percent and 8 percent of their sales by volume, respectively, in February, March and April compared to the same period last year, Kantar data showed.

The overall detergent bar category grew 2.3 percent in the period, according to Kantar.

The ability of large FMCG companies to contain inflation through cost-cutting measures, reduction of their product weights and other initiatives helps them gain market share over the unorganized segment and smaller brands, who have to resort to price hikes to save their margins.

“When inflation hits, the small pack of an established brand becomes more lucrative than the large pack of a local brand as the price differential shrinks. This, in turn, negatively hits the local brands to an extent,” said Kantar.

HUL CEO and MD Sanjiv Mehta indicated the trend in a conversation with Moneycontrol in April.

“When times are tough, people can’t afford to waste money. And when they can’t afford to waste money, they go after trusted large brands, provided they are accessible,” Mehta said.

“We straddle the price benefit pyramid. Even if there is downgrading, we have brands to cater to that,” he added.

Inflationary concerns remain

HUL’s management expects inflationary pressure to persist for another quarter and indicated that commodity price rise may be higher sequentially in the September quarter than in the June quarter.

“In June quarter, the net material inflation was about 20 percent of our total cost. In the September quarter, the impact on the books would be based on the inventory that we have booked already and if the prices taper down going ahead then we will see an impact coming in our books from the December quarter onwards,” Mehta said.

According to the company’s management, price rises in the commodity markets accelerated sequentially in the June quarter and prices of most commodities are already at very high levels.

“While the correction in some commodities like palm oil happened in the end weeks of June, we had already secured our inventory and incurred high costs on it,” said Ritesh Tiwari, executive director of finance and chief financial officer at HUL.

“Due to consumption of this inventory (in Q2) and many other commodities like crude oil, caustic soda and plastics, whose prices remain elevated, our September quarter net material inflation will be higher than June quarter,” he added.

The price of crude oil, according to HUL, was up 60 percent year-on-year (YoY) in the June quarter, while caustic soda was 125 percent higher.

How is downtrading different from downgrading?

HUL's results show that people have been downtrading and not downgrading. Both downtrading and downgrading are consumer responses to inflation. The first is when consumers pick smaller volume packs, and the second is when they pick cheaper brands. Downtrading can intensify shrinkflation, which is when brands do not increase prices with inflation, but reduce their pack sizes and keep the prices steady. Consumer staples brands do this because they know that their consumers are sensitive to a price level–like Rs 5 for a packet of biscuit–which is called the magic price point.",99,

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR’s sales and volumes were ahead of expectations in 1QFY23 but gross profit, EBITDA, PBT and PAT were broadly in line. Margin pressure led by commodity cost inflation is likely to persist in 2QFY23E, before sequential improvement from 3QFY23E onwards. Within the premium personal care portfolio, skin care is ahead of pre-Covid levels although color cosmetics portfolio is still below the pre-pandemic levels despite the recent recovery in mobility. Signs of incipient earnings growth recovery are getting better – but only gradually – fueled by possible good monsoon, fertilizer subsidy, gradual reduction in commodity costs from the decadal high levels and recovery in premium personal care portfolio. We maintain BUY with a TP of INR3,000.

Outlook

While the pace of earnings recovery to double digit and then mid-teens will be gradual, improving narrative will keep multiples high for the bellwether FMCG company. Rolling forward to Jun’24E EPS and maintaining our target multiple of 60x result in our target price of INR3,000 – 17% upside to CMP. Maintain BUY.

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) posted strong numbers amid a tough environment with revenues and PAT growing by ~20% and 17% y-o-y in Q1FY2023. Domestic volumes grew by 6% versus a decline of 4-5% for the industry. Market share gains in over 75% of portfolio and consistent growth in some premium categories helped HUL post resilient sales volume growth. Management expects demand to improve in H2FY2023 on back of expected cool-off in general inflation and likely recovery in rural demand. Raw material inflation stood at 20% in Q1FY2023 (price increases stood at 12%). Management expects margins to remain under pressure in Q2FY2023 due to high input cost inflation on a y-o-y basis. However, recent correction in the commodity price inflation would reflect from Q3FY2023 with a sequential uptick in OPM.

Outlook

Stock has seen good run-up of 17% in the past month and is currently trading at 60x/50x its FY2023E/24E earnings. We maintain our Buy on the stock with a revised price target of Rs. 2,850.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL has guided for QoQ margin pressure in 2Q23 as high priced inventory, input cost inflation and inadequate price increases will pose near term challenge on margins. 1Q23 displayed mid-single volumes led by high single digit volume growth in Fabric wash. However, we remain constructive on the longer term structural story given 1) market share gains in 75% of portfolio 2) strong innovation pipeline 3) scale up in emerging categories (Green Tea, Fabric Conditioner, Liquid Detergents, Liquid Dishwash, Hair conditioner) 4) distribution gains from strategies like WIMI and SHIKHAR and 5) faster growth in premium portfolio (2x than company growth).



Outlook

We expect 13.5% Sales and 18.9% PAT CAGR over FY22-24 and assign a DCF based target price of Rs 2699 (NA earlier). We change FY23/24 EPS by -3.1%/2.7% factoring in calibrated price hikes, cost synergies and higher ad spends. We assign Accumulate rating to the stock (From Under Review), however post 22% run up in stock price in last few weeks, we expect incremental returns to come at a more moderate pace.

Sustained price rise in key commodities such as crude oil, crude-linked derivatives, barley and coffee and a deflating rupee are expected to result in higher inflation in the months ahead even as prices of a few commodities such as palm oil inch down, the management of FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) indicated at a post-earnings press briefing on July 19.

“In June quarter, the net material inflation was about 20 percent of our total cost. In the September quarter, the impact on the books would be based on the inventory that we have booked already and if the prices taper down going ahead then we will see an impact coming in our books from the December quarter onwards,” Sanjiv Mehta, CEO and MD, HUL said.

According to the company’s management, the commodity markets have inflated further sequentially in the June quarter and prices of most commodities are at very high levels.

“While the correction in some commodities like palm oil happened in the end weeks of June, we had already secured our inventory and incurred high costs on it,” said Ritesh Tiwari, executive director finance and chief financial officer, HUL.

“Due to consumption of this inventory (in Q2) and many other commodities like crude oil, caustic soda and plastics, whose prices remain elevated, our September quarter net material inflation will be higher than June quarter,” he added.

The price of crude oil, according to HUL, was up 60 percent year-on-year (YoY) in the June quarter, while caustic soda was 125 percent higher. The prices of other key commodities – palm oil and polyethylene – were up 50 percent and 25 percent YoY in the June quarter, respectively.

Demand concerns remain

The slowdown in demand, a trend which emerged in the first quarter of FY22, continues to mar the rural as well as urban economy, said the company’s management. According to Nielsen data, the sales volume of the FMCG segment de-grew by 5 percent in the quarter gone by. Value growth of seven percent was recorded in Q1 of FY23, however, it was mostly price-led.

Mehta indicated that while the urban regions were faring better than rural India, it was mostly on account of base impact. “Last year, urban India witnessed a slowdown due to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This year the region has seen recovery as compared to that same period in FY22 and hence urban is looking better than rural areas,” he said.

Mehta, however, also added that over a three-year period the volume growth of both urban and rural regions remains flat.

The FMCG segment is now pinning its hopes on the monsoon, which has remained below expectation in some regions so far in the country.

“There are still pockets of the country, especially, the central belt, where the monsoon has not been good so far. But if it covers up going ahead then it will be one good factor,” said Mehta.

The government initiatives such as fertiliser subsidy should also benefit the economy and help the country out of this crisis, said the HUL CEO.

Earnings beat expectations

HUL reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,391 crore in the June quarter (Q1), a jump of 13.85 percent YoY, as compared to the Rs 2,100 crore posted in the same period last year. The company's revenue from operations rose 19.46 percent YoY to Rs 14,331 crore in Q1 FY23.

The company's EBITDA margin during the period stood at 23.2 percent and declined by 110 basis points YoY and 144 basis points QoQ , while its gross margins dropped 327 basis points YoY and 212 basis points QoQ.

“Numbers are better than expectations on almost all fronts. However, HUL stock has moved up sharply from Rs 1,900 to Rs 2,550 in the past four months. Although overall monsoon numbers are now above normal, one concern is the huge deficit in high-population states like UP, Bihar, Bengal, and Jharkhand. For rural recovery, these states are critical, hence remains a key monitorable,” said a note by Edelweiss.",680,0.09965685697702262

The market ended yet another volatile week on a mildly positive note, with the Nifty smartly defending the crucial 15,700 mark on July 1. On the first day of the July series, most sectors, barring oil & gas, helped the market recover and narrow losses.

The Nifty rose 53 points to close at 15,752 during the week ended July 1, taking support at 15,500 as well as 15,700. After getting support at around 15,190 in the previous two weeks, the index formed higher lows in the last week, which experts say is a good sign, with resistance at 15,900-16,180.

The index formed a kind of a bearish Hammer pattern on the weekly scale, and on the daily charts, a bullish hammer, which is generally a trend-reversal pattern.

Oscillators or sentiment indicators showed a marginal uptick on the weekly charts. The relative strength index moved up from 40.49 levels to 41.1. The Stochastic gave a positive crossover, climbing up from 17.6 to 19.4 levels.

On the higher side, he said 15,850-15,900 is seen as the immediate near-term resistance on the lower timeframe charts and a breakout should lead the Nifty to the retracement marks of 15,990 and 16,180.

Here are the top 10 trading ideas from experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on closing prices on July 1:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,107 | Stop-Loss: Rs 970 | Target: Rs 1,180-1,330 | Return: 7-20 percent

The stock is forming a series of higher tops and higher bottoms, which is extremely positive. It has again surpassed its previous high of Rs 1,060 last week with the decisive dismissal. Such a pattern helps the stock to move into a new bullish segment.

The level of Rs 970 will be a great support for the stock and as long as it trades above it, the chances of reaching Rs 1,180 or Rs 1,330 will be bright.

The strategy should be to buy at Rs 1,110 and add more at Rs 1,000. Place the last stop-loss at Rs 970.

Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 11,323 | Stop-Loss: Rs 10,700 | Target: Rs 13,000 | Return: 15 percent

The stock has bounced back strongly after completing a corrective pattern at Rs 10,727, which is positive. The breakout is decisive and depending on the formation, it can extend to Rs 12,300-13,000 in the next few weeks.

The strategy should be to buy partly at current levels and on the downside, at Rs 10,900. Protect long position with the final stop-loss at Rs 10,700.

Cipla: Buy | LTP: Rs 949.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 900 | Target: Rs 1,030 | Return: 8.5 percent

After hitting the support at Rs 900, it is forming a double bottom. It has taken almost a month, which is positive for the stock and may help it move upwards.

It is advisable to buy between Rs 950 and Rs 930 for targets of Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,080, where the stock has a multiple resistance zone. Keep stop-loss at Rs 900.

Expert: Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking

Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,282.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,230 | Target: Rs 2,390 | Return: 5 percent

We’ve been seeing decent buying in the FMCG space and HUL is trading in sync with the trend. After a marginal dip, it has formed a fresh buying pivot while holding firmly above the support zone of multiple moving averages (100 and 200 exponential moving averages) and looks set for a surge.

We recommend creating fresh longs within the Rs 2,275-2,285 level.

United Breweries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,495.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,400 | Target: Rs 1,675 | Return: 12 percent

UBL has been trading with the corrective bias for the last eight months. Though it made a couple of attempts to surpass the resistance hurdle of the declining trendline but failed.

At the same time, it upheld the support zone at around Rs 1,400. The chart pattern and positioning of indicators are pointing towards the possibility of a breakout soon. We recommend accumulating within the Rs 1,485-1,495 zone.

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst, HDFC Securities

Godrej Properties: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,227.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,160 | Target: Rs 1,310 | Return: 7 percent

After correcting from a high of Rs 2,598 in October 2021, Godrej Properties found support at around Rs 1,130 in June 2022. The stock has found support around the same level recently past and it also coincides with the 200 weeks simple moving average (SMA). On July 1, the stock reversed its downtrend by crossing its previous swing high of Rs 1,230 during the day.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals, as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-period SMA on the 60 minutes chart. Momentum readings like the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), too, are in a rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential upsides.

With the realty index also showing signs of strength, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 1,220 and 1,224, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,160 and target at Rs 1,310.

Mphasis: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,241 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,370 | Target: Rs 2,040 | Return: 9 percent

Mphasis is in a short-term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks after breaking the support of Rs 2,824. Recently, the stock slipped from the 20-day SMA and ended lower on the back of above-average volumes.

With the stock trading below key moving averages like the 20 and 50-day SMAs, the 14-week RSI in a decline mode and the intermediate technical setup looking negative, we believe the stock is headed lower in the coming weeks.

We recommend a sell between Rs 2,235 and Rs 2,245, with a stop-loss at Rs 2,370 and the target at Rs 2,040.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical & Derivative Research Analyst, Reliance Securities

Ashok Leyland: Buy | LTP: Rs 146.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 134 | Target: Rs 166 | Return: 13.5 percent

In the last week, the stock surpassed its medium-term supply zone (placed between Rs 139 and Rs 142) convincingly and rose to a seven-month high of Rs 149 with better volumes.

Its key technical indicators are positively poised on major timeframe charts. The stock has the potential to move towards lifetime high of Rs 153.5 initially and Rs 166 subsequently, which coincides with its prior highs (Rs 139 and Rs 153.5), connecting a rising trendline.

Havells India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,111 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,037 | Target: Rs 1,230 | Return: 11 percent

The stock formed a strong base around its prior lows (Rs 958 and Rs 1,037) connecting the rising trendline and is poised for a rebound.

Its daily RSI has witnessed a bullish divergence after a trendline breakout, which signals strength in the stock.

This could lead the stock towards Rs 1,190 and Rs 1,230 subsequently. In case of decline, the stock will find support around its prior swing low.

SBI Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,099.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,033 | Target: Rs 1,185 | Return: 8 percent

The stock respected its lower band of the ascending channel and is poised for the next leg of upmove.

Its daily RSI again reversed from the bull market support zone (33-40) and gave a buy signal. In the past, the stock witnessed a decent rise after an identical buy signal.

The stock could move towards the upper band of the channel in the short term. On the lower side, the stock will find support around the lowest level of March 2022.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com

United Spirits: Buy | LTP: Rs 788.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 754 | Target: Rs 830-850 | Return: 5-8 percent

In the last few months, the prices have corrected within a channel and the stock has reversed from the support end of the pattern. On July 1, the stock also gave breakout from a falling trendline resistance with better than its daily average volumes.

The 'RSI Smoothed' oscillator has recently given a positive crossover and is indicating a positive momentum. Looking at the technical evidence, we expect the stock to rally higher in the near term.

Traders can buy the stock in the range of Rs 790-785 for potential targets of Rs 830 and Rs 850 in two-three weeks. The stop-loss should be placed below Rs 754.

Chalet Hotels: Buy | LTP: Rs 327.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 316 | Target: Rs 349 | Return: 6.5 percent

The stock had seen a time-wise correction in the last couple of months, where prices traded within a range and relatively outperformed the broader markets. On July 1, the stock gave a breakout from the resistance-end of this consolidation and hence the stock seems to have resumed its uptrend.

The short-term moving average has given a positive crossover to the medium term and the relative strength index (RSI) oscillator is in buy mode and has indicated a positive momentum.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 328-325 for a potential target of Rs 349 in the near term. The stop-loss can be placed below Rs 316.

Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) CEO and Managing Director, Sanjiv Mehta will be appointed the President Commissioner (Non-Executive Chairman) of Unilever Indonesia, the company said in a press release on June 30.

Unilever Indonesia is a public company and the appointment is subject to approval from shareholders at Unilever Indonesia’s next Extraordinary General Meeting to be held on July 28, 2022.

“He will join the company’s Board of Commissioners and chair the same in a non-executive capacity,” the company said.

Mehta will continue to be Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and President, Unilever South Asia. He is also a member of the Unilever Leadership Executive.

The Board of Commissioners of Unilever Indonesia is responsible for overseeing the policy and the implementation of the corporate governance agenda of the company and providing advice to the Board of Directors in managing the company.

Established in 1933, Unilever Indonesia is one of Indonesia’s foremost Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies with a turnover of $2.7 billion as of December 2021. Unilever Indonesia has nearly 5,000 employees. It manufactures over 40 Unilever brands including local jewels Bango and Sariwangi across nine factories situated in the country.

Unilever announced a restructuring in January that is aimed at helping the company generate 600 million euros of cost savings while adopting a leaner structure. According to company executives, Unilever’s matrix structure, under which the teams report to several heads, has become redundant and was no longer working. The proposed new organisation model will result in a 15 percent reduction in senior management roles, while junior management roles will be trimmed by 5 percent, equivalent to about 1,500 roles globally, the company said in a statement.",298,

The market seems to be oversold and hence it snapped six-day losing streak with support from FMCG, and IT stocks and the HDFC twins on June 20. The BSE Sensex gained more than 200 points to close at 51,598, while the Nifty50 defended its Friday's low of 15,183 and rose 57 points to 15,350.

However, auto, metal, realty and select banks stocks remained under pressure. The broader markets also stayed under control of bears on weak breadth.

The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices fell 2.3 percent and 3.2 percent respectively as about six shares declined for every share rising on the NSE.

India VIX, the fear index that measures volatility in the market, fell by 1.51 percent to 22.41 levels, indicating that the market was volatile and in favour of bears.

Stocks that were in action and sharply outperformed frontline indices included Pidilite Industries, HUL and HDFC which were among top five gainers in the futures & options segment on Monday.

Pidilite Industries gained 5.4 percent at Rs 2,106.65, Hindustan Unilever rose 4 percent t Rs 2,196, and HDFC climbed 4 percent to Rs 2,135.

Here's what Vidnyan Sawant of GEPL Capital recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:.

Pidilite Industries

On longer term charts, Pidilite Industries was moving in a strong uptrend since March 2020. Post August 2021, the stock started to consolidate in a broader range while forming a topping Head and Shoulder pattern.

On the weekly charts, prices formed an Inverted Hammer candle pattern after retesting the neckline which again was followed by a faster retracement of the previous swing. Also the 13 weeks exponential moving average (EMA) which was acting as a strong support to prices has lost its validity and is acting as resistance.

On daily charts, the stock has been sustaining below its 200 days simple moving average (SMA) since last one month indicating negative sentiments of the stock.

The RSI indicator on weekly time frame is below 50 which indicated bearish tone in the stock. We advise traders and investors to exit the positions from Pidilite Industries. Upside resistance for the stock is placed at Rs 2,200 level.

Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever has seen an exceptional uptrend since October 2018. The stock after such an elongated rally saw lower low formation, lower high formation since November 2021.

The stock on the weekly time frame broke the trend line which was respected very well since October 2018, and started acting as a resistance to the prices. We can also spot changes in the polarity of the prices.

On daily time, the stock has been taking strong resistance at 200 days SMA since November 2021. The RSI indicator is below 50 which shows bearish momentum.

The stock may show some pullback. We recommend to hold this with a strict stop-loss of Rs 1,900 mark.

HDFC

On weekly chart of HDFC, we saw some sideways action post breakdown happened at Rs 2,400 levels with volume confirmation. Prices have been maintaining lower low, lower high formation. The downtrend was also preceded by Negative direction.

In the previous week, the stock opened gap down and managed to sustain below the gap. The relative strength index (RSI) indicator is below 50 mark on higher time frame which suggest bearish tone for the stock.

We recommend trader and investors to stay away from HDFC till it sustains below Rs 2,400 mark. Rs 1,800 - 1,900 will act as a downside support for the counter. Level of Rs 2,400 would act as a strong resistance to the prices.

Consumer goods giant Unilever announced the appointment of billionaire investor activist Nelson Peltz to its board on the heels of a restructuring plan proposed earlier this year.

“Peltz’s appointments as a non-executive director and as a member of its compensation committee are expected to be confirmed on or before July 20,” Unilever said May 31.

In December, it was reported that Trian Partners, Peltz’s activist hedge fund, had acquired a significant stake in Unilever. Following the reports, Unilever said in January that its business would be restructured into five business groups – beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice-cream.

The proposed model would reduce senior management roles by 15 percent and junior management roles by 5 percent, equivalent to about 1,500 roles globally.

Speculation had been rife that Unilever’s cost-cutting measures and structural revamp had been prompted by Trian’s acquisition of a stake in the company. Peltz is known for bringing about operational changes in portfolio companies including Mondelēz International and Procter & Gamble.

Who is Peltz?

Peltz, 79, is an activist US investor and founding partner of Trian, a New York-based alternative investment management fund. His net worth was $1.6 billion as of June 1, according to Forbes.

Trian owns stakes in Bank of New York Mellon, DuPont and food conglomerate Mondelēz. Peltz is known to push for changes in portfolio companies, mostly towards simplification of business and reassessing strategy.

In 2018, he battled with P&G over a board seat and managed to get one. Although he quit the P&G board last year, he has been credited with bringing in positive changes at the company.

“Peltz has a good track record of effecting positive change at other consumer companies such as P&G, Mondelēz and Kraft Heinz. In 2017, Peltz called for a slew of changes at P&G, after which he joined its board in March 2018. P&G's stock price has almost doubled since then,” Edelweiss said in a note.

Trian manages funds that hold interests in about 37.4 million ordinary shares of Unilever, constituting approximately 1.5% of Unilever’s share capital, the company said while announcing Peltz’s appointment.

What will Peltz’s appointment mean for Unilever and Hindustan Unilever?

Analysts said Peltz’s presence on the Unilever board will mean several more changes in the company. Peltz will most likely follow his playbook of cost and business optimisation.

According to Edelweiss, there is a likelihood that the Unilever business might be split into different smaller businesses and some brands may even be sold. Peltz had introduced similar changes in P&G and the company had been split into independent operating units.

However, Edelweiss indicated that the Indian unit may not be impacted as Hindustan Unilever’s businesses have performed well and derive synergies from being part of one company.

“One recent example is its tea business, which was retained in India,” it added.

There will be a focus on margin improvement for both the parent company and Hindustan Unilever, Edelweiss said.

The key aspects to watch out for the parent company, indicated Edelweiss, would be transformation/change in corporate culture, remuneration (this can impact Hindustan Unilever too), a reset of strategic initiatives or focus areas, and a relook at the M&A strategy.

Why are these changes needed?

Unilever’s performance has been subdued for a few quarters and the company has faced pressure from investors to report better margins and sales growth. The failed attempt to buy GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products business for the third time had also disappointed investors.

“With Peltz’s entry, the market expects a simpler structure, focus on core, and some changes in culture and remuneration at Unilever,” the Indian brokerage said.",618,0.5997926354408264

Sanjiv Mehta, CEO and MD at Hindustan Unilever (HUL) witnessed a 47 percent jump in his salary in the financial year 2022 to Rs 22 crore as compared to Rs 15 crore paid to him in the last fiscal, according to the company’s annual report.

Mehta drew Rs 3.7 crore as salary, Rs 9.2 crore as allowances, Rs 4.3 crore as a bonus and Rs 4.2 crore as perquisite - long term incentives. Contribution to provident fund and perquisites formed other components of his salary.

Mehta though was the highest-paid FMCG CEO in FY20 and drew a salary of Rs Rs 19.42 crore, his remuneration dropped by 21 percent in FY21 and Nestle’s Suresh Narayanan dethroned him at a pay package of Rs 17.19 crore (in 2020).

In 2021, however, Narayanan’s salary climbed 9.3 percent to Rs 18.8 crore and is significantly lower than Mehta’s Rs 22 crore. Nestle follows January to December financial year.

Other FMCG majors such as Britannia, Marico, Dabur, Godrej Consumer Products and Tata Consumer Products are yet to release their annual reports for FY22 and it remains to be seen who will emerge as the highest-paid FMCG CEO this year.

HUL’s other top executives such as Ritesh Tiwari, Wilhelmus Uijen and Srinivas Phatak were paid Rs 5.9 crore, Rs 11.5 crore and Rs 1.4 crore as an annual pay package in FY22. Ritesh Tiwari was appointed as a whole-time director and chief financial officer of the company on May 1, 2021, succeeding Srinivas Phatak. Uijen is the executive director, supply chain at HUL.

Mehta’s salary was 179.61 times higher than the median salary of HUL employees, while Tiwari’s salary was 53.07 times higher. The percentage increase in the median remuneration of HUL employees for the financial year was 3.3 percent. The company had 8,480 permanent employees on the roll as on March 31, 2022.

According to HUL, the average increase made in the salaries of employees other than the managerial personnel in the financial year was about 8 percent.

“In a post-pandemic world, the workforce dynamics and employee preferences are changing rapidly with companies facing a very competitive talent market. HUL has taken proactive reward and career-related measures to ensure our talent feels valued and maintain our competitiveness,” said the company’s annual report.

“The Board of Directors based on the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee has provided an increase of 8 percent in salary and allowances for Ritesh Tiwari and Dev Bajpai which shall be effective from 1st June, 2022. The increase in remuneration for Sanjiv Mehta and Wilhelmus Uijen will be placed before the Nomination and Remuneration Committee in due course for its consideration,” it added.",460,0.9993973970413208

EBITDA margin contracted 30bps YoY to 24.1%, largely owing to higher cost inflation and increased A&P spends. Adj. PAT grew 6.6% YoY to Rs 2,269cr (-1.7% QoQ).

“I am very bullish about the new Unilever structure; it would be right for Unilever and it would be good for HUL,” said Mehta.

Unilever had announced the restructuring of its business in January, under which the company will move away from its current matrix structure and will be organised around five distinct business groups – beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice cream. The proposed new organisation model will result in a reduction of 15 percent in senior management roles, while the junior management roles will be trimmed by 5 percent, equivalent to around 1,500 roles globally, the company had informed in a press statement.

Soon after this announcement, Nitin Paranjape, a former HUL CEO, was appointed chairman of HUL, a post earlier held by Sanjiv Mehta, along with the roles of chief executive officer and managing director. Paranjape has also been appointed chief people officer and chief transformation officer of Unilever starting April, and will lead the company as it goes through a major restructuring. Globally, Unilever will appoint five business leaders for each of these business groups, reporting to the top management.

According to Mehta, while in most of the countries where Unilever operates, businesses will go through a restructuring, following which five business segments will emerge, India will be a bit different.

“We are a large company, one of the fastest growing companies and a listed company. Here, the executive leadership of the business will remain with me,” said Mehta.

“We will align to the five business groups, but unlike in most parts of the world, we will have three leaders like today leading the business,” he added.

Post restructuring Hindustan Unilever’s beauty and personal care division, shared Mehta, will be called beauty, well-being and personal care and will be led by Madhusudhan Rao, homecare will remain homecare and will be led by Deepak Subramanian. While Unilever has broken the foods and refreshments division into nutrition, and ice cream, the division will remain intact at HUL and will be headed by Srinandan Sundaram, said Mehta.

The restructuring, however, will help HUL as it would speed up the decision-making at the parent company and make way for better innovation, said Mehta.

Unilever’s move to make changes in its structure and leadership team follows a significant stake acquisition by Trian Partners, Nelson Peltz’s activist hedge fund, as reported by Reuters last month. According to reports, the hedge fund, known for pushing big firms such as General Electric (GE), Mondelez, and Procter & Gamble (P&G) to improve and simplify their operations, has been pressuring Unilever as well. Trian Partners had called for changes in another consumer goods firm P&G in 2018 and won the battle. The restructuring exercise, which will bring about a significant change in how the organisation has been run for the past two decades, will result in cost savings of €600 million, the company’s management said, while addressing a post-earnings investor call in February.

According to Mehta, the prices will continue to inch up till commodity prices do not abate.

“It’s difficult to predict what would be the precise quantum of price increases, but the way we see it is, commodity costs keep going up, so there will be more price actions,” he said.

(Read: We are a Rs 50,000-crore company but HUL’s best is yet to come: CEO and MD Sanjiv Mehta)

Mehta also said that the margins will continue to be under pressure due to inflation. “Margins will be under pressure in the short term. But then, we'll get it back,” he added.

FMCG companies across the board are battling inflation in key commodities which has hiked their costs substantially and dented their margins. HUL’s overall gross margin contracted by 331 basis points (bps) year-on-year (YoY) in Q4, while the homecare segment saw an EBIT margin contraction of 138 bps YoY and beauty and personal care of 129 bps YoY. The company was able to manage its EBITDA margins, however, on account of its cost-control measures and saw a compression of 20 basis points YoY. HUL had taken a 10 percent price hike across categories in the March quarter of FY22.

“The most impacted categories are skin cleansing – toilet soaps, because of palm oil, and laundry powders, because of crude-based derivatives. These have been most impacted so far but increasingly, we are seeing the impact coming in other categories because of SLES, which is again a palm-based derivative,” said Mehta.

The FMCG honcho, however, does not expect any major impact on HUL due to the Indonesia palm oil ban. “I don’t see it as a long-term issue. The palm oil that we use, the fractionation units, they have not been put under ban,” he added.

Indonesia, a major exporter of palm oil, banned the export of the commodity last week as the country also struggles with supply shortages and inflation. Palm oil accounts for about 40 percent of total edible oil consumption in India and 60 percent of imports and is a major commodity for FMCG and the food and beverages (F&B) industries.

Economists and industry experts are expecting an impact of the development on these industries.

“Palm oil is a key ingredient in the food processing industry. Rising prices of palm oil will impact costs and margins of several consumer companies,” said Amnish Aggarwal, director - research at Prabhudas Lilladher.

“FMCG staple majors such as Britannia, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India and ITC would be amongst the key companies affected directly as a result of the ban and higher prices,” said Aggarwal.

Packaged consumer good companies have been battling inflation since FY21. However, the war between Ukraine and Russia has worsened the situation and created a supply shortage for several key commodities.

Mehta of HUL believes settling of the Ukraine-Russia war could be a trigger for the softening of commodity prices.

“When geopolitics gets involved, then speculation also comes in, in anticipation that there would be constraints, prices are driven up further,” he said. “So, you need a trigger for commodity prices to start softening. In current times, a geopolitical settlement between Ukraine and Russia could lead to softening of prices,” added Mehta.",601,-0.6671169315065656

He talks about how HUL will navigate these turbulent waters, including on the latest threat from Indonesia’s decision to ban palm oil exports.

In an interaction with Moneycontrol, Mehta refutes their being interested in acquiring MDH. He also makes it clear that in foods, they are not interested in commodity plays and are looking for opportunities where they can use technology and value-add to build great brands. Inflation is leading to weak demand conditions but the company is winning market share across channels, categories and both urban and rural markets. Horlicks' uptake is weaker than expected because of market conditions but they have a gameplan to get it back on track. He also opens up about what the restructuring at Unilever means for HUL. Finally, you can read his outlook for the sector, the company and why he thinks HUL has never been as strong as it is today and that the best is yet to come.

The past few years have been a challenge for any CEO, what with COVID, supply chain disruptions, slowing demand growth, and now a war in Ukraine that has sent inflation through the roof. What are some of your important learnings? And what would you do differently if you could go back in time?

I've been a student all my life. There are several learnings. Most industries drive for efficiency and productivity improvement. But, one thing which has come in very clear, loud and clear, during the pandemic is the need for resilience. And resilience does imply that you will have spare capacity. Otherwise, you won't have inbuilt resilience. But the critical bit is to understand where in your value chain you will drive for efficiency, and where you will create resilience. So, that's the first learning.

The second important one is adaptability. The US Army used to talk about the world being VUCA -- volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. That hasn't gone away. An American futurist rightly talks about the world being BANI -- brittle, anxious, non-linear and incomprehensible. If you put the VUCA and the BANI together, these are the choppy waters we’ve been navigating in the last few years. What’s critical is how adaptable we are. When growing up, we would make a strategic plan, which would run its course for three years. Now, when you make a strategic plan, it may become irrelevant after three months. What’s important for an organisation is agility -- the speed with which you’re able to adapt.

The third learning has been on information. If you wait for precise information to come in, you will be too late. And you have to put together disparate information and make sense of it. I call it sense making. And this is a skill, which comes from experience, knowledge and to some extent intuition. And what data and analytics do is help you tremendously in this quest for sense making.

The fourth learning that has come in and which is something which we’ve been telling all our colleagues is, whenever we used to talk about leadership, we used to talk about a person very good in say, strategy, a person who is a great orator, articulates very well, a person who is very good in execution. But we never talked about compassion. I think one thing, which has again come home to roost (is) how important compassion is for leaders, compassion for your neighbours, compassion for your people, and compassion for the community in which you live. And these are some of the things which have become absolutely loud and clear. And these were not so pronounced before the crisis that we've seen in the last few years.

And, what would you have done differently?

In January 2020, when COVID came into China, we set up a crisis team. And the brief was that we were importing chemicals from China and if their chemicals supply gets disrupted, how will we mitigate the risk. But we never thought that COVID would come into our country. Otherwise, I would have got a three-month head start. When we do our risk assessment exercises, it’s not that the pandemic hasn’t appeared in it. It has, and even zoonotic diseases have appeared. But we never thought that it will really play out.

For instance, all of us are conscious that if you're not able to control global warming, many parts of the world will go under water. But is any one of us making mitigating actions? The answer is no. But a few years down the road if we are not able to control rising temperatures, then we will have to have plans, keeping in perspective things which are distant in the future, but happening at a much greater speed. So, it is not going to be placid waters anymore.

And we have seen it over the years, right? The Gulf War, I was running North Africa then, and the Middle East where we had the Arab Spring. Then we had financial crisis and COVID. In India, we also had demonetisation. Yeah, there will be a slowdown of the economy and there will be a pick-up, and you have to be very agile, very focused, very adaptable, build in resilience in your value chain, and lead with compassion.

Could you sketch out the demand situation in urban and rural areas? And what’s your outlook, say, for the next six to 12 months?

If we take a step back, pre-COVID, we’d seen the rural slowdown happening. And then COVID happened. Rural proved to be much more resilient for various reasons. Amongst them, I would say is, first, the spread of COVID in the first wave was more concentrated in urban areas as opposed to rural areas. The second was government interventions: the direct transfer of money, free food grains, increase in the outlay of MGNREGA, all helped the cause. These were absolutely the right things to do because you expect every government to look after its people, particularly those who are not so well off. So, rural proved to be very resilient. Urban markets took a lot of battering, because stores were closed, economic activities came to a halt, modern trade came to a halt. So, we saw rural was growing at a much faster pace. Then from last year onwards, as economic activity started picking up, the modern trade stores came back, urban activity started, urban growth going back, and rural against a high base started to cut down.

And so, it has been coming down and this got exacerbated with inflation coming in. I've been now working for Unilever for nearly 30 years and I have not seen this kind of inflation. There used to be a period when crude oil price went up. In the first decade of the millennium, there was a time when it went up to $135-$140 a barrel before the financial crisis. But we've not seen a period where crude oil-based derivatives, palm oil and everything else linked to it, go up like this. In a country like India, where we may be a $3-trillion economy, but the per capita income is $2,000 on an average and there’s a large section of population who still have very little income in their hands, this kind of inflation proves to be a real hardship. And when prices go up, people who have more money, they go for more value packs, such as large packs, but people who have less money, they titrate volumes or go for low unit price packs. And when prices go up, people do not have unlimited money. And prices are going up for nearly everything, not just packaged goods. Edible oils are going up, food grains are going up. So, the outlay comes down, then they veer towards more essential products and then they titrate the volume. Whatever they can get within that pool of money is what they're going to buy and volumes take a knock when you have this kind of price increase.



Penetration is not going down. It is not that people have stopped using detergent powders or stopped using personal wash products. Some discretionary items do get impacted. But we must also remember that discretionary items are used by people who have higher disposable income. Discretionary items got impacted more by COVID lockdowns or the threat of COVID or work from home. I anticipate a few more quarters where (discretionary) volumes will be under stress.

Do you think the Indonesia palm oil export ban is going to worsen the situation? And which categories will be most impacted?

Indonesia consumes about 30 percent of the palm oil on a normative basis of what they produce. And this is a big export item for Indonesia. I can understand them putting in controls to control the price for the 30 percent which is consumed domestically. I don't see it as a long-term issue. The palm oil that we use, the fractionation units, they have not been put under ban. At this moment in time, I don't see it as a major issue. Leave aside the price (increase), but from an availability perspective, I don't think this would be an issue for us.

Prices have gone up. But what happens is that if prices remain high for a longer period, then people look at alternatives.

A slowing market also means a tapering of valuations in general. Do M&A opportunities look more attractive? There was talk about spices. Has HUL had a rethink on being present in food staples?

The news about MDH (about HUL being interested in acquiring the spice-maker) was wrong. But if the question is about, are we looking at inorganic growth, then yes. In the last few years, we acquired Indulekha, which has proved to be an extremely wonderful acquisition. Then we went in for Adityaa Milk, which was focusing on the south of India, which was basically strengthening out footprint in ice creams in the south of India. Then we acquired GSK, which was the mother of all acquisitions. And then, we acquired VWash, a fabulous intimate hygiene brand and is doing extremely well. So, we've had a good series of acquisitions.

Are we on the drawing board, looking at acquisitions? Yes, we always do that. For us, organic growth is very important. But we also look at inorganic opportunities. But when we look at inorganic opportunities, we look at the strategic fit. We look at the evolution of the brand, where it is in the S-curve. We also look at what would be a fair valuation. And then of course, an acquisition happens when a seller is also willing to sell, right? So, we keep looking. But just because there is a fashion to acquire brands, we don’t join that race. We have firepower -- we are a zero debt company. And the way we did the GSK deal was fabulous. We used higher price earnings (PE) ratio and we used the share swap structure to acquire this fabulous brand. Today, our market cap is over Rs 5 lakh crore. So yes, the firepower is there.



See, staples for us, we had a rice brand, Indus Valley, which we've sold off. We have Annapurna (wheat flour) in certain pockets. But that's not a big thrust area for us. For us, it is more about creating a brand where there is more technology involved, more value-add involved. We would not like to be in the commodity space, we would like to be more where we can create a great brand.

And if you look at our foods’ portfolio today, we have a fabulous business in tea where we are the volume and value market leaders. We took back leadership a couple of years back and we have kept strengthening it. Coffee is a good player for us. Kissan is a wonderful brand where we were in jams and ketchup, but now we have gone in for peanut butter. We have extended our spreads into mayonnaise, Hellmann's mayonnaise has been launched, Knorr we have soups. We have launched cubes in certain parts. And then we are a big player in HFD (health food drinks).

What about D2C (direct to consumer) brands? Several companies have come up in this area in beauty and personal care as well as health and nutrition segments. Are we going to see any acquisitions here?

E-commerce is bound to play an increasing role in the FMCG space, COVID or no COVID, because of their sheer assortment and convenience. For us, that's a big thrust area. And we have been investing in e-commerce capabilities much ahead of the curve. Today, because of our thrust on technology, we are proud that 20 percent of our demand capture is done digitally. As far as e-commerce is concerned, whether pure-play, omni-channel, or through our own sites, we are in every segment. In Lakme, for instance, it has the largest followers on Instagram of any beauty brand. And 30 percent of our sales are coming from e-commerce today, including from our own site. For us, that will remain and we have also carved out a separate premium business unit with the entire focus on digital first brands. Simple, Love Beauty & Planet, Dove Baby are brands focused on e-commerce through the premium business unit.

How are they doing?

They are doing reasonably well. We are very satisfied with the entire game that we are playing on e-commerce and our thrust will continue. When it comes to acquisitions, I'll come back to the same thing that it has to be a strategic fit, we will see where it is on the stage of evolution and it has to be at a price that makes sense to us.

What is your assessment of competitive intensity in the FMCG market in the past two years? Has it stepped up, has it stepped down? And you know, you have companies such as ITC and Patanjali with aggressive growth plans.

Competition is good for consumers. No question about that. In our country, the per capita consumption of FMCG is just about $45. If you look at a country like Indonesia, it is 2X of India, China is 3X of India, Philippines is 4X of India. So, when it comes to the runway to grow, there’s a massive opportunity. The second point is that this is not a zero sum game. We have not reached a level of saturation, that if someone else grows, it will be necessarily at my cost. So, you keep growing, because the market has so much more to it. The third important bit is that a good competitor brings out the best in Hindustan Unilever. It keeps us on our toes. It allows us to do the best that is required for our consumers and for our business. If you look at our track record, in the last nine years, we have doubled our business, we have tripled our profits and we have quadrupled our market cap. When we say we have doubled our business, we have added Rs 25,000 crore to it, more than the total turnover of any of our competitors. We have our feet on the ground, we are not complacent and we respect all our competitors.

Does the unorganised segment pose a threat since consumers are downgrading?

Our portfolios straddle the price benefit pyramid. If you look at hair care, we have Clinic Plus shampoo where the largest selling SKU is at one rupee. A great brand, consumers love it and has great brand salience. Can you get anything really good at less than one rupee? No. But if you want to go up (the value chain), we have a mass beauty brand Sunsilk, if you want a salon kind of hair care at home, you have TRESemmé, if you want a brand for hair repair it's Dove. And if you want a premium natural brand, there is Indulekha. We straddle the price benefit pyramid. Even if there is downgrading, we have brands to cater to that.

Not only that, take laundry, for instance. The biggest selling brand in laundry is Surf Excel. It's also one of our largest brands with sales of more than Rs 5,000 crore, and also a premium brand. But we have made it accessible. You can get Surf Excel for Rs 10 (sachet pack). Our market share gains have been the highest in a year, say compared to a decade or more than a decade ago.

When times are tough, people can’t afford to waste money. And when they can’t afford to waste money, they go after trusted large brands, provided they are accessible. So, brands like Lifebuoy, brands like Lux, brands like Clinic Plus, brands like Wheel, brands like Taaza. These are the brands which are trusted by millions, and they’re able to compete at those price points.



There'll be some consumers for whom one rupee would be very important. There’ll be some consumers who would say, I want more value and two rupees is still affordable for me from an outlay perspective, and they would be very happy to migrate. When the commodity costs increase then in large packs you can take a price increase. For a Rs 100 bottle, you can go to Rs 105. But if you're a one-rupee pack, going to two rupees means doubling, which may not be sensible. Then you look at reducing the volume a bit. But if you reduce the volume beyond a point, then it will not give you the kind of cleaning that the consumers are looking for. Therefore, you can’t reduce quantity below a certain point. The question is, if the commodity price still keeps going up, how do you ensure that you’re able to protect the business model of that SKU while ensuring a value to the consumer, and that’s where a bridge pack comes in.

Could you tell a little more about your plans for bridge packs; is it going to be across categories?

We are still working it out. Price is not the only dimension consumers look at. What they look at is price value and many times, like I said at the beginning of the conversation, that many consumers are veering towards large packs. They’re going towards the large packs, because they get higher value for it. And if consumers find that between one rupee and two rupees, they get a better value for two rupees, they will migrate towards it. But there would be still consumers who would say, I’d rather stick to one rupee. So be it.

The plan for bridge packs is in the drawing stages, we are working it out, and you will see it happening.

Will the categories most impacted by inflation see a roll out of bridge packs?

The two categories most impacted are skin cleansing -- toilet soaps, because of palm oil, laundry powders, because of crude-based derivatives. These have been most impacted so far. But increasingly, what we’re seeing is the impact coming in other categories, hair, because of SLES, which is again a palm-based derivative. Then packaging material cost is going up because most of them are polymer-based. Prices are going up. And they're going to go up till we reach a point where the commodity prices start going down.

And I believe one of the trigger could be the settling of the Ukrainian crisis. If you look at the genesis, first it was supply chain disruptions because workers were not there during the harvesting season (due to COVID-related lockdowns). So, supply came down prices went up. Shipping lines got choked and the supply chain movement got curtailed. These cost increases were mainly driven by supply chain constraints, and not as much as by demand. It's still a question of whether it is structural or supply chain-driven inflation. Of course, what happens when things start going up and when geopolitics gets involved, then speculation also comes in, in anticipation that there would be constraints, prices are driven up further. So, you need a trigger for commodity prices to start softening. In current times, a geopolitical settlement between Ukraine and Russia could lead to softening of prices.

In the March quarter, what level of price increases were taken? And in the current quarter, what kind of price increases could be expected?

We took about a 10 percent price increase (in the March quarter).

There are two imperatives for us. One is the consumer franchise, where we want to strengthen. The second is we want to protect the business. You would have seen over the last many quarters, margins have remained within a certain range. Our first point of call is looking at all lines of P&L and asking ourselves how do we optimise, taking away all costs, which are in any way discretionary, we do that. Then we drive efficiency and productivity much harder. Over the last few years, we have been delivering savings of between 6 to 9 percent of turnover. So, it’s a very aggressive savings agenda.

But there are some things which we don't touch. One is product superiority -- it gives us a huge edge. And we must also remember that why consumers trust big brands is because of product superiority and brand salience. Coming to brand salience, I’ve always maintained that we will keep spending money at a rate where our share voice is higher than our share of market, because we want our brand salience to be there. Rest of the things, we will optimise. And after that, the last port of call is how do we take price increases? And again, we look at it from an affordability perspective, to an extent where consumers can afford more we take more, but what is very important is the price value. And in price value, one of the factors, which is very important is relative pricing. We don't want to be out of whack when it comes to relative price. It’s difficult to predict what would be the precise quantum of price increases, but the way we see it is commodity costs keep going up, so there will be more price actions. Margins will be under pressure in the short term. But then, we'll get it back.

A few discretionary and beauty and personal care portfolios did not fare well in the quarter. How do you see demand panning out in these categories?

First is, they didn't fare well from a relative growth perspective. But in beauty, personal care, foods and refreshments, we gained market shares. And the story on market shares is we are winning in urban, we are winning in rural. We are winning in GT (general trade), we are winning in MT (modern trade). We are winning in large packs, we are winning in small packs, we are winning in premium segment, and we are winning in mid-tier and in economy. Our gaining of market share has been across the portfolio spectrum. When it comes to discretionary categories, we must remember that in the first two months of the year, we were hit by Omicron. Discretionary gets impacted when people don't step out of their homes. When you don't step out, you don't use that same quantum of make-up for instance, or you don't use the same kind of skincare products. So, they do get impacted. And we have seen that March was better than the first two months of the last quarter. So, I would hope as the country keeps opening up and the next variant doesn’t come in, hopefully, discretionary should bounce back.



Fabric wash has been on a rhythm for many years. We have completely changed the profitability of the division. It used to be a bleeder from our perspective, now it has very healthy margins. We have great brands, superior products, and we have been outpacing the market for many years.

If we take, say the last two, three years, there was a period when the tea business was growing at 20-25 percent. There was a period when skin cleansing was growing at 20 percent. There was a period when hair care was growing majestically. We have the benefit of a portfolio. One strategy which comes in very handy is winning in many Indias. We don't have a pan-India strategy. We craft strategy for the 15 clusters that we have. And each cluster has its own nuance. The competitive context is different. Brands are at a different stage of evolution; per capita consumption is different. And whenever we hunt for an opportunity based on our winning strategy, we press hard on the pedal.

What's the strategy behind tapering advertising and promotions spend? Do you see this change in the coming quarters?

There can't be a one-to-one correspondence between commodity price increases and your selling price. Everyone tries to optimise their spending and their entire industry spending comes down. We keep a hawk’s eye focus on ensuring that our share of voice is greater than the share of market. And the two things we look at are, the share of voice should be greater than the share of market, and the other is that there should be a certain minimum reach. And if the entire (spending) table goes down, then yes, the advertising spend goes down, but not on a competitive basis.

Does it mean that the market does not have that strength to give returns commensurate with what you are spending?

Because you're not able to pass on (price hikes) your gross margin takes a massive hit. How do you optimize, because a 3-4 percent inflation is something which the industry can very easily build into their plans and absorb. But when, just to give you an idea, (you) compare the July quarter of 2020 with the March quarter of 2022, then the net material inflation went up in rupee terms by 4.5 times. So, this is not something which is normal. It's very high inflation. So, the entire industry optimises.

On Unilever's restructuring, what will be the impact on the Indian unit in terms of layoffs?

First, let me give you a perspective of why Unilever has gone about doing it. Organisation structures are meant to evolve. They're like a living organism. So, you have to keep evolving and taking cognisance that we need to be much faster and agile, we need to be more focused, and we need to have a greater end-to-end accountability. Unilever has gone about creating what we call the compass organisation, where there are going to be five business groups. And in most parts of the world, Unilever will be aligned in that fashion.

Now, India is a bit different. We are a large company. We are one of the fastest growing companies and we are a listed company. Here, the executive leadership of the business will remain with me. And we will align to the five business groups. But unlike in most parts of the world, we will have three leaders like today leading the business. So, beauty and wellbeing and personal care, which is part of our beauty and personal care will be led by Madhusudhan Rao now. Homecare will remain homecare and will be led by Deepak Subramanian, and foods and refreshment, Unilever has broken up into nutrition and ice cream. In our case, both of these will be led together as foods and refreshment by Srinandan Sundaram. So for us, that doesn't change at all. But where the benefit to us will come in is we believe this new structure will allow Unilever for speed of decision making. Second is, we should be getting better innovations. So, all this will augur good for a business like India, and I lead South Asia as well. So, I'm very bullish about the new Unilever structure, it would be right for Unilever. And it would be good for HUL.

Could you give us an update on the Horlicks business, it seems to be growing at a slower than anticipated.

That's right. Horlicks, we acquired when we were in the pandemic situation (the formal completion of the acquisition). In fact, the integration took place virtually. And, the Horlicks story, the growth premise was based on penetration of HFDs is still in the mid-twenties, whereas we know how to grow laundry business where the penetration in universal. The second is that we will be able to ramp up distribution. And the third is our prowess of market development. We know how to grow a category. Many categories in the country were created after HUL brought them in. So, those were the fundamentals. And the fourth one was that we will be able to get synergy from cost saving. First, because of the pandemic, it took us longer to do the distribution integration. The second is market development, which is based on experiential marketing, which is based on house-to-house sampling and education -- that did not take off at the same speed, as we would have normally done. And the third is that some of the variables in the market got changed with schools remaining closed. The children were at home, the mothers had many more alternatives than when the kids are going to school, when you would give them a glass of Horlicks. Some of the dynamics very clearly changed. But I am as bullish about Horlicks as about when we acquired the business.

What can we expect to see in the next one or two years?

It will gradually get back to the growth that we were looking at. I’m very confident about that. You know, we’ve launched the Mothers Plus, Diabetes Plus, and they're doing extremely well. We've started putting activities back on market development. The distribution integration is done. Our cost savings is running ahead of plan. And we are putting big money behind it. We're relooking at the whole communication. And I'm very bullish, we'll get back.



Between us and our distributors, there was no friction. We have a great relationship with our distributors. We have 3,500 distributors. And we are committed to them. A large part of our business is through the distributors. And with distributors, we have a great relationship, many of them multi-generational distributors. They're not the first generation distributors. And our endeavour has to be very clearly we bring in better technology to them. We bring in better practices to them. And we allow them to grow the business. If you look at the Shikhar app, it allows our distributors to bring in the benefit of technology because all those outlets which are today adopted by Shikhar or who adopt Chicago, they are serviced by the distributors. So, I didn't see any issues with our distributors. Our distributors have a great relationship. And even now I see no issues at all with our distributors.

Finally, how do you expect the FMCG industry, and more importantly HUL, to perform in the next one or two years? Which are the categories of growth, some new products or new categories that HUL could enter?

First let me tell you, none of the segments in which we operate are anywhere close to maturity. So, there is headroom to grow everything. Yeah. And the growth could come through penetration, the growth could come through upgradation or growth could come by increasing consumption. There is headroom to grow everywhere. That's point number one. Second is, we have market leadership in over 80 percent of our turnover. The third important bit is that we have absolutely great brands. We have brands which are big, which are trusted, which we keep renovating and innovating to make them contemporary. The fourth is we are building massive capability under a reimagined HUL agenda, where we want to be the most intelligent consumer goods enterprise. And last but not the least are our people. We are the employer of choice in the country, we are able to recruit the best possible talent. And our people are behind all those initiatives. So, I'm very confident, that it will be tough, it is going to be very challenging, but we will navigate these times and we will have to adjust our sales (to the new reality). But we'll come out winners. I believe that HUL has never been as strong as it is today.

So there will be turbulence. There will be choppy waters. But this is a great market for FMCG. And as I said, it is not a zero sum game. We have over nearly 95 percent of the households using one or more of our brands, where we have great market leadership, great capabilities, where we have deep roots, where we align ourselves to the national agenda, and we have great talent. So, I'm very confident about HUL's future. While we may be a Rs 50,000-crore company, let me say very confidently, that our best is yet to come.",5559,0.356156795313864

Arihant Capital's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s Q4FY22 Net Revenue grew by 10.73% YoY to INR 13,767 Cr (2.44% QoQ). This beat our quarterly revenue estimate of INR 13,303 Cr by 3.49%. Q4FY22 Gross Margin contracted by 312bps YoY 49% (-667bps QoQ). This is indicative of the notable input cost pressures faced by the company during the quarter. Q4FY22 EBITDA grew by 8.48% YoY to INR 3,301 Cr (-3.71% QoQ). EBITDA Margin contracted by 50bps YoY to 24.98% (-134bps QoQ). This beat our quarterly EBITDA estimate of INR 3,193 Cr by 3.38%, and was largely in line with our EBITDA Margin estimate of 24%. Q4FY22 Consolidated PAT grew 7.6% YoY to INR 2,364 Cr (1.81% QoQ). PAT Margin contracted by 50bps YoY to 17.17% (-11bps QoQ). This beat our quarterly PAT estimate of INR 2,156 Cr by 9.6%. The overall performance of the company was in line with expectations- muted but positive. This is due to the rising commodity price pressures faced by the company. Material costs are at an all-time high, and about a 7% price hike was passed on. Most of the growth was price led as inflation continues to pinch consumers pockets leading to low volume growth for HUL.

Outlook

We expect the performance for the next two quarters to be under pressure, but HULs robust financial management system, and agility to adapt to sudden market changes will allow the company to maintain current run rates. We assign a TP of INR 2,368 with an upside of 10.5%, valued at an FY24E EPS of INR 45, and a P/E of 53x. At current levels, we recommend that investors hold the stock.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

While 4QFY22 results were above expectations, management did highlight the likely sequential margin pressures over the next 2-3 quarters. Beat in 4QFY22 was also led by a 220bp decline in ad-spends to sales that may not be a compensating factor going forward. Lower ad-spends to sales helped EBITDA margin surpass our expectations despite lower-than-expected gross margin. Two factors that constrained HUVR’s earnings growth (ex-GSK) over the past two years were escalating material costs and lower-than-expected premiumization. Both these factors are likely to inhibit the company’s 1HFY23E earnings as well. Nevertheless, positive factors can emerge from rural recovery fueled by: a) good Rabi crop, b) good monsoon, and c) sustained agri commodity inflation, unless offset by input cost pressures for farmers.

Outlook

We remain positive on the stock based on HUVR’s technological edge, nimbleness v/s its FMCG peers and continued impressive market share gains (highest decadal gain witnessed in FY22). Maintain BUY with a TP of INR2,500.

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

In Q4FY22, HUL posted resilient numbers with revenues growing by 11% y-o-y (with sales volume standing flat) while OPM stood stable at 24% y-o-y despite a 300 bps decline in the gross margins Market share gains across categories and sustained double-digit growth in some of the premium categories helped HUL post higher sales volumes versus the industry (which saw a 7-8% fall in volume). Significant raw material inflation would keep margins stressed. However, calibrated price hikes and stringent cost savings across verticals will help OPM to sustain at 23-24% in the near term. Management is confident of rural demand recovery led by expectations of good monsoons and higher agri-incomes that would push demand.



Outlook

HUL’s stock has underperformed broader indices for the past one year and is currently trading at 52.1x/43.3x its FY2023E/24E EPS. We maintain our Buy on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs. 2,456.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL has given cautious commentary in 4Q22 as high input costs and inflation will continue to weight on volume growth and margins in 1H23. 4Q22 displayed flat volumes despite mid-single digit volume growth in Fabric wash, showing growth concerns in BPC portfolio. Near term margin headwinds are likely to sustain due to 1) inflationary environment in commodity basket. 2) down trading of products across categories 3) rising gap between realisations vs commodity prices. However, we remain positive on the longer term structural story given 1) sustained market share gains 2) strong innovation pipeline 3) scale up in emerging categories (Green Tea, Fabric Conditioner, Liquid Detergents, Liquid Dishwash, Hair conditioner) 4) distribution gains from strategies like WIMI and SHIKHAR and 5) faster growth in premium portfolio (2x than company growth).



Outlook

We expect 11.0% Sales and 13.6% PAT CAGR over FY22-24 and assign a DCF based target price of Rs 2384 (Rs 2356 earlier). We have marginally increased our FY23/24 EPS by 0.7%/1.2% on calibrated price hikes & cost synergies.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after March quarter earnings:

Prabhudas Lilladher

HUL has given cautious commentary as high input costs and inflation will continue to weigh on volume growth and margins in the first half of this year.

We expect 11.0% sales and 13.6% profit after tax compound annual rate over FY22-24 and assign a DCF based target of Rs 2384 (Rs 2356 earlier).

We have marginally increased our FY23/24 earnings per share by 0.7/1.2% on calibrated price hikes and cost synergies.

Risk reward is favourable at 44x FY24 EPS and 2% dividend yield, but we expect returns to be back-ended given near term volume pressures and volatility in input costs. Retain buy.

Motilal Oswal

We have kept our EPS forecasts for FY23/FY24 broadly unchanged.

HUVR’s pre-COVID earnings had been extremely strong and it reported 18% EPS compound annual rate in the four years ending FY20, before steeper commodity cost inflation and the over-indexed discretionary portfolio adversely impacted its earnings in FY21 and FY22.

The company’s pre-COVID earnings growth was particularly impressive given weak mid-single-digit growth posted by its (much smaller) staples peers over the same period. We expect HUVR to return to mid-teens earnings growth.

We also believe that HUVR is the best prepared among peers, both on the technology front as well as on the e-commerce strategy level, to deal with the potentially significant disruptions.

Given all these factors, HUVR’s valuations at 47.7x FY24E EPS still leave room for further upside. We maintain our buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 2,500 (premised on 55x FY24 EPS) implying 17% upside.

Sharekhan

HUL posted resilient numbers aided by a strong portfolio of brands across price points helping it to gain market share in key categories and across markets.

The company is focusing on premiumisation and market development to improve penetration in key categories and digitalisation to drive consistent earnings growth in the medium to long term.

We maintain a buy recommendation on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs 2,456.

Credit Suisse

Broking firm has kept an outperform rating on the stock and cut the target price to Rs 2,550 from Rs 2,800 per share.

Home care saved the day, but BPC and nutrition weakness are concerning, it said.

Credit Suisse cut FY23-24e by 9% to factor increase in commodity costs hurting EBITDA margin.

The gross margin was under pressure, but cost savings protected EBITDA margins, reported CNBC-TV18.

Morgan Stanley

Research house has maintained equal-weight rating on the stock with a target price Rs 2,381 per share as earnings were ahead of estimates.

Market share gains remain a positive.

The company management cautioned against rising near-term inflation, weak volume growth and margin risks, reported CNBC-TV18.

At 09:19 hrs HUL was quoting at Rs 2,206.75, up Rs 62.50 or 2.91 percent on the BSE.

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

The stock has corrected by 27% from recent highs, owing to multiple headwinds. A sustained rural slowdown and high inflation led to downtrading in highly penetrated categories and cut in consumption of premium category products has hit sales volumes. Inflated input prices (including those of palm oil, packaging material, and caustic soda) will put pressure on margins; price hike undertaken is insufficient to fully mitigate input cost pressure. Leadership position in 80% of portfolio, strong set of brands (from mass to premium) and a wide distribution reach will help HUL to quickly recover in a stable demand environment.

Outlook

We reiterate a Buy recommendation on Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) with a revised price target of Rs. 2,456.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) was conferred with outstanding business of the year award at CNBC-TV18’s Indian Business Leader Awards, held in Mumbai.

The Indian subsidiary of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant Unilever, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) is unarguably the country’s largest FMCG company with a turnover of over Rs 45,000 crore. The company with an extensive network of over 45,000 distributors and over 50 brands has a presence in nine out of every ten Indian households.

Unilever’s Indian roots can be traced back to 1931, when it set up its first domestic subsidiary, Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Company, followed by Lever Brothers India in 1933 and United Traders in 1935. These three companies merged to form Hindustan Lever in November 1956, which later was renamed HUL.

The company has over the years built a large portfolio of brands, with brands such as Pond’s, Brooke Bond and Lakme coming into the HUL fold through acquisitions. Recently, the merger of GSK Consumer Healthcare, the parent company of brands such as Horlicks and Boost, with HUL in 2020 made the company the largest player in the food and refreshment segment. HUL houses 14 brands that each have a turnover of over Rs 1,000 crore. Its brands such as Brooke Bond tea and Surf Excel detergent breached the Rs 1,000-crore sales mark as early as 2007, while detergent brand Wheel crossed the Rs 2,000-crore sales milestone in 2008, according to the company’s website.

HUL made successful inroads into rural India through its Project Shakti launched in 2001, which targeted villages with populations of less than 5,000 individuals, helping build a presence in about 50 percent of over 6 lakh villages.

The company employs over 21,000 people and has been recognised as the employer of choice in FMCG by Aon Hewitt for 12 years now.

The FMCG behemoth is also making strides towards sustainability and achieved plastic neutrality in 2012, four years ahead of its target. Since 2018, HUL has facilitated environmentally safe disposal of more than 1.2 lakh tonnes of post-consumer-use plastic waste.",339,0.9005098342895508

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We are cutting HUL’s EPS estimates by 2.3/8.2/6.1% for FY22/23/24 and DCF based target price to Rs2356 (Rs2900 earlier). This follows impact of 1) deepening slowdown in demand in rural and urban India 2) likely hit on margins in 1H23 as the impact of Ukraine Russia crises plays out on commodity prices 3) increase in overall inflation led by higher food and fuel prices which could impact medium term demand scenario and 4) increase in risk free rate for DCF from 6% to 6.8% in rising interest rate scenario. We believe that this phase is transitionary and structural story is intact as 1) HUL continues to gain share in key product categories and organized players gain more during times of high inflation 2) HFD segment is likely to emerge as a key driver of growth led by distribution led gains and small packs and 3) sustained innovation across categories and distribution gains from strategies like WIMI and SHIKHAR will play out in long term. However, we expect 1H23 to be challenging due to twin impacts of poor demand and high input cost inflation. We expect 10.5% Sales and 13.9% PAT CAGR over FY22-24.



Outlook

HUL trades at 42.9xFY24 EPS (49.3xFY24 at target price) which not only shows impact of near term growth/margin pressures but also sectoral shift in fund allocations. While 2% dividend yield and strong balance sheet protect downside, expect back ended and moderate returns in current environment. Maintain BUY.

FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever is in discussions with Mahashian Di Hatti, more popularly known as MDH, to buy a majority stake in the spice maker, Mint reported on March 22. Given its national presence, MDH could be valued between Rs 10,000-15,000, the report said quoting people familiar with the development.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Valuations

Other such acquisitions have seen spice makers quoting valuations worth 12-15x the Ebitda. For example, ITC bought Kolkata’s Sunrise Foods for Rs 2,150 crore upping its valuation 25x the previous year’s operating profit.

Sunrise’s FY20 Ebitda was Rs 88 crore on a revenue of Rs 591 crore; for comparison MDH earned Rs 507 crore in FY21 on net sales of Rs 1,191 crore.

Sources said MDH Spices has also been in discussions with other conglomerates after founder Dharampal Gulati’s death, but did not specify who showed interest.

Market prospects

Marquee investing banking firm Avendus Capital estimates India’s branded spice market will double in size to Rs 50,000 crore by 2025. Notably however, the space is dominated by regional players who cater to consumer preferences and cooking habits which differ across states.

Analysts feel that HUL’s entry into the space could change the dynamics, especially if it leverages its distribution muscle to promote MDH after the acquisition.

However, some analysts also feel that expansion beyond tier II cities would be a challenge as local brands have built trust for years with people in Tier III, IV and V cities and also cater to specific local palettes through their regional blends.

HUL and MDH Spices did not respond to queries, as per the report.

MDH Spices sells over 60 products in India and deals with at least 1,000 wholesalers and hundreds of thousands of retailers. Its website claims the company can produce 30 tonnes of spices a day.",324,-0.07887977361679077

Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) has announced two key appointments to its management committee: Madhusudhan Rao as executive director, beauty and wellbeing and personal care, and Deepak Subramanian as executive director, home care.

“Rao takes over from Priya Nair who will move into her new global role as beauty and wellbeing, chief marketing officer. Subramanian will take over from Prabha Narasimhan, who has decided to leave the company to pursue an external opportunity,” the company said in a press statement on March 9.

Rao, currently executive vice president – home and hygiene, Unilever, joined HUL in 1991.

“In his over 30 years in the company, he demonstrated a strong performance track record in marketing, customer development and brand development roles across geographies. In his current role, Rao helped shape the home and hygiene category as a successful business with a distinctive high-performance culture,” it added.

Subramanian, currently vice president, home care, South-East Asia/Australia and New Zealand (SEAA) and global head, fabric enhancers, joined HUL in 1995 as a management trainee. From being the marketing manager for Kissan in India and the regional brand director for Vitality Foods, he moved on to become the vice president for foods and refreshment for Central and Eastern Europe.

“In his current role leading home care for SEAA, Subramanian significantly improved the profitability of the business, whilst strengthening top-line growth. In his global role, he helped transform the fabric enhancers category by driving innovations and re-positioning the brands to have more social impact,” HUL said.

In February, HUL had announced the splitting of chairman and MD and CEO posts and appointed former CEO Nitin Paranjpe as new chairman of the Indian unit. Sanjiv Mehta remains CEO and MD of the company.

Paranjpe is part of the parent company’s leadership. Currently, operations chief of Unilever, he is set to become the chief people officer and chief transformation officer in April as the company goes through a major transition.

Unilever in January announced a restructuring that would help the company generate 600 million euros of cost-saving while adopting a leaner structure.

According to executives, Unilever’s matrix structure, under which the teams report to several heads, has become redundant and is no longer working for the company.

“It slows down the decision-making and diffuses accountability,” said Alan Jope, CEO, Unilever, addressing an investor call earlier in February.

As a result, the company is restructuring its senior management roles. The proposed new organisation model will result in a reduction of 15 percent in senior management roles while the junior management roles will be trimmed by 5 percent, equivalent to around 1,500 roles globally, the company informed in a press statement.

Another major move by the company as part of its restructuring will be to organise its business under five distinct business groups – beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice cream. Each of these units will have a business leader reporting to the top management.

My strongest female role model has been my mother. And of course, every child feels that their mother is the best mom ever. My true inspiration comes from what I have learnt from her.

At 77, she is a practising doctor, who runs a clinic in the back alleys of Mumbai, serving under-privileged patients with meagre charges. It’s from her that I have learnt the power of purpose, to keep yourself going at all costs. She has, like many doctors during the pandemic, continued to serve her patients selflessly. In fact, she did contract Covid-19 but fortunately recovered well.

I have learnt that in corporate life, if you are fortunate enough to discover your purpose, which I have in my work, you will have the strength to manage all volatility and uncertainty. I have learnt that it is the power of the inner compass that gives you conviction, energy, and optimism.

The second lesson I have learnt is to keep learning. I have watched my mother attend numerous seminars and forums, constantly reading and keeping abreast of all the advancements in her field and take notes for herself – all while being a septuagenarian. This learning agility is very critical in management, as we see the world change at an increasing speed. Constant learning, not just on the job, but also learning from peers and industry is critical for sharpening your skills and for personal development.

Inspired by this and after 25 years of work experience, I took on a Harvard Executive Leadership Program and went back to school. I continue to take pride in the lessons I have learnt from my mother.

I have had the privilege to have a strong female role model at home and the result has been two successful daughters my mother has raised. My sister is a well-respected surgical oncologist with the Tata Hospital. Very soon, my mother will be a successful grandmother with my daughter, who will be off to university shortly.

We definitely need more women who raise their daughters strong!

Former Hindustan Unilever chief executive officer Nitin Paranjpe’s appointment as its non-executive chairman will help strengthen the company’s relationship with parent Unilever, which plans to restructure its business model, analysts said.

While Paranjpe’s appointment, effective March 31, was made in keeping with good governance practices, it has wider implications for the company, experts indicated.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market regulator, had been urging listed companies to separate the roles of chairman and CEO or managing director. Sanjiv Mehta, the former chairman, will continue as CEO and MD, Hindustan Unilever said in a regulatory filing on February 24.

“The appointment will make the relationship between the parent Unilever and Hindustan Unilever much stronger and seamless given Nitin Paranjpe also occupies leadership roles at the parent Unilever,” said Abneesh Roy, executive director, institutional equities, at Edelweiss Securities.

Paranjpe is currently COO of Unilever and is set to become chief people officer and chief transformation officer in April. He will lead the company as it goes through a major restructuring, Unilever had said.

‘No one better’

Experts said Paranjpe’s experience as CEO of Hindustan Unilever will work in favour of the Indian unit.

“Paranjpe has earlier been a very dynamic MD and CEO of Hindustan Unilever, so he understands India and Hindustan Unilever extremely well and will enrich the board,” said Roy.

Paranjpe was CEO of Unilever’s Indian unit and served as executive vice president for the South Asia region from 2008 to 2013, when he was appointed president of the home care business at Unilever and then president of food and refreshments in 2018. Paranjpe became a member of the Unilever Leadership Executive in 2018 and COO of the company in 2019.

“Besides helming HUL for a long time, Paranjpe has also headed most divisions at Unilever globally. He is now going to spearhead the parent company’s transformation and there is no one better than him to be the chairman of HUL,” said Himanshu Nayyar, lead analyst – institutional equities, at Yes Securities.

Unilever announced a restructuring in January that is aimed at helping the company generate 600 million euros of cost-savings while adopting a leaner structure. According to company executives, Unilever’s matrix structure, under which the teams report to several heads, has become redundant and is no longer working.

Read: Unilever’s restructuring to generate 600 million euros of cost-saving, says management

“It slows down the decision-making and diffuses accountability,” Unilever CEO Alan Jope had said on an investor call earlier in February.

The proposed new organisation model will result in a 15 percent reduction in senior management roles, while junior management roles will be trimmed by 5 percent, equivalent to about 1,500 roles globally, the company said in a statement. The move is expected to result in job losses in India.

“In India, too, the company had adopted a similar structure and we expect some positions will be eliminated and there will be a downsizing. However, in the long term it will make the company more agile and help it in adjusting to the current business environment,” said Nayyar of Yes Securities. “But near-term disruption can’t be ruled out, which will impact employee morale.”

Restructuring impact

Another major move as part of the recast will be to organise its businesses under five distinct groups – beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice-cream. Each of these units will have a business leader reporting to the top management.

Currently, Unilever houses its businesses under foods and refreshments, beauty and personal care, and home care. Experts said the Indian unit may not be reorganised similarly.

“Globally, the ice-cream business is quite large, but not in India, and hence it is unlikely that we will see a separate ice-cream division,” indicated Nayyar.

The Rs 45,000 crore HUL is the largest FMCG company in India and sells products such as Lux and Lifebuoy soaps and Kwality Wall’s frozen desserts.

Hindustan Unilever is yet to state what the restructuring would mean in India.

The company, in response to a query from Moneycontrol last month, said HUL has a mutually beneficial and interdependent relationship with the Unilever Group and the company will continue to leverage this organisation structure to serve consumers and customers.

“Changes, if any, will be announced in due course,” the company had said.",734,0.3149908185005188

FMCG behemoth Hindustan Unilever on January 24 announced the appointment of Nitin Paranjpe as the non-executive chairman and non-executive director of the company, effective from March 31, 2022. Sanjiv Mehta, the CEO and MD of the company, said HUL in a stock exchange filing, will continue in his current role.

The company also announced the re-appointment of Dev Bajpai as a whole-time director for a period of five years starting from 23rd January, 2022 to 22nd January, 2027.

Nitin Paranjpe commenting on his appointment as the Non-Executive Chairman said, “It’s an honour and a privilege to be appointed as the non-executive Chairman of HUL; one of the most respected companies in the country. I look forward to working closely with Sanjiv and the Board to further strengthen the company and help navigate the challenges and opportunities in the years ahead.”

Paranjpe’s appointment comes amidst a major restructuring within the HUL’s parent company Unilever. Unilever about a month back had announced a restructuring exercise within the company and re-appointed Nitin Paranjpe, a former HUL CEO, as the chief transformation officer and chief people officer. He is currently the COO of the company.

Paranjpe, the company said, will lead the business transformation, and head the HR function now. The executive was CEO of Unilever's Indian unit HUL and served as executive vice president for the South Asia region from 2008-2013. In 2013, he was appointed president of home care business at Unilever and then president of food and refreshments in 2018. Paranjpe in 2018, also became a member of the Unilever Leadership Executive and COO of the company in 2019.

FMCG major Unilever’s restructuring exercise, which will bring about a significant change in how the organisation has been run for the past two decades, will result in a cost-saving of 600 million euros, the company’s management said while addressing post-earning investor call on February 10.

“We expect our new organisation to be fully operational from the middle of the year. The new structure will be achieved within existing restructuring investment plans of 2 billion euros between 2021 and 2022. Restructuring investment for 2022 is therefore expected to be around 1.4 billion euros, returning to pre-2017 levels of around 1 percent of turnover thereafter. The new organisation is expected to generate around 600 million euros of cost savings over two years.

Unilever, in a significant move last month had announced a restructuring of the organisation. The proposed new organisation model will result in a reduction of 15 percent in senior management roles while the junior management roles will be trimmed by 5 percent, equivalent to around 1,500 roles globally, the company had informed in a press statement.

Unilever’s move to changes its structure and leadership team follows a significant stake acquisition by Trian Partners, Nelson Peltz's activist hedge fund, as reported by Reuters last month. According to reports, the hedge fund, known for pushing big firms such as General Electric, Mondelez, and Procter & Gamble to improve and simplify their operations, has been pressuring Unilever as well. Trian Partners had called for changes in another consumer goods firm Procter & Gamble in 2018 and won the battle.

The new ‘structure’

The company, under its new structure, will move away from its current matrix structure and will be organised around five distinct business groups – beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice cream.

“Increasing differences are emerging between what we are calling those business groups,” the company’s CEO Alan Jope in an answer to a query.

In particular, he added, in channel footprint, if you look at the beauty, health, and well-being, it's very strongly dominated by the drugstores, health and beauty independents; and online is a particularly important part of that business. “By contrast, personal care, which in our case, we've populated with deodorants, skin cleansing, and oral care is a business that's much more dominated by more mass channels,” he said.

According to the company’s management, differences are emerging between these business groups in the channel landscape, as well as concerning competition and consumer cohorts that they target.

“And that's why we've chosen to focus them in five different areas,” he said.

Jope also emphasised that “matrix structure” had served its purpose for the company and wasn’t working anymore. “It slows down the decision-making and diffuses accountability,” he added.

The company, hence, will appoint five business leaders for each of these business groups, reporting to the top management. As part of its restructuring exercise, Unilever, said Jope, is also optimising its profit and loss statement (P&L) across categories at the country-level.

“We will now optimise the P&L within a category across countries so that we retain the strategic integrity of the agenda of each of those categories,” he added.

Impact on HUL

The impact of the restructuring exercise on the Unilever Indian unit Hindustan Unilever remains unclear. Unilever while announcing the development last month had said that Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman, and Managing Director, Hindustan Unilever, and President, Unilever South Asia will retain executive leadership of Hindustan Unilever.

Moneycontrol had sent a query to HUL last month to understand how the restructuring would impact the Indian unit but the company’s response did not bring any clarity.

“Unilever has been focused on accelerating growth within its existing business. The new organisation structure announced today by Unilever is intended to enhance business performance. This operating model will drive greater agility, improve category focus and strengthen accountability. India has been and continues to be one of the three top priority markets for Unilever. We will continue to have executive leadership of Sanjiv Mehta, chairman, and managing director under the supervision and guidance of the HUL Board,"" said an HUL spokesperson.

""We have a mutually beneficial and interdependent relationship with Unilever Group, bringing the best of trends, innovations, and capabilities to the Indian market. We will continue to leverage this organisation structure to serve our consumers and customers even better. Changes, if any, will be announced in due course,” the spokesperson further said.",775,0.9317820817232132

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR’s 3QFY22 result was broadly in line with our volume, sales, and gross margin estimate, but sharply lower ad spends (down 14.3% YoY and 260bp YoY as a percentage of sales) led to a 8.5-9% beat in our EBITDA, PBT, and adjusted PAT estimates. Since the largest player (also the first to report its result) has cut ad spends, it remains to be seen whether it is a harbinger of a trend that its other Staples peers also adopt to shore up margins in a difficult commodity cost environment.

Outlook

We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of INR2,750/share (55x FY24E EPS).

Geojit's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL), a subsidiary of Unilever PLC, is India’s leading FMCG Company. It has over 35 brands spanning across 20 distinct categories, such as soaps, detergents, shampoos and skin care. Q3FY22 standalone revenue up 10.4% YoY to Rs. 13,092cr (+2.9% QoQ), driven by calibrated pricing actions to combat inflationary pressures. EBITDA margin expanded 90bps YoY to 25.0% despite cost inflation, largely owing to reduction in A&P spending and other expenses. Adj. PAT grew 4.8% QoQ to Rs 2,292cr (+16.8% YoY). With its strong brand power, diversified portfolio, increasing market share and wide distribution network, the company is well positioned to deal with near-term uncertainties.

Outlook

Ongoing measures like grammage reduction on certain products will aid combat input cost inflation in future. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a rolled forward target price of Rs. 2,630 based on 54x FY24E Adj. EPS.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We are upgrading HUL to BUY even as we change FY22/23/24 EPS by 0.6%/ -2.7%/ -3.5% on lower margin expansion assumption for FY23/24 (50/60bps). Near term volume outlook is cautious due to 1) tepid sales growth of 6.9% in personal care and 3.3% in Food and Refreshments 2) lack of visibility on rural demand recovery 3) 2% volume growth impact due to grammage reduction in LUP’s and 4) further price hikes to counter 30% YoY input cost inflation (Ocean freight 200%, Crude oil 80%, CPO 60% and Polyethylene 40% YoY). However, we remain positive on the longer term structural story given 1) sustained market share gains 2) strong innovation pipeline 3) scale up in emerging categories (Green Tea, Fabric Conditioner, Liquid Detergents, Liquid Dishwash, Hair conditioner) and 4) distribution gains from strategies like WIMI and SHIKHAR. We expect 10.9% Sales and 13.6% PAT CAGR over FY22-24 and assign a DCF based target price of Rs 2900 (Rs 2930 earlier).

Outlook

We believe risk reward is favorable at 44x FY24 EPS and ~2% dividend yield. BUY.

Unilever on January 25 announced a major organisational restructuring, which will impact several senior and junior management roles in the organisation.

The proposed new organisation model will result in a reduction of 15 percent in senior management roles while the junior management roles will be trimmed by 5 percent, equivalent to around 1,500 roles globally, the company informed in a press statement.

Under the new structure, the company will move away from its current matrix structure and will be organised around five distinct business groups – beauty and wellbeing, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice cream.

Each business group will be fully responsible and accountable for their strategy, growth, and profit delivery globally, the company said.

Leadership changes

As a result of the new set-up, Unilever is making changes to its leadership team, which includes the reappointment of former Hindustan Unilever (HUL) CEO Nitin Paranjpe, Chief Operating Officer (COO), as Chief Transformation Officer and Chief People Officer.

Paranjpe, the company said, will lead the business transformation, and head the HR function now. The executive was CEO of Unilever's Indian unit HUL and served as Executive Vice President for the South Asia region from 2008-2013. In 2013, he was appointed President of home care business at Unilever and then President of food and refreshments in 2018. Paranjpe in 2018, also became a member of the Unilever Leadership Executive and COO of the company in 2019.

Sunny Jain, President, beauty and personal care, has decided to leave Unilever to set up an investment fund in technology megatrends, the company said. Jain had joined Unilever in 2019 and was part of the Unilever Leadership Executive.

“Other members of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE) will remain in the role, including Sanjiv Mehta who will retain executive leadership of Hindustan Unilever,” it added.

In other major leadership changes, Fernando Fernandez, EVP, Latin America, has been appointed President, beauty and wellbeing, which includes hair care, skincare, as well as vitamins, minerals and supplements, and Unilever Prestige and Fabian Garcia, President, North America, has been appointed President - personal care. Garcia will be responsible for skin cleansing, deodorants, and oral care.

Hanneke Faber, President, foods and refreshment, has been appointed President, nutrition, which will be home to scratch cooking, healthy snacking, functional nutrition, plant-based meat, and food solutions.

Matt Close, EVP, ice cream, has been redesignated as President, ice cream, a business group in its own right, according to the company.

Peter ter Kulve, the company said, will continue in his role as President, home care, responsible for fabric care, home and hygiene, and water and air.

These appointments are effective from April 1, 2022.

The new structure

Unilever said its five business groups will be supported by Unilever Business Operations, which will provide the technology, systems, and processes to drive operational excellence across the business. “A lean Unilever Corporate Centre will continue to set Unilever’s overall strategy,” said the company.

Alan Jope, CEO, Unilever, explained, “Our new organisational model has been developed over the last year and is designed to continue the step-up we are seeing in the performance of our business. Moving to five category-focused business groups will enable us to be more responsive to consumer and channel trends, with crystal-clear accountability for delivery. Growth remains our top priority and these changes will underpin our pursuit of this.

The move by the parent company could work in favour of the Indian unit, indicate analysts. ""While it is difficult to quantify or point out specific benefits for HUL, the category-focused business groups could give faster access to global product portfolio, help in sharing of best practices, and possibly result in quicker decision making. Also, the big focus on growth is positive for the Indian unit as HUL has gained the highest year-on-year market share in a decade,"" said Abneesh Roy, Executive Director of institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities.

Unilever’s move to changes its structure and leadership team follows a significant stake acquisition by Trian Partners, Nelson Peltz's activist hedge fund, as reported by Reuters earlier this week. According to reports, the hedge fund, known for pushing big firms such as General Electric, Mondelez and Procter & Gamble to improve and simplify their operations, has been pressuring Unilever as well. Trian Partner’s had called for changes in another consumer goods firm Procter & Gamble in 2018 and won the battle.",768,0.8423878947893778

Even as Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) battles inflationary headwinds and a slowdown in rural India, the company’s discretionary and out-of-home portfolio, which consists of products ranging from ice cream to beauty and cosmetics brands, recovered to pre-pandemic levels of growth in the quarter ended December.

“While health, hygiene, and nutrition categories under our portfolio have performed well even during the COVID period, our out-of-home and discretionary portfolio struggled. However, in the last two quarters, we have seen consumption coming back in these products – be it ice cream or colour cosmetics under Lakme. The products have started to grow ahead of 2019 and pre-pandemic levels with the improvement of mobility,” said Ritesh Tiwari, HUL’s chief financial officer.

Discretionary (skincare, deodorants and colour cosmetics), which contributes 12 percent to HUL’s business, posted 5 percent two-year CAGR in sales in the fiscal third quarter, compared to -13 percent in the first quarter.

Similarly, out-of-home, which makes up 3 percent of its business, posted 12 percent two-year CAGR in the December quarter, compared to – 22 percent in the June quarter.

The numbers mark a recovery in the categories, which have been struggling with the onset of the COVID-19.

According to Abneesh Roy, executive director of institutional equities at Edelweiss Securities, the recovery in out-of-home and discretionary categories helped HUL’s performance in the third quarter in the face of headwinds from inflation and rural slowdown.

Margin recovery

Growth in these categories helped HUL deliver better quarter-on-quarter gross margins, said a note by Jefferies. “Sequential gross margin recovery was led by product price-hike and better mix (recovery in discretionary along with seasonality), even as raw materials pressures remain elevated and in fact, saw a further step-up in the third quarter,” the note said.

HUL reported a 60 basis points (bps) jump in its third-quarter gross margins. The year-on-year decline at 180 basis points remained high, said Jefferies. According to the packaged consumer goods giant, its unit material costs were 30 percent higher than FY20 levels in the December quarter. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Going forward, analysts said discretionary and out-of-home portfolios can come to the rescue of the company as inflation plays spoilsport with the rest of the segment.

“In our upside scenario, we forecast 14 percent annual growth in revenues over FY21-24E with 160 bps of EBITDA margin expansion. Revenue growth is supported by a strong acceleration in discretionary and out-of-home categories,” said Jeffries. EBITDA is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.

The brokerage cited the impact of the third wave of the pandemic on discretionary products as a downside.

Roy of Edelweiss, however, said the third wave might not have an impact on HUL’s discretionary and out-of-home portfolios because lockdowns and curbs this time around were not very strict and will not impact mobility like the last two waves did.

‘Unprecedented’ inflation

Meanwhile, inflation will continue to remain a worry for the company at least until the second half of the calendar year 2022, indicated its top management.

“We are seeing unprecedented inflation; something we have not seen for at least last 30 years. And this is not demand-led but supply-led because of disruptions across the world. I believe, that hopefully in the second half of the year, we should see some moderation in inflation,” Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director of HUL, said at a post-earnings media briefing.

The company expects inflation to accelerate in the March quarter.

Packaged consumer products companies have been grappling with the rise in prices of several key commodities such as palm oil, and crude-linked derivatives for several quarters now.

Despite hiking prices, the companies have been unable to pass on the increased costs to consumers given the high inflation and fears that demand may be hurt. This in turn has dented their margins.

HUL increased the prices of its soaps and detergents by 3-20 percent earlier this month, after taking a 1-33 percent increase across the product portfolio in November.

HUL on January 20 reported about a 17 percent year-on-year jump in its Q3 net profit to Rs 2,243 crore, compared to Rs 1,921 crore reported in the corresponding period last year. The company’s revenue during the period climbed by over 10 percent to Rs 13,183 crore compared to Rs 11,959 crore in the December quarter of the previous year.",746,0.563992943082537

After a significant rally of 10 percent, the market, for first time, saw some meaningful correction in the week ended January 21 as the benchmark indices fell 3.5 percent amid inflation concerns, rising oil prices, spiking US bond yields and FII selling. Traders also seem cautious ahead of the Union Budget.

The Nifty50 fell more than 600 points during the week to settle at 17,617, as selling pressure was seen across sectors barring energy, forming large bearish candle on the daily charts. It was down seven-tenth of a percent and formed Doji kind of pattern on the daily charts, indicating indecisiveness among bulls and bears.

The index defended the 17,500 level which is going to act as a crucial support next week as breaking the same can drag the index towards 17,300 levels, while the 17,700 mark would be a crucial hurdle, experts feel.

""Before this corrective phase, we had seen a sharp surge, too, wherein the index had rallied from 16,410 to 18,300 without any meaningful correction and thus, this down move could be seen as a corrective phase within the uptrend,"" says Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com.

He further says the index has retraced 38.2 percent of the previous rally and has formed a 'Doji' candlestick pattern on the daily chart. ""This pattern near the support indicates indecision and thus a follow up move in the coming week is likely to dictate the near term direction.""

For the coming week, Ruchit Jain says 17,500 will be seen as an important support while a move above 17,700 could again lead to a buying interest among market participants and take the index towards 17,900-18,000.

This week's correction is just a short-term corrective phase and the market should now resume the uptrend to mark a pre-budget rally, says Jain.

Here are top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on the January 21 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Tech Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,593.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,480 | Target: Rs 1,690-1,770 | Return: 6-11 percent

On Friday, the stock completed a corrective pattern between the Rs 1,610-1,600 levels. It was at Rs 1,838 in December 2021 and currently it is available at Rs 1,600, which is a decent correction from the high level but it is still in the trading range of the previous up-move, which was between Rs 1,480 and Rs 1,838.

Buy at the current levels, add more if the stock falls to Rs 1,540. Make the final stop-loss near Rs 1,480. On the upside, there would be resistance at Rs 1,690 and Rs 1,770.

Tata Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 241.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 225 | Target: Rs 268-287 | Return: 11-19 percent

Last month, the stock was consolidating into an ascending triangle, which was transformed into a breakout formation above the Rs 230 level.

It is pursuing a breakout formation that allows the stock to reach Rs 268, which was its previous highest level. Buy at current levels for a target of a minimum of Rs 268 and a maximum of Rs 287 over the next few months. For that, keep the stop-loss at Rs 225.

IRB Infrastructure: Buy | LTP: Rs 232.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 210 | Target: Rs 263-290 | Return: 13-25 percent

After hitting the support at Rs 200, it is forming a rounding bottom. It has taken almost a month, which is positive for the stock and may help the stock to move upwards.

It is advisable to buy between the Rs 240 and Rs 230 levels for the target of Rs 263, where the stock has left the bearish gap and the next target would be Rs 290. For that, keep a stop-loss at Rs 210.

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

Linde India: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,774.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,630 | Target: Rs 3,065 | Return: 10 percent

After showing a rangebound action in the last few weeks, the stock price (Linde India) has witnessed a sharp upside breakout in this week amid a volatile broader market. The stock price has moved above the crucial resistance of the consolidation at Rs 2,535 levels on Friday and closed higher. Hence, there is a higher possibility of further extension of upside momentum in the coming week.

Volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period relative strength index (RSI) shows positive indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price ahead.

Buying can be initiated in Linde India at CMP, add more on dips down to Rs 2,700, wait for the upside target of Rs 3,065 in the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 2,630.

CCL Products India: Buy | LTP: Rs 460.9 | Stop-Loss: Rs 430 | Target: Rs 515 | Return: 12 percent

After showing minor weakness within a narrow range in the last two weeks, the stock price has witnessed a decisive upside bounce of the range movement at Rs 440 levels in this week and closed higher. The weekly candle pattern indicate a decisive upside breakout of the larger consolidation pattern.

The larger positive sequence like higher tops and bottoms is intact as per weekly timeframe chart. Volume has expanded on Friday during upside breakout and the weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication.

One may look to buy CCL Products at CMP, add more on dips down to Rs 445 and wait for the upside target of Rs 515 in the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 430.

Biocon: Buy | LTP: Rs 377.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 350 | Target: Rs 417 | Return: 11 percent

The down trend of the last many months seems to have completed in this stock (Biocon). The stock price is now making an attempt to stage upside breakout of the consolidation movement (type of triangle pattern) at Rs 385 levels.

After showing a larger downward trend in the last many months, the stock price seems to have halted its down trend and recently showed an accumulation type pattern at the lows. This bullish action could consider as an attempt of decisive change in trend in the stock price towards upside.

The volume has started to expand and weekly 14 period RSI and weekly ADX/DMI (average directional index/direction movement index) signal chances of further strengthening of upside momentum for the stock price ahead.

One may look to buy Biocon at CMP, add more on dips down to Rs 360 and wait for the upside target of Rs 417 in the next 3-4 weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 350.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: 2,325.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,250 | Target: Rs 2,440 | Return: 5 percent

This stock has gone through a corrective phase in last four months and prices have corrected from its high of Rs 2,850 to Rs 2,200. Historically, the '20-EMA' (exponential moving average) on the monthly charts have acted as a support during price corrections from where we again usually witness buying interest in this stock.

After this recent correction, the stock is trading near its long-term moving average support and now even on the daily chart, we witnessed some buying interest in the stock on Friday. This up move during the day was supported by good volumes while a combination of short covering and long formation was seen in the derivatives segment. Hence, we expect a pullback move in the stock in the near term.

Thus, short-term traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 2,320-2,300 for a potential target of Rs 2,440 in next 2-3 weeks. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 2,250 on long positions.

Bharat Dynamics: Buy | LTP: Rs 459.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 435 | Target: Rs 500 | Return: 9 percent

In the recent corrective phases, the stock has managed to find support around its '200 EMA' on the daily chart and in this month, we have witnessed a decent buying interest in the stock. Prices have seen an up move supported by good volumes while the stock has also given a breakout from its resistance.

The weekly and monthly momentum readings are indicating a positive structure and hence, we expect the stock prices to continue its up move in the short term.

Hence, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 460-450 for a potential target of Rs 500 in next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 435 on long positions.

Hitachi Energy India: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,030.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,750 | Target: Rs 3,450 | Return: 14 percent

The stock has been forming a 'Higher Top Higher Bottom' structure on the weekly charts and is thus in an uptrend. In last couple of months, the stock went through a time-wise correction and prices have given a breakout from this consolidation during this week.

The price up move on Friday was supported by good volumes which indicate that the stock has resumed its broader uptrend. The breakout zone of Rs 2,850-2,800 should now become a support on any declines and hence, short term traders can adopt a strategy to buy the stock at current levels and add on dips towards the mentioned support.

Thus, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy around Rs 3,000 for a potential target of Rs 3,450 in next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 2,750 on long positions.

Expert: Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One

Time Technoplast: Buy | LTP: Rs 86.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 77.90 | Target: Rs 102 | Return: 18.3 percent

Although the entire market corrected sharply this week, there were few handful of stocks who did extremely well and this stock is clearly one of them.

On Friday, despite stock prices falling sharply on the back of profit booking, the weekly structure still looks quite sturdy. We can see it traversing weekly '200-SMA' with some authority along with sizable volumes, indicating tremendous strength in the counter.

The momentum oscillators on daily charts are pointing northwards, which indicates momentum to continue in the upward direction. We recommend buying for a medium term target of Rs 102. The stop loss can be placed at Rs 77.90.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) share price rose in the early trade on January 21 - a day after the company reported its December quarter earnings.

Hindustan Unilever reported a 16.8 percent on-year rise in net profit to Rs 2,243 crore for the quarter ended December 2021. This was in line with analysts' expectations of Rs 2,242.7 crore.

The soap-to-shampoo conglomerate saw its revenue from operations grow 10.4 percent on-year to Rs 13,092 crore for the reported quarter, which was slightly above street's estimate of Rs 12,995 crore.

On the operating profit front, HUL surpassed estimates with a 14.9 percent year-on-year rise to Rs 3,279 crore as against expectations of Rs 3,188 crore. The company's operating margin for the reported quarter expanded 100 basis points to 25.4 percent.

The Indian benchmark indices opened gap-down on January 21 with the Sensex down 522.28 points or 0.88 percent at 58942.34, and the Nifty down 154 points or 0.87 percent at 17603, while writing this copy.

Catch all the market action on our live blog

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after its December quarter earnings:

Morgan Stanley

The research house kept an 'equal-weight' rating on the stock and cut the target price to Rs 2,766 from Rs 3,012, as the Q3 earnings beat its estimate and stayed slightly ahead of consensus.

The management sounded optimistic on the company's performance, while cautioned about near-term operating environment.

Credit Suisse

The broking firm has maintained 'outperform' call with a target at Rs 2,800.

Credit Suisse expects the company to deliver healthy mid-teens earnings growth in FY23, while volume growth is likely to remain in low single digits.

CLSA

The research firm has maintained 'outperform' call on the stock with a target at Rs 2,725.

The company is relatively better positioned but tailwinds lacking for stock performance. It is well positioned in earnings growth longevity and preparedness to handle disruptions.

The mean valuations have reverted to the five-year average.

Jefferies

The broking house has kept a 'buy' call on the stock with a target at Rs 2,900.

A round of price hike that drove the double-digit revenue growth is going to offset input price pressure, it said.

The company’s margin was improved, driving 15 percent EBITDA growth. The near-term outlook is clouded by weak consumption trends and stiff raw material cost inflation.

Jefferies expects a recovery in revenue and earnings growth in FY23.

Motilal Oswal

Revisions to our model have led to a +2.6 percent/-0.9 percent/-0.1 percent change in the FY22E/FY23E/FY24E EPS estimates, said the broking house.

Before a steeper commodity cost inflation v/s peers and HUVR’s over indexed discretionary portfolio affected earnings in FY21 and FY22, the same had been extremely strong, having reported 18 percent average annual growth in EPS in the four years ending FY20. This was particularly impressive given the weak mid-single-digit earnings growth posted by its (much smaller) peers over the same period. We expect the company to return to the 15-17 percent earnings growth range.

""Given all these factors, valuations at 51.9x/45.3x FY23/FY24 EPS still leave room for an upside. We maintain our 'buy' rating with a target price of Rs 2,750/share (55x FY24E EPS)."" .

Sharekhan

Though a slowdown in rural demand and raw material inflation will lead to moderate growth in the near term, a strong portfolio of brands, market share gains in the key categories, strong team with great focus supported by R&D and agile distribution and supply chain will help HUL to achieve volume-led earnings growth in the medium term.

We maintain our buy recommendation on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs 3,185.

At 9:18am, Hindustan Unilever was quoting at Rs 2,266.15, up Rs 4.55, or 0.20 percent, on the BSE.

Inflation, a constant worry for FMCG companies since the onset of the pandemic, will continue unabated for the next two quarters and will moderate only in the second half of the calendar year 2022, indicated Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) top management during a virtual media briefing on January 20.

“We are seeing unprecedented inflation; something we have not seen for at least last 30 years. And this is not demand-led but supply-led because of disruptions across the world. I believe, that hopefully in the second half of the year, we should see some moderation in inflation,” said Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director, HUL addressing a post-earnings media briefing.

The company’s chief financial officer Ritesh Tiwari too chimed in and said the company expects a further rise in inflation in the March quarter.

“In the near term, the operating environment looks challenging, and we expect to see sequentially more inflation in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter,” he added.

FMCG companies are grappling with the rise in prices of several key commodities such as palm oil, and crude-linked derivatives for several quarters now. Despite taking price hikes of several rounds, the companies have been unable to pass on the increased costs to consumers given the quantum of inflation and fearing an impact on demand. This in turn has dented their margins.

HUL has also taken several rounds of price hikes. The company increased the prices of its soaps and detergents by 3-20 percent earlier this month, after taking a 1-33 percent increase across the product portfolio in November.

According to HUL’s management, the company’s raw material costs are up by 30 percent as compared to FY20, most of which is on account of commodities such as palm oil and crude-linked derivatives. Palm oil is a key raw material for soaps, while crude-linked derivatives are essential for detergents and packaging material.

“About two-thirds of our business is exposed to these commodities,” said Tiwari.

HUL houses soap brands such as Lux, Dove, Rexona, Lifebuoy, Liril, Pears and detergent brands such as Surf Excel and Rin.

Rural slowdown a drag

A tepid rural demand has further complicated matters for FMCG companies. While rural demand remained resilient with the onset of the pandemic and even during the second wave, the second quarter of FY22 witnessed a downturn.

CMD Mehta flagged off the rural slowdown while reporting second-quarter results in October. “Rural demand in the past few quarters has been resilient thanks to government initiatives such as higher spending on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), food subsidies, direct cash transfers to farmers, and a “decent harvest,” Mehta had said then.

“Now, as mobility improves and urban markets see a pickup, rural centres, though they are still growing, their growth rates have moderated,” he added.

The demand scenario in rural areas, indicated HUL’s management, further weakened in the quarter gone by.

“Though the headline value growth is still there in rural India, the volumes growth has turned negative,” said Mehta, while addressing the media briefing.

While the company is unable to introduce price hikes in rural India, given the unsupportive demand scenario, it has reduced the grammage of its low-unit products (LUPs), resulting in a drop in its sales volume.

“Almost 30 percent of our business comes from packs that operate at magic price points of Rs 1, Rs 5, and 10. In these packs instead of increasing pricing, we reduce grammage; as a result, the same number of units sold leads to volume decline and this has an impact on our volumes,” said Tiwary.

HUL reported volume growth of 2 percent in the third quarter-ended December as compared to 4 percent growth registered in the second quarter.

CMD Mehta called for government interventions such as increasing the outlay under MGNREGS for the recovery of the rural economy and demand regeneration.

HUL on January 20 reported about a 17 percent year-on-year jump in its Q3 net profit to Rs 2,243 crore as compared to Rs 1,921 crore reported in the corresponding period last year. The company’s total income during the period climbed by over 10 percent to Rs 13,183 crore as compared to Rs 11,959 crore in the December quarter last year.",728,-0.3358972320954005

Companies operating in consumer staples are expected to report moderate growth in the third-quarter ended December, while discretionary will outperform the consumer goods pack backed by festive demand, project analysts. According to analysts, a slowdown in rural demand coupled with high inflation as FMCG companies battle raw material costs will impact their performance in Q3.

“Consumer staples are likely to record slower growth, with volume growth across most firms in the low single-digits, impacted by the rural demand slowdown and the reversal of Covid-related tailwinds,” said a recent report by Emkay Global.

However, an increase in sales and a rise in footfalls due to festivities in October and November are supposed to have aided the discretionary universe.

“Jewellery retail should see strong underlying revenue momentum aided by share gains. Alcoholic beverage companies should see continued recovery with on-trade channel normalisation and wedding/functions led demand uptick,” said a note from Kotak Institutional Equities.

FMCG: Rural growth story tapers off

A slowdown in rural India coupled with inflationary pressure is expected to have impacted the performance of FMCG companies in the third quarter. Companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Marico, Tata Consumer Products, and Dabur had reported early signs of a rural slowdown in October last year.

Rural demand in the past few quarters has been resilient thanks to government initiatives such as higher spending on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, food subsidies, direct cash transfers to farmers, and a “decent harvest,” said Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director of Hindustan Unilever, India’s largest FMCG company.

“Now, as mobility improves and urban markets see a pickup, rural centres, though they are still growing, their growth rates have moderated,” he said.

A report by data, insights and consulting company Kantar confirmed the trend. Rural areas, according to data released by the company, reported 1.5 percent growth in the September quarter compared to 4.5 percent growth in the year-ago period.

Analysts expect the rural growth to have further slowed down in the October-December period impacting their performance during the quarter.

“In Q3FY22, the rural slowdown will be a key issue due to grammage cuts, inflation hurting consumers’ pockets, high base, an uneven monsoon and delay in winter,” said a note by Edelweiss Research.

Besides rural slowdown, inflation, a worry for FMCG companies since the onset of the pandemic, would also weigh in their performance in Q3.

“Significant inflation across raw materials implies the pressure on gross margins will persist, which would start easing off Q4FY22 onwards. Companies have taken aggressive price hikes and grammage cuts—and that would impact volumes,” added Edelweiss Research.

Discretionary to outperform

Discretionary consumer products after struggling with sluggish sales in the first quarter and then gradual recovery in the second quarter as the second wave of the COVID-19 ebbed, are expected to have clocked growth in the third quarter.

Earlier this month, Titan Company in a quarterly update reported to have witnessed strong demand across its consumer businesses of jewellery, watches and wearables, eye wear, and clocked 36 percent growth over the festive quarter last year.

A note by Kotak Institutional Equities, too, pegs discretionary (ex-ITC) will outperform staples pack on underlying (two-year CAGR) revenues. It expects companies in staples to register 9.8 percent revenue CAGR while discretionary to report 16 percent revenue CAGR.

“We expect continued strong growth in paints (decorative)/adhesive companies led by share gains from smaller players and good construction led demand, despite some drag from unseasonal rains,” the brokerage added.

According to Kotak Institutional Equities, jewellery retail should see strong underlying revenue momentum aided by share gains, and alcoholic beverage companies should see continued recovery with on-trade channel normalisation and wedding/functions-led demand uptick.",611,0.06709238416270207

2022-01-08 07:27:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/storyboard18-when-i-met-gerson-da-cunha-7912621.html,"Ad man Gerson Da Cunha died on Friday (January 7, 2022). He was 92.

Four years ago, when advertising and theatre veteran Alyque Padamsee passed away, I was looking for less-known stories of the legendary adman. I made several calls to people who could tell me tales of that golden era of advertising and Padamsee’s glorious and glamorous past and the contributions he made to Indian advertising during those years.

My first call was to Gerson Da Cunha, a close friend and colleague of Padamsee’s. At the time, Da Cunha was trying to live a chaos-free life, which basically meant that he didn’t have a smartphone. I sourced his residence landline number and called him. His assistant received my call and said he would discuss the possibility of a meeting with Da Cunha. I was asked to check in an hour later.

When I made the next call, I briefly spoke to the man himself. He said in his distinctive voice and manner, “I would love to talk about my friend Alyque. Meet me tomorrow at 3 pm.”

24 hours later, I was waiting in Da Cunha’s sunlit living room in his South Bombay flat in one of the city’s Art Deco buildings. I use the word Bombay deliberately because this feels like Da Cunha’s Bombay and I was about to take a short trip there. As I waited, through the window I could see young boys playing cricket at the Oval Maidan, which was across the street.

A couple of minutes later, Da Cunha welcomed me with a big smile. Before we started our chat, he told me he would tell me stories of a dear friend and not an adman. His narration of tales about his friend and that era of advertising felt like watching a play. He was, after all, a man of the theatre as much as advertising.

But Gerson Da Cunha, who studied biochemistry and was about 17 years old when India was freed of British rule, started his career as a journalist working with Reuters and later with All India Radio (AIR). He left the profession slightly disillusioned to join advertising, working at agencies like JWT (J Walter Thompson) and Lintas for decades. He spent his time in advertising and in theatre. Da Cunha also devoted his life to social causes. He moved to the US to work with UNICEF. In later years, he devoted much of his time and energies to public causes, to Bombay - the city he loved dearly, and the NGO that he founded, AGNI (Action for Good Governance and Networking in India).

Da Cunha’s advertising life’s highlight is at Lintas, where he spent 25 years, the last 10, from 1969 to 1979, as the agency’s head. He brought with him Alyque Padamsee and later he hired Shyam Benegal. At Lintas, they worked on prized accounts like Hindustan Unilever (HUL) and its iconic brands. At the time it was three separate companies – Hindustan Vanaspati Manufacturing Company, United Traders Limited and Levers International Limited.

In an interview with Mumbai Mirror in 2019 he said one of the reasons he moved to Lintas was the closeness to HUL and the other was that at Lintas, “you didn't work in an advertising cocoon. You worked in the bazaar. You met salesmen. You toured the country. Now that is something indispensable”.

During our conversation, he told me stories about the days and nights he spent in newsrooms, green rooms, and of course, script rooms. He requested that I keep a few to myself because “let bygones be bygones”.

While talking about the advertising culture back then, Da Cunha told me they never sat in plush offices and wrote. They went out in the world and absorbed as much as they could of it and the people they met during their travels, which inspired their storytelling, as they call it nowadays.

An hour into the chat, we suddenly heard a few boys who were playing cricket across the street screaming with joy. He grinned and told me a story about this one time when Padamsee came late for the dress rehearsal of Ebrahim Alkazi’s production of William Shakespeare’s Richard III. He came in late because he was busy with a neighbourhood cricket match.

It was an excuse that wasn’t appreciated by a lot of people then, Da Cunha said with a chuckle. He then paused, his eyes moist, and said, “I will miss those days. I will miss my dear friend.”

I left him with his memories and came back to my newsroom with a notebook full of stories.

Da Cunha passed away at 92 years old. His stories and his legacy will live on.

Tributes from the advertising community for Gerson Da Cunha

Prasoon Joshi, CEO and CCO of McCann Worldgroup India and chairman of McCann Worldgroup Asia Pacific

Though he was out of real day-to-day action in advertising by the time I started into the profession, for my generation of professionals, Gerson was someone who represented the cerebral. He had a much larger horizon of life and things he loved - be it cinema, art or music. He kept curiosity and keen interest alive and made living life like an art form.

I will cherish all my interactions with him deeply, he had so much to impart and that too with generosity.

Sam Balsara, Chairman, Madison World

Gerson da Cunha was the quintessential advertising man, full of ideas, versatile, witty and with a wonderful command of the written and spoken English language. He was leader of Lintas for many years and original brand builder of many brands, notably many Lever brands. Like most advertising greats of the time, he did not restrict himself to advertising but also made a mark as a theatre personality. I admired his commitment, willingness to give freely of his time and his mastery over the English language. It was always a pleasure to listen to him and I admired his facility of the English language. In later years he devoted his life to public causes, loved his city Bombay and wanted to do a lot for it and did succeed with the NGO that he founded, AGNI. What a man and what a life.

Prabhakar Mundkur, independent brand strategy adviser

I am an ardent admirer of Gerson. I can’t believe he is gone. He was an important pillar of Mumbai, the city that he loved. He launched my musical career by getting me my first gig with HMV for a 45 RPM record in 1968 and then helped me launch my advertising career by taking me into Lintas in 1976. He is one of the most talented people I know. Actor, author, poet, ad man and social activist. They don’t make men like him any more.",1129,0.9627033472061157

All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF) has called off the boycott of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) products after the company met its representatives and addressed their concerns about emerging business-to-business platforms and cash-and-carry players such as Udaan, Jumbotail, Walmart Best Price, Metro Cash and Carry, the association said on January 4.

“HUL has given assurance that it will give serious consideration to protecting the interests of its distributors and will take action against ill-practices in the market if proven correct,” said the association.

Therefore, it added, we are ending the protest against HUL for now and will keep an eye on developments in the market for the next three months. “If the company, does not improve its practices after three months, then we will start the campaign again.”

AICPDF, however, will continue to agitate against FMCG firm Colgate-Palmolive (India) and distributors in Maharashtra will not stock Colgate Max Fresh. AICPDF has warned that if the company continues to ignore its demands, distributors will boycott other brands by Colgate-Palmolive.

“We had written all the major companies in the FMCG segment and most of them have given us an assurance about addressing our concerns, but Colgate-Palmolive continues with its stubborn attitude,” the association said in a strong-worded press statement on Tuesday.

“Hence, as announced earlier, we will start the boycott of Colgate’s Max Fresh brand in Maharashtra market and if the company still doesn’t pay heed to our complaints, then we will stop stocking Colgate Vedshakti also from next week onwards,” warned AICPDF.

Colgate-Palmolive on Tuesday in a regulatory filing informed that it is directly engaging with its distributors on the issue. “Please note that the company has a strong relationship with its distributors and supply chain partners, developed over the past eight decades, based on mutual trust, fairness and transparency,” the company said in a response to a clarification sought by the exchanges on the news reports that certain Colgate-Palmolive products will go off shelves in Maharashtra.

“Further, the company engages with distributor networks directly on an ongoing basis to address their business challenges including but not limited to a fair return on their investment,” the company informed.

Colgate-Palmolive, however, also said that it is not engaging with the AICPDF.

“Please also note that the company is not aware of any information in this regard that requires disclosure to exchanges. Further, there is no material impact of the news article on the company and the company will ensure that supply of its products remains uninterrupted in the state,” it added.

Reports of a conflict between FMCG companies and their distributors emerged in the first week of December when AICPDF wrote to 25 FMCG companies, demanding margin parity with online B2B platforms and cash-and-carry players. While most companies held talks with the association by December-end, HUL and Colgate-Palmolive were yet to respond, which piqued the already disgruntled association and led to a boycott of their products in Maharashtra.

Why HUL, Colgate-Palmolive are in a tussle with distributors

The association alleges that FMCG companies such as Hindustan Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive are offering higher margins to these platforms, hurting the business of its members. FMCG companies offer 3.5-5 percent margins to traditional distributors, but new platforms can negotiate 12-15 percent margins, given their bulk orders, distributors say.",589,-0.4947982132434845

A group of distributors has said that consumer goods behemoth Hindustan Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive are yet to respond to its demand for parity on margins offered to them and business-to-business entities.

Most of the 25 FMCG companies have responded to the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation’s demand to offer equal margins to them and B2B platforms, Dhairyashil Patil, federation president, told Moneycontrol.

“HUL and Colgate-Palmolive are two companies that have not reached out to us for further discussions. I believe these companies don’t believe in playing fair,” said Patil.

Although Patil said Hindustan Unilever is in talks with its distributors, they are not satisfied with the company’s answers. For companies that have agreed to its demands and conditions, the federation wants a written compliance document.

“We want everything in writing,” stressed Patil.

Responding to Moneycontrol's query, HUL in an email response said, ""General Trade (GT) continues to be our largest channel and our distributors (redistribution stockists) are our valued partners. We remain fully committed to enhancing capabilities in our GT network and have taken several actions such as deploying technology for order placements through India’s largest eB2B app, Shikhar, supporting our distributors to increase their direct reach and introduced specially tailored programmes with reputed academic institutions to help them hone their business skills and be future-ready. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have extended support to ensure the safety and secure livelihoods of our distributor partners through several initiatives such as wide scale vaccination drives and special medical insurance coverage.""

It further added, ""Having said that, our arrangement with our distributor partners is not exclusive. We sell and distribute our products across all channels such as general trade, modern trade, e-commerce, cash and carry B2B etc. to make our brands available to shoppers and consumers. As the new channels evolve, we will continue to take up new initiatives with an objective to help scale up business for our distributors, strengthen our distribution network and to better service our consumers.""

Distributors have been at loggerheads with FMCG companies since the start of December over the margins offered to new and emerging distribution channels such as Udaan, Elasticrun, Jumbotail, Walmart’s Best Price, and Metro Cash and Carry.

According to the federation, which represents about 400,000 distributors and stockists across India, the FMCG companies offer better margins to these platforms, which in turn grant discounts to retailers and eat into their business.

While distributors are given 3.5-5 percent margins by FMCG companies, new platforms negotiate 12-15 percent margins, given their bulk orders, and this is disrupting the market, said Patil.

Distributors from several locations also reported that retailers are buying products from cash-and-carry outlets and modern trade stores, which is hurting their business.

Unmoving companies and margins

Durgesh Shukla, 39, took up Hindustan Unilever’s distributorship in the Indore region about five years ago. However, the businessman, who also holds the distributorship of several other companies in the region, recently relinquished Hindustan Unilever’s distributorship.

“It used to be lucrative but since the pandemic, general trade has grown marginally,” he told Moneycontrol.

Hindustan Unilever used to clock about Rs 4 crore in sales from general trade and about Rs 5-6 crore from modern trade in Indore every month about five years ago, said Shukla. The Rs 45,000 crore company sells products including Lux and Lifebuoy soaps, Kwality Wall’s frozen desserts and Horlicks health food drinks.

“Though modern trade has now grown to Rs 16-17 crore, the general trade has inched to Rs 7 crore of sales and now these new channels are taking a share of the general trade pie,” he added.

Hindustan Unilever’s distributors are not making much money because the company has not increased margins in the past five years and is also making them pay transportation costs, they told Moneycontrol. About 10-15 of the company’s distributors in Madhya Pradesh recently gave up their distributorship citing these reasons, people aware of the matter said.

The situation is the same across FMCG companies. Patil of AICPDF said 15,000-20,000 distributors across the nation have quit distributorship or are in the process of doing so.

FMCG companies in India sell products to about 9-10 million general trade outlets in the country, out of which about 4-5 million are covered by their direct distributors. These outlets account for the majority share, in most cases about 90 percent, of their business.

‘Why should we collect the garbage?’

Meanwhile, as the distributor federation works on the fine print of margins with the FMCG companies, it has threatened to stop launching new products and stocking goods that are sold to the new platforms at higher margins, if their demands are not met.

“We will also stop collecting damaged and expired products of these FMCG companies from the market,” added Patil.

Authorised distributors, besides providing stocks to retailers in general trade stores, also collect damaged and expired products and return them to the FMCG companies.

“Since other channels too are selling the stocks now to general trade, then why should we be the ones collecting the garbage?” asked Patil. “If companies want us to collect expired products, then they will have to pay us a basic commission for it.”

FMCG companies may have a crisis brewing in their distributor channels as they try to pave a way out of this situation. While they have to ensure their traditional channels, which account for about 90 percent of their business, keep going, they cannot also ignore new emerging channels, which are growing at a fast pace.",947,-0.26194893568754196

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s 20% correction from the peak shows twin impacts of 1) slowdown in rural demand due to lower farmgate income and lower remittances from workers and 2) Impact of Inflation, mix changes and base impact in key categories in urban India, partly neutralized by uptick in discretionary segments. We believe that rural slowdown and inflation challenges are transitory and structural story is intact as 1) More than 75% of business is gaining share which is at a decade high 2) HFD segment is likely to emerge as a key driver of growth led by distribution led gains and small packs 4) sustained innovation across categories and launch of D2C platforms for Lakme, Simple, Dermalogica and Love Beauty & Planet and 5) distribution gains from strategies like WIMI and SHIKHAR. Input cost scenario remains volatile with uncertainty around Omicron covid variant even as we expect HUL’s margins to bottom out in 3Q. We expect 10.9% Sales and 15% PAT CAGR over FY21-24 and assign a DCF based target price of Rs 2930 (unchanged).

Outlook

HUL trades at 43.2xFY24 EPS which not only shows impact of near term growth/margin pressures but also sectoral shift in fund allocations. We believe that risk reward is favorable for steady returns from current levels given ~2% dividend yield, although returns might be back ended. Maintain Accumulate.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

While the recovery in consumption continued after the lifting of restrictions post the second COVID wave, it has been uneven with urban markets leading growth. The resilience of rural India is coming off as demand begins to slow down. The demand for MNREGA jobs is high, indicating higher unemployment levels. Farm input inflation has been higher than output inflation, causing farmer incomes to shrink. HUVR’s operating categories have seen a mid-single sales growth overall, with flat growth in rural India. This would suggest that rural volumes saw a decline in 3QFY22.



Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating with TP of INR2,800 per share (55x Dec’23E EPS).

Edelweiss Securities' report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which now houses one of the biggest food businesses in India, has completed SAP migration and 85% of go-to-market integration for its nutrition business. With this strong grounding, the company is taking the next important steps, i.e.: i) getting aggressive in terms of launches – Horlicks Diabetes Plus already launched; and ii) investing in market development – launched INR2 and INR5 sachets to drive trials. Margin realisation is ahead of the plan, and we see another 300–400bp opportunity to reduce costs, which could be redeployed towards market development.



Outlook

HUL has expanded direct coverage in the nutrition business by 2x compared to pre-acquisition. Retain ‘BUY’ with a TP of INR2,960.

KR Choksey's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL reported revenue growth of 11.7% YoY (+7% QoQ) at INR 130,460 Mn driven by double digit growth in Home Care and Beauty & Personal care segment. Gross Margins declined by 140 bps YoY impacting from higher input cost. EBITDA stood at INR 32,260 Mn (+10.3% YoY), with EBIDTA Margin at 24.7% (-30bps YoY), the contraction in margin was mainly due to higher input cost which was partially offset by cost saving measures and operational efficiency. PAT for the quarter was at INR 21,850 Mn (+10.7% YoY), with NPM at 16.7% (-20bps YoY). The company has declared an interim dividend of INR 15 per share for FY22.



Outlook

We assign a P/E multiple of 54.5x (earlier 62x) to the FY24E EPS of INR 52 (earlier FY23E EPS of INR 44.5) to arrive at a target price of INR 2,834 per share, an upside of 14.3%. We maintain our positive outlook on HUL and assign ‘ACCUMULATE’ rating to the stock.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUVR)’s 2QFY22 results were in line with our estimates. While domestic volume growth was weaker than expected at 4% for the quarter, strong realization growth actually led to a small beat on sales. While commodity costs remain elevated, we believe mix improvement would lead to continued sequential margin improvement. HUVR’s share of the Discretionary and Out-of-Home (OOH) portfolios (~15% of sales) is higher v/s peers. Moreover, these businesses have much higher margins than the rest of the portfolio. As a result, the earnings growth outlook from 2HFY22 is incrementally better v/s peers.

Outlook

We maintain a Buy rating, with TP of INR3,200 (60x Dec’23E EPS).

A seven-session rally, the market faced a drag from ITC off its record peak on Tuesday. It was perhaps the news of health ministry reviewing the taxation structure for tobacco products that had pulled the share down 6 percent. On October 20, ITC was trading 1 percent down.

The cigarettes business, which accounted for more than 40 percent to the total revenue for ITC, has seen a major relief at least since the Covid period as the government has not majorly tweaked any tax with respect to the tobacco segment.

A revival in consumption demand took the stock up 26 percent in more than a month, making it one of the major contributors to the market rally.

The Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare has set up an expert panel to review the taxation policy for tobacco products. The panel will develop a proposal for comprehensive tax policy for tobacco products with a public health perspective, the health ministry said on October 19.

Any increase in tax on tobacco-related products erodes the margins for ITC, but the company has always passed on the cost to consumers by hiking products prices. ""The demand is inelastic and does not change much due to increase in price as smokers are addicted to it. There can be a knee-jerk reaction but prices move up soon,"" said Jay Prakash Gupta, Founder at Dhan.

Likhita Chepa, Senior Research Analyst at CapitalVia Global Research feels the proposed tax structure on tobacco products is expected to put a strain on the margins of the company as cigarettes form a significant chunk of the total business of the conglomerate.

The inflationary pressure, reflected in Hindustan Unilever's operating margin for the September quarter, was also one of the reasons for the correction in ITC, though experts feel the consumption demand is getting improved. HUL was also down over 4 percent in the previous session.

""Most of the FMCG counters are continuously facing the heat of unprecedented input cost inflation and subdued consumer sentiment in the short term. A sell-off in broader markets has halted the stocks' rally and it could be profit-booking,"" said Ankur Saraswat, Research Analyst at Trustline Securities.

Apart from tobacco business, ITC also operates in several other businesses such as FMCG, hotels, paperboards and speciality papers, packaging, agri products and IT.

""ITC's business verticals are diverse and each of the verticals have potential to create enormous wealth and value for shareholders,"" said Jay Prakash Gupta.

He further said ITC as a stock has underperformed over the years. The stock is not overpriced given the kind of cash flow it generates. ""ITC must spin off its businesses and if that is done it would create a lot of value for shareholders.""

Ankur Saraswat feels the stock is available at very attractive valuations. ""With rapid vaccination drive leading to reopening of economy and gradual recovery in consumers demand in urban and rural areas, revival of its education and stationary products business, expected revival in hotels business, focusing on cost-saving programmes with richer business and category mix,"" he explained.

The net profit margin of the company for FY21 has come down to 28.65 percent from previous year's 33.17 percent but the revenue from the operations have been growing YoY. ""Therefore, investors can add this stock to their portfolio after a healthy correction,"" said Chepa of CapitalVia Global Research.

Experts expect its net profit and sales to improve going ahead, though there could be a bit of strain on margin (in cigarette business) if there is a change in tax structure.

ITC will release its second-quarter earnings on October 27. ""ITC is expected to see a swift recovery in cigarette volumes and other discretionary business with normalisation of our out-of-home activity. Consolidated revenues are likely to grow at 13.4 percent with an expected 9.4 percent growth in cigarettes sales,"" said ICICI Direct.

The brokerage expects cigarettes volumes growth of 7 percent. The hotels business is estimated to double over its low-base quarter and the FMCG and paper division is likely to grow 13.4 percent and 12.2 percent, respectively. ""We estimate the agri business growth at 6.5 percent on a relatively high base.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We are cutting FY22/23 EPS by 1.9%/0.2% on the back of 1) Inflationary environment impacting GRMs and 2) Slowdown witnessed in rural demand neutralized partly by uptick in Discretionary segments. Despite the near term inflation challenges, we remain positive on the structural story given that 1) More than 75% of business is gaining share 2) HFD segment is likely to emerge as a key driver of growth with synergies ahead of guidance 3) Rebound in discretionary and OOH expected with improving mobility 4) Launch of D2C platforms for Lakme, Simple, Dermalogica and Love Beauty & Planet 5) distribution gains from strategies like WIMI and SHIKHAR.

Outlook

We expect 10.9% Sales and 15% PAT CAGR over FY22-23 and assign a DCF based target price of Rs 2930 (Rs 2915 earlier). Maintain Accumulate.

""In this backdrop, we have delivered a strong performance, growing topline in double digits and stepping up profitability sequentially,"" Mehta said.

HUL remained cautiously optimistic about demand recovery, he said. ""In these times of uncertainty and unprecedented input cost inflation, we continue to firmly focus in delivering consistent, competitive, profitable and responsible growth,"" he said.

The homecare segment, which contributed 30 percent to the total revenue, delivered a 15.7 percent year-on-year growth in the quarter at Rs 3,838 crore, driven by high double-digit growth in fabric wash.

The beauty and personal care segment’s contribution to the revenue was at 39 percent. The company clocked 10.3 percent YoY growth in the segment at Rs 5,000 crore led by skin-care, colour cosmetics and hair-care divisions.

""Contextual communications in hair care continue to yield good results as it delivered another quarter of strong performance,” the company said.

Given its leadership position, HUL is slated to capitalize on long-term growth in the FMCG industry in India and we maintain a positive outlook on it.

7) Dr. Lal PathLabs

Dr. Lal Path Labs is engaged in providing diagnostic and related healthcare tests and services nationally and internationally. The company has been compounding its sales by almost 21 percent over the last decade and has also a maintained a healthy return on equity of 26 percent over the same period. Along with the pandemic induced increased test volumes, the companies' persistent focus of service parameters and timely turnarounds have aided in achieving resilient growth.

In order to increase its geographical penetration, the company is also expanding its network of laboratories and collection centers in West & South India.

With the diagnostic industry poised for growth, we believe premium and organised players like Dr. Lal Path Labs are set to gain market share and thus is an attractive investment bet.

8) Computer Age Management Services

Computer Age Management Services is the market leader with a share of over 70 percent of total Mutual Fund AUM in a duopoly RTA market.

Additionally, India has one of the lowest MF penetrations globally with an AUM-GDP ratio of 12 percent versus world average of 65 percent, this itself offers long-term growth potential for the overall MF and in-turn for the RTA industry. CAMS has been an attractive opportunity for investors since its listing and continues to be one.

9) Affle (India)

Affle is a leading adtech company with proprietary consumer intelligence platform helping its customers to drive user acquisitions and improve user engagements through relevant mobile advertising. Affle has achieved over 40 percent revenue CAGR over FY19 to FY21 with focus on top industry verticals in the internet segment and on faster growing emerging markets.

With a leadership position in both in-app and on-device ecosystems, end-to-end offerings in the CPCU business model, first-mover advantage in the connected device segment and an improving share of mobile ad spends, Affle is well positioned to capitalise on opportunities created in the underpenetrated industry. The management of the company expects the operating margin to be sustainable in the forthcoming quarters and aims to deliver at least 25-30 percent revenue CAGR over the medium term. We remain positive on Affle given its strong balance sheet, positive cash flow conversions, increased platform usage and a long growth runway.

10) Housing Development Finance Corporation

HDFC is India's largest mortgage lender in the current environment and remains one of the best real estate proxy play in India. With its nearly stable asset quality performance during a period when other rivals in the housing and asset financing sectors reported a large spike in stressed loans, the company has surprised the market. It has secured its position with access to low-cost funds, a solid ALM position and comfortable leverage.

Sufficient balance-sheet provisioning also provides cushion from any asset quality surprises. HDFC is well-positioned to acquire a profitable market share as demand for home loans continue to remain buoyant. Disbursements have also picked up pace with the nation-wide unlocking. In addition to this, the industry is in a sweet spot with interest rates at historical lows, robust housing demand and improving collection efficiency. The stock thus remains one of the best picks in this space.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We expect HUVR to witness MoM improvement in demand since June-21 aided by resilient Rural demand and improving Urban demand. Inflation in Palmoil and Crude is likely to pressurize margins, however the intensity will be likely lower than 1Q22. Calibrated price hikes will not be sufficient to ward off the inflation in input costs and higher intensity in ad-spends. We estimate 8% volume and 4% growth in realisations during 2QFY22. EBIDTA and PAT is estimated to grow at 9.4% (Rs.31.4bn) and 9.3% (Rs22.3bn).



Outlook

We believe worst is over in margin pressures led by higher prices and peaked out input costs. We estimate 15% PAT CAGR over FY21-24 and arrive at DCF based target price of Rs2915. Although recent upsurge in stock price limits near term gains, we recommend accumulating HUL for Long term.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

As the number of COVID-19 cases started to reduce, mobility improved, restrictions were progressively lifted, stores remained open for a longer time, and modern trade (MT) reopened in a phased manner. Demand in Jul-Aug’21 has been better than that in Jun’21. General trade (GT) remains resilient, while MT has improved. However, MT is still not back to its Aug’19 levels owing to lower ‘Big Day’ sales. Rural markets continue to remain resilient on the back of a strong Rabi crop, good Kharif sowing, and monsoons ahead of its long period average. Rural resilience is expected to continue. Urban markets have seen an uptick in momentum.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating with a TP of INR3,280 per share.

Domestic research and broking firm Motilal Oswal has a “buy” call on the stock, with target at Rs 3,280 a share, an upside of 15 percent from current level.

""The company’s portfolio is already well-placed, with its e-commerce market share higher than its Modern Trade (MT) market share, which, in turn, is higher than its General Trade (GT) market share.

Indian markets succumbed to profit-booking on September 20 amid weak global cues. At close, the Sensex was down 524.96 points, or 0.89 percent, at 58,490.93, and the Nifty was down 188.30 points, or 1.07 percent, at 17,396.90.

The correction in broader markets was more intense as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell 1.8 percent each, while the volatility increased significantly with India VIX climbing nearly 15 percent to 17.5.

Stocks that were in focus included Apollo Pipes which rallied 7.5 percent to close at Rs 1,655.6. Hindustan Unilever, which was the biggest gainer in the BSE Sensex with a 2.84 percent rally. On the other hand, Tata Steel was the biggest loser in the BSE Sensex, down 9.5 percent.

Here's what Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Apollo Pipes

The stock scaled a record high crossing its previous peak highs near to Rs 1,200 levels, and moved higher by 33 percent from its previous high.

We believe it has completed its bullish stance over the past eight weeks and expect it to underperform or witness a corrective action from current levels.

We would recommend booking profit as higher volumes are lacking in the current momentum.

Hindustan Unilever

The stock has started to outperform after a long time in the current quarter with positive momentum in the sector.

On the downside, the stock has support near to Rs 2,650 levels with respect to its previous top term which would act as strong support now.

We would recommend holding the stock. The current upmove can lead the stock higher near to Rs 3,000 levels.

Tata Steel

The stock has witnessed sharp profit booking after a Head and Shoulder pattern breakdown on weekly charts.

The sector has been underperforming in the current upmove and has declined by 5 percent compared to 12 percent upmove in the Nifty.

It has closed at strong support of its 100-day average and we expect some bounce back. We would recommend holding the stock which has a target of Rs 1,320.

Hindustan Unilever will widen its premium product portfolio and go big on digital as part of its growth strategy for the next decade, brokerages said.

The company’s sales so far have been driven by mass market products and it is now looking at introducing more premium products and increasing the share of revenue from e-commerce channels, HUL executives said during its annual investor meeting.

“HUL analyst meet focussed on the key consumption themes which are likely to unfold over the next decade,” brokerage firm Jefferies said in a recent note.

“In this context, the HUL management is taking measures to drive sustainable growth through focusing on the core, market development, premiumisation etc. Excessive focus is visible on digital and series of initiatives are under way to drive agility but this is still work in progress.”

The company also listed out key customer trends that are likely to shape the future of fast-moving consumer goods – a shift from stereotypes; more authenticity (naturals and local products), hyper-personalisation; rapid digital adoption; increased caring for holistic health, and environment/sustainability.

HUL said it is well-placed to tap these opportunities.

From mass to premiumisation

Though the company will continue to focus on the bottom-of-the-pyramid segment, there is more scope for premiumisation as affluence and income grow, HUL noted.

In foods and refreshments, HUL is focussing on nutrient-rich products, while in the premium-end, it is on high science-based innovation. The company aims to drive premiumisation for coffee, which is well-established in the south of the country. For other categories of personal care and home care, too, the company is eying a premium play.

“Premiumisation is a very strong theme in several FMCG categories and presents a huge scope for companies operating in the segment,” said Abneesh Roy, executive director at Edelweiss Securities.

Body wash as a category is used by only 2 percent of the country’s population, while the rest use soap, he said.

“In other countries, however, body washes have a much higher penetration and hence, this trend will replicate in India too,” Roy added.

Other categories also present similar opportunities.

“After premiumisation in detergents led to strong growth in detergent sales and margins in the last decade, the personal wash and dishwashing segments show considerable promise,” Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note. “The premiumisation boost presents a big opportunity to grow the top line and margins. For instance, liquid detergents and fabric conditioners have 2x the realisation of powders and have penetration of less than 15 percent.”

Digital future

The digital channel also has immense headroom for growth for the company, experts said. HUL, of late, has been increasing its presence in e-commerce and has also started direct-to-consumer platforms.

“HUL has ramped up efforts in e-commerce through its own digital content platform (BeBeautiful, Get Set Clean), product trials (Smartpick), D2C channel (Lakme, Indulekha). HUL has also rolled out its own D2C multi-brand platforms, UShop in Mumbai and Delhi. More interventions are under way and HUL has an agile innovation model for faster new product developments in the digital channel,” said Jefferies.

The company currently draws about 10 percent of its sales from digital channels and is eying a much larger share from this segment.

In the beauty and personal care segment, the company has rolled out high-margin e-commerce focused products such as skin serums, hair masks and hair serums. As part of the digital-first approach, it has set up a premium beauty business unit.

HUL’s digital initiatives would also help it to target consumers with personalised products and marketing.

“By means of e-commerce, FMCG companies can draw consumer insights which can help them drive sales and marketing,” said Roy.",610,0.942984823669706

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

The company is focusing on winning the next decade by achieving double-digit earnings growth by achieving sustained volume growth in core categories of home care and personal care, scaling up the foods and refreshment business coupled with gradual improvement in OPM. Growing the core through premiumisation, market development through new launches, cluster based approach through WIMI strategy, and distribution expansion remain key growth drivers in the medium to long run. Resilient demand in rural India would lead to better volume growth in the coming quarters. Raw-material pressure is under control with raw tea prices correcting from its high and price hikes undertaken across the portfolio in Q2FY2022. OPM likely to be at 24-25%.

Outlook

We maintain Buy on Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) with a revised PT of Rs. 3,185. Leadership position in 80% portfolio, strong earnings visibility with well-defined strategies, and a healthy balance sheet with sturdy cash flows make it the best pick in the FMCG space.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s annual investor meet highlighted emerging trends, the company’s growth initiatives across categories, and its R&D and digital prowess. Management remains upbeat on the medium-term growth outlook and expects to maintain double-digit EPS growth. The commentary emphasized significant leverage on data analytics and technology across functions, which will be a competitive advantage, going ahead. We expect some improvement in growth as increasing mobility could drive a recovery in the laundry/beauty segments, which we have factored in our forecasts as well. Post the recent run-up (61x/54x FY23/24E EPS), limited upside potential keeps us neutral on the name. We await a more visible pick-up in earnings growth after recent underperformance vs. peers.

Outlook

Maintain Hold with a Sep’22E TP of Rs2,700, valuing it at 55x Sep-23E EPS (47x Sep-23E EPS earlier). Correction in key commodity prices can offer upsides to forecasts whereas rural slowdown remains a risk.

The management shared details on the augmentation of its analytics and R&D strengths, which were already far superior v/s peers. As highlighted in our Annual Report note, there have been a host of initiatives in the past year focusing on the burgeoning E-Commerce market, which now contributes 8–9% to HUVR’s sales. The company’s portfolio is already well-placed, with its E-Commerce market share higher than its Modern Trade (MT) market share, which, in turn, is higher than its General Trade (GT) market share. Winning in Many Indias (WiMI) has been a key factor driving volume growth and market share gains for the company in recent years. However, the localization of products as well as communication is only gathering further steam – of which the company stated several examples in the analyst meet in categories ranging from Foods to Beauty and Personal Care (BPC) – and ought to be a key driver of growth for many years to come.

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) Q1FY2022 performance was mix, with revenue rising by 13% driven by a 9% domestic volume growth; raw material inflation hit OPM that was tad lower than our expectation, at 23.9%. After a disrupted May 21, demand recovered in June 21 to March 21 levels. Rural growth outpaced urban growth. HUL saw penetration improve for 80% of product portfolio and market share rise for two-thirds of portfolio. HUL aims to clock competitive volume growth by having customer-relevant portfolio assortment and ensuring strong back-end support. Likely correction in the raw material inflation, better product mix and synergies from GSK acquisition would drive up OPM in the medium term.

Outlook

Stock has underperformed broader indices in the past year and currently trades at 48x FY2023E EPS. We maintain a Buy on the stock with a PT of Rs. 2,790.

HUVR’s 1QFY22 result was better than our expectations led by topline growth. Sales in the month of Jun’21 were reportedly back to levels seen before the second COVID wave witnessed in Mar’21, and augurs well for Discretionary sales and margin going forward. Despite the higher incidence of COVID-19 cases in rural India compared to last year, the demand momentum remains resilient. The expectation of a good monsoon should sustain this momentum. Urban demand is expected to see a strong rebound. With Discretionary demand back on the recovery path, mix improvements will play a major role in driving a gradual margin improvement sequentially.

We are cutting FY22/23 EPS by 4.2%/3.2% and downgrading the stock to Accumulate. Despite the near term challenges, we remain positive on the structural story given that 1) More than 80% of business is gaining penetration 2) HFD segment is likely to emerge as a key driver of growth with launch of Rs2/5 pack of Horlicks and Boost and benefits of expansion in distribution and integration post 3Q22 4) Rebound in Discretionary Portfolio with easing of restrictions and improvement in mobility 4) Strong growth in Ecom channel which already accounts for 10% of revenue and 5) gains from strategies like WIMI and SHIKHAR driving distribution led gains. Although HUL used to guide for calibrated margin expansion, however inflation in laundry, skin cleansing and Tea inputs and focus on driving volumes is likely to curtail margin expansion to levels lower than earlier expectations.

Outlook

We expect 11.5% Sales and 14% PAT CAGR over FY21-23 and assign a DCF based target price of Rs 2535 (Rs 2562 earlier). We downgrade the stock to Accumulate (Buy earlier) with near term underperformance.

The on-the-ground disruption hurts the uplift. The consolidated numbers along with GSK volumes grew 5% YoY, while synergies to materialise by CY21 end.

We have reduced our earnings estimates by 3% to factor in lower-than-earlier-expected OPM while we have maintained estimates for FY2023.

In a quarter marked with uncertainties with the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported a 9.6 percent jump in its net profit at Rs 2,061 as compared to Rs 1,881 crore clocked in the corresponding period last year. The FMCG behemoth’s revenue for the quarter stood at Rs 11,730 crore, up 12.7 percent from Rs 10,406 crore in the year-ago period.

Its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was up 7.7 percent at Rs 2,847 crore against Rs 2,644 crore and the margin was down at 23.9 percent versus 25 percent, year-on-year (YoY).

Addressing a media briefing after reporting its first-quarter results, HUL management said the focus on e-commerce continued growth in rural India, and growth in categories such as foods and refreshment, beauty and personal care, and home-care segment helped it tide over the challenging period.

“Rural has been the growth engine for FMCG for the last few quarters, and it continues to be resilient. Hopefully, we see a good monsoon and this will augur well for the rural economy,” said Ritesh Tiwari, Executive Director, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, HUL.

The discretionary out-of-home category continued to be a drag, the company informed.

Analysts, however, are not, too, enthused by the company’s performance.

“Overall performance was marginally below expectations. Management is cautiously optimistic in the near term. A possible surge in infection rates may cause uncertainty to demand; monsoon and crop sowing will remain key factors for rural demand. Commodity prices have remained volatile and elevated,” said Deepak Jasani, Head-Retail Research, HDFC Securities.

The digital recipe

Given the mobility restrictions during the quarter as several regions of the country underwent lockdown, HUL concentrated on increasing the reach of its eB2B app Shikhar.

“We have been able to drive a higher contribution of our app and Shikhar now contributes six times more as compared to the June quarter last year,” said Ritesh Tiwari, Executive Director, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, HUL.

According to Tiwari, the company has also doubled its contribution from e-commerce in the last year.

To fuel this growth further, HUL created packs designed exclusively for e-commerce and also rolled out a range of premium beauty products under its digital-only brand Simple. The company also plans to expand the presence of its direct-to-consumer platform UShop.

Discretionary drags

The company’s discretionary and out-of-home portfolio continued to suffer in the first quarter. Though categories such as ice cream witnessed a growth, it was on the low base of June quarter in FY21, which had witnessed country-wide lockdown.

Discretionary products under brands such as Lakme, Vaseline, Axe, Elle 18, Pond’s, and Glow & Lovely witnessed a 39 percent growth in comparison to Q1 FY21. However, when compared to pre-COVID period of (Q1 FY20), the segment registered a 24 percent de-growth.

Out-of-home showed similar trends. Brands such as Pureit, Kwality Wall’s, Cornetto, and Unilever Food Solutions reported a 91 percent growth against Q1 FY21 but a 40 percent drop as compared to Q1 FY20.

Its other products segments, which have several products in the essential category, saw growth. However, unlike last time there was no sales spike reported due to hoarding by consumers.

The home-care segment grew at 12 percent on double-digit growth in fabric wash. Beauty and personal care grew 13 percent led by haircare and skincare, both growing in high double-digits. Foods and refreshments delivered another quarter of strong performance and grew at 12 percent.

Pricing pressure

HUL’s margins continue to be under pressure on account of price rise in several key materials such as vegetable oil.

“Three of our biggest input materials remain volatile and at elevated levels. And we have continued to look for all leavers like savings, judicious and calibrated pricing to protect our business model,” Tiwari informed.

The company informed it has taken calibrated price increases across fabric wash and household care portfolio to partly offset the high inflation in input costs. This comes after two consecutive quarters of price increase in categories such as soaps and tea.

In Q4 FY21, HUL had increased the prices of its soap brands such as Lifebuoy and Lux by 6-7 percent.

The company is cautiously optimistic about the way ahead.

“With mobility improving, we believe the demand for FMCG products will go up, especially for discretionary categories. The strength of our portfolio and capabilities will hold us in good stead,” said Tiwari.",759,0.20123017105189236

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has launched its first ‘Smart Fill’ machine, an in-store vending model for its home care products with the aim to reuse, reduce and recycle plastic. Currently deployed in select Asian markets, this initiative offers consumers an option to reuse their plastic bottles by refilling products from HUL’s brands like Surf Excel, Comfort and Vim through the smart refillery. Initiatives like the refillery are part of Unilever's global effort to build sustainable, 'purposeful' brands.

Speaking about the initiative in a conversation with Storyboard, Prabha Narasimhan, executive director (Home Care) for Hindustan Unilever and Vice President (Home Care) for Unilever South Asia, says, “We did an interesting piece of research on this and what we found is that 20 percent of the Indian consumers are already eco-warriors, these are the lead-edge consumers who want to understand what is happening in the environment and want to make a positive contribution. In our pilot we saw that they are looking for avenues in which they are keen to contribute. Our first port will be these consumers.”

To access products from the Smart Fill machine, consumers can either use their old empty bottles or purchase a Smart Fill bottle from the store at a nominal price. As an incentive, consumers are being offered INR 30 off on the MRP or effective price at the store if they get their own bottle and Rs 15 off to those who purchase the Smart Fill bottle. The flagship brands that consumers can avail these benefits on include Surf Excel, Comfort and Vim gel.

The company aims to use learnings from this pilot project to create a scalable refill business model in partnership with prominent retailers and modern trade outlets.

Speaking about how to scale the model, keeping in mind COVID restrictions, Narsimhan says “Our idea is to get it out at a lot of touch points. We will do it at a particular time, as the country unlocks and more consumers get out of home over a period of time.”

The BYOB Challenge

But there are other challenges too. “The first is the idea of consumer behaviour - which is to encourage consumers to bring their own bottles, because that’s where it works the best. The second challenge that we have is that of the business model which is making sure that it works in a way so that it is a win-win for everybody.”

Narasimhan is not overly concerned about pandemic-induced comsumer behaviour change. Sure visits to the stores have reduced, people are used to shopping online for everything from salt to shoes, but, Narasimhan says, the behaviour of going to the modern trade store is not going to go away. She adds, “We need to make sure that at the store, safety is 100 percent."" As an additional safety measure, the refill bottles are UV treated.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

With various parts of India progressively opening up, the management believes the impact from the second COVID wave would have peaked in May’21 and things will progressively get better. The outlook from Jun’21 onwards is positive, barring the emergence of a third COVID wave. The increase in store operating hours is also a positive development. Rural continues to do better than urban, despite experiencing a higher impact from the pandemic in 1QFY22 v/s last year. Prediction of a normal monsoon, good Rabi harvest, favorably timed Kharif sowing, and MNREGA provide prospective support as well. The modern trade (MT) channel was affected.

Outlook

HUVR’s best-of-breed analytics and execution capabilities (demonstrated via the successful implementation of its WIMI strategy, cost-saving plans, herbals, etc.) are key factors driving the pace of earnings growth. The strong outlook on rural, GSKCH synergies, and sustained growth and premiumization in Skin Cleansing offer further medium-term tailwinds. We maintain our Buy rating with a TP of INR2,780 per share.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR now has 14 brands with over INR10b in annual sales (v/s 12 brands last year). In FY21, it gained market share in 84% of its portfolio and launched more than 150 SKUs. Rapid technology adoption: A significant leap has been observed in technology adoption among small retailers, which are convinced that this is, indeed, the need of the hour. HUVR’s eB2B app, ‘Shikhar’, has enabled its retailer partners to place contactless orders conveniently, with over 500k retailers ordering through the app. We reckon that while this accounts for ~20% of HUVR’s direct reach and ~6% of the total reach, the proportion of sales would be higher. HUVR is looking to scale up the app, while continuing to work at the backend to build next-day delivery systems. The company has partnered with the State Bank of India to resolve the liquidity issues of small retailers, thus helping build stronger channel relationships. HUVR continues to empower Shakti entrepreneurs and now has a network of nearly 136k spanning 18 states/territories in India ensuring strong growth in a volatile supply chain environment.

Outlook

There is no material change in our forecasts. We maintain a Buy rating, with unchanged TP of INR2,780 (55x Jun’23E EPS).

The COVID-19 has hit Hindustan Unilever’s discretionary portfolio of skincare, deodorants and colour cosmetics contracted 15 percent in FY21, while out-of-home products such as Hice creams shrank 26 percent but the much bigger business of health, hygiene and nutrition grew 12 percent .

India’s biggest consumer goods maker attributed the decline in the discretionary portfolio of brands such as Lakme, Rexona, Ponds, Axe and Glow & Lovely (earlier Fair & Lovely), which brings 15 percent of its business, to pressure on household budgets and limited mobility because of the pandemic and lockdowns.

The company faced a bigger fall of 26 percent in its out-of-home categories such as ice cream and the food solutions business that caters to institutional buyers like hotels and office catering, which suffered because of lockdowns. Out-of-home categories, which include ice cream brands Magnum, Cornetto and Kwality Wall’s, account for 5 percent of the turnover.

However, its health, hygiene and nutrition, which account for 80 percent of the company’s business reported a strong 12 percent growth as consumers stepped up spending on essentials.

The company’s turnover in 2020-21 rose18.38 percent to Rs 45,311 crore, while profit rose 18 percent to Rs 7,954 crore. In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, its consolidated net profit rose 44.8 percent to Rs 2,190 crore while revenue grew 35 percent to Rs 12,433 crore.

Navigating the pandemic

The company said its beauty and personal care division grew by 4 percent during the year, led by robust double-digit growth in skin cleansing, oral care and hair care.

“Home care grew by 2 percent led by double-digit growth in household care and a marginal growth in fabric wash due to slowdown in laundry consumption owing to limited mobility,” it said in the report.

HUL’s foods and refreshments segment expanded 17 percent, helped by strong performance of tea brands such as Taaza, Brooke Bond Red Label and Taj Mahal. Malt-based Boost and Horlicks also performed well, it said.

The company saw a good demand for skin cleansing and hygiene portfolio, which includes brands such as Lux and Dove, as bar of soap became the first line of defence against the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company said it faced margin pressure as palm oil and tea soared to multi-year highs but it took “judicious pricing actions” to deal with the situation. It raised the price of Brooke Bond and Lipton tea brands by 4-5 percent during the year, while Lifebuoy and Lux soaps were up 6-7 percent, according to estimates.

In the face of several supply-chain disruptions, which impacted sales in the first quarter of FY21, HUL built alternative distribution channels.

“The company’s initiative such as onboarding more retailers on its B2B app Shikhar app, which now reaches out 0.5 million retailers, creating a rural distribution network of 136,000 women micro-entrepreneurs under Project Shakti helped them clock growth during the year,” said Himanshu Nayyar, Lead Analyst - Institutional Equities, Yes Securities.

He said other initiatives such as a slew of launches in health and hygiene category, pan-India launch of Boost and introduction of low pack units (Rs 5 and Rs 10) of Horlicks also helped it tide over this crisis period.

While its margins have been under the pressure due to the price, Nayyar believes, it will ease out as demand improves with the re-opening of the economy.

The Way Ahead

Sharing an outlook for the year ahead, the company in its annual report indicated that the pandemic remains a challenge.

“Notwithstanding these encouraging developments, the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over. The trajectory of the pandemic still remains unpredictable to a very large extent, with country already witnessing a second wave of COVID-19,” it said.

However despite the unpredictable situation, the company is confident of the medium to long-term growth prospects of the FMCG sector.

Going ahead, the company will keep strengthening its core brands.

ICICI Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL posted strong set of results with 34.6% revenue growth led by 16% volume growth. Though the growth was aided by the low base quarter & consolidation of foods business, discretionary categories also saw a sharp recovery in Q4FY21. Home care and beauty & personal care (BPC) segments witnessed growth of 14.6% & 19.7%, respectively. Detergent category, which was adversely impacted in 9MFY21 saw strong recovery in Q4 due to increase in out of home activity. The growth in BPC category was also driven by volume as well as calibrated price hikes in the soaps category. Foods business grew 96% due to consolidation of nutrition business but on a like-to-like basis, the segment growth was 36%. Gross margins contracted 117 bps mainly on account of a sharp increase in palm oil, tea & crude based raw material prices. However, the company was able to pass on the increase in raw material cost partially in the last six months. Marketing spends & other overhead spends were down 127 bps & 172 bps, respectively. This helped the company grow its operating profit by 43.2% to Rs 2957 crore. Operating margins improved 146 bps to 24.4%. Led by strong operating profit growth, PAT witnessed growth of 41.1% to Rs 2143 crore. The company declared a final dividend of Rs 17/share.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after Q4 earnings:

Macquarie | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 2,700

The profit was broadly in line, while gross margin miss was offset by lower other expenses. The willingness to hike price in soaps enhance comfort on near-term growth.

Citi | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 2,755

It was a strong end to FY21 and the company is well-placed in uncertain times. The overall EPS estimate has been raised up to 1 percent.

Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 2,750

There was a strong beat on EBITDA and net earnings despite near in-line revenues. The company believes that the second coronavirus wave may not disrupt supply chain significantly, while margin should see an improvement in H2FY22.

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 2,562

We have increased our sales estimates by 1.8 percent for FY22 and FY23 on the back of strong momentum in the fourth quarter but cut our EPS estimates by 3.3 percent/0.8 percent for FY22/FY23 on the back of input cost inflation and higher tax rate.

We expect HUVR to emerge stronger post-pandemic on the back of increased operating leverage in the nutrition business and improving demand scenario.

Dolat Capital | Rating: Reduce | Target: Rs 2,512

We have revised our FY22/23E revenue estimates to factor in Q4 performance and the improvement in the discretionary portfolio. However, we have revised downward our margin estimates to factor in the increase in RM prices and anticipated increase in A&P spends. In line with the revision, we have tweaked our EPS estimates as well.

Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 2,790

We have fine-tuned our earnings estimates for FY2022/23 to factor in the little lower other income and higher depreciation charged than earlier estimated. Barring near-term uncertainties due to rising COVID-19 cases, HUL management is confident of achieving volume-led earning growth on the back of a strong product portfolio, agile supply chain, strong distribution model and relatively higher presence in rural India.

Synergistic benefits from GSK merger will add on to the earnings in the coming years. This, along with a strong cash-generation ability and dividend payout, makes it a better pick in the large-cap FMCG space.

At 0932 hours, Hindustan Unilever was quoting at Rs 2,399.85, down Rs 9.20, or 0.38 percent on the BSE.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever is likely to report healthy double-digit growth in all earnings parameters for the quarter ended March 2020 on the back of low base due to lockdown in the year-ago quarter and GSK Consumer Healthcare acquisition.

Brokerages largely expect more than 30 percent year-on-year growth in revenue with strong demand for home care and personal care products, while profit could grow in the range of 30-40 percent compared to the same quarter last year.

""We model 20 percent organic revenue growth led by 15 percent YoY growth in underlying volume growth (UVG). Reported revenues including GSK Consumer Healthcare acquisition would be up 35 percent YoY,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees a 42 percent YoY growth in profit.

The brokerage forecasts 9 percent revenue growth in home care segment, 23 percent revenue growth in beauty & personal care segment, and 33 percent organic revenue growth in packaged foods and refreshments segment partly aided by price hikes in tea.

According to ICICI Direct, HUL is likely to post a 32.7 percent revenue growth in Q4 FY21 given 9.4 percent sales decline in the base quarter due to lockdown in the last 10 days of March 2020. Moreover, consolidation of acquired nutrition business would also add to revenues, said the brokerage which sees a 32 percent YoY growth in profit.

Revenues came ahead of our estimate but APAT was in line. Core business registered 7% sales growth - was a marginal beat. Beauty and personal care business reported 9.7% growth after 4 consecutive quarters of decline, was a positive surprise. Most discretionary categories witnessed revamp during the quarter. However, increase in RM and brand investment in key categories resulted in EBITDA margin contraction. We believe that the brand investment would help HUL in the long run. We have tweaked our FY21/FY22/FY23E EPS estimates to Rs 34.0/40.0/46.1 to factor in Q3 performance. Valuing the stock at 55x FY23E EPS, we have arrived at a TP of Rs 2,535.

Below is a summary of what some brokerages are saying about the stock and the company after the Q3 numbers:

Sharekhan

HUL’s management is optimistic about better growth in the coming quarters because of improving demand environment, gaining market share in key categories, and new products gaining good traction. Rural demand outpacing urban demand, improving growth prospects for health food drinks, and an expected recovery in discretionary categories remain key growth drivers in the near term.

We expect HUL’s revenue and PAT to register a CAGR of 13% and 21% over FY2020-FY2023 (including the acquired business of GSK Consumers). We maintain our buy recommendation on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs 2,790. The stock is currently trading at 47x its FY2023E EPS.

Prabhudas Lilladher

We remain constructive on HUL post 3Q Concall given improving growth outlook led by 1) Robust growth across Health, Nutrition and Personal care, 2) Increasing distribution reach, 3) Strong portfolio of new products in Hygiene, Nutrition and Personal care 4) restoration of supply chain 5) higher share in distribution platforms of future (MT and e-com) and 6) Synergy benefits from GSK merger

We expect near term margin pressure in select categories of Tea and P wash, however, worst seems to be over given F&R margins in 3Q (ex GSK) at just 8-9% (Est). We estimate CAGR of 11.6/15.7/18.2% in Sales, EBIDTA and EPS over FY21-23. Retain buy with DCF based target price of Rs 2502.

Dolat Capital

We have tweaked our FY21/FY22/FY23E EPS estimates to Rs 34.0/40.0/46.1 to factor in Q3 performance. Valuing the stock at 55x FY23E EPS, we have arrived at a target price of Rs 2,535. We maintain reduce. Considering recent run up in stock price, there is limited room for further upside. However, fundamentally, we see high growth prospects for HUL going ahead. Buy on dips.

Motilal Oswal

The company’s earnings growth has gained further momentum in recent years (17% EPS CAGR in the past three years v/s ~12% CAGR over 10 years). This is particularly impressive given the weak mid-single-digit earnings growth posted by (much smaller) peers in recent years. Valuing the company at 55x FY23 EPS, we arrive at target price of Rs 2,690. Maintain buy.

CLSA

CLSA has maintained buy call with a target at Rs 2,925 per share. The Q3 results were largely in-line, with revenue, EBITDA & earnings growth of 20/16/19% YoY. Company sounded confident on near-term tactical volume strategy & execution.

We continue to see company as a structural play in Indian FMCG and it is our key pick for 2021, reported CNBC-TV18.

Citi

Research house Citi has retain buy call with a target at Rs 2,730. The prioritising volume-led growth in the near term. Research house raises revenue forecasts by 1-2%.

The company remains a very well-managed business. As mobility improves, the drag due to discretionary/OOH segments should reverse, reported CNBC-TV18.

Jefferies

Jefferies has kept the buy call with a target at Rs 2,780. The management intends to prioritise growth over margin. The pick-up in personal care is a positive while muted trend in laundry, a disappointment, reported CNBC-TV18.

JPMorgan

JPMorgan remained overweight on the stock with a target at Rs 2,610. The prioritising revenue growth over the margin. JPMorgan lower FY21-23 EPS estimates by 3-5% to account for lower margin & other income and upgrade revenue forecasts by 2%. It stay overweight & would add into any pullback, reported CNBC-TV18.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) will report its December quarter scorecard on January 27 in which it may report healthy double-digit growth in PAT and revenue.

Brokerages expect demand recovery in most discretionary consumption categories, in line with the opening up of the economy.

Besides, brokerages expect a good recovery and growth in most personal care categories.

""RM price inflation has gathered pace but the Q3 gross margins would be largely protected for most companies thanks to low-cost inventory. We expect EBITDA margins to be healthy partly aided by cost savings,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities.

Kotak expects a 27.9 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in HUL's reported PAT while net sales can witness a 19.2 percent YoY rise.

EBITDA, as per Kotak, can rise 19.5 percent YoY and EBITDA margin can climb 6 bps YoY.

""We model 5.9 percent growth in organic revenues (up 19.2 percent YoY including GSK-CH acquisition) led by 5 percent growth in UVG (organic),"" said Kotak.

The brokerage firm expects (1) good pick-up in winter portfolio (strong 3Q) after a late start (soft pre-season stocking in 2Q), (2) bounce back in GSK-CH portfolio revenues to 10 percent growth following supply-side disruption in 2Q, (3) improvement across color cosmetics, deodorants and out-of-home consumption categories, and (4) continued weakness in detergents.

It expects a 5.5 percent growth in the personal care segment, a 1.5 percent YoY growth in the home care segment and a 15 percent growth in packaged food and refreshments segment (organic) partly aided by price increases in the tea segment.

The estimates of brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services shows a 20 percent YoY change in the company's net sales and a 19.8 percent YoY rise in reported profit.

Motilal expects a 17.7 percent YoY rise in the company's EBITDA but the EBITDA margin may shrink to 24.4 percent in Q3FY21 against 24.9 percent reported in Q3FY20.

Outlook for the pace of rural and urban growth, competitive intensity, downtrading and RM cost will be in focus, Motilal Oswal pointed out.

Unwilling to let up after the first round of its tussle with Hindustan Unilever which it claims to have won, Sebamed is now gearing up for a second go at India’s largest FMCG player.

The German skincare brand has refused to budge from its strategy of comparing its cleansing bar with that of Hindustan Unilever’s Dove and other bathing bars. In fact, it has already started airing a new ad campaign along much the same lines.

In conversation with Moneycontrol, Sandeep K Rathod, General Counsel and Vice-President – Legal, Sebamed India/USV Private Limited, said that the Bombay High Court (HC) is backing comparative advertising which has scientific evidence.

“Such comparative ads will also make other people open to information-sharing to customers. Plus, the court (HC) has said that there is no harm in mentioning names of competitors. But it has been suggested that use of negative language should be avoided. So, instead of saying Dove is not perfect, we can say Sebamed is perfect.”

Sebamed had launched an advertising campaign on January 8 in which it compared the pH value of its own product with that of HUL’s soaps like Dove, Pears, Lux and even with detergent bar Rin. HUL took the legal route and obtained a restraining order from the Bombay High Court on Sebamed’s ad campaign.

However, in its latest judgement, the Bombay HC passed provided Sebamed some relief, permitting it to continue its advertising campaign, albeit with a few changes.

Rathod said the court has said that Sebamed cannot compare detergent bars with bathing soaps. In its new ad campaign, Sebamed is now comparing its cleansing bar with Dove.

So, with few minor changes in its advertising campaign, Sebamed will continue with comparative advertising.

“We wanted to educate customers about pH value (pH value refers to the acidic level in a product. Lower pH means the soap is less acidic). And comparative advertising was an easier way to put it in the minds of the consumer about pH value. We wanted to create a new vocabulary in the personal care market which is driven by emotional or make-believe concepts,” said Sebamed Country Head Shashi Ranjan.

He added that it was not soaps alone, but an entire personal care portfolio including anti-hair loss shampoo and anti-ageing cream, among others that has pH 5.5 benefits.

Moneycontrol had reached out to HUL but received no response to email queries till the time of writing this article.

But a question remains: If this was only about giving right information to the consumer, why did Sebamed only compare products of HUL, the country’s largest soaps maker?

Ranjan says it’s not about a particular brand or company. “We wanted to say that pH is an important factor for your skin and every customer has a right to know. It was more about educating the customer.”

But Vibhav Sanzgiri, global vice-president, research and development, skin cleansing, for Unilever, and site leader, R&D India as well executive director, HUL in a recent interview to Business Standard, said that only focusing on pH value is an unhealthy precedent that is being set by companies.

Ranjan points out that while pH is not the only criteria, “it is an important determinant when consumers make their purchase decision, especially in the current times when health and hygiene has become so important.”

But is Sebamed only looking at the pH value? What about pricing?

Sebamed’s cleansing bar (100 gm) is priced at Rs 99, which is steep when compared to HUL’s premium soaps such as Dove and Pears which are available for around Rs 48 and Rs 41 respectively.

This means that even HUL’s premium soaps are more cost-effective than Sebamed’s cleansing bar.

So, what’s Sebamed’s strategy for pricing?

Ranjan said that while they are creating a niche for the brand, they will look at different variants and different price points depending on the market they are entering.

Sebamed, which is currently present in 47 cities, is planning to ramp up expansion to 3x in the next two years and will take the market count to 100 by this year, said Ranjan.

In the Rs 22,000-crore soap market, which is increasingly getting competitive, Sebamed is aggressively looking to capture market share and has already captured consumers’ attention.

Ranjan said that the number of enquiries around Sebamaed’s cleansing bar as well regarding pH value have increased after the advertising campaign on print and television.

While he did not share any data regarding increased traction for Sebamed’s soap, he said that on e-commerce platforms, where sales can be tracked much faster, they saw a multiplier effect.",775,0.49442872405052185

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

A strong product portfolio, wide distribution reach and sturdy balance sheet make HUL an evergreen pick in the FMCG space. For Q3FY2021, we expect HUL’s core business volumes to grow by 6-7% as against 1% in Q2FY2021 driven by strong demand for winter products and sustained higher sales of personal wash products. Gross margins to remain under pressure led by higher input prices. However, judicious price hikes in key SKUs (soaps and tea) and a better revenue mix would ease pressure on gross margins in the coming quarters. Rural demand outpacing urban demand, improving growth prospects of health food drinks segment and expected recovery in discretionary demand remain key growth drivers in the near term.

Outlook

We retain a Buy on HUL with a revised PT of Rs. 2790 (rolling it over to FY23E estimates).

In a candid chat with Moneycontrol, Karan Shah, Director, Society Tea, said, “We are striving to be a national brand, which means, customising blends for each of the markets as per their requirement rather than blanketing it. While we have a stronghold in the west, we are looking at expanding into every major city across the country be it north, east, or south.”

Founded in 1933, Society Tea is the largest tea-seller in the state of Maharashtra, with a 40 percent market share within the state. The brand is also present in Goa, and in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.

While it has been dominant in western India for long, the company has managed to establish a presence in the southern markets through its e-commerce channels.

The plan now is to expand further, Shah said.

A fourth-generation director of the company, Shah is keeping his cards close to his chest, and would not elaborate much on how he plans to take on the big names in the industry, but said the company wants to capitalise through new launches and penetrate in every market. ""Our strategy is: Listen to our consumer! The way tea is consumed changes every 100 km,"" he said.

India is the world’s second-largest producer of tea, after China. The local tea industry in India has a market value of more than Rs 12,000 crore. Assam alone contributes more than 50 percent to total tea production in India. Almost 80 percent of the total output in India is consumed domestically.

Across India, Tata Global Beverage holds a 29.6 percent market share with brands such as Tata Tea, Tetley, Good Earth, Vitax, Joekels, and Teapigs. According to brand experts, within the tea segment, Tata Global Beverage is the leader across East, North and South zones.

Hindustan Unilever, which sells tea under the brands Red Label Brook Bond and Taj Mahal, has a 25 percent market share, while Gujarat Tea Processors & Packers Ltd that sells tea under the brand Wagh Bakri has 15 percent.

COVID-19 trends

When the coronavirus-pandemic struck, after analysing new trends among customers, the company felt there was a need to ""improvise"" (as per the trend) tea, Shah said.

The COVID-induced lockdown was a blessing of sorts for the company, Shah said, as it compelled people to stay indoors and adopt a remote working culture. The lockdown period saw a sharp increase in tea consumption, he added.

Since tea is a beverage that contains immunity-boosting ingredients, showcasing properties that are beneficial to health, the company also capitalised on the pandemic-led drive for healthy living by launching Cleanse Green Tea Detox Kahwa Premix.

Cleanse Green Tea is made of ingredients known to accelerate metabolism and help build immunity. It contains ingredients like turmeric which is known (as per Ayurveda), to be beneficial for skin-related problems, common cold, cough, etc., along with, ginger, asafoetida, cardamom, black pepper, clove, cinnamon, green tea extract, amongst others, which help remove toxins from the body, working towards cleansing the system.

During the pandemic, the company witnessed traction on its website and other e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Big Basket and Grofers.

Among its frequently-purchased products online this year were One Minute Tea, Cleanse Green Tea, and also new offerings from the chutney and pickles category under the Spice Secrets brand.

Entry into dairy

Widening its product range, in October this year, the company also ventured into the dairy category, with offerings such as Skimmed Milk Powder, Dairy Whitener, and Desi Ghee.

“We wanted to ensure that the milk in the tea is just right. Hence, continuing our quest to provide better-quality products we came up with the idea of venturing into the dairy category,” Shah said.

Last year, too, the company had ventured into chutneys and pickles, which it sells under the Spice Secret brand. Shah said the response towards the category has been encouraging.",680,0.4299342802592686

The COVID-19 pandemic will lead to future work schedules being more flexible and collaborative, but permanent work from home is not an option, Anuradha Razdan, executive director – HR for Hindustan Unilever (HUL) told The Economic Times.

“The future of work would mean more flexibility, collaboration and open workspaces, though permanent work from home may not be an option for the larger section of the workforce,” she said.

Razdan said that flexible work schedules would never be an issue for some who chooses to work with the FMCG major, but “it doesn’t mean that we will say we will have permanent work from home.”

Emphasising the importance of “face-to-face interconnection, collaboration and creativity,” she said, it is “too early” to decide that offices will no longer be needed or that everyone should work from home, it added.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

“For an organisation like HUL, the innovation that happens, the creativity, collaboration are a result of physical connections which are important for the business,” she said.

On the other hand, companies continue to invest in WFH and employee benefits. Top IT firms saw their employee-related expenses increase for the six months ended September 2020 compared to the previous year.

ICICI Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL reported a healthy set of numbers with 16.1% sales growth aided by consolidation of acquired brands (Horlicks, Boost, VWASH). On a like to like basis, growth has been 3% supported by 1% volume growth. Beauty & personal care segment recovered from 12% decline in Q1 to flat YoY sales in Q2. Foods segment saw strong 19% growth supported by price hike in tea segment. Home care segment declined 1.6% with 2.3% price cuts in fabric wash. The recovery in the business was led by complete normalisation of supply chain & strong demand in health, hygiene & nutrition space. However, demand for discretionary & out of home products has still remained dismal. The health, hygiene & nutrition products that constitute 80% of sales witnessed growth of 10% whereas discretionary & out of home consumption products, which constitute 20%of sales saw a decline of 25%. Gross margin declined 145 bps largely on account of a sharp 70% increase in tea prices. Though the company has taken price hikes, it is not sufficient to pass on the entire cost increase. With 221 bps lower advertisement spends, HUL was able to maintain its operating margins at 25.1% (27 bps up). Net profit increased 8.7% to Rs 2009 crore. The slower growth in profitability is largely due to lower tax in base quarter.

Outlook

We believe H2FY21E would witness strong growth across segments with complete demand recovery in discretionary portfolio as well. The company has been able to leverage strong brands in hygiene (Lifebuoy, Domex, Vim, Surf Excel) space to drive growth. We believe the company would continue to witness strong double digit growth in the health, hygiene & nutrition space. Further, margins improvement with consolidation of nutrition brands would drive earnings. We upgrade our recommendation from HOLD to BUY with a revised target price of Rs 2500/share.

2020-10-28 13:29:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/whats-in-a-name-if-its-all-glow-and-lovely-hul-wouldnt-mind-6027671.html,"The brouhaha over the fairness cream controversy, which led to a name change of Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) flagship product, does not seem to have impacted its sales.

In July 2020, HUL renamed its flagship skin care brand Fair & Lovely as Glow & Lovely after fairness products came under social pressure amid a global debate about racial inequality.

Dealers, distributors and brand experts claim that sales numbers have not come down ‘at all’ despite the name change.

“Hardcore loyalists of Fair & Lovely (now Glow & Lovely) know what the name has changed to. So, it is unlikely that sales would have got affected. They have very loyal customers,” said Pavan Padaki, branding coach and consultant.

Dealers and distributors say that they have been distributing the same quantity as they used to sell before the name change. This trend indicates that the demand has remained unaffected.

“We used to supply 12 cartons to 20 shops in the pin codes that I deal with. The orders have remained unchanged after the change of name,” said a Mumbai-based distributor.

When Moneycontrol reached out to HUL to know whether sales have picked up or remained unchanged, the company spokesperson said: “As a policy, we do not share brand sales figures.”

However, on the question of what feedback the company has been receiving after the name change, the spokesperson said: “The new packs and communication have just gone into the market, and early consumer response is welcoming the change. Research over the years and even now indicates ‘Glow’ resonates strongly with our consumers.”

What the new pack says

Moneycontrol visited a couple of supermarkets in South Mumbai to see how the new pack looks like and the placement of the product.

We found that the old stock was also kept right next to the new stock. We also observed that the company has used the same font size on the pack to say ‘Fair & Lovely’ is now ‘Glow & Lovely’.

When asked if the company is allowed use the old name on the pack and if old stock continues to stay in stores, N Chandramouli, CEO of TRA Research, a consumer analytics and brand insights company, said: “Since the company themselves had made a choice to change the name, they can do what they want. Old stock in stores is retained because the old stock will have to be depleted first.”

Glow & Lovely accounts for 80 percent of the fairness cream market in India, and is one of HUL’s most successful cosmetics lines.

“The new stock reached us by end of August or so. We have exhausted the first two lots and have ordered the third one,” said Naresh Tiwari, store manager of Reliance Super Mart in South Mumbai.

Brand experts pointed out that HUL had introduced Fair & Lovely to the market in the 70s, and, since then, it has been one of the most successful products of the company.

Why the name change

In June 2020, Johnson & Johnson decided to stop selling skin-whitening creams popular in Asia and the Middle East, after such products came under social pressure amid a global debate about racial inequality.

The company stopped selling its Clean & Clear Fairness line of products, sold in India.

While experts called it a ‘bold and ethical move’, other brands did not curb production and instead opted for a name change.

A slew of cosmetic brands came under the scanner for promoting skin fairness for stereotyping racial types that intensified further in the wake of the 'Black Lives Matter' movement in the West.",595,-0.31778576638963485

Geojit's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL), a subsidiary of Unilever PLC, is India’s leading FMCG Company. It has over 35 brands spanning across 20 distinct categories, such as soaps, detergents, shampoos and skin care. Q2FY21 standalone revenue rose 16.1%, primarily aided by improved sales from Food & Refreshments segment. EBITDA margin improved 30bps YoY to 25.1% mainly benefitted from Nutrition business (acquisitions). Excluding this impact, on a like-tolike basis, margin declined 60bps. Company is set to benefit from winter portfolio demand which usually picks up by September. Also, we expect non-staple demand to recover and production and supply-chain disruptions to subside post-lifting of lockdowns.

Outlook

Hence, we upgrade our rating to a BUY on the stock with a revised target price of Rs. 2,440 based on 57x FY22E adj. EPS.

HDFC Securities research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL posted a mixed result, with a marginal beat in revenue (3% vs 1% HSIE), but a slight miss in margins. UVG was at +1% (HSIE -2%). Home Care remained weak at 2% YoY decline as demand for fabric wash was sluggish (also impacted by price cuts). BPC recovered well but was flat after a sharp 12% YoY decline in 1QFY21. F&R clocked strong growth of 19% (ex-GSK), aided by in-home consumption. The company clocked double-digit growth in 80% of its portfolio, which indicates a strong recovery. GM contracted by 145bps YoY due to commodity inflation and adverse product mix. ASP saw a sequential increase as the company resumed investments. We expect a gradual recovery in core categories in 2HFY21. We maintain our below-consensus EPS estimate for FY21/FY22/FY23.

Outlook

We roll forward our target price to Sep-22E EPS and value HUL at 50x P/E to derive a TP of Rs 2,060. Maintain REDUCE on a muted absolute growth trajectory and limited scope for re-rating.

Dolat Capital Market's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s Q2FY21 revenue was ahead of our estimate, but APAT was in line. Core business registered 3% sales growth with 1% volume growth. Foods and Refreshment posted mere 60bps expansion in EBIT margin – was a muted performance. Addition of GSK portfolio is expected to enhance margins here on. Small SKU’s contribution has increased in rural areas while consumption of large packs has remained firm in urban geographies. 80% of the company’s portfolio, related to health, hygiene and nutrition grew in double digits during the quarter. Ex-GSK, Home care/Personal care reported 1.6%/0.2% sales decline. We have maintained our FY21E and FY22E EPS to Rs 34.3 and Rs 40.0 and introduced FY23E EPS estimates at Rs 46.4.

Outlook

Valuing the stock at 50x FY23E EPS we have arrived at a TP of Rs 2,320. We Maintain Reduce. Considering recent run in stock price, there is limited room for further up-move. However, fundamentally, we see high growth prospects for HUL going ahead. Buy on dips.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Background: 80% of the portfolio comprising Essentials - such as Soaps, Detergents, Tea, Oral Care, etc. - grew at 6% in 1QFY21. Of the remaining 20% portfolio, 15% declined by 45% while the rest 5% declined by 69% during the quarter. In 2QFY21, the Essentials-led portfolio (80%) continued to be resilient. Skin Care - the largest segment of the remaining 20% portfolio - performed poorly in 1QFY21, but has started to recover consistently since June (although it is yet to turn positive YoY). Recovery has also been seen in the Water Purifier business, which was adversely affected in 1QFY21. With the Ice-Cream business being a washout in 1QFY21, it contributed significantly to business decline in the quarter. However, the Ice-Cream business is much less salient in the base quarter of 2QFY21 (2QFY20) v/s 1QFY21. Therefore, 2QFY21 is not expected to be as drastically impacted by the Ice-Cream business as 1QFY21.



Outlook

We remain positive on HUVR from a medium-term perspective, encouraged by: (a) robust earnings growth potential beyond the near term owing to its portfolio and execution strengths and (b) significant synergies in FY22E as a result of GSKCH. These factors suggest premium multiples are likely to sustain. Valuing the company at 55x Sep'22 merged EPS, we arrive at TP of INR2,670, implying 25% upside.

Complying with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'vocal for local' call, leading consumer products companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Dabur and Godrej have started sourcing raw materials locally. The companies plan to either reduce or completely stop importing materials from China.

""We are developing local sources for these imports. Since the world supplies are dominated by China, it will take some time for alternates to develop,"" said Sunil Kataria, CEO - India and SAARC at Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, as per a report in The Economic Times.

Consumer goods major Hindustan Unilever in July said that it was looking for alternatives to China for sourcing raw material and packaging material.

""We do have imports from China worth Rs 429 crore, including raw material and part packing material. And we have an absolutely clear strategy, and have started working on what would be the possible alternatives,"" HUL Chairman, Sanjiv Mehta had said during the AGM.

Meanwhile, Dabur India has also started the process of identifying local substitutes.

“China accounts for under 1 percent of our raw material and packing material procurement, and action has already been initiated for their replacement,"" Mohit Malhotra, CEO of Dabur India said, as per the ET report.

China is India's second-biggest trading partner, with trade worth $87 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2019, and a trade deficit of $53.57 billion in China's favour, the widest India has with any country. To put it in perspective, China constitutes 9 percent of India’s total export and 18 percent of total merchandise imports.

PM Modi, in his address to the nation on May 12, announced a push for locally-manufactured products.

Moreover, there have been calls to boycott Chinese products and after the Galwan Valley standoff in which 20 Indian Army personnel, including a colonel, were killed in a fierce clash with Chinese troops.

The Bombay High Court, in a temporary order, has restrained FMCG firm, Emami, from selling any skincare product under the brand name containing the words ""Glow and Handsome"", saying that prima facie Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has used them first in its brands.

Justice SC Gupte passed the order on August 17 on an application filed by HUL under the Trade Marks Act, seeking an injunction against Emami from using the trademark ""Glow & Handsome"".

HUL recently dropped the word ""Fair"" from its skin creams for men and women, and renamed the skin cream for men as ""Glow & Handsome"".

Emami claimed that it was the proprietor of this trademark, and was going to launch a skincare cream for men under the same name. ""... plaintiff (HUL) prima facie appears to be a prior adopter and user of the mark 'Glow & Handsome',"" the high court said in its order.

HUL had already launched its goods in the market with this trademark while Emami was still at the stage of adopting a process of launching its goods, the court noted.

""Its (Emami) application for registration of that mark is also of a subsequent date,"" the order said.

Further, HUL had sufficiently advertised its new brand ""Glow & Handsome"", said the court.

""At this threshold stage, it is reasonable to see that there is a concrete likelihood of confusion and deception in the public if identical marks are allowed to hold the field for popular and much-sold commodities,"" it said.

Until the final disposal of the matter, Emami, which has not yet brought its own goods into the market under ""Glow and Handsome"" brand, deserves to be restrained from doing so, said the judge.

""Pending final hearing and disposal of the matter, the defendant (Emami) is temporarily restrained from using the alleged mark 'Glow & Handsome' and/or any other mark containing the words in respect of any grooming, skincare and cosmetic products,"" the court said.

It posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.

As per HUL, it launched Fair & Lovely face cream in 1975. In 2006 it launched 'Fair & Lovely, Men', and in 2018, it coined and adopted the trademarks 'Glow & Lovely' and 'Glow & Handsome', being the first company to do so, it claimed.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR has successfully integrated GSK which reinforces our confidence in long-term growth story led by 1) Increased Market penetration by leveraging HUVR’s distribution capabilities (increase in reach by 1.75x initially and then 2.25x), 2) Launch of sachets and pouch packs at aggressive price points (20% discount), 3) Low rural penetration of HFD in South and East India, 4) Savings in media costs and material procurement, 5) Reduction in number of depots and 6) Savings of 3% in Royalty costs as it now owns Horlicks brand. Synergy benefit of 250-300bps has been realized already, the HUL expects 550-700bps margin expansion over base of 31.1% (ex-royalty) of FY20. We remain positive on core business of HUL given advantages in distribution, technology and analytics and categories of future. We have tweaked some estimates for GSK in our proforma numbers shall revise our estimates for GSK acquisition on getting more clarity from the company.

Outlook

We currently estimate 13.1% PAT CAGR over FY20-23 (post-merger) and value the stock at 46xFY23 pro-forma EPS of Rs50.1 and assign a target price of Rs2304. Retain Hold, although we would seek a lower entry point given COVID19 led disruptions and rich valuations.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL, in its GSK merger-related call today, shared further details about the integration and synergy benefits. Management has broadly maintained its double-digit medium-term growth outlook and synergy benefits of 800-1,000bps on the margin front of which 250-300bps have been already realized. Increasing the currently low rural penetration through affordable price packs and expanding reach (HUL’s F&R reach is 1.75x and HUL’s reach is 2.25x) offer sizable growth opportunity. Focus will also be to expand the category to adult nutrition over medium term. Margin guidance was maintained and further synergy benefits of 550-700bps are likely to be realized over the next few years, driven by savings from media buying and material purchase, supply-chain benefits and leveraging of scale. Management said the target is realistic and it will look at investing in growth vs. going aggressive on margin gains.

Outlook

We maintain our forecasts, factoring in a 420bps margin gain in FY21-23E and do not see any changes to our growth assumptions yet. Accounting for the Rs400bn merger will lead to a drop in ROE/ROCE. Maintain Hold as current valuations offer only limited upside.

ICICI Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported 4.4% revenue growth with the inclusion of acquired brands (Horlicks, Boost) revenue. On a like to like basis, revenue fell 7% with 8% volume dip. Despite manufacturing & supply chain disruption in April, May, the home care segment saw mere 2.1% decline in revenues. The company has been able to refill the distributor pipeline by June 2020 to pre-Covid levels. Beauty & personal care segment (BPC) segment saw 12.0% sales decline severely impacted by cosmetics, skin care & deodorants. However, soaps, sanitisers saw a strong surge in demand. The company has augmented hand wash capacity by 5x to meet the surge in demand aided by increasing hygiene awareness. Foods & refreshments category grew 52% with the inclusion of acquired brands sales. On a like to like basis, revenues fell 4% with ice-cream business severely impacted by lockdown. However, ketchup, tea & coffee witnessed strong double digit growth with increasing in-home consumption. Operating margins contracted 113 bps with 220 bps shrinkage in gross margins. The reduction in A&P spend by 393 bps partially offset the operating de-leverage impact on other costs. Net profit increased 7.2%.



Outlook

The strong performance in unprecedented quarter shows resilience of FMCG business. We expect HUL to be able to leverage structural demand trends in health & hygiene space with strong brands (Lifebuoy, Surf excel, Domex, Vim). We also expect strong growth in packaged foods, tea, coffee to continue in medium term. Maintain HOLD with revised TP of Rs 2410.

HDFC Securities' research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL clocked revenue growth of 4% YoY, primarily led by the GSK acquisition. Its domestic consumer business (ex-GSK) saw a decline of 7% YoY. Growth in the Hygiene & Nutrition business (80% mix) was resilient at 6% YoY, while discretionary (15% mix)/OOH (5% mix) declined by 45/69% YoY. Gross margin dipped 222bps YoY, despite GSK being GM accretive and soft crude basket. However, cost management initiatives supported the EBITDA margin. The company saw sequential improvement in demand in May and June, but overall sentiment remains weak on account of job losses and return of lockdowns in several states. The Discretionary and OOH categories are expected to remain weak in FY21. We maintain our below-consensus EPS estimate for FY21/FY22/FY23.



Outlook

We value HUL at 50x P/E on Jun- 22E EPS and derive a target price of Rs 2,016. Maintain REDUCE on a muted absolute growth trajectory and unfavourable risk-reward.

Q1FY2021 performance was better than our as well as the street’s expectation with revenue and PAT growing by ~4% and ~8%, respectively. Core business performed well with just a 7% decline compared to ours as well as street’s assumption of 12-13% decline. OPM was affected by unfavourable mix and higher COVID-19-related expenses. However, the same is expected to recover in coming quarters as business normalises (skin care and personal care regaining momentum). Recovery in rural demand, strong demand for hygiene and nutritional products and market share gains in key categories will be key revenue drivers in the near term. The company paid special dividend of Rs. 9.5 per share. We have raised earnings estimates by ~5% and ~4% for FY2021 and FY2022.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR results beat expectations driven by strong growth in health, hygiene and nutrition portfolio (up 6%) and GSK integration gains in media buying, marketing and innovations. HUL seems well placed to gain from 1) increased consumer focus on hygiene increasing demand for personal wash, Detergents and Hygiene 2) Synergy benefits in GSK as the current environment of nutrition focus, deep distribution reach and LUP strategy of HUL will work well 3) portfolio straddling from economy to premium segment will come in handy during current uncertain environment. Despite near term Covid uncertainty, we expect HUL to emerge stronger given strong brands, hygiene, deep distribution and sustainability. We believe cost cutting during in Covid times will enable margin gains once normalcy returns.



Outlook

We estimate 11.5% EPS CAGR over FY2023. We value the stock at 46xFY23 EPS (46xSept22 earlier) and arrive at target price of Rs2278. Retain Hold, although expect small correction and back ended returns given rich valuations.

Dolat Capital's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Revenues came in line with our estimate but EBITDA and APAT was a beat. Core business registered 8% volume de-growth - was in line. Core business witnessed 170bps deterioration in margins but merger with GSK Consumer was margin accretive, helped restrict margin contraction to 110bps. Small SKU’s contribution has increased in rural areas while consumption of large packs has remained firm in urban geographies. 80% of the company’s portfolio (including GSK), related to health, hygiene and nutrition grew by 6% during the quarter. Ex-GSK, Home care/Personal care/Food & refreshment reported 2%/12%/4% sales decline. We have maintained our FY21E and FY22E EPS to Rs 34.3 and Rs 40.0. Though the operational performance was better than estimate, persistent supply constraints would have impact in ensuing quarters.



Outlook

Maintain TP at Rs 2,320 (58x FY22E). We Maintain Reduce. Considering recent run in stock price, there is limited room for further up-move. However, fundamentally, we see high growth prospects for HUL going ahead. Buy on dips.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUVR) reported 5% beat on sales and ~10% beat on EBITDA and PAT v/s our estimates. The outlook is gradually improving, with the discretionary part of the portfolio (15% of sales) gradually seeing recovery. In a period of relative normalcy, HUVR (as has been the case in recent years) is likely to report superior earnings growth, which has led us to maintain a BUY rating.



Outlook

These factors suggest premium multiples are likely to sustain. Valuing the company at 55x Jun’22 merged EPS, we arrive at TP of INR2,550, implying a 10% upside.

Hindustan Unilever is expected to report decline in every earnings parameter in quarter ended June 2020 largely due to COVID impact on volume growth, but the same could be better on a sequential basis.

Overall numbers are not comparable due to merger of GSK Consumer's health food drinks (HFD) business during June quarter.

Brokerages largely expect 1-3 percent decline in June quarter profit as well as revenue as its core business is likely to have impacted badly due to lockdown wherein people seems to have focus more on essential items than luxury products.

""The core business of HUL is expected to decline by 13-14 percent affected by lower demand for personal care, skin care products and ice creams during the quarter. Sales volumes are expected to be lower by 11-12 percent. GSK Consumer's HFD business is expected to decline in mid-single digits,"" said Sharekhan which sees 1.6 percent YoY decline in profit and 2.9 percent fall in revenue.

Kotak Institutional Equities feels about 70-75 percent of HUL's portfolio that can be classified as essentials grew marginally during the quarter, whereas balance 25-30 percent (non-essential/discretionary) comprising skincare, hair care, color cosmetics, deodorants, ice-cream and out-of-home consumption products (tea/coffee vending machines) declined sharply.

The brokerage expects 12 percent decline in revenues (down 2 percent YoY including GSK-CH acquisition) in the domestic FMCG business led by 10 percent decline in underlying volume growth.

""On a segmental basis, we bake in 5 percent YoY revenue growth for Home care, 22 percent YoY decline for Personal care and 20 percent YoY decline for packaged food and refreshments (organic basis),"" said Kotak.

HUL's gross margin is expected to be supported by lower raw material cost and GSK Consumer acquisition, but EBITDA margin may contract 100-200 basis points YoY, according to brokerages.

Kotak expects 75 bps YoY expansion in gross margin aided by raw material tailwinds and GSK-CH acquisition partly offset by product mix change. ""EBITDA margin would decline 185 bps YoY (off high base) due to negative operating leverage and change in product mix (lower salience of high-margin personal care categories),"" said the brokerage which sees EBITDA falling 9 percent.

According to Sharekhan, operating profit margin is expected to be lower by 104 bps due to change in revenue mix as lower SKUs will see higher sales.

HUL share price fell 5 percent during the quarter ended June 2020 and rallied 21.3 percent year-to-date against 10 percent rally and 4 percent gains in Nifty FMCG index, respectively.",427,-0.6576025605201721

It might give an impression that bulls have taken the rally forward in Nifty50, if we look at the prices on a weekly closing basis but things are not as embellished as it is appearing. Even though the gain of more than 150 points has been registered in the week gone by but, the behaviour of bulls during the last trading week is raising a question mark on the strength of an ongoing rally. Gap up opening on July 6 could not attract the follow up buying and prices remained sideways throughout the week just below its 200-day simple moving average, which is placed at 10,876. The inside day pattern on a daily time frame which was followed by ""Doji"" on Friday's trading session and indecisive small body candle in a weekly time frame suggesting that rally is losing steam and a phase of distribution might start in coming days.

An index is likely to remain sideways in the range of 10,880 to 10,680 in the forthcoming trading week with slightly negative bias. Breaking below the lower range i.e. 10,680 could result in profit booking and slide in such case can be expected till 10,528 and even till 20 DMA which is placed at 10,428. Having a glance with the birds-eye view and considering the advanced Fibonacci system, Nifty50 is trading with ""justified good above series"" and rallied after trading the ""master high"" of 10,328.50 formed on June 8. The same master high will now act as strong support in coming days on the way down and until the prices are trading above it, the medium-term trend will remain up but short term volatility will not be ruled out.

Bank Nifty on the other hand looks more lucrative and could outperform Nifty50 in the coming days. When Nifty is trading near its 200 DMA, the Bank Nifty is still trading far below its 200 DMA which is placed at 26,340 indicating that it has more headroom for rally. The trend reversal buying is emerging in many banking stocks and range breakout along with positive moving average crossover can be seen in the banking index itself.

Banks, non-banking financial sector, and consumption stocks could offer decent gains during the expected subdued phase of Nifty50. We have identified three stocks that could offer an 8 to 15 percent return in the short term.

Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services: Buy | CMP: Rs 204.1 | Target: Rs 235 | Stop loss: Rs 188 | Return: 13.5 percent

The stock has been hammered quite intensely in the month of February and March 2020. The fall has been abated in March-end and since then the counter has been consolidating and forming a base. Recently, the breakout of a base formation is visible on the chart along with a bullish crossover of major short term and medium-term moving averages. The prices have also breached its 23.6 percent retracement level of intermediate swing move and likely to move towards 38.2 percent retracement level which is placed at Rs 232. Traders can initiate long positions at current market price (CMP) and on any dip till Rs 195. The positions can be held with the short term perspective.

State Bank of India: Buy | CMP: Rs 195.60 | Target: Rs 225 | Stop loss: Rs 180 | Return: 15 percent

We have identified and recommended the stock earlier as well at Rs 158 levels when it was trading at a multi-year support zone. This is a follow-up call as the stock has bounced back from the important support levels and formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the monthly chart. Bullish ""harami"" pattern has formed in the monthly time frame last month and follow up buying has also witnessed in the current month.

In the daily time frame, the stock is on the verge of breaking out from an ""inverse head & shoulder"" pattern. The RSI has started trading in a bullish zone for the first time in the current year and other momentum indicators are also trading with a bullish bias. The upward slope of short term moving averages suggesting that stock is poised for a breakout and can be bought for short term gain.

Hindustan Unilever: Buy | CMP: Rs 2,223.80 | Target: Rs 2,405 | Stop loss: Rs 2,120 | Return: 8 percent

The stock has been consolidating near its 20-day moving average for quite some time and looking poised for a fresh upmove. The prices have witnessed bullish crossover of major short term and medium-term moving averages. After hitting the fresh lifetime high in April 2020, the counter went through mild correcting but kept its higher top and higher bottom cycle intact. The RSI has now started trading in a bullish zone and other momentum indicators are also going through positive crossover, suggesting bullish momentum is building up in the counter. The stock is likely to outperform the benchmark indices and can be bought for short term gain.

Note: Closing price as per NSE on July 10 is taken as CMP.

In an interim relief to Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which recently dropped the word 'Fair' from its skin cream for men and renamed it 'Glow & Handsome', the Bombay High Court on Monday said FMCG firm Emami, that has its own 'Glow and Handsome' cream, shall give HUL seven days prior notice before initiating legal proceedings on trademarks.

Justice B P Colabwalla was hearing an application filed by HUL under the Trade Marks Act seeking injunction against Emami from issuing ""groundless threats"" in view of the use of its trademark 'Glow and Handsome'.

HUL in its application said the defendant (Emami) should give it at least seven days prior written notice before initiating any legal proceedings in any court or claiming any interim relief against HUL as threatened in the statements made by Emami.

The court after hearing preliminary arguments observed that ""prima facie"" it does appear that HUL was the prior adopter of the mark as it had filed its trade mark application first in September 2018 and subsequently on June 25, 2020.

Also read: All is fair in business and war: HUL versus Emami — who will dominate men’s fairness cream space?

""The statements made by the defendant (Emami) do amount to a threat, however, whether they are unlawful or groundless, that is something that will have to be decided after hearing both the sides,"" the court said.

The bench directed Emami to give HUL seven days prior written notice before initiating legal proceedings against it and posted the matter for further hearing on July 27.

As per the application, HUL, in 1975, launched a fairness face cream Fair & Lovely which was initially gender neutral.

To specifically target the men's segment, in 2006, HUL launched 'Fair & Lovely, Men'.

HUL said in 2018, it coined and adopted the trademarks 'Glow & Lovely' and 'Glow & Handsome'.

On July 2, 2020, HUL made an official announcement that 'Fair & Lovely' was being rebranded as 'Glow & Lovely' and its skincare range products for men will be called 'Glow & Handsome'.

However, Emami then gave press statements threatening legal action against HUL for violating its alleged rights in its mark 'Emami Glow and Handsome', HUL claimed in its application.",379,-0.48907434940338135

Consumer goods major (HUL) said it was looking for alternatives to China for sourcing raw material and packaging material, amid border tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

""We do have imports from China worth Rs 429 crore, including raw material and part packing material. And we have an absolutely clear strategy, and have started working on what would be the possible alternatives,"" HUL Chairman, Sanjiv Mehta said on June 30.

Mehta was speaking to investors at HUL's 87th annual general meeting (AGM).

""During the COVID period, we have demonstrated a huge degree of resilience, and moved to alternative sourcing which will help us to mitigate any risk that might arise because of the present geopolitical crisis,"" Mehta said.

There have been calls to boycott Chinese products after a clash on June 15-16 night at Ladakh's Galwan Valley where 20 Indian soldiers died.

HUL's plan to look for alternatives to China also comes amid the government's ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ plan, or push for domestically produced goods.

The 99 percent of the products sold by HUL in India are manufactured locally, Mehta told investors.

Mehta also said the risk of recession is real, and that the Centre should watch the demand situation closely.

""It is not easy for the government to have a large demand-led stimulus and it must be concerning the government that if they go down this route, a large part of the stimulus could end up as savings rather than being spent to generate demand,"" Mehta said.",269,0.9999953508377075

A day after Hindustan Unilever announced that it will drop the word 'fair' from Fair & Lovely brand, L’Oreal, the world’s biggest cosmetics company, has said that it will remove words referencing “white”, “fair” and “light” from its skin-evening products, a spokeswoman said on Friday. Unilever and L’Oreal are two big players in the global market for skin whitening creams used in many Asian, African and Caribbean countries where fair skin is often considered desirable.

Unilever, in particular, came under fire for its “Fair & Lovely” brand at a time of worldwide focus on racial injustice following weeks of protests sparked by the May death of George Floyd, a Black man, in police custody in the United States.

L’Oreal’s products include Garnier Skin Naturals White Complete Multi Action Fairness Cream.

Johnson & Johnson went a step further, saying it would stop selling skin whitening creams sold in Asia and the Middle East under its Neutrogena and Clean & Clear brand.

Kolkata-based FMCG firm Emami, which owns fairness cream brand Fair & Handsome, had said it is evaluating the current situation. ""We, as responsible corporate citizens value consumer sentiments and take cognizance of the holistic approach that is required to be taken to address their needs. We are studying all implications currently and evaluating internally to decide our next course of action,"" an Emami spokesperson had said.

Leading FMCG player Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on Friday said it has completed the acquisition of VWash from pharma major Glenmark Pharmaceuticals. The company, however, did not disclose the value of the transaction.

The acquisition was announced in March and was subject to certain closing conditions, which have now been fulfilled, the FMCG firm said in a filing to BSE.

VWash was launched by Glenmark in 2013 and the brand has established itself as the market leader in the female intimate hygiene category backed by strong product proposition, consumer endorsements and brand building investments.

HUL has acquired intellectual property rights including trademarks, design and knowhow related to the VWash brand worldwide, the company said.

""VWash acquisition is strategic and gives us an entry into rapidly growing female intimate hygiene segment. It enables us to serve consumer needs through scientific solutions. This acquisition is also timely given heightened focus on health and hygiene,"" HUL Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Mehta said.

With this acquisition, HUL is looking to scale up the brand by building awareness, driving penetration, leveraging distribution and enhance offering for chemist channel.

It is too early to predict the mid-term impact of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic and the pace of growth, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) Managing Director Sanjiv Mehta said.

Mehta told Motilal Oswal that products in the detergents and home care segments will do well. ""Skin cleansing products such as hand washes, soaps, and sanitisers are also witnessing huge demand."".

The brokerage remains positive on HUL in the medium term with a Buy rating and target price of Rs 2,400 per share.

Here are some other takeaway from that conversation:

>> Demand for immunity-building products and in-home consumption is growing. Tea and coffee are some products that are doing well due to a rise in in-home consumption.

>> The sale of liquid hand washes are expected to go up significantly. Brands such as Dove, Pears and Lifebuoy are doing well.

>> The merger with GSK Consumer Healthcare, which helped HUL acquire the Horlicks brand, was well-timed.

>> As consumers' purchasing power dips due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 outbreak, selling products in smaller packages and satchets may be important.

>> Mehta said the brands need to evolve and reinvent.

>> The management is confident of HUL emerging stronger from the current crisis.",220,0.7143018756593976

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever’s (HUVR) FY20 Annual Report highlights the company’s continuous efforts to strengthen its building blocks, thus enabling the sustenance of robust growth. Key insights highlighted from the report below: The Personal Care category witnessed significant effects of the slowdown in 2HFY20, which culminated with the sharp COVID-19 led decline toward the year-end. Despite this, HUVR reported another year of double-digit earnings growth, taking its earnings CAGR over the past 3 years to 16.6%, even as peers (many of whom are much smaller) witnessed revenue deceleration over the same period. If not for the COVID-19 disruption impact, sales growth would have been healthy for the third consecutive year as well.



Outlook

Moving our forecasts to merged numbers (which add over 9% to FY22E EPS due to the nature of the GSK merger and synergies), we value the company at 55x merged EPS, to arrive at a TP of INR2,400 and maintain Buy.

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever Limited

The GSK Group sold 5.7% stake (13.37 crore shares) in Hindustan Unilever (HUL) through multiple block deals in the open market. This has reduced the supply overhang in the stock. The merger of GSK Consumer Healthcare's business with HUL will make the latter one of the largest players in the domestic foods space and would lead to earnings accretion of 4-8% over FY2021/FY2022. HUL’s stock price has corrected by ~16% from its recent high factors in the sluggish performance in Q4FY2020. With 50-55% of business catering to essential categories and the company’s strong direct distribution reach, we expect HUL to recover rapidly post the pandemic situation.

Outlook

HUL has a strong balance sheet with robust cash flows and goods dividend payout which makes it a safest bet in the uncertain environment. We maintain our Buy recommendation on the stock with unchanged PT of Rs. 2,305.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) share prices jumped over 3 percent in the morning trade on May 8 after Societe Generale had bought 1.29 crore shares of the company at Rs 1,902 per share.

The stock is among the most active stocks on NSE in terms of value with 23,62,605 shares being traded at 09:30 hours. The stock is quoting at Rs 2,056.40, up Rs 63.90, or 3.21 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 2,070 and an intraday low of Rs 2,040.15.

British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Pte and Horlicks Limited sold 5.69 percent stake in the company via block deals on May 7, 2020. The price band is at a discount of 3-8 percent to the closing price of the HUL stock of Rs 2,010.2 per share on May 6 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Global research firm Credit Suisse has maintained its outperform call on the stock with target at Rs 2,400 per share. It is of the view that GSK's 5.7 percent stake sale removes the key overhang adding that premium to Britannia Industries and Dabur India has narrowed to 5-15 percent after the recent correction, according to a report by CNBC-TV18.

On the other hand, after the correction, discount to Nestle India has widened to 25 percent, it said. Morgan Stanley feels that diversified brand portfolio and track record of execution makes it a better risk reward while the company is likely to deliver flat revenues in core business in FY21. It expects total EPS growth of over 20 percent in Hindustan Unilever.

The stock has seen a steady decline in the last 5 days with GSK selling stake in HUL on May 7, 2020, a deal which will be valued roughly between USD 3.2-3.4 billion, according to a Business Standard report.

Sumit Bilgaiyan, Founder of Equity99 is of the view, ""Hindustan Unilever results were certainly weak. We would recommend adding on dips as these are defensives and essential products, demand of which might not be impacted in the downturn.""

According to Moneycontrol SWOT Analysis powered by Trendlyne Hindustan Unilever has zero promoter pledge with growth in quarterly net profit and increasing profit margin (YoY). However, the technical rating remains very bearish.

GlaxoSmithKline said on Thursday it sold its stake in Hindustan Unilever's Indian business for $3.35 billion, which Refinitiv says is the largest block trade ever to have been carried out in India.

The funds will help GSK in its goal of reinvigorating its drug development pipeline, having made costly bets on experimental cancer treatments and future cell and gene therapies amid sluggish revenue growth.

The 5.7 percent stake in Hindustan Unilever was accepted by GSK as payment for the sale of its malted drink brand and other nutrition brands to Unilever, agreed in late 2018.

The 133.77 million shares were offloaded on average for 1,905 rupees, according to a statement from GlaxoSmithKline.

Potential investors were earlier told the shares would be sold in a range of 1,850 to 1,950 rupees, which was a 3 percent - 8 percent discount to Wednesday's closing price of 2,010.20 rupees.

In the statement, GSK said it would now receive net proceeds from the Horlicks divestment of 2.9 billion pounds ($3.59 billion), up from its original expectation of 2.4 billion pounds.

It said the recent Hindustan Unilever share price gains led to the better than expected outcome.

The deal, at $3.35 billion, eclipses the previous block trade record in India when Daiichi Sankyo sold its $3.18 billion stake in Sun Pharmaceuticals in April 2015, according to Refinitiv.

On a global basis, the Glaxo block trade will be the 10th ever biggest, according to the data provider. The largest ever block trade remains Naspers selling $9.8 billion worth of Tencent stock in Hong Kong in March 2018.

MORE DIVESTMENTS

GSK's decision could also inject some momentum into India's equity capital markets which have struggled in line with other major financial markets as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

There has been $6 billion worth of equity capital market deals in India so far in 2020, down from $8.52 billion during the same time list year, according to Refinitiv.

The data showed the rate of activity in 2020 is the slowest since 2017.

In comparison, Hong Kong's equity capital markets have seen $12.8 billion worth of activity this year.

GSK struck a deal in 2018 to fold its Indian business - whose main product is Horlicks - into Unilever's Indian unit Hindustan Unilever in exchange for shares in the combined group.

According to GSK's first-quarter report, it completed the Horlicks deal on April 1, receiving the 5.7 percent equity stake in Hindustan Unilever plus about 400 million pounds in cash.

Earlier this year, GSK launched a two-year programme to split into two entities, separating the core prescription drugs and vaccines business from an enlarged over-the-counter products business that was merged with a Pfizer unit.

It is considering more divestments to fund the costs of the separation.

Having sold travel vaccines to Bavarian Nordic for up to 955 million euros ($1.03 billion)in October last year, the British group is looking into shedding more assets, starting with a review of its prescription dermatology business with about 200-300 million pounds in annual sales.",513,0.33284608523050946

Shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) declined over 5 percent in morning trade on BSE on May 4, reacting to the company's March quarter scorecard.

The company on April 30 reported a profit of Rs 1,519 crore in the fourth quarter, registering a 1.2 percent decline YoY due to the lockdown in the second half of March.

Most brokerage firms forecast fell in earnings as well as volume disruptions but they maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock. After a 14 percent rally, most experts feel that valuations still remain high but it is a good 'buy on dips' stock in the long-term.

Credit Suisse (CS)

As per CNBC-TV18, CS has an 'outperform' call on HUL with a target price of Rs 2,400.

CS finds Q4 decline not relevant as it was driven by the last 10 days' performance. CS cut HUL's earnings marginally by 2-3 percent.

""Lower ad spends, cost savings and input cost tailwinds will offset lower revenue growth. Earnings growth will also be aided by GSK merger impact,"" CS said.

CS highlighted that large-scale downtrading will be the key risk to watch out for.

HSBC

HSBC has a buy rating on HUL. It raised the target price to Rs 2,650 from Rs 2,350 but cited that the uncertainty on demand will persist.

""This one-off quarter doesn’t reduce the company's structural appeal,"" CNBC-TV18 reported HSBC saying so.

The company will spring back to growth as soon as the situation normalises, HSBC said.

HSBC is of the view that FY21 will still likely be a resilient year. Optically expensive valuation builds in reasonable long-term expectations, HSBC said.

Macquarie

As per CNBC-TV18, Macquarie has an outperform call on HUL with a target price at Rs 2,500.

It said adjusted Q4 profit was 10 percent below its estimates due to lower sales. Macquarie said the company is its top pick and a marquee recommended stock.

JPMorgan

JPMorgan has maintained a 'hold' call on HUL but trimmed the target price to Rs 2,397 from Rs 2,516, reported CNBC-TV18.

""Below-estimate Q4 results reflected on-ground reality for the FMCG industry during COVID. Pressures will continue into Q1 on likely change in consumer buying patterns,"" said JPMorgan.

JP Morgan has cut its estimates by 4 percent and 3 percent for FY21 and FY22, respectively.

""We build in weaker near and medium-term recovery. We are positive on the company's portfolio and execution capabilities and await a better entry point with valuations at 48 times FY22E earnings and lower earnings visibility,"" said JPMorgan.

Jefferies

As per CNBC-TV18, Jefferies has a buy call on HUL but cut the target price to Rs 2,525 from Rs 2,750.

Jefferies highlighted that the management commentary was cautious, but it refrained from providing demand outlook.

The global brokerage firm has cut FY21-22 EPS estimates by 3-5 percent to factor in lower revenue and said it did not see risk to margin and the company is better placed than peers.

Jefferies said near-term pressure in share price will be an opportunity to buy the stock.

FMCG major HUL expects technology adoption in distribution channel, including neighbourhood stores besides e-commerce, to speed up as a result of consumers' experience during the coronavirus pandemic. According to Hindustan Unilever (HUL) CMD Sanjiv Mehta, the company will be ready to serve its consumers through any channel that they would prefer to shop, be it big format stores, kirana stores or online.

""Different channels have different shopping missions. People go to a big format store on certain occasion, they go to a neighbourhood store on certain occasion but yes this crisis will habituate and I believe that it would give a fillip to e-commerce, there is no question about that,"" he said in a conference call on the company's quarterly earnings on Thursday.

Mehta further said, ""It would also give a fillip, whether it is a big store or a neighbourhood store, to adopt technology and serve consumer better. I believe that from a perspective of a distribution channel, this is certainly a moment where adoption of technology would speed up.""

Commenting on consumer habits during the COVID-19-induced lockdown, he said there are two big emerging trends.

""One is the relevance of humble grocers, who are always important for India. I believe that people have realised their benefits .. and the second is e-commerce. Certainly, as people would like to place their order from home, which would definitely give a fillip to e-commerce and we would be ready for that,"" Mehta added.

The company has taken several initiatives over the past couple of years by introducing its e-commerce initiative humarashop.com.

""As things normalise, we have humarashop, which clearly from reverence and importance perspective, that becomes very strategic ... We would be looking as how to reach consumers in the best possible way and going to serve consumers,"" he said.

Mehta also said there is an expectation of a surge in the sale of hygiene and nutrition products post lockdown and the company is ready for that.

""There would be a hike in need, very clearly, for hygiene and nutrition products. There would be no question about that. We would be willing to provide this to shoppers and consumers, in whichever channel, they would like to,"" he said.

Commenting on current situation on production, Mehta said the focus is on goods that are in demand by people.

“Our entire focus was on health hygiene and those kinds of products so that we could maximise our products,” he said adding that for several weeks, products such as colour cosmetic were not manufactured.",430,0.8886336088180542

Here are the highlights of Hindustan Unilever's Q4FY20 earnings call compiled by Narnolia Financial Advisors:

Management Participants: Sanjeev Mehta - Chairman

Before COVID-19, the macro economic scenario had been challenging led by high retail inflation, liquidity issues and lower GDP. However, the government and RBI took various measures to push the growth and are in right direction.

The recovery in rural demand is not yet visible while resulting low consumer confidence has reflected into continued slowdown of FMCG market growth before COVID-19.

Due to nationwide lockdown in second half of March-20 supply chain got disrupted (resulting 50 percent drop in primary level stock) impacting distribution and trade inventory. In April, supply chain gradually improved and the company is able to do 75-80 percent of its normal level.

Amidst COVID-19 situation the company has protected frontline team and distributors by providing reimbursement of insurance cover, initiated COVID-19 helpline number etc.

The company is doing continuous interaction with people through digital medium and is also analyzing the change in the consumer patterns.

The company's brands & portfolios are being readjusted as per consumer behaviour and innovation is been made on the same.

The company's operation remained impacted from middle of March-20.

Domestic consumer growth stood at -9 percent in Q4FY20, 50 percent of the impact is on account of reduced stock at distributor location due to disturbance in primary distribution network and rest is on account of lower stock retailer and loss in consumer demand for ice cream and discretionary category.

The company's ice cream business witnessed sharp decline since mid of March-20.

The company's food category witnessed some boost whereas the discretionary category remained impacted.

The material cost increased by 40bps on account of inflation in raw material prices like oil, SMP (up by 60 percent) and Tomato paste.

Improvement in other expenses led by supply chain efficiency, saving initiatives, costs settlement and benefits from currency markets.

The company will continue looking for consistent, competitive, profitable and responsible growth.

Management expects shift in consumer demand to health, hygiene and nutrition segment.

The company is bringing in Lifebuoy germs kill spray and Domex disinfectant spray into the market along with other innovative products like germ removal wipes, germ wash boosters are expected to come in next 4-6 weeks.

The company will continue to bring in science for inventory management.

The company is deferring some of the expansion plan unless that is very important.

The company will focus on rebalancing media expenses across channels both from competitive as well as consumer demand context. Thus, as of now the company’s motto is 'Earn and then spend'.

The company will cut down expenses which are not core and not adding value.

The company expects demand in personal care to get normal post lockdown and will focus more on value packs.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever CMD Sanjiv Mehta on Thursday said the company has not cut any jobs or salary of employees so far due to the coronavirus pandemic but cannot say what will happen in future.

Addressing a media conference call on the company's quarterly earnings, Mehta said Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has already taken various cost saving measures but steps for the road ahead will depend on how the economy behaves after the country emerges from the health crisis.

""Right now we have not shed any jobs and at this stage we have not done any salary cuts, but I would not be able to say what is going to happen in the future because we will have to see how the situation evolves,"" he said.

Elaborating further, Mehta said, ""If for instance the economy bounces back then we are into business but if we get into deep depression then we will revaluate all the steps that we have been taking. We always keep options open because we evaluate everything very closely. We have to evaluate, we have the options that we can exercise in future.""

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

He was responding to a query on whether the company has cut jobs or reduced salaries of employees in order to overcome the financial impact of coronavirus outbreak and subsequent nationwide lockdown.

Stressing that ""the ethos of HUL is very frugal"", Mehta said, ""We have a very close focus on each of the lines of P&L (profit and loss) and we look very closely to ensure we add value and drive value to the business.""

Citing some of the steps that the company has undertaken to save cost, he said activities ""that don't add any value like travelling, even if you wanted to, there is no expenses incurred there"".

""Under the current context if it is not going to add value then why should we be spending that money. Our focus is going to be on absolutely looking at every bit of it in ensuring that the strong business model that we have, we are able to preserve it,"" Mehta asserted.

Underlining the fact that HUL also has to ensure its ecosystem remains strong, he said, ""Also you will appreciate that we don't run the business in isolation. We have distributors, we have scores of suppliers, thousands of distributors...and what we have to do is play a part in ensuring that the ecosystem also survives so that the business keeps doing well going forward.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever on April 30 is expected to report double-digit growth in Q4FY20 profit due to a lower tax rate and higher operating income. The expected profit growth range is 10-20 percent YoY.

Among brokerages, Kotak Institutional Equities expects the maximum 19.5 percent growth in profit for the quarter while Emkay sees a 10.4 percent rise in bottomline.

At operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is likely to grow in the range of 7-17 percent with triple-digit margin expansion, aided by cost measures, lower oil prices and strong gross margin.

""We expect 350 bps YoY expansion in EBITDA margin aided by gross margin expansion (100 bps), operating efficiencies (150 bps) and adoption of Ind-AS (100 bps). Net profit would be aided by a cut in the corporate tax rate,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which expects 17 percent growth in EBITDA.

Sharekhan also feels the efficient buying of raw materials would help gross margins to be higher by 74 bps while efficiencies and stringent ad-spends would result in 206 bps improvement in OPM (will also benefit from the change in accounting standards to Ind AS-116).

""Operating profit is expected to grow by 12.7 percent and adjusted PAT is expected to grow by 13.5 percent (will also be aided by lower tax rate),"" the brokerage said.

According to brokerages, revenue from operations in Q4FY20 could increase 2-3 percent with likely volume growth of 3-4 percent compared to year-ago period, but may see some impact of more than a week lockdown in March.

""We model 2 percent revenue growth in domestic FMCG business led by 2.5 percent underlying volume growth (UVG) and flat pricing. On a segmental basis, we bake in 3.3 percent YoY revenue growth for Home Care, 1.8 percent YoY growth for Personal Care and 3.5 percent YoY growth for Packaged Food and Refreshments,"" said Kotak.

The brokerage expects HUL to have cushioned the impact of COVID-19 by planning in advance and stocking up the channel in anticipation of potential up stocking by consumers ahead of the lockdown.

According to Narnolia, HUL's revenue is expected to grow by 3 percent YoY led by volume growth of 4 percent YoY (versus 7 percent YoY in Q4FY19). On pricing front, the brokerage expects 1 percent YoY decline on the back of price reduction taken in Home care and Personal wash segment (domex floor cleaners, Sanitisers and Lifebuoy portfolio).

Lockdown on account of turbulence caused by COVID-19 is expected to reduce volumes as the production remained hampered due to closure of factories in the last week of Q4FY20, it said.

Key things to watch out for would be an outlook on the pace of rural growth and demand turnaround, outlook on competitive intensity in soaps, raw material cost; volume growth on the wake of COVID-19, and movement in advertising and promotional expenses.

HUL share price reported double-digit return during the March quarter, FY20, and year-to-date periods, rising 19.5 percent, 34.7 percent and 18 percent, respectively.

A rub off effect was seen on HUL shares back home as well, but experts feel that the FMCG major should be able to ride the storm. The stock is up over 20 percent so far in 2020.

Angel Broking has placed Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) in its top picks category. The FMCG major is engaged in the manufacturing of branded and packaged FMCG products.

Besides, it also manufactures several food items, which are exempt from the lockdown.

Shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) climbed almost 3 percent in morning trade and looked on course to break their losing run of the last two consecutive sessions on February 25.

Shares of the company saw some traction a day after its board gave nod to the formation of a new subsidiary that will be 100 percent owned by the company.

""This new subsidiary has been formed to leverage the growth opportunities in a fast-changing business environment and will help HUL in becoming more agile and customer-focused,"" it said.

HUL on January 31 reported an 11.9 percent year-on-year growth in the December quarter profit at Rs 1,616 crore, driven by lower commodity cost and other expenses.

Shares of Hindustan Unilever rallied more than 5 percent intraday to hit a record high of Rs 2,264 on February 12 after Motilal Oswal retained its bullish stance. The brokerage said it is seeing significant 'levers' for the company's earnings growth.

The stock gained more than 13 percent in last one month. It was quoting at Rs 2,255.45, up Rs 102.65, or 4.77 percent, on the BSE at 1052 hours IST.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has been a stellar performer over the past decade, both in terms of earnings (around 13 percent CAGR) and stock price which climbed 884 percent in last 10 years.

Also, it has significantly outperformed some of its largecap consumer peers over the same period.

An unprecedented EBITDA margin improvement of more than 900bps YoY over the past 10 years ending FY20 has been led by factors such as (a) superior nimbleness in response to raw material cost and competitive stimuli, which has been boosted further by best-of-breed analytics, (b) strong execution of its 'Winning in Many India' (WIMI) strategy, herbal products and more recently on acquisitions as well, and (c) emphasis on premiumization with rigorous focus on cost savings at the same time.

These above factors are likely to benefit the company in the future as well, Motilal Oswal feels.

From a near-term perspective, favorable base in the next few quarters, expected recovery in the demand environment from Q2FY21, synergies from the GSK Consumer merger, price increase in soaps and lower crude costs are likely to boost earnings, according to the brokerage.

The research house feels earnings are likely to clock an impressive 18-19 percent CAGR over the next two years, continuing the past 3 years' trend ending FY20. ""If we take the GSK Consumer merger into account (not in our projections yet as NCLT Chandigarh approval is awaited), EPS CAGR is likely to be even more remarkable at around 23 percent over FY20-22.""

Both these earnings growth projections are extremely impressive, especially for a company the size of HUL, which points toward the company continuing its stupendous wealth-generation track record, it said.

Further, it is also notable that HUL's performance is likely to continue being superior (versus smaller peers), it added.

""Moreover, if trends in the factors leading to HUL's strong earnings growth in recent years sustain momentum, our forecasts on operating margin expansion of 90bp/50bp in FY21/FY22 could be surpassed. This is not

unlikely given the past 5 years' EBITDA margin expansion of 830bp,"" Motilal Oswal said.

With best-of-breed earnings growth as well as far superior RoEs compared to peers, the brokerage raised its target multiple to 50x FY22E EPS on the merged numbers resulting in target price changing to Rs 2,490 (16 percent potential upside), and maintained buy call on the stock.

We are increasing FY21 and FY22 EPS estimates by 3.7% and 4.6% following better than expected margin expansion and 5% volume growth in a highly challenging operating environment. HUL is cautious on near term volume growth even as it continues to invest behind long term strategic levers led by expected uptick in Rural demand (favorable rainfall, higher crop prices due to food inflation and benefit of DBT), structural urban drivers like categories of future (body-wash, hand wash, naturals, premium Home Care, color cosmetics etc.) and strong innovation pipeline in new generation products. We believe sustained investments in Distribution, logistics, Digital analytics and brand and product innovations will keep ahead of the entire HPC pack in our listed universe.

Outlook

We estimate 13.9% Adj.

Shares of multinational companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India and Britannia rallied 4-5 percent on February 3 after the abolition of dividend distribution tax (DDT) in the Budget.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech, said to remove the cascading effect, she proposed to allow deduction for the dividend received by holding company from its subsidiary. ""The removal of DDT will lead to estimated annual revenue forgone of Rs 25,000 crore,"" she said.

At present, companies are required to pay DDT on the dividend paid to its shareholders at the rate of 15 percent plus applicable surcharge and cess in addition to the tax a company pays on its profits.

She said non-availability of credit of DDT to most of the foreign investors in their home country results in reduction of rate of return on equity capital for them.

Hence, to increase the attractiveness of the Indian equity market and to provide relief to a large class of investors, she proposed to remove the DDT and adopt the classical system of dividend taxation under which the companies would not be required to pay the tax, she added.

In order to address liquidity challenge at wholesale as well as well as retail level, and to support volume growth, the company will take some price cuts in the current quarter. In addition to this, the festive season is likely to give some relief to the slowing demand. If there is a revival in demand, HUL will be the key beneficiary.

While current macro-economic conditions is likely to keep subdued demand in near term, we remain optimistic that the company will outgrow the industry. HUL being the largest FMCG Company with one of the largest footprints in terms of products and distribution network and its strategy to target volume growth, should drive healthy growth in medium to long term.

At CMP the stock is trading at 69.0x FY20E EPS and 60.0x FY21E EPS. We recommend buy on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,422 per share.

Shares of FMCG major Hindustan Unilever gained more than 2 percent intraday on February 1 after the company posted a robust set of number for the December quarter.

The profit during the October-December quarter grew 11.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,616 crore, driven by lower commodity cost and other expenses.

Revenue increased 2.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 9,808 crore, while domestic consumer growth was 4 percent with underlying volume growth at 5 percent.

""Volume growth of 5 percent was remarkable, given the high base (double-digit growth in Q3FY19), the weak operating environment and its size versus peers,"" said Motilal Oswal which has a buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 2,280.

""Urban growth has moderated, but rural growth has slowed down even further (at 0.5x urban growth during the quarter). The near-term demand outlook is challenging,"" said the management (in a conference call) which expects 5-6 percent price increase in soaps in the next few months.

This effectively means the reversal of the 5-6 percent decrease it had taken in September-October 2019 when commodity prices were soft, Motilal Oswal said.

Given the company’s best earnings growth visibility in the large-cap Indian consumer space and by far the highest return ratios, the premium valuations are justified, the brokerage added.

HUL in its BSE filing on January 31 said home-care continued its trajectory of good performance with double-digit top-line growth, but beauty and personal care segment was impacted by a higher-than-expected slowdown to market growth and delayed winter.

At the operating level, HUL beats analyst estimates. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased 19.5 percent YoY to Rs 2,445 crore in Q3FY20 and margin expanded 350bps to 24.9 percent, driven by cost-saving programme and leverage in other expenses.

Meanwhile, the Budget 2020 is expected to focus on agriculture as well as rural non- farming sector including warehousing, waste management and supply chain management, Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research told Moneycontrol.

""Certain policies to raise farm income are also predicted. GST rates on consumer durables & FMCG might be revised and lowered which will have an impact on the price movements of these sectors,"" he said.

""In the short term, demand outlook and market growth continue to be challenging.""

Underlying volume growth was 10 percent in the same period last year and 5 percent in the September quarter of FY20.

HUL said home-care continued its trajectory of good performance with double-digit top-line growth, but beauty and personal care segment was impacted by a higher-than-expected slowdown to market growth and delayed winter.

The home-care segment, which contributed to 35 percent to total revenue, registered a 9.8 percent YoY growth in Q3 revenue at Rs 3,456 crore and 41 percent rise in EBIT with 400bps margin expansion.

Revenue from foods & refreshment business grew by 7.9 percent YoY to Rs 1,865 crore, with healthy EBIT growth of 28 percent and 280bps rise in the margin.

However, beauty and personal care segment revenue, which contributed to 45 percent to total revenue, fell 2.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,412 crore, but at the operating level, its EBIT grew by 7.5 percent with 270bps rise in the margin in Q3FY20.

Operating performance was ahead of analyst estimates as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (reported EBITDA) increased 19.5 percent YoY to Rs 2,445 crore in Q3FY20, with margin expansion of 335 bps at 24.9 percent, driven by cost-saving programme and leverage in other expenses.

EBITDA was estimated at Rs 2,313 crore with margin at 23.1 percent, according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Abneesh Roy of Edelweiss Securities said 5 percent volume growth is a good number. ""Overall numbers were good with EBITDA and margin ahead of estimates. GSK merger completion is seen in February which would be key thing to watch out for,” he said.

Meanwhile, HUL appointed Ashish Gupta as an independent director to the board. Prabha Narasimhan will be the executive director of the home-care segment replacing Priya Nair, who will be the Executive Director for beauty and personal care.

Nair takes over from Sandeep Kohli, who will move to Dubai as VP-Beauty and Personal Care for North Africa, Middle East, Turkey and Russia markets, the company said.",475,0.8181461529298262

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL), on January 31, is likely to report double-digit profit and EBITDA growth year-on-year in quarter ended December 2019.

Profitability is largely driven by lower corporate tax cost, while cost saving program and premiumization agenda may support EBITDA and margin.

Revenue is seen rising in the range of 5-6 percent YoY, with volume growth around 3 percent in Q3FY20.

""We model 6 percent revenue growth in domestic FMCG business led by 4 percent underlying volume growth (UVG) and 2 percent price-led growth. On a segmental basis, we bake in 8 percent YoY revenue growth for home care, 4 percent YoY growth for personal care and 8 percent YoY growth for packaged food and refreshments,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 18.4 percent growth in profit YoY and 21 percent in EBITDA YoY.

HDFC Securities also agreed with Kotak, saying underlying volume growth could be 4 percent on base of 10 percent in Q3FY19 and 5 percent in Q2FY20, while PhillipCapital expects 3 percent volume growth on delayed season impacting winter portfolio, rural slowdown, liquidity challenges in trade channel.

Margin expansion is likely to be in the range of 100-200bps YoY on operating efficiencies, brokerages feel.

""Cost saving program combined with high other expenditure in the base quarter will lead to EBITDA margin expansion of 210bps YoY,"" said Edelweiss which sees revenue/profit/EBITDA growth at 4.5 percent/13.1 percent/14.7 percent YoY.

HDFC Securities built in 202bps increase in gross margin (down 76bps in Q3FY19 and up 251bps in Q2FY20). ""Cost control initiatives will continue to benefit, we expect like-to-like EBITDA margin to expand by 137bps YoY (up 185bps in Q3FY19 and up 191bps in Q2FY20).""

Key things to watch out for would be consumer demand environment outlook, improvement in rural business, impact of premiumization and new product launches, sustainability of cost saving initiatives, performance of Ayush and WIMI growth, and GSK and HUL merger update.

The share price of FMCG major Hindustan Unilever declined 2.7 percent in the morning trade on December 18 after Credit Suisse cut its target price of the stock to Rs 2,150 from Rs 2,180 while maintaining a neutral rating.

The global brokerage house also reduced earnings estimates by 1-2 percent after the parent company Unilever cut its growth guidance, highlighting India slowdown as a key factor.

""The growth guidance cut implies revenue growth below 5 percent and volume growth of around 3 percent in Q3. The company may deliver earnings growth via cut in advertising spends and other savings,"" Credit Suisse said.

Potential sale of GSK's 5.7 percent stake after the merger in Q4 is also an overhang on the stock.

The Economic Times recently said that GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was planning to sell its stake in Hindustan Unilever (HUL) in 'tranches' by early 2020. The move follows GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare’s December 3, 2018 decision to merge with the Indian unit of Unilever.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) bench in Chandigarh was expected to approve the HUL and GSK Consumer merger by December-end, the report said.

The stock was quoting at Rs 1,915.30, down Rs 49.15, or 2.50 percent, on the BSE at 1042 hours.

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is planning to sell its stake in Hindustan Unilever (HUL) in ‘tranches’ by early 2020, reported The Economic Times. The move follows GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare’s decision on December 3, 2018 to merge with the Indian unit of Unilever.



As per the report, GSK said it would sell its stake, close to six percent, in HUL once the merger was completed in early 2020. The approval for the merger between HUL and GSK Consumer is expected by December-end from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) bench in Chandigarh, it added.



If the deal fructifies, the deal could value GSK’s stake in HUL at Rs 26,580 crore ($3.7 billion), based on HUL’s December 13 closing price of Rs 2,005.30 per share, or about 17 percent appreciation over its pre-merger price.



Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.



In October, GSK said the value of HUL shares to be received on sale of Horlicks and other consumer healthcare brands had risen to 247 million pounds in nine months, with the cumulative increase in value since the signing of the deal being 345 million pounds.



“Following completion of the divestment of Horlicks in Q1 2020, we intend to sell down our holding in HUL. Such sell-down will be in tranches and at such times as GSK considers appropriate,” the article quotes Simon Steel, a spokesperson for GSK, as saying.



The article also quotes an HUL executive as saying, “This will be a market trade distributed among institutional investors and with no rights… Considering the size, it’s not clear yet if it will be done in a single tranche or in multiple blocks like Daiichi Sankyo and Sun Pharma in April 2015… GSK needs the cash to pay off its global obligations, so it would want to do it at the earliest as per its stated position.”



On December 3, 2018, HUL announced its decision to merge with GSK Consumer Healthcare in a deal that valued the latter at Rs 31,700 crore. Shareholders of GSK Consumer were to receive 4.39 shares of HUL for each share held. Post-merger, GSK was to emerge the second-largest shareholder in the merged entity with a 5.7 percent stake, with Unilever’s holding in HUL falling to 61.9 percent from 67.2 percent.",383,0.5405547022819519

The government has launched several projects to increase awareness around plastic recycling and curb the negative environmental impact of plastic waste.

Aligned with the national agenda on plastic waste management, several FMCG companies are working aggressively towards using 100 percent biodegradable plastic for packaging ready-to-eat and cosmetic products.

Companies such as Marico, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India, Future Consumer, Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Co, Parle Agro will move to 100 percent recyclable packaging by 2025 helping towards a sustainable future.

The move comes in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push to shun the usage of single-use plastic which may curb the use of items such as plastic spoons, 200 ml PET bottles, plastic straws, cups, plastic packets, among others.

Plastic containers of all types shed layers called microns in daily usage. These are insoluble compounds depositing as toxins in human body cells, in the environment and are carcinogenic beyond a limit.

Hindustan Unilever is working with the government and other partners such as the United Nations Development Programme on pilot projects for plastic waste management.

""At Unilever, we are committed to moving to 100 percent reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025, said a spokesperson from HUL.

Recently, HUL also announced two new commitments -- Reduce our use of virgin plastic packaging by 50 percent by 2025, with one third coming from an absolute plastic reduction and help collect and process more plastic packaging than we sell by 2025.

""We continually look at new ways to reduce, re-use, recycle and recover packaging and waste as we move towards becoming a zero-waste business. Globally, we have reduced nearly one-third of our packaging waste since 2010. We are committed to accelerating a transition to a circular economy, moving from the linear take-make-dispose model to a regenerative approach, which keeps materials at their highest value for as long as possible,"" HUL spokesperson added.

Single-use plastics are majorly used for packaging in FMCG packets and sachets of packed foods, groceries, cosmetics and toiletries.

Most FMCG companies are taking initiatives to reduce, collect and recycle multi-layered plastic.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for beverage products are being re-purposed to make apparels, footwear, and furniture by many companies.

At an industry event recently, Marico Chairman Harsh Mariwala said, “We will be moving to 100 percent recyclable plastic usage by 2025 and we will be using recycled content in packaging.”

Early November, Marico, in line with its commitment to sustainability, announced its partnership with Future Retail’s format Big Bazaar to launch a plastic recycling program ‘Plastic Lao Paise Kamao’.

The program enables consumers to submit plastic bottles across 21 key Big Bazaar outlets in and around Mumbai.

For each bottle that is submitted, Marico in association with Future Retail offers Rs 10 to consumers, which is instantly credited to their Future Pay wallet and can be redeemed against their purchase.

The incentive provided is for all products of Marico and also for products of Future Consumer, irrespective of the size of the bottle.

Other FMCG companies, Hindustan Unilever, Nestle too will move to 100 percent reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging by 2025.

In fact, Dabur India is aiming to become a plastic waste neutral company by March 2021.

“Dabur India has set its sights on becoming a Plastic Waste Neutral company by the end of March 2021 by collecting, processing and recycling 20,000 MT (20 million kgs) of post-consumer plastic waste from across the country. With this, the company would be collecting back 100 percent of the plastic waste that it generates through its product packaging, making it amongst the first Indian FMCG companies to achieve this feat,” said Shahrukh Khan, Executive Director-Operations, Dabur India.

Dabur has already rolled out a pilot plastic recycling initiative in 2018-19 in six states.

The fiscal year 2018-19 was the first full year of its roll-out and we have collected, processed and recycled nearly 4,000 MT (four million Kgs) of post-consumer plastic waste from these six states, Khan said.

It covers both recyclables (like PET, HDPE, beverage cartons) and non-recyclables (multi-layered plastic). The six states initially targeted by Dabur are Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Punjab.

Dabur India has now extended this Plastic Waste Management initiative to 25 states in 2019-20 fiscal and the company will collect 12,400 MT (124 lakh kg) plastic waste and send them for recycling/processing.

“This would be further hiked to 20,000 MT (200 lakh kgs) in 2020-21. With this, we would collect back 100% of the plastic waste generated by our packaging by March 2021, making us a Plastic Waste Neutral company,” Khan said.

Coca-Cola is redesigning and light-weighting packaging, increasing renewable and recycled material use. HUL is working with the government and other partners such as the United Nations Development Programme on pilot projects for plastic waste management.

PepsiCo India has been working across states to collect, segregate and sustainably manage the equivalent of 100 percent plastic packaging by 2021. It has partnered with organisations to upcycle plastic into creating utility products such as chairs, benches, tables, t-shirts, laptop bags.

“One of our key targets is to make 100 percent recyclable, compostable or biodegradable packaging by 2025 and we have been striving to design all packaging with the goal to achieve optimum results with utmost efficient use of material possible,” a PepsiCo India spokesperson said.

Future Consumer will also move towards polyolefin or similar polymeric structure wherever technically and commercially feasible.

""We are exploring a non-plastic based structure with coatings for a smaller sachet of solid products and experimenting with nearly Zero Base Packaging Concept during the year through the pilot,"" a company spokesperson said. They are also working on replacing glass with plastic bottles in selective products in food to reduce the Carbon footprint.

Parle Agro has also tied up with key players such as PET - Packaging Association for Clean Environment (PACE) and Action Alliance for Recycling Beverage Cartons (AARC) towards implementing its PWM initiatives.

“We have set an ambitious goal to immediately become 100 percent PET waste free company. This not only requires us to accelerate many of our ongoing environment and sustainability initiatives, but also double our investments. We are committed to invest Rs 50 crores in the next three years towards this endeavor,"" said Nadia Chauhan, Joint Managing Director and Chief Marketing Officer, Parle Agro.

""Given our 30 percent growth rate, our ‘PET Sustainability’ investments will most definitely increase every year. Moreover, in the coming months we will be launching additional employee and consumer campaigns that will act as a multiplier for our PWM initiatives,"" she added.

Even chocolate makers are making use of upcycled papers for wrapping chocolates.

Launched in Amsterdam and produced in Chennai, Kocoatrait chocolate bars are packed using our cocoa husk paper which is upcycled, plastic & paper-free, recyclable, biodegradable & compostable.

According to government data, India generates more than 25,000 tonnes of plastic waste every day, 40 percent of which remains uncollected and littered in the environment.

The government aims to rid the country of single-use plastic by 2022 as part of the Clean India (Swachh Bharat) part two campaign.

It has notified Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, as per which the generators of waste have been mandated to take steps to minimize generation of plastic waste, not to litter plastic waste, ensure segregated storage of waste at source and handover segregated waste to local bodies or agencies authorised by the local bodies.",1241,0.9247302055358887

Indian market remained volatile, but rose a little over 9 percent in Samvat 2075. However, the rally may not be over yet.

Experts feel that we are well on track to hit fresh record highs by Diwali 2020 as most of the bad news is priced in.

There are many global and domestic headwinds which the D-Street has to fight it out in the short term for it to break out into unchartered territory. But, the recent fall in the Indian market has made valuations slightly more attractive.

Most experts see Nifty50 hovering in the range of 12,300-13,500 levels in the next one year. The opportunities are likely to remain stock specific; hence, investors should do bottom-up cherry-picking from different sectors.

“The earnings yield of equities is attractive and supportive of high valuations. A bearish outlook on oil and commodities in general also upholds India’s case. The fag-end monsoon onslaught, which fetched an excess to the tune of 110 percent of long-term averages, augurs well for the next Rabi crop,” YES Securities said in a note.

“Our one-year target for Nifty is placed at 12,330, based on 21x multiple to FY21 earnings. Our best-case target stands at 12,915 but with high chances of a steep fall, which may even pull back Nifty to sub-11,000,” it said.

The market is putting a good fight amid bad news from both global, as well as, domestic fronts but most of it is in the prices, feels Atul Suri, Founder & CEO, Marathon Trends in an exclusive interview with CNBC-Tv18. He feel that Nifty may touch 13,500 by Samvat 2076.

Key monitorable to watch out in the next 12 months include the global situation, math of fiscal deficit, Indian Rupee movement (specifically pursuant to any US-China trade war escalation) and ongoing stress in real estate, SMEs and shadow banks.

Although mid and small-cap stocks have remained under pressure in Samvat 2075 but there could be stock-specific opportunities that could come in the next 12 months.

In the next three years, there could be 12-15 percent compounded gains in the market, said market veteran Madhu Kela in a chat with CNBC TV18. Kela said that he prefers midcaps than indices at this juncture as it is more about the quality and cheaper stocks than sectors.

We have collated a list of 10 high-quality stocks from different brokerage firms which investors could look at buying for Samvat 2076:

Brokerage Firm: Yes Securities

HDFC Bank: Buy

Within the Indian financial system, the macro scenario has been playing out in a way that would immensely benefit larger well-governed and well-capitalized private banks having solid outreach and brand equity.

The choking of NBFCs, weaker position and consolidation within PSU Banks and specific issues faced by smaller/regional private banks and co-operative banks would mean a significant shift of incremental business to stronger private banks.

The one bank which we trust to take ‘prudent advantage’ of the given opportunity is HDFC Bank. The bank is set to witness accelerated market share gains, reflected in its resilient loan growth delivery amid a slowing system-wide credit growth.

ICICI Bank: Buy

Over the past four years, ICICI Bank has impressively de-risked and rebalanced its core revenue streams by increasing the contribution of retail loans (61 percent of loans), de-emphasizing on international lending (10 percent), focusing on higher-rated domestic corporate loans, reducing exposure to stressed sectors/borrower groups, substantially increasing the share of low-cost sticky deposits and retailizing the fee income to a large extent.

Along with margins and credit cost, subtle improvement in cost metric through digitization would also be an RoA driver. Stand-alone bank’s RoE would likely reach 15 percent in FY21.

Adjusted for the significant value of its holdings in ICICI Pru Life, ICICI Lombard, ICICI Pru AMC, and I-Sec, the ICICI Bank trades at a valuation of 1.7x FY21 P/ABV. Its capital position is robust with Tier-1 ratio at 15.6 percent.

UltraTech Cement: Buy

Post-acquisition of Century cement assets, the domestic capacity of UltraTech Cements has scaled to ~113.4 MTPA, translating into a volume share of 25 percent vis-à-vis 10 percent in FY05.

Although the demand remains jittery in the near term due to liquidity crunch and slowdown in Govt funding towards infrastructure, we believe the sluggish scenario is transient in nature.

We reckon that massive investments lined up in the infrastructure segment combined with a pick-up in tier 2 and tier 3 housing space will drive growth going ahead.

UltraTech Cement will continue to outperform the industry growth rate on the back of ramp-up of organic capacity and sweating of inorganic assets.

Polycab India: Buy

Polycab is a market leader (12 percent organized market share) in the domestic C&W segment led by its diverse product portfolio, strong distribution network, and high brand recall.

Domestic C&W market is expected to witness 10-12 percent CAGR over FY19-22E on the back of strong power distribution capex, strengthening of current T&D network revival in demand from real estate and adoption of electric vehicles.

In line with its aim to evolve as a large B2C player, the company is constantly investing in new products and new categories in the FMEG space.

Led by strong revenue CAGR of 25 percent over FY19-22E in the FMEG space and execution of large orders over the next two years in the C&W segment, we expect the company to witness a revenue/operating profit of 10.8 percent/9.9 percent CAGR over FY19-22E.

Cochin Shipyard Ltd: Buy

Cochin Shipyard (CSL) has an order book of Rs80.5bn & it is also likely to receive incremental order for IAC Phase III (~Rs103bn) soon. This implies a total order backlog of Rs183.5 (~6x TTM sales) by FY20.

Shipbuilding (SB) is expected to deliver a healthy 21 percent CAGR over FY19-21E. CSL also has a shipbuilding order pipeline of Rs100bn+ comprising next-gen missile vessels, solar research vessels & coastal shipping vessels which are likely to be finalized over FY19-21.

Strong infrastructure capabilities coupled with diverse competencies in the SB & SR segments give CSL a significant edge over peers. With a huge capex planned at Rs30bn over FY18-21E (funded through internal accrual) and superior return profile (average RoEs, RoCEs of 15.5 percent, 16.5 percent, respectively, in FY12-17), we believe CSL is a quality play and is on a strong footing.

Brokerage Firm: Motilal Oswal

State Bank of India: Buy

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal is of the view that State Bank of India (SBI) is well poised for an earnings recovery led by a steady operating performance at the PPOP level, recoveries from NCLT resolutions and normalization in credit cost to 1.9 percent/1.3 percent over FY20E/FY21E.

Hindustan Unilever: Buy

Four key trends point towards an elevated earnings growth trajectory for HUL compared to the past, such as (1) rapidly improving adaptability to market requirements, (2) recognition and strong execution on Naturals, (3) continuous strong trend towards premiumization, and (4) extensive plans to employ technology, creating further entry barriers. Premium valuations are justified as the company has the best earnings growth visibility in the large-cap Indian consumer space, and also, the highest return ratios so far.

Titan Company: Buy

The longer-term investment case remains strong as Titan is well placed to grow led by a combination of its own initiatives and regulatory tailwinds.

With over 60 percent of the jewelry segment growth continuing to come from SSSG, operating margins are also likely to improve.

Ashok Leyland (AL): Buy

Unlike the previous cycles, AL is currently on a strong footing (lean cost structure and net cash balance sheet) and is focused on adding new revenue/profit pools. Valuations are reasonable in view of the downcycle in earnings.

L&T: Buy

For L&T, we forecast adjusted consolidated EPS CAGR of 23 percent over FY19-21. Consolidated RoEs should expand to 17.6 percent by FY21 from 14.6 percent in FY18.

ICICI Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

After two quarters of moderation in volume growth, HUL’s volume growth remained on the slower path at 5%. Net sales increased 6.7% to Rs 9,852 crore while operating margins expanded 293 bps to 24.8% on account of tight control over operating costs in addition to Ind-AS 116 accounting effect. On a comparable basis, margins expanded 200 bps. Led by healthy sales growth, strong margins and lower corporate tax rates, net profit for the quarter grew 21.2% YoY to Rs 1,848 crore. The company has announced an interim dividend of Rs 11/share.

Outlook

However, valuations at 50x FY21E provide little headroom for strong upside. Hence, we maintain our HOLD recommendation with a target price of Rs 2075.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We cut HUVR's FY20 and FY21 EPS by 1.1% and 2.6% despite 5% volume growth and strong margin expansion on account of 1) delayed rural recovery despite good monsoons 2) limited scope to increase margins from current level 3) liquidity issues in trade channels. Though the near term outlook remains cautious, HUVR is well placed to benefit from Rural uptick (favorable rainfall, higher crop prices due to food inflation and benefit of DBT) and structural urban drivers like categories of future (body-wash, hand wash, naturals, premium Home Care, color cosmetics etc.) and strong innovation pipeline in new generation products. Although HUVR is operating at lifetime high margins, agility in price actions, strong brand health and gains from cost efficiencies in supply chain, data analytics and inventory management will keep competition at bay.

Outlook

We estimate 12.4% Adj. PAT CAGR over FY19-22 (12.7% including GSK Merger) and value the stock at 46xFY22 pro-forma EPS (including GSK acquisition) to arrive at a target price of Rs2083 (earlier Rs1967 based on 46xJune21 EPS). Retain Accumulate.

Shares of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) climbed almost 2 percent on BSE in early trade on October 15, a day after the company reported a 21 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit at Rs 1,848 crore for the July-September quarter on the back of better volume growth.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were at Rs 2,443 crore, up 21 percent (16 percent on comparable basis after adjusting for accounting impact of Ind AS 116).

Brokerages have mostly maintained their call on HUL, while some raised the target price. Most of them are also positive on the growth prospects of the FMCG major.

CLSA has maintained an outperform view on the stock, raising the target price to Rs 2,250 from Rs 2,135, saying HUL's Q2 results exceeded on all counts.

""Volume growth of 5 percent mirrors current weakness but is good in the context of the slowdown. We raise earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 1-2 percent on better margins. GSK merger could add at least 6 percent to EPS,"" CLSA said.

Macquarie, too, has an outperform view on the stock. The brokerage raised the target price of HUL to Rs 2,383 from Rs 2,041.

""Volume growth of 5 percent and EBITDA of 14 percent are some of the best operational numbers. The biggest surprise in the company's earnings in the last three years has been margin levers,"" Macquarie said.

The brokerage says the present ecosystem is suitable for HUL to gain market share. Macquarie has raised FY19-22 EPS by 4-6 percent on lower tax.

JP Morgan has a neutral, with a target price of Rs 2,120. It says the company showed in-line operating performance in a tough market environment.

""Premium multiples could hold up, given better performance against most peers,"" JP Morgan said.

Foreign brokerage Jefferies has a hold recommendation on HUL, with a target price of Rs 2,020. While the overall FMCG market has slowed down, led by rural segment, HUL has maintained steady growth, it says.

The brokerage has left the estimates unchanged, saying HUL continues to execute well in a tough macroeconomic environment.

""Margin delivery continued to surprise positively, driven by benign input costs and given limited scope for earning upgrades, we remain on the sidelines,"" Jefferies said.

On the other hand, UBS has a neutral rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,150. It says the risk-reward is unattractive at present valuations.

“We expect EPS upgrades after Horlicks deal. Revenue growth outlook hinged on volume upside from segments that saw pricing action,"" said UBS.

Credit Suisse has maintained a neutral call, with a target price of Rs 2,180. The foreign brokerage says HUL displayed a decent volume growth in a weak macro situation.

""We lower our FY20-22 earnings estimates by 2-4 percent as soap business remains the area of concern,"" Credit Suisse said.

While management commentary on consumption environment is also a concern, the corporate tax cut could lead to more supply chain savings, Credit Suisse added.

Domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a buy recommendation on the stock, with a target price of Rs 2,265.

The brokerage says HUL's revenue was in line, while the margin surprised yet again.

""Once we incorporate the GSKCH merger (final approvals awaited), there could be an 8-9 percent addition to EPS in FY21, which means that the stock is trading at about 45.3 times FY21 against 49.4 times as it appears currently. On a target multiple of 50 times September 21E EPS, we derive a target price of Rs 2,265,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Given best-of-breed earnings visibility and by far highest return ratios, the premium valuations of HUL are justified, it says.

The domestic consumer segment grew by 7 percent with underlying Volume growth at 5 percent.

Reported EBITDA improvement is 310 bps (200 bps on a comparable basis after adjusting for accounting impact of Ind AS 116 on leases), the company claimed.

HUL's numbers meet market expectations on most parameters. Net profit at Rs 1,848 crore is about 3 percent more than CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 1,800 crore.

Revenue at Rs 9,852 crore is higher by a percent of CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 9,750 crore. EBITDA margin came at 24.8 percent against CNBC-TV18 poll of 23.7 percent.

The board of directors have declared an interim dividend of Rs 11 per share for the year ending March 31, 2020.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL), on October 14, is expected to report double digit growth in September quarter earnings driven by strong operating performance. Revenue is likely to increase around 7-8 percent over a year-ago period.

The stock gained 11 percent during the quarter ended September 2019 and rallied 12 percent year-to-date.

Motilal Oswal expects HUL's revenue to grow 7 percent YoY, with underlying domestic volume growth of 6 percent in Q2FY20 against 10 percent growth in Q2FY19 while Kotak sees 8 percent revenue growth in the domestic FMCG business led by 5.5 percent underlying volume growth and 2.5 percent price-led growth.

""On a segmental basis, we bake in 9.5 percent YoY revenue growth for home care, 5.8 percent YoY growth for personal care and 10 percent YoY growth for packaged food and refreshments,"" said Kotak which expects 36 percent growth in adjusted Q2 profit and 21 percent rise in EBITDA.

Operating performance is likely to be supported by lower commodity prices and cost saving measures.

""We expect 270 bps YoY expansion in EBITDA margin aided by gross margin expansion (150 bps), operating efficiencies (20 bps) and adoption of Ind-AS (100 bps). Net profit growth would be much higher owing to effective tax rate (ETR) cut and associated reversal of Q1FY20 taxes; we model 19 percent ETR for Q2FY20 translating into 25.2 percent ETR for first half of FY20,"" Kotak said.

Motilal Oswal expects 150 bps expansion in operating profit margin YoY and 14.4 percent growth in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) while Emkay sees 15.5 percent growth in EBITDA and 202 bps increase in margin compared to year-ago.

- FMCG companies are launching cheaper packs to attract new consumers as a slowdown hurts demand

- Over the past few quarters, brands such as Doritos, Dabur Amla hair oil have all released products in Rs 10 price packs -------------------------------------------------

Indian consumers need little convincing to embrace products at cheaper price points; after all, good things come in small packages.

The nation’s largest household goods makers are introducing cheaper packs — Rs 10 is the popular choice — of products ranging from soaps to chocolates to attract new consumers as an economic slowdown in Asia’s third-largest economy depresses demand.

Over the past few quarters, brands such as Doritos, Dabur Amla hair oil and Babool Ayurvedic toothpaste have all released products in Rs 10 price packs. Lower prices are expected to help companies reach newer consumers, especially as they expand their reach in rural markets. Moreover, with exposure to the internet, even rural shoppers are aspiring to buy premium products, albeit at an affordable price, said top executives at consumer product companies.

“The Rs 10 price point is required because we have to increase consumption. For doing that, we have to increase penetration,” said Mohit Malhotra, Chief Executive of Dabur India. “So, if you look—whether they are economy brands or premium brands, they are all reaching out at that price point.”

In recent quarters, Dabur India has introduced a Real Koolerz drink at Rs 10, and even rolled out its Amla hair oil priced at Rs 10 (30ml). The company recently launched a Rs 10 Babool Ayurvedic toothpaste and is pushing its oral care brands such as Red toothpaste and Babool’s Rs 10 packs as it expands its rural reach.

To be sure, India is a large value market, which means that biscuit packets priced as low as Rs 2 and one-time shampoo sachets priced at Re 1, as well as chips and chocolates at Rs 5 and Rs 10 draw big numbers for companies. This is especially true for categories such as salty snacks, chocolates and biscuits.

However, companies said that over the last two-three years, the Rs 10 price point has been growing at a faster clip. “Small packs and sachets are an important part of our portfolio,” said a spokesperson at Hindustan Unilever that launched a Rs 10 pack of Surf Excel detergent a few years ago. “Such packs allow us to reach first-time users more effectively, introducing our offerings to them. They are particularly useful to drive market development of nascent categories. Apart from this, small packs and sachets allow us to make available quality and aspirational products at affordable prices to consumers.”

In the biscuits category, for instance, Rs 5 and Rs 10 price packs constitute over 60 percent of the overall market.

Parle Products Pvt has seen contribution of Rs 10 packs to sales jump from less than 15 percent a few years ago to almost 25 percent now as it introduces trial packs for some of its premium cookies across rural and urban markets. The Rs 10 pack, said Mayank Shah, Category Head at Parle Products, has been growing at a faster rate over the past two-three years, though Rs 5 packs lead sales for the company.

“Ideally, it makes sense to gradually move the consumer to a price point, which would be convenient for you to cater to as well as affordable for consumers, and Rs 10 fits in very well there,” he said.

For Mondelez India, which sells the country’s largest chocolate brand Cadbury Dairy Milk, the Rs 10 price point for the brand has been growing at a faster pace and has trumped the Rs 5 pack over the last few years. Close to 80 percent of units sold under the chocolates and confectionery category in India fall in the sub-Rs 10 price point.

“For the longest time, the category was heavily dependent on Rs 5,” said Anil Viswanathan, Director of Marketing (Chocolates) at Mondelez India. Today, the Rs 10 Dairy Milk is available in more stores than the Rs 5 pack, he added. However, for some of its other brands such as Perk and Gems, the Rs 5 pack continues to lead growth.

Earlier this year, PepsiCo launched its premium nachos brand Doritos at Rs 10, apart from its Lay’s Maxx, to make it more accessible to urban consumers. Recently, it even launched a Lay’s south Indian chips at that price.

“The Rs 10 pack is growing quite fast for us, in both urban and rural; of course led by urban,” said Dilen Gandhi, Senior Director of Marketing (Foods Category) at PepsiCo India. “It is a more sustainable price point from a manufacturing standpoint, and overall consumer affordability is increasing; it is also partly driven by the fact that a lot of innovations are coming at Rs 10.”

For wholesale retailer Metro Cash and Carry, the Rs 10 price pack has seen a 150 percent jump in sales on an annual basis in May. “The Rs 10 is a very attractive price point, which allows for easy distribution and penetration into the market,” said a company spokesperson.",848,0.4978901594877243

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We upgrade HUVR from HOLD to Accumulate given that HUVR should emerge as one of the biggest gainers from Govt's social push aimed at bottom end of pyramid and increase in rural purchasing power on improved monsoons and food inflation. Although 2Q outlook remains uncertain, We remain structurally positive on HUVR led by 1) expansion in categories of future by launching liquid detergent in Sunlight 2) increased thrust on naturals with launch of Lux botanicals and Pears Naturale, two variants in Sunsilk and FAL Ayurveda facewash and facial kits 3) sustained Premiumisation in Home Care 4) synergy gains from acquisition of Glaxo Consumer healthcare and 5) sustained gains (70bps in 1QFy20) from cost efficiencies in supply chain, data analytics and inventory management.

Outlook

We estimate FY21 pro-forma EPS including GSK acquisition of Rs38.3 and value the stock at 46xJune21 arriving at target price of Rs1816. We strongly advise Accumulating HUL in uncertain markets.

ICICI Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported a moderation in volume growth to 5% after reporting strong volumes in the last six quarters. Net sales increased 6.6% to Rs 10114 crore while operating margins reported 244 bps expansion to 26.2% mainly due to changes in Ind-As 116. On a comparable basis, margins expanded 150 bps. Advertisement & promotions (A&P) spend remained flat during the quarter mainly due to lower competitive intensity (across channels except MT). The home care & foods segment witnessed a healthy 10% & 8% growth, respectively. Beauty & personal care segment reported muted 4% growth largely impacted by the dismal performance of soaps segment.

Outlook

However, valuations at 50x FY21E provide little headroom for strong upside. Hence, we maintain our HOLD rating with a target price of Rs 1900.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR's net sales grew 6.6% YoY to INR101b (v/s est. of INR102b). EBITDA of INR26.5b was up 17.6% YoY (13% on comparable basis after adjusting for Ind- AS 116; v/s est. of 8.7% to INR24.5b), while PAT (bei) was up 11.7% YoY to INR17.5b (v/s est. of INR17.4b). Domestic consumer business sales were up 7% YoY led by underlying volume growth of 5% YoY (v/s est. of 5%).

Outlook

We believe the premium valuations are justified as the company has the best earnings growth visibility in the large-cap Indian consumer space, and also, the highest return ratios so far. On a target multiple of 48x Jun'21 EPS, we derive a TP of INR1,970, with 16% upside.

Dolat Capital's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s volume grew +5% YoY and operational results were in line with our estimate. We are positive about this as (1) the base was unfavorable (+12%) and (2) the industry, across categories, is experiencing a slowdown. We expect the volume growth to remain in mid-single digit, due to an unfavorable base in next few quarters. Even a 6%+ volume growth is a positive, given HUL’s size. In addition, the GM and EBITDA margin rise on an unfavourable base (highest Q1 EBITDAM in 10 years+), indicates that margins have not peaked yet, and it may continue to gain from operating efficiency. However, lower rural growth (1x urban) remains a concern. In addition, moderation in demand is likely to pressurize volume growth in H1FY20. Nevertheless, HUL is likely to benefit from the expected rise in the government’s rural expenditure (farm loan waiver, rural stimulus, etc.).

Outlook

We maintain our FY20E and FY21E EPS at ` 33.5 and `37.4 and TP of `1,877 (50x FY21E). Maintain Accumulate.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever is scheduled to release its Q1 earnings on July 23.

According to brokerage estimates, the profit may growt more than 10 percent in Q1, and revenue growth could be in the range of 7-10 percent YoY on the back of around 6 percent volume growth in June quarter despite expected slowdown in rural demand. This along with cost-saving measures and operating leverage could boost operating income and profit.

The volume growth in June quarter last year was 12 percent and in March quarter it was 7 percent. Considering weak rural demand, 6 percent is satisfactory, brokerages said.

""We expect HUL to post 9.7 percent YoY sales growth mainly driven by 6 percent volume growth across categories as its shift towards natural products and increasing premiumisation trend is yielding results, helping it to maintain the growth trajectory,"" ICICI direct said.

While expecting 11 percent growth in adjusted profit, Kotak said, ""We model 9 percent revenue growth in domestic FMCG business, led by 6 percent underlying volume growth and 3 percent price-led growth. On a segmental basis, we bake in 11.5 percent YoY revenue growth for home care and 7 percent YoY growth for personal care.""

After not building impact of Ind-AS 116, the brokerage expects EBITDA margin to expand 50 bps YoY aided by operating cost efficiencies (including advertising & sales promotion spends).

Key issues to watch for would be comments on consumer demand environment, pace of rural growth, competitive intensity especially in detergents, performance of Lever Ayush, overall volume growth and Provision towards restructuring and few contested matters, and gross and EBITDA margin considering volatility in crude.",281,0.7305671274662018

Consumer goods major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has created a full-fledged end-to-end digital transformation programme that will redefine the ways of working going forward.

Currently, over 80 experiments are underway to accelerate the company's journey on digital transformation, HUL told the shareholders on June 29.

The company has set up a digital council comprising a cross-functional team of leaders, for its 'Reimagining HUL'.

""With the world changing at a furious pace, we are continually adapting to remain future-fit. We will continue to leverage Unilever's global knowledge and our deep local understanding to serve our consumers better be it through path-breaking innovations or our expertise in new channels,"" said chairman and managing director Sanjiv Mehta said in his address to theshareholders at the 86th AGM.

On the FMCG sector, Mehta said faster economic growth and technological changes provide an exciting future for the industry.

""Despite being one of the fastest growing markets globally for FMCG products in recent times, the per capita FMCG consumption spend in our country is still amongst the lowest in the world, giving the sector a long runway for growth.

""Key factors like rising affluence, changing family structures, emerging new large cities and a young working population will positively impact the growth of the industry,"" he said.

He noted that if the countrycan bend the growth curve and deliver a consistent growth rate of 9 percent and above, it could transform into a USD 10 trillion economy by 2032.

On the rapidly evolving technology and its use at workplaces, Mehta said, ""Re-skilling of our workforce will become a national priority. Machines will augment human cognition and it will be imperative for companies to optimally leverage human talent and machines at the same time"".

He noted that HUL's focus is on reimagining itself from the lens of portfolio, organisation, capabilities and culture.

""We are clear that we do not want to simply follow, we will lead the change,"" he underlined.

""At HUL, we are creating a culture that embraces diversity, inclusiveness, and our founders mindset and experimentation.

""We have a five-pronged strategy to continue to thrivedrive purpose into our brands and enhance societal impact, build a future-fit organisation, nurture talent in the new age, innovate for the future, and reimagine the business across the value chain by leveraging data and technology,"" he concluded.",390,0.9807486161589622

Shareholders of Hindustan Unilever enjoyed substantial growth in their investment as the share price of the company more than doubled in the past three years.

The scrip rose 106.4 percent from Rs 859.80 on June 27, 2016, to Rs 1774.75, on the same day of 2019. In comparison, the BSE Sensex rose 50 percent during the same period while the Nifty50 soared 46 percent.

Let's put the surge in HUL's share price in perspective. Your investment of Rs 10,000 in the company three years ago would be now worth Rs 20,640.

Analysts at Motilal Oswal expect the stock to rally further to reach Rs 2,070 on multiple moats such as rapidly improving adaptability to market requirements, recognition and strong execution on Naturals and other evolving categories, continuous strong premiumisation trend and extensive use of technology, creating further entry barriers.

The company witnessed a growth spurt in FY19 as domestic volume growth improved to 10 percent, from 6 percent in FY18. According to analysts, HUL stuck to its strategy of growing the core, evolving the portfolio through innovation as well as market development, and developing new channels.

Meanwhile, the operating margin (OPM) of the company inched up to 23 percent, which is in line with the global group strategy of sustained improvement in profitability.

""Revenue continues to outgrow volumes, suggesting a combination of price growth, superior product mix and premiumisation,"" said Edelweiss in a report.

""FY19 was operationally one of the strongest financial years for HUL, with revenue growing by 12 percent and profit after tax (PAT) rising by 17.3 percent YoY,"" said analysts at BNP Paribas.

BNP Paribas expects the acquisition of GSK Consumer to boost growth prospects of the company’s food business and added that better monsoons along with re-defined government policies will improve the agricultural economy and help demand getting back on track in H2 FY20.

Edelweiss, in its report, said the 51 percent rise in FY19's contingent consideration, which depends on Indulekha’s revenue, suggests an impressive performance by the brand.

""This instils confidence that HUL will be able to leverage the benefits from its other acquisitions, viz Adityaa Milk and GSK Consumer Healthcare,"" said Edelweiss.

According to Edelweiss, the acquisition of Adityaa Milk will enable HUL to pilot low-cost business models and enhance its ice creams supply chain and ‘go to market’ capabilities. Meanwhile, the acquisition of GSK Consumer India will help the company in building a sustainable and profitable foods and refreshment business in India by leveraging the mega trend of health and wellness.

HUL is also planning to launch an all natural line of products across multiple categories such as oral care, haircare, skin care, skin cleansing among others, which shows the company's willingness to adhere to market expectations of healthier alternatives.

With disruptive events such as demonetisation and implementation of GST behind them, Edelweiss expects the earnings growth to continue despite macroeconomic headwinds, particularly rural distress that has affected consumer sentiment.

""Rural, which has been logging 1.3–1.5x urban growth in recent times, slowed to 1.1x in Q4 FY19. Hence, the first quarter of FY20 might be particularly tough, with rural India still dealing with the slowdown. That said, volume growth thereafter should perk up,"" said Edelweiss.

HUL also boasts of one of the strongest working capital management frameworks as the net working capital cycle stayed negative at 119 days, aided by strong supply chain management and better relationships with traders and distributors, said BNP Paribas.

""Return ratios continue to improve and remained robust. RoE (return on equity) and RoCE (return on capital employed) stood at 84 percent and 113 percent, respectively, in FY19 as against 104 percent and 78 percent, respectively, in FY18. A strong improvement in return ratios was mainly led by a steady rise in operating margin (OPM), which expanded by 200 bps to 22.6 percent in FY19,"" said the brokerage.

Furthermore, cash generated from operations increased by Rs 1,660 crore to Rs 8,413 crore in the past two years.

""Strong cash generation ability helped HUL continue paying robust dividends (this stood at 90 percent in FY2019). Dividend per share stood at Rs 22 in FY19 as against Rs 17 in FY17,"" added BNP Paribas.

The stock of Hindustan Unilever last closed at Rs 1,774.95 on June 27.

Highlights:

- The music video titled 'Ab Teri Baari' features actor Ayushmann Khurrana and rap star Naezy who are performing the song- The video also features Sunil Chhetri, Dharmesh Yelande, YouTube sensation ‘BeYouNick’ and actor Shashank Arora

-------------------------------------------------

‘Be a man’, a casual phrase, often thrown at young men forcing them to comply with the society’s traditional rules of masculinity clearly shows that stereotyping is not gender dependent. To break socially accepted notions of masculinity such as men shouldn’t show emotions or always sport a macho look, Hindustan Unilever-owned deodorant brand Axe has launched a new campaign with the country's top influencers across industries.

Created in collaboration with digital platform Arre and media agency Mindshare, the music video titled 'Ab Teri Baari' features actor Ayushmann Khurrana and rap star Naezy who are performing the song, co-written by them. Composed by Clinton Cerejo, the music video brings alive the personal stories of Indian football captain Sunil Chhetri, dance superstar Dharmesh Yelande, YouTube sensation ‘BeYouNick’ and Made in Heaven Amazon original series actor Shashank Arora.

The song is a strong call for Indian men to stop worrying about the rules of society and the dreaded ‘Log kya kahenge’ (what will people say) and instead focus on finding what makes them unique. Built around Axe’s brand purpose of inspiring men to express their individuality and becoming their most attractive selves, the song mirrors the brand’s communication platform of ‘Make your own rules'.

Talking about the concept, Nippun Aneja, General Manager - Deodorants and Men’s Grooming, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) said, “Many boys in India still feel an overwhelming pressure to conform to masculine stereotypes. There are many said and unsaid rules on how to ‘Be a Man’ - the way you look, act and interact with your peers; even your career choices and hobbies are being judged through the lens of being ‘masculine enough’. We want young men to feel free from the pressures of these ‘rules’, discover what makes them unique and work on it. Axe believes that expressing your individuality is what makes a man attractive, so go ahead ‘Make Your Own Rules’ and be the best version of yourself.""

The digital campaign will be promoted across social media as well as digital platforms.

Ajay Mehta, Vice-President, Content+, Mindshare, said, “Axe has always been an iconic youth brand with communication deep rooted in the pop culture. The idea was to use music and more importantly hip-hop as a genre which has been recently quite popular among the younger audiences. While Ayushmann and Naezy have lent their voice, the music video features some of the top influencers who not only resonate with the brand but are real-life examples. Each of them have a unique story to tell which brings alive the brand’s narrative in a compelling manner. It’s a light-hearted piece of content which is fun, catchy yet inspiring.""

Often synonymous with sexist advertising, male grooming category, dominated by deodorants, is taking baby steps to talk about equality and respect. Axe, which has once relied heavily on ads which made men wildly popular among women often dressed in skimpy clothes, is changing the way it pushes the brand to consumers, adding larger purpose.

In 2018, male grooming brand Brylcreem range, co-created by HUL and Amazon India, urged young men to change their mindset and become more respectful towards others. The campaign featured actor Siddharth Malhotra.

In 2016, Emami-owned deodorant brand ‘HE’ called out various sexist deodorant ads in its campaign featuring comedian Vir Das.

While heavily sexist advertising in the deodorant category is on a decline, brands such as Marico-owned Set Wet and Vini Cosmetics' Fogg play around light-hearted teasing and wooing of one's love interest.",623,0.49071572721004486

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL's Annual Investor Meet reinforced our positive stance on long term growth potential and business strategy of the company. HUL continues to ride on twin engines of new category creation and innovation in existing segments to remain ahead of the competition. We believe sustained investment in categories like Liquid Detergents, face wash, Hand wash, Coffee, Body Lotion hair conditioners and soups etc. will create long term drivers given higher market share, strong right to win and technology and brand head start over competition. We believe HUL's Premiumisation drive in key categories like Laundry, personal wash and Cosmetics will go a long way in increasing growth given presence of huge mass segment in these categories.

Outlook

We estimate pro-forma EPS (including GSK acquisition) of Rs38.2 for FY21 and value the stock at 46x thus arriving at target price of Rs1764. We expect back ended returns given lifetime high valuations. Hold.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever sees stable demand in this fiscal helped by government initiatives such as increases in minimum support prices but the challenge of an expected below-normal monsoon will have to be navigated.

Besides, the company expects premiumisation of products to continue in FMCG helped by ""secular trends of young population, growing affluence, rising urbanisation and burgeoning digital connectivity"", which would enhance spending patterns of consumers, the company said in the outlook of its Annual Report for FY2018-19.

""The demand trends in the markets is stable and the government initiatives such as increases to Minimum Support Price (MSP), provision of health insurance, direct income distribution etc will lend further impetus to the rural economy,"" said HUL Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Mehta.

However, he has also raised concerns over several challenges as rising commodity prices, a below-normal monsoon this year, which may impact the rural and semi-urban demand.

""Commodity inflation, potential disruptions due to global events and a below normal monsoon this year are possible headwinds which the business will need to navigate with caution,"" Mehta said.

According to him, the FMCG markets continue to offer sizeable headroom for growth by increasing consumption and penetration and HUL is well placed to leverage this opportunity.

""Your Company's strategy to lead premiumisation, market development, build channels of the future whilst keeping the sustainable living plan at its core, will enable it to create long-term value for all stakeholders,"" said Mehta adding that HUL ""will continue to focus on being Purpose-led and Future fit.""

Over the performance of FY 2017-18, Mehta said HUL's domestic consumer business grew by 12 per cent with 10 per cent underlying volume growth.

""We delivered over Rs 8,500 crore of EBITDA, our EBITDA margins are at its highest ever at 22.9 per cent and our profit crossed the Rs 6,000 crore mark for the first time,"" he said.

In FY 2018-19, ended on March 31, HUL reported a revenue of Rs 38,224 crore.

""Profit after tax before exceptional items, PAT, grew by 18 per cent to Rs 6,080 crore and Net Profit at Rs 6,036 crores was up by 15 per cent,"" he added.",367,0.5997909545898438

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We cut our EPS estimates for FY20-21 by 4.4-5.7% due to 1) likely impact of moderation in demand in 1HFY20 2) lower margin expansion of 80bps over FY19-21 versus 360bps over FY17-19 and 3) 100bps higher tax rate. Although 4Q volume growth has moderated to 7%, we believe that it is temporary given expectations of normal monsoons and benefit of PM Kisan Yojana to farmers in due course. We remain positive on HUVR given 1) sustained Premiumisation in Home Care, 2) success in naturals led by Lever Ayush, Indulekha and variants across brands 3) strong growth in emerging categories (premium laundry, hand wash, Liquid dish wash, Hair conditioner, Face-wash and Green tea) 4) synergy gains from acquisition of Glaxo Consumer healthcare in distribution and costs and 5) gains from supply chain, data analytics and efficient inventory management.

ICICI Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported a healthy set of numbers with revenue growth of 9.3% YoY on the back of 7% volume growth. Volume growth moderated on a high base, after delivering five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. Operating margins expanded 83 bps YoY to 23.3% well supported by a 63 bps decline in marketing expenses to sales, 35 bps reduction in employee expenses to sales and 11 bps decline in other overheads to sales, partly offset by a 27 bps increase in material costs to sales. Led by healthy sales growth and strong margins, net profit for the quarter grew 13.8% YoY to Rs 1,538 crore.

Outlook

We estimate HUL will report revenue, PAT CAGR of 14%, 16.3%, respectively, in FY19-21E. Though HUL-GSKCH merger would bring in significant synergy benefits, valuations at 50x FY21E provide little headroom for strong upside. Hence, we maintain our HOLD recommendation with a target price of Rs 1900.

Dolat Capital's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s volume growth (+7%) and operational results were in line with our estimate. We are positive about this as (1) the base was unfavorable (+11%) and (2) the industry, across categories, is experiencing a slowdown. We expect the volume growth to remain in high single digit, due to an unfavorable base in the next few quarters. Even a 6%+ volume growth is a positive, given the size of the company. In addition, the GM and EBITDA margin increase on an unfavourable base (highest Q4 EBITDAM in 10 years+), indicate that margins have not reached a peak as yet, and HUL is likely to continue to gain from operating efficiencies. However, lower rural growth (1x urban) is a concern. Nevertheless, HUL is likely to benefit from the expected rise in the government’s rural expenditure (farm loan waver, etc.).

Outlook

We maintain our FY20E and FY21E EPS at ` 33.5 and `37.4 and TP of `1,877. (50x FY21E). Maintain Accumulate.

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

For the quarter, revenue grew by 9.3% y-o-y with a volume growth of 7% led by innovations and better revenue mix. Gross margin stood at 53.9% and operating profit grew by 13.3% y-o-y, with OPM standing at 23.3%. Domestic business volume growth will stand at high single digit in the coming quarters; margin expansion would sustain. We have marginally reduced our earnings estimates by 2.3%/1.6% for FY2020/21 to factor in lower than earlier expected revenue growth.

Highlights:

- Volume-led growth with strong performance in home care

- Rural demand moderates to 1.1 times from 1.3 times that of urban

- Mass brands - Lifebuoy and Lux – impacted; seasonality benefits ice cream and skin category

- In Naturals, focus shifts to south; oral care performance stabilising

- Key positives - strong agility in supply chain and product innovation

- Recent M&A integration remains a key watch

-------------------------------------------------

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) delivered volume-led growth in Q4 FY19 amid challenges like moderation in rural demand and oil price volatility.

Key positivesDomestic sales growth of nine percent year-on-year (YoY) was aided by a seven percent volume growth on a relatively high base of 11 percent in Q4 FY18. While volume growth moderated in line with sectoral trends, the company’s outperformance versus peers merits attention.

FMCG volume growth Source: Moneycontrol Research, Company

Divisional performance Source: Moneycontrol Research, Company

Home care segment (35 percent of Q4 sales) saw another quarter of double-digit growth, led by performance in household care (Vim and Domex) and premiumisation trend in the fabric wash category. Strong performance was witnessed in food and refreshment (19 percent of sales), backed by seasonality and new launches in ice cream category. In fact, this category already seems to be reaping the benefits of the integration of Aditya Milk in terms of innovations.

EBITDA margin (up 90 bps YoY) improved on account of lower advertising and employee cost (as a percentage of sales) and cost rationalisation partially offsetting lower gross margin. Operating margin improvement was seen in all segments.

Key negativesContraction at the gross margin level reflects impact of higher crude oil linked cost in the quarter gone by. Raw material price volatility in the home care segment remains a key factor to watch out for. However, benign cost inflation in other segments (barring tea category) is comforting. In the case of tea, a new crop in June/July would be crucial in determining the demand-supply balance.

Personal care segment (44 percent of sales) witnessed a sharper moderation in growth due to weak performance by mass brands such as Lifebuoy and Lux. Deodorants was another category where the company faced high competitive intensity. Better performance in skin care was not a surprise as the category continued to do well on account of longer winter in north India.

The most important takeaway from the analyst conference call was moderation in rural demand, which is now 1.1 times urban demand from 1.3 times earlier. Moderation in the rural-urban growth gap is similar to that assessed by Dabur. The management cautioned about further moderation unless the new government takes measures to perk up demand.

Other observationsThe oral care segment continues to witness better performance on account of pricing and promotional strategy. The management sees a better-than-market performance for brands -- Closeup and Lever Ayush -- implying marginal market share gains. However, Pepsodent remains a weak spot. It is difficult to say if the company is out of woods in terms of competitive intensity (Dabur, Patanjali Ayurved and Colgate-Palmolive India), but its market performance appears to have stabilised for now.

In case of Naturals, the company has focused its attention to south India, where there is higher acceptability for ayurveda-based products. At present, there is a tactical retreat from the northern and central India with respect to Ayush brand in terms of product placement and promotion. The management said its ayurvedic hair oil, Indulekha, has seen exceptional performance and is now an around Rs 400 crore brand (up four times since its acquisition in 2015).

OutlookSeen in the context of near-term challenges (rural demand and oil led cost inflation), HUL’s performance is noteworthy. Since the rollout of GST, the management has tweaked its supply chain and increased product innovation. This has helped it in operating during difficult market situations like the one we are facing at present. The additional lever which has helped the company is its investment behind brands and visibility.

We also remain positive on the company’s recent M&A deals and feel its emphasis on the food and refreshments business could be the next strategic growth lever. However, there would be a gestation period of four-to-five quarters before reasonable synergistic benefits accrue.

As far as the stock is concerned, investors should use the current consolidation phase as an opportunity to accumulate on dips.

The HUL stock currently trades close to 41 times its FY21 estimated price-to-earnings after including benefits arising from the GSK Consumer Healthcare India deal. Regulatory approval on the merger is expected by December. We expect the company’s premium valuation to sustain as it factors in innovation profile, limited volatility in earnings and strong execution capability.

At the current level, the market has priced in most of the positives but good corporate earnings could help the market inch higher. Key concerns will be the sustainability of the FII inflow at current valuations and sustained recovery in corporate earnings. Change in the political environment could pose challenges for our market, said Rajeev Srivastava, Head Retail Broking, Reliance Securities in an interview to Moneycontrol's Sunil Shankar Matkar.

Edited excerpts:

Q: Nifty has rallied from 10,600 to 11,760, how do you position yourself in the market at current levels?

A: The market has rallied based on favourable opinion polls and cut in interest rate. The inflation environment has been quite benign and another round of interest cut cannot be ruled out. We believe the market will focus on corporate earnings as we enter the results season. Banking will continue to be the key focus sector with good credit growth and stable yields.

Q: According to you, what is fueling the ongoing rally?

A: This has largely been a pre-election rally with the expectation that the incumbent government will retain power. Further, conducive FII inflow mainly in the form of ETFs in pursuit of better yields with a stable rupee supported the rally.

At the current level, the market has priced in most of the positives but good corporate earnings could help the market inch higher. Our key concerns will be the sustainability of the FII inflow at current valuations and sustained recovery in corporate earnings. Change in the political environment could pose challenges for our market.

Q: What is your earnings forecast for FY20?

A: Nifty earnings are expected to increase in double-digit in the range of 15-18 percent, which is reasonable on the backdrop of low base and visible improvement asset quality ratio of BFSIs, which commands around 39 percent weight. We believe banking, infrastructure, cement and consumer should do well.

Q: Sensex surged 4,000 points in past six weeks. Is it the right time to buy stocks?

A: There has never been dearth of quality and alpha-generating stocks in the market irrespective of cycles. Hence, investors may still invest in quality stocks.

Q: What is your take on banking and financial stocks that have been front-runners in the rally?

A: The sector has outperformed in the recent past despite headwinds including sluggish capex cycle, delay in corporate recoveries and challenges in deposit growth, leaving little margin of safety given the strong upside. We prefer large banks with strong liability franchise and adequate provisioning levels.

Q: What are your top five picks for FY20?

A: Larsen & Toubro

L&T continues to remain one of the prime beneficiaries of the up-tick in capex in India. It is well-placed in the focused sectors like defence, road, railways and power T&D. We believe the company is well-placed to benefit from several big-ticket projects, as it satisfies all basic requirements from balance-sheet size, strong track record, technical expertise and adequate liquidity to bid for such projects.

ICICI Bank

We believe ICICI Bank’s liability and asset franchise has strengthened over the years with de-risking of its loan portfolio, rising market share in CASA, increased competitiveness in cost of funds relating to peers and improving capital efficiencies. We expect its RoEs to expand to 14 percent by FY20E and 15 percent by FY21E from 4 percent in FY19E, driven by improvement in margin and decline in credit cost.

Hindustan Unilever

HUL is expected to witness the fastest earnings growth among the major FMCG companies. It is estimated to register earnings CAGR of 23 percent over FY19-21 driven by both organic and inorganic initiatives. Acquisition of GSK Consumer’s India business provides HUL a strong foothold in the foods segment in terms of diversifying its portfolio and reducing dependence on homecare and personal care segments.

JK Cement

Healthy demand environment in its key markets including northern region and likely improvement in realisations in the northern region are expected to aid the company’s performance. Its value-added products continue to remain cash cow and ensure better return ratios. We expect its grey cement business to improve following commissioning of new kiln at Mangrol, which may warrant a further re-rating of the stock.

Sonata Software

We like Sonata’s differentiated business model, focus on IP and platforms, high dividend yield, quality balance sheet, high RoE and no equity dilution for the past several years. Given its platform focus, investments made in IP and S&M, decent cash generation and reasonable valuation, coupled with healthy growth (19.6 percent EPS CAGR over FY18-FY20E), we believe there exists legroom for further upside, notwithstanding strong stock performance over the past year.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We spoke to the management of Hindustan Unilever (HUL) for an update on the overall market conditions. Key takeaways: A small short-term blip was seen in 4QFY19 demand. But, we had already built in 8% volume growth for 4QFY19 v/s double-digit growth of the preceding five quarters. Measures announced in the budget are expected to benefit demand from 1QFY20 onwards. We see no immediate threat to our FY20 forecast of 7.5% volume growth. We believe HUVR will continue to outperform peers over the medium term. Material cost outlook remains benign, ad spends & promotion intensity have not picked up erratically and cost savings continue at the targeted pace.

Outlook

We maintain BUY rating on the stock with a target price of INR2,125, target multiple of 52x FY2021 EPS (which is ~15% premium to 3-year average due to significantly improving business fundamentals).

Nitin Paranjpe, 56, who heads Unilever’s foods and refreshments business, has been elevated as Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Unilever, world's second-largest consumer goods company. He is the second Indian after Harish Manwani to make it to the global post.

From 2008 to 2013, Paranjpe was Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer at Hindustan Unilever (HUL), before he became President of Unilever’s foods and refreshments division.

Man of Transformation

Paranjpe is known in the domestic corporate world for navigating India’s largest FMCG company HUL through the tough times of the global economic crisis.

He was appointed as Chief Executive Officer of Hindustan Unilever, India and Executive Vice President for the South Asia cluster in 2008.

Having taken the helm of HUL in April 2008 at about the same time the global financial crisis starting shaping up, Paranjpe led India’s largest consumer packaged goods company on an aggressive growth charge over the last five years despite a tough macroeconomic environment.

From 2008-2013, the net profit grew from Rs 2,504.51 crore (for the 15-month period ending March 31, 2009) to Rs 3,828.98 crore in FY13. The period considered is 15 months because until 2007 HUL followed the calendar year for reporting yearly figures. Starting in 2010, the company began disclosing numbers on a financial year basis.

For HUL, sales in those five years grew at 5.71 percent on a compounded annual growth rate basis from Rs 20,457.95 crore to Rs 27,003.99 crore. In comparison, its peers such as Dabur, Emami and Marico fared far better (21.2/22.4/19.2 percent sales CAGR from FY08 to FY13, respectively), albeit on a significantly lower revenue base.

Between 2013 to 2017, he was the president of Unilever's Home Care business and joined the Unilever Leadership Executive. Figures for home care business are not available for FY13 since the company did not disclose it. For this segment, HUL began reporting numbers only from FY17.

He was appointed as President of Unilever's foods and refreshment business and member of the Unilever Leadership Executive January 1, 2018. Revenues from the foods and refreshment segment stood at Rs 6,925 crore from January – December 2018, up 10.3 percent during the same period in 2017.

Under his leadership, HUL acquired GSK Consumer in December 2018. By virtue of the deal, the Horlicks brand came under HUL’s umbrella, thereby enabling it to strengthen its positioning in the healthy food drinks segment. Foods & Refreshment (F&R) division constituted 18.4 percent of HUL’s net sales for 9M FY19. With this merger, F&R revenues are likely to scale up to more than Rs 11,000 crore, which will be approximately 28 percent of HUL’s post-merger sales.

Unilever’s new bet signifies the trust that the company has in Paranjpe.

""Today’s increasingly fragmented consumer, channel and media environment requires us to operate with more speed and agility than ever before. With his deep knowledge and experience of our markets, Nitin is ideally placed to work with me and the Unilever Leadership Executive to drive our performance and help deliver our growth ambitions,” said Unilever CEO Alan Jope in a statement to the exchanges

Journey with Unilever, HUL

Paranjpe joined Unilever in 1987, as a management trainee in its Indian subsidiary. In his early years, he performed different roles across marketing and customer development.

Subsequently, he moved to London to work as Assistant to the Unilever Chairman and then returned to lead the Laundry and Household Care categories in India before joining the management committee of the Indian business in 2006 as head of the Home and Personal Care business.

Paranjpe has a degree in mechanical engineering and an MBA in marketing from the Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai.

He is a member of the nomination and remuneration committee, stakeholder relationship committee and corporate social responsibility committee of HUL.",640,0.9868163108825684

Hindustan Unilever shares declined more than 2 percent in morning trade on Friday after the management rejig, but global brokerage house CLSA remained bullish on the stock.

The stock was quoting at Rs 1,697.40, down Rs 39.95, or 2.30 percent on the BSE, at 11:36 hours IST.

The FMCG major, on March 14, has elevated HUL Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Mehta as the President of Unilever South Asia with effect from May 1, 2019.

Mehta would also continue as the Chairman and Managing Director of Hindustan Unilever. As part of the new role, he would also become a member of the Unilever Leadership Executive (ULE).

Unilever also announced appointment of Nitin Paranjpe, President, Foods & Refreshment, as the Chief Operating Officer.

He will be responsible for all of Unilever's go-to-market organisations, driving and co-ordinating in-year performance across our countries in line with company's divisional strategies.

Hanneke Faber, currently President, Europe, has been appointed as the President, Foods & Refreshment.

Kees Kruythoff, President, Home Care, has decided to leave Unilever after 27 years of service to pursue external opportunities, the company said.

Peter ter Kulve, Chief Digital Officer and EVP South East Asia & Australasia (SEAA), has been appointed President, Home Care.

While maintaining outperform call on the stock with a price target at Rs 2,010 (implying a 16 percent potential upside), CLSA said Q4FY19 is an important quarter for Indian staples to gauge consumption trends.

The research house said as input price trend remains benign and medium-term guidance on modest margin expansion stays, premium Valuations will likely sustain.

Deutsche Bank also remained positive on the stock with a buy call and price target at Rs 2,100 apiece as it expects company to report volume growth of 7.5 percent in Q4 YoY.

It expects sales/EBITDA / PAT growth of 11/15/16 percent for Q4.

""Rural growth is still higher than urban growth, but moderated to 1.2x urban growth,"" it said.

Initially this week, Reliance Securities initiated coverage on Hindustan Unilever with a buy recommendation and a target price of Rs 2,000.

Looking ahead, it expects HUL to witness the fastest earnings growth among the major FMCG companies, notwithstanding the size and scale of operations.

""HUL is expected to register earnings CAGR of 23 percent over FY19-21 driven by both organic and inorganic initiatives. Acquisition of GSK Consumer’s India business provides HUL a strong foothold in the foods segment in terms of diversifying its portfolio and reducing dependence on homecare and personal care segments,"" it said.

At CMP, the stock trades at a premium valuation multiple of 50x FY20E earnings, which it believes to sustain owing to strong growth visibility.

Hindustan Unilever shares gained a percent on March 12 after Reliance Securities initiated coverage with a buy call on the stock, citing premiumisation and improving operational performance.

The brokerage said premiumisation has always been HUL's long-term strategy, as mass-market products are impacted by vagaries of market-owing to lower pricing power.

The key premium brands like Surf, Dove and Lipton clocked 11 percent, 14 percent and 18 percent CAGR, respectively, over the last six years significantly outpacing their respective category growth.

-------------------------------------------------

Strong volume growth trajectory and rural contributionDabur’s domestic business (72 percent of sales) growth continues to benefit from broad-based volume growth. In the December quarter, sales were helped by 12.4 percent YoY volume growth, coming on top of a growth of 13 percent in the year ago period. Its performance was similar to that of market leader Hindustan Unilever. The effect of price change contributed 2.5 percent to sales growth, which was also higher than in earlier quarters.

Rural growth continues to be healthy. Rural growth in the general trade channel remains ahead of urban growth, with a gap of 3-4 percentage points. Adjusting for modern trade, rural growth is still ahead of urban markets by about 2 percent. The management expects high single-digit volume growth should continue, which can increase to double digits if the government’s rural policy measures materialise.

Naturals are a formidable defenceCompetitive intensity has decreased in some categories in the past few quarters, where Patanjali was a core challenger. In healthcare (36 percent of sales), Dabur's sales rose by 16 percent, led by double-digit growth in Chyawanprash and honey. In fact, sales of health supplements, as per our estimates, are past their historic peak level of sales suggesting a recouping of market share loss to a great extent.

Personal care growth was driven by a number of categoriesHome and personal care segment (47 percent of sales) grew well by 16.3 percent YoY (Q3 FY19) aided by hair oil market share gains and a stellar showing in shampoos. Over the past few quarters, there has been a strong performance across categories and not just in oral care. The two-year CAGR of these categories – hair, skin, oral care- are in mid to high teens. Hair care stands out as a category that has made a good comeback over a longer timeframe.

Within oral care, Red Toothpaste sales (two-thirds of toothpaste category) continued to show a strong growth momentum. The last three to four years was a phase in which Patanjali Ayurved's aggressive strategy led to growth in the naturals category. Dabur gained market share from HUL and Colgate.

However, low-priced Babool continued to face high competitive intensity. Takeaways from Colgate results also suggest margin pressure for low grammage/low priced packs. Going forward, a new toothpaste launch on the naturals platform is awaited.

Beverages division gives some cause for concernThe beverages segment (foods category constitute 22 percent of sales) has been affected by high competitive intensity, which is being countered by giving trade offers and new products. Beverages grew by 11.5 percent, lower than expected, due to severe winter in Northern India and higher trade promotions by competitors. The company expects a sequential improvement but margins may get affected.

On international business and input costsThe international business (28 percent of sale), with constant currency growth of 1 percent YoY, was affected by currency movement and weak performance in the MENA region. There were weak sales in Europe due to pricing issues with distributors.

Another sore point was weaker gross margins (decline of 126 bps YoY for the India business). However, management expects a sequential improvement in margins, despite higher advertising expenses as input prices have softened in the current quarter.

Stock outlookWe remain constructive on the stock. The intertwined factors of distribution reach (direct reach of one million outlets) and rural exposure (around 45 percent of sales) will benefit the company. Dabur will be a key beneficiary of the government’s rural focus that is giving birth to schemes targeted at this population.

The stock had corrected significantly (down 25 percent from 52-week high) after the management’s Q2 commentary on rural outlook. Since then it has rebounded and trades in a range bound manner at a 40x of FY20 estimated earnings, on the back of an improving outlook. If we assess its prospects over a longer period, we remain positive about Dabur’s successful execution of product-wise business strategies, which help in gaining or even defending market share.

In the past few quarters, we have seen broadening of growth drivers and hence the stock can be accumulated on a staggered basis.Follow @anubhavsays

Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever wants subsidiary Hindustan Unilever (HUL), the country's largest consumer goods player, to contribute at least 15 percent of the group topline that is currently under 10 percent, Paul Polman, who stepped down as CEO in December said on Wednesday.

Unilever owns over 67 percent in HUL which had reported sales of Rs 34,619 crore in FY18, while the parent, present in over 190 countries, had an annual turnover of 53.7 billion euros in 2017.

Though contributing only a shade lower that 10 percent of the topline now, HUL is the second largest unit for the company after the US.

""HUL is growing at twice the rate of the group so far, and there is no reason why it will not exceed the 10 percent (revenue share) over time. We serve 1.3 billion people here. You have a population that's 15 percent of the world's. You should by any standards be above 15 percent (of the group revenue),"" Polman who was at the helm of the Levers for almost a decade and retired in December 2018.

Stating that India as a market is worth investing in and growing he said, the recent acquisition of GSK's consumer business globally, will further fuel this growth.

""I am already thinking bigger than 10 percent,"" Polman, who is currently helping his successor Alan Jope in transition till May said on the sidelines of the annual Nasscom leadership summit here, said without setting a time- frame for the same.

In probably, what was his last deal, Polman had finalised acquisition of Glaxosmithkline's (GSK) consumer business in the country for Rs 31,700 crore in December.

When asked if the FMCG major has set a timeframe for the 15 percent revenue share target, he said, ""ask the local management. I am sure they are working harder.""

He further said at ""the current growth rate we have more than doubled in my 10 years and there is no reason why we cannot continue on that trajectory. The Indian economy is helping. It is one of the best performing economies in the world. If the rural areas get prosperous, it will help companies like ours.""

The 62-year-old Dutchman credited HUL chairman and managing director Sanjiv Mehta for the GSK deal and expressed confidence that the acquired brands would become more successful.

""It cost me a little bit of money, but I also have so much confidence in our people in HUL that they have consistently delivered and over-delivered the results. They will make this brand more successful than its previous owners. And GSK fits with our food business,"" he said.

Hindustan Unilever has reported a growth of 11.3%YoY in its revenues at Rs 95,580. The domestic consumer growth during the quarter was 13% with underlying volume growth at 10%.

The rural market continued to remain key driver for the growth registering 1.3 times faster growth than urban markets.

The company’s EBITDA margins for the latest quarter stood at 21.4% at Rs 20,460 million as against 19.6% at Rs 16,800 million in Q3FY18. The improvement in operating margins was mainly due to prudent management of volatility in costs (crude and currency) along with improved mix and operating leverage.

In terms of business segment, Home Care segment continued its impressive performance and grew 16% in the quarter with both fabric wash and household care delivering double-digit growth.

Going ahead in medium term, the management has guided for a stable demand scenario at current levels. However, management has sounded a caution on macroeconomic environment which continues to be a key factor to watch both internationally or domestic factors due to upcoming national elections.

In terms of strategy the company continues to follow its existing plan of volume driven growth and improving operating margins.

We continue to remain positive on the company in the long run and maintain our buy rating on Hindustan Unilever with a target price of Rs 2,250 per share.

ICICI Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported robust set of numbers with revenue growth of 11.3% YoY on the back of 10% volume growth. The strong volume growth has been mainly on account of healthy growth witnessed across all segments in addition to new launches gaining traction. Home care (33% of revenue), personal care (47% of revenue) and foods & refreshments segments (18% of revenue) grew 14.8%, 11% and 9.9%, respectively Operating margins rose 185 bps YoY to 21.4% despite 76 bps contraction in gross margins. EBITDA expansion on the back of employee expenses, marketing expenses and other overheads to sales declined 85 bps, 48 bps and 128 bps, respectively Led by healthy sales growth and strong margins, net profit for the quarter grew 8.9% YoY to Rs 1444 crore. Adjusting for one-offs, net profit would have grown ~15%.

Outlook

Though the HUL-GSKCH merger would bring in significant synergy benefits, valuations at 50x FY21E provide little headroom for strong upside. Hence, we maintain our HOLD recommendation with a revised target price of Rs 1900.

Sectors like rural consumption, infrastructure development like capital goods, autos, FMCG and Consumer durables are likely to benefit from the Budget, Vivek Ranjan Misra, Head of Fundamental Research at Karvy, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

We expect it to be more than a routine Vote On Account. The government may make announcements in order to please rural voters and the urban middle class, he added.

Edited excerpt:

Q) What are your expectations from the upcoming Interim Budget? Arun Jaitley has already highlighted that it would be more than just Vote on Account.

A) By all accounts, we expect it to be more than a routine Vote On Account. Until now, the government has followed a path of fiscal prudence, this being an election year, the government may make announcements in order to please rural voters and the urban middle class. These could include cash transfers and some changes in the income tax slabs.

Q) Most experts are of the view that government might not be able to meet its fiscal deficit target. Do you think we could see a knee-jerk reaction due to that?

A) GST collections do indicate that meeting the fiscal deficit target will be tough. We believe that the slippages will be minor. The government will attempt to keep the slippage low either by expenditure control, which is most likely to be met by controlling capex. Also the government may ask PSU to hike dividends.

Q) The FM recently said that the government would address issues confronting the farm sector. Those changes would be good for consumption but not necessarily fiscal deficit. What kind of SOPS are you factoring in your estimates?

A) Firstly, the farm sector needs structural reforms that would take time to have an impact. However, some steps to alleviate stress are highly likely.

The PM has rules out farm loan waivers. The most likely step would be a cash transfer, which may be in lieu of subsidies. The mechanism could be via DBT or using Kisan Credit Card.

Certain other measures are likely, like changes in crop insurance scheme. Universal Basic Income (or UBI) may figure in party manifestos, but given the short period is unlikely.

Q) What are your views on the biggies which have come out with their results for Q3 such as RIL, HUL, Wipro as well as HDFC Bank?

A) Results have largely been in line, we do expect that as the earnings season progress, earnings in the quarter are likely to be a bit subdued, as margins are likely to be squeezed due to higher raw material prices, while raw material prices have declined since mid November, this may help boost margins in the next quarter i.e. Q4FY2018-19.

Q) What according to you should be ideal portfolio allocation ahead of Budget?

A) Our portfolio allocation is driven by our outlook for 2019. Overall, we expect that equities will be a bit subdued ahead of the election, but if a stable, reform-oriented government were to assume power, equities could do well in the second half.

We believe conditions are in place for an earnings recovery and the banking sector is past its worst, and this would support a rally.

Q) Historically, which are the sectors that have been in limelight ahead of the Budget and what are you recommending your clients and why?

A) Sectors which could benefit from the budget - those tied to rural consumption or infrastructure development- 1) capital goods, 2) autos 3) FMCG 4) Consumer durables.

However, our sector recommendations take into account our outlook for 2019 and beyond. Considering the economic cycle, the sectors we are the most bullish on are capital goods and banks.

Q) Any 5 stocks which are likely to benefit the most from the upcoming Budget and why?

A) We like Jain Irrigation as it would be a key beneficiary of a rural focus from the government, Hindustan Unilever, Mahindra and Mahindra, Bajaj Corp, as rural consumption may get a boost. Larsen & Toubro as it may benefit from an infra thrust.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) Q3 performance was in line with estimates with a 9 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit to Rs 1,444 crore against last year's Rs 1,326 crore.

Volume growth of 10 percent exceeded Street expectations.

Revenue for the quarter was Rs 9,558 crore, up 11 percent over previous year's Rs 8,590 crore.

HUL management in its post result conference call said the supply chain restructuring was progressing well which will enable 6-7 percent of cost savings in the medium-term.

“The restructuring will continue for the next 4-6 quarters, impacting exception item in P&L,” said Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman & Managing Director.

Ongoing re-imaging strategy has shown favourable results in the last two years, he said.

The company’s business operating matrix has shown improvement in terms of speed, and market coverage along with better operational matrices in terms of lower inventory days, net working capital and well-placed capital reserves to undertake faster inorganic growth.

Speed to market increased by 40 percent in 2018 compared to 2015, effective coverage (direct reach) and assortment put together also improved 40 percent over the calendar year 2016-18, inventory days reduced by 20 percent over 2016-18.

Rural growth exceeds urban

Rural growth for HUL is 1.3 times that of urban growth at present. However, Mehta believes rural should be growing at a much faster pace than 1.3x.

In the past few years, the surge in agri business and rural sales has been the driving factor of the future growth potential of FMCG businesses in India. Rural contributes 35-40 percent of overall sales value.

Rural segment growth is on the radar of analysts in assessing the roadmap of the top FMCG companies in India.

HUL operates in three segments of home care, beauty care, and foods solutions business. Of this, the home care and beauty care products are widely distributed in rural and semi-rural areas too, given the rising youth lifestyle aspirations of rural India.

With broad fundamentals looking better for the overall FMCG sector in India, brokerages believe there are also some rural-specific factors which look positive for the medium term.

The overall good monsoon, higher MSP (minimum support price) and upcoming elections for states and the central government could provide tailwinds to the existing growth momentum.

The decline in macro commodities like crude oil, palm oil and stable currency should also add to the favourable factors for the sector and the companies in terms of margins.",413,0.5417566373944283

Dolat Capital's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s volume performance in Q3 (+10%) was better than our estimate, while the operational performance was a beat. Volume growth was led by: (1) improvement in rural growth (1.3x urban) and (2) increase in sales reach. This was the fifth consecutive quarter HUL has reported a double digit volume growth and margin expansion. We expect the volume growth to taper down to a high single digit in the medium term, due to an unfavorable base. However, even a 6%+ volume growth is a positive, given the size of the company. In addition, the GM and EBITDA margin increases on an unfavorable base (highest Q3 EBITDAM in 10 years+), indicate that margins have not reached a peak yet, and the company is likely to continue to gain from operating efficiencies. In the next few quarters, we believe HUL would benefit from GST benefits and expected rise in rural expenditure by the government (farm loan waver, etc).

Outlook

Further, lower crude oil prices and cost saving initiatives should support margins. We value HUL at 50x FY21E, and raise our TP of `1,877. Maintain Accumulate.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR reported 5th consecutive quarter of double digit volume growth (10% UVG) with 16.9% Adj. PAT growth in a stable demand scenario despite a high base. HUL is well placed to gain from 1) Premiumisation in Home Care, 2) success in naturals with Lever Ayush, Indulekha etc., 3) strong growth in emerging categories (premium laundry, hand wash, Liquid dish wash, Hair conditioner, Face-wash and Green tea) 4) synergy gains from acquisition of Glaxo Consumer healthcare with expected margin accretion of 800-1000bps over time and 5) gains from supply chain, data analytics and efficient inventory management. Farm distress seen in some pockets of rural India and rising competition in select categories can pose a near term challenge, however decline in crude prices will provide a near term tailwind.

Outlook

We estimate pro-forma EPS (including GSK acquisition) of Rs40.7 for FY21 and value the stock at 46x thus arriving at target price of Rs1874. Retain Hold.

Anubhav SahuMoneycontrol Research

Broadly as per our expectation, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) posted a decent set of Q3 FY19 earnings mainly led by volume growth. Domestic sales grew 13 percent year-on-year (YoY). Volumes rose 10 percent versus 11 percent in the base quarter.

Result snapshot Source: Company

One of the positive takeaways from the initial management commentary is that rural demand remained the flag bearer of overall growth. All the three divisions posted double-digit sales growth YoY making it the fifth such consecutive quarter. Among key trends from the quarter gone by were premiumisation for fabric wash and personal wash, improved rural reach in household care and new launches.

Gross margin contracted 76 bps on higher crude oil linked raw material cost in the quarter gone by. EBITDA margin, however, improved on better product mix, operating leverage and cost rationalisation.

OutlookWe are enthused by the volume-led growth coming on a high base. While pricing growth was a shade lower, it possibly reflects the recent moderation in cost inflation. HUL remains our key stock pick and is likely to benefit from consumption growth led by rural areas (40 percent sales exposure). The stock after seeing a decent run from the October 2018 lows has recently consolidated and hence provides an opportunity to accumulate. It currently trades close to 44 times FY21 estimated earnings after including benefits arising from the recent GSK Consumer Healthcare India deal. The premium valuation factors in limited volatility in earnings, innovation profile and strong execution capabilities.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever is expected to report strong growth in October-December quarter, driven by volume growth and operational performance along with price hikes in detergents and skin care categories during Q2FY19.

The company is scheduled to announce its Q3 results on January 17.

In fact, its profit, revenue and operational income growth are likely to be in double digits, analysts said.

According to them, volume growth could be in the range of around 6-10 percent (against 11 percent in Q3FY18 and 10 percent in Q2FY19), which may drive revenue higher by around 10-13 percent for the quarter. Profit growth could be 12-20 percent YoY, analysts said.

""We expect 11.6 percent YoY sales growth mainly led by volume growth of 8 percent on account of volume growth across categories along with improved rural demand in addition to price hikes taken in detergents and skin care categories during Q2FY19,"" ICICI Securities said.

Antique Stock Broking also expects HUL to deliver sales growth of 12 percent, driven by 8 percent volume growth whereas Prabhudas Lilladher estimates 12.5 percent sales growth on 10 percent volume growth and 19 percent profit growth.

Volume growth will be driven by festive season, sustained rural demand and continued shift in demand from unorganised/small players to organised players in large categories like soaps and detergents, Antique said.

Emkay estimates home care/personal care/foods and refreshment to deliver revenue growth of 13/11/11 percent for the quarter.

On the operational front, analysts expect 10-23 percent growth range for EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) with margin expansion of 100-200 bps YoY.

""Cost-saving initiatives will continue to lead margin expansion, although advertising and promotion spends should remain elevated, Antique said.

Motilal Oswal said gross margins are likely to expand 40bp YoY to 54.9 percent and it expects operating margin to expand 150bp YoY to 21.1 percent in Q3FY19, leading to EBITDA growth of 18.4 percent YoY.

""The company should witness operating margin expansion of 208 bps to 21.6 percent in spite of higher raw material costs, benefiting from a focus on premiumisation, cost-cutting and market share gains,"" ICICI Securities said.

The Nifty Midcaps and Smallcaps are currently looking good after a disappointing 2018. We feel that broader indices will do well if the market rallies in 2019, Vipin Khare, Director-Research, William O'Neil India, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpt:

Q) After a stable 2018 what are your views about Indian market for 2019? Do you think election uncertainty will remain an overhang?

Except for November, FIIs have been net sellers in every month since April. Elections in May 2019 will be a key event to watch out for. However, the result may not have a drastic impact on stock markets as was observed in state election results.

India is likely to remain one of the fastest growing economy, but global factors like a slowdown in China, monetary tightening and growth/trade concerns in Europe, United States could mean weaker global growth in 2019.

However, the Indian domestic market should uphold the economy and that would be favourable for markets.

Q) Do you think Modi’s popularity is going down especially after state election results?

A) Weak performance in state elections is a concern for the ruling coalition but continuity at the Centre post 2019 elections cannot be ruled out.

General Assembly elections work differently in India and a 3-0 in a state election is not drastic enough to completely turn the mandate against the ruling party in 2019 general assembly elections.

Q) It looks like the government will dole out certain populist measures ahead of the polls to set the stage for the big day. Do you see this as a concern for D-Street?

A) The current government has been very responsible in maintaining its finances. We do not see any reason for investors to worry unless any specific signs of fiscal profligacy - which have been absent so far - become evident.

Q) The broader market remained under pressure in 2018. After the recent correction, do you think much of the froth is out and investors can again look at the mid and the smallcaps in the year 2019?

A) The Nifty Midcaps and Smallcaps are currently looking good after a disappointing 2018. We feel that broader indices will do well if the market rallies in 2019.

However, investors are advised to keep a close track of the earnings and buy stocks that demonstrate strong earnings acceleration. We would strongly advise investors to not play all the cards at once and follow a staggered approach to investing.

Q) Top stocks you think are good buying ideas with a target price for the year 2019?

A) Here is a list of top 4 stocks which are a must buy for 2019:

Hindustan Unilever:

HUL is expected to benefit the most from reduced raw material prices such as crude palm oil and palm fatty acid distillate, which will help improve its margins.

It derives about 50 percent of the revenue from the personal care segment (soap included) which is much higher than Godrej consumer and ITC.

O’Neil Methodology: HUL has been resilient since Sep18 market correction. The stock is currently trading 12 percent and 17 percent above its 50-and 200-DMA. The stock is making new 52-week highs and its relative strength line is inching higher as well.

RBL Bank:

The management continues to focus on increasing loan sizes from high-yield segments like retail (45% y/y growth in Q2 FY 2019), micro-banking (55% y/y growth), and MSME (62% y/y growth). We believe the change in loan mix will further strengthen the net interest margin (NIM) for the bank.

O’Neil Methodology: It is currently trading 8 percent above its 50-and 200-day line. Technical ratings and rankings also signal a strong momentum.

Nestle India:

Though the current market share is relatively less compared with its share before the ban of Maggi in 2016, it has improved its market share at a rapid pace.

Maggi contributed to 30 percent of the Company’s revenues in H1 2018. Nestle India’s H1 2018 gross margin expanded to 59 percent in H1 2018. The price of its key raw materials remained flat (wheat) or dropped (sugar), which aided margin expansion.

O’Neil Methodology: Following strong Q3 results, the stock witnessed a strong accumulation and is on course to break out on high volumes. Its technical indicators have been improving over the past few days, thus indicating strong demand for the stock.

PVR:

Growth Drivers: PVR expects to close the SPI Cinemas acquisition by Q3 FY2019. Post-acquisition, the box office revenue from regional films for PVR will increase by 300bps to 22 percent.

It also makes an arrangement with online aggregator partners Book My Show and Paytm, for a period of 3 years. Under the transaction, PVR is entitled to receive Rs 410 crores towards minimum guarantees and refundable deposits from these partners for enabling booking of PVR movie tickets across their platform.

O’Neil Methodology: Post Q2 result, the stock has made a strong run-up and is currently trading 10% above its previous high of Rs 1,423. The RS line is inching higher and at its 52-week high.

Q) What is the mood of FIIs… do you think the recent friction between the govt and the RBI will lead to some loss of credibility and weigh on sentiment?

A) Foreign investors are bullish on India’s growth story. Investors are likely to focus on the fundamentals of the economy rather than elections noise to make their investment decisions.

FIIs/FPIs were net sellers as they have sold stocks worth Rs 84,946 crore in 2018 till date, while in 2017, they bought stocks worth INR 2 trillion.

April to October months FIIs were net sellers, but the trend has reversed in November, where FII/FPIs were net buyers.

Q) Is market pricing in Modi returning to power in 2019? If not, then in case Congress come or we have a coalition government, do you think we could see more pressure?

A) A stable government at the Centre is always good for the Indian stock markets. As with the stable government, much-needed reforms can be implanted in a smooth manner and investors welcome it.

But, with a coalition government, functioning cannot be as smooth as the market expects. If we get a coalition government in 2019, we can expect some correction.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) said it is considering ""legal options"" after GST anti-profiteering authority found it guilty of not passing on rate cut benefits to consumers.

The National Anti Profiteering Authority (NAA) has passed an order against the company on December 24, 2018 for depositing an amount of Rs 223 crore, HUL said in a regulatory filing.

Making its stand clear on the matter, the company said: ""The NAA order refers to the need to pass on the benefit of reduction in rates to consumers which is fully consistent with HUL's stand and actions.

""However, it makes a narrow interpretation of the law and does not take into account well established industry practice backed by law.""

Also, it said, ""no methodology has been determined by NAA as required under law to determine if benefit has been passed or not. Given there is divergence on some basic issues, HUL will, consider legal options available to it.""

The company claimed that it has always maintained that GST is a progressive reform which will benefit consumers and the industry at large.

""In the absence of set rules and guidelines on profiteering, HUL has gone by the spirit of the law, and passed on the entire benefit received under GST to consumers - either through reduction in prices or through increase in grammage,"" it said in the filing.

HUL further said it kept the government informed of the approach and the manner that it had adopted in passing on the GST benefits to consumers.

The NAA had stated that although the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on a large number of products was cut from 28 percent to 18 percent, HUL had not reduced the maximum retail price (MRP) of its products.

The authority had found the company guilty of not passing on rate cut benefits of Rs 383 crore to consumers.

""Since the respondent (HUL) has already deposited an amount of Rs 160.23 crore in the Central CWF (consumer welfare fund), he is hereby directed to deposit an amount of Rs 31.45 crore in the central CWF and the balance amount of Rs 191.68 crore in CWFs of the states,"" the NAA had said.",373,0.003101825714111328

The National Anti-Profiteering Authority (NAA) has slapped a hefty penalty of Rs 383 crore on consumer goods major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on the ground of not passing benefits of GST rate cuts to consumers.

The company had earlier this year voluntarily submitted Rs 160 crore - an amount significantly lower than the government's calculation - as the profiteering amount to the government.

As per GST rules, 50 percent of the amount profiteered or Rs 191.68 crore is required to be deposited by the company in the central consumer welfare fund (CWF), while the balance amount is to be deposited in the CWF of concerned states where the company sold its products.

NAA has also asked HUL to explain why the penalty should not be imposed on the company.

Under the GST-related laws, the government has introduced an anti-profiteering clause to ensure businesses transfer the benefit of input tax credit to the consumers by 'commensurate reduction in prices'.

If this is not done, the NAA can then impose penalty, cancel registration of the supplier or return the amount of benefit not passed on, along with an interest of 18 percent, depending on the details of the case.

""In the absence of a framework or methodology to determine the manner in which GST rate reductions or increase in input tax credits should be passed on across the value chain, any decision that does not consider the overall cost, weight, size, package aspects may be challenged provided the intention of the law is satisfied. Significant input cost changes during the past year including oil price changes, rupee devaluation making imports more expensive, in addition to the dynamic domestic cost environment need to be factored while considering cases of anti-profiteering- as these factors also have a significant impact on pricing,"" said MS. Mani, Partner, Deloitte India.

The framework of the anti-profiteering mechanism comprises a standing committee, screening committees in every state as well as the Directorate General of Safeguards, now renamed as DG anti-profiteering (DGAP).

If consumers feel that the benefit of a rate cut is not being passed on to them, they can directly approach the state's screening committee for relief. Once DGAP completes the investigation, the case is then sent to NAA, which issues the final order.

Complaints started pouring in after the GST Council in November last year cut rates of over 200 items across various slabs. The rate rationalisation continued earlier this year in January, July and also last week.",421,-0.8580405513445536

The holding companies generally tend to outperform the underlying ones in a bull market. Thus, with a 2-year view, one should look at buying holding companies of strong groups, Ambareesh Baliga, independent market expert, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q) After a muted 2018, what are your predictions for the year 2019?

A) The initial period of 2019 would be lackluster unless one witnesses a fresh pro-BJP wave which seems remote as of now. We should see a decisive move post general elections — which could be either up or down depending on the outcome. Broadly there could be three scenarios –

1) BJP/NDA managing a workable majority: The markets will bounce back and we could witness a sharp rally. Could lead to a new high in 2019.

2) Congress forming the government with dependable allies – A knee-jerk reaction which would be limited leading to normalisation of the markets in a few months

3) An unstable weak formation: Markets will correct sharply and seek lower levels

Q) Any sector(s) which you think could turn out to be a dark horse in 2019?

A) The dark horse bet for 2019 would be sugar sector. I believe the policy change to allow sugar mills to produce ethanol directly without going through the traditional route of producing sugar is a “game-changer”.

With increased blending, the sugar mills will have a greater control over their operations. Secondly, I don’t believe the fortunes of Ethanol will depend only on the oil price as environmental considerations and the forex savings will ensure it remains in focus.

I would also suggest retail investors look at holding companies which have corrected sharply and most of them are quoting at more than 60 percent discount to the underlying.

The holding companies generally tend to outperform the underlying in a bull market. Thus, with a 2-year view, one should look to buy holding companies of strong groups.

One such pick is Pilani Investments. It is a holding company of the Birla Group having blue-chip investments like Century Textiles, Grasim, Ultratech to name a few. Among others, one could look at Uniphos Enterprises and BF Investments.

Q) A large part of the recovery in 2018 was led by heavyweights and on the other hand, small & mid-caps remain muted. Do you think the broader market is likely to remain under pressure?

A) Broader markets will remain lackluster due to lack of participation. However, we could see specific stocks in action based on news or developments in the specific sector or stock.

Q) 2019 strategy: Top five fundamental safe stocks which are good buys at current levels for a holding period of 1 year?

A) Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Ultratech Cement, TCS, and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories.

Q) Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in 2019?

A) Though I expect FMCG and pharma to do well in 2019, I expect a good recovery in cement and discovery of PSU banks as a sector.

Q) Where do you see the benchmark indices headed in the near term?

A) Global events, as well as impending election results, kept the markets on the edge in the first two weeks of December. The market absorbed the outcome of state election even though BJP failed to get an absolute majority in any of the Hindi heartland states.

Markets generally prefer continuity, except for 2014 when it was waiting for the Modi government to take over. However, it also expects a stable government after an initial period of knee-jerk reaction and volatility, whenever there is an upset for the incumbent government. Thus, I expect the markets to be back on track in 2019, even if there is an upset at Centre.

Q) Do you think the pain in the mid and smallcaps is here to stay in 2019?

A) Well, the small and the midcaps as a group is moving up after a sustainable rally in the largecaps. However, 2018 was different as even among the largecaps, the rally was limited to a few index heavyweights.

The pain the small and midcaps would continue in the initial months of 2019, but I see it as a stock pickers’ delight.

Q) Do you think rupee will continue to appreciate in the near term?

A) I think we have seen the worst for the rupee when it was trading closer to Rs 75/USD. Going forward, I believe INR/USD should stablise around Rs 70/71 and possibly appreciate if we have a stable government in 2019 with incremental foreign flows.

Q) What should be the ideal portfolio allocation for investors for the next one year?

A) One should look to increase exposure to equities since troubled times is a great opportunity to get invested. I would invest 60 percent in equities, of which 10 percent in cash, 30 percent in fixed income, and the rest 10 percent in gold/gold equivalents.

Global research firm JP Morgan has downgraded FMCG major Hindustan Unilever to neutral from overweight and also slashed target price to Rs 1,910, implying 3 percent potential upside.

""It has been a great stock but time for a breather,"" it said.

HUL shares, so far, rallied 35 percent in the current calendar year on better earnings in Q2 and hope of growth in consumption sector ahead of general elections 2019.

JP Morgan said the recent acquisition of GSK Consumer India added medium term revenue growth potential, but the stock valuations are factoring in the strong franchise benefits.

Earlier in the month, HUL approved the merger with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (GSKCH India) through an-all equity deal, valuing the total business of the latter at Rs 31,700 crore.

CMD Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman and Managing Director had said post the acquisition, the turnover of the company's Foods and Refreshment (F&R) business will exceed Rs 10,000 crore. ""We will become one of the largest F&R businesses in the country.""

Following the issue of new HUL shares, Unilever's holding in HUL will be diluted from 67.2 percent to 61.9 percent.

JP Morgan sees limited scope for earnings upgrades as margin gain assumptions are leaving little margin of safety.

Ahead of the Union Budget, FMCG major Hindustan Unilever CMD Sanjiv Mehta Thursday pitched for reducing corporate tax rate and redressal of technical glitches and procedural matters of the goods and services tax (GST).

He said that the taxation burden for multi-national corporations (MNCs) can be reduced by ""bringing down their corporate tax rate at par with the rate applicable in neighbouring countries"".

While GST has proven to be a game changer and is positively impacting taxation practices, ""transitional issues need to be rectified fast, covering both technical glitches and procedural matters,"" he added.

He was speaking at CII's national conference on 'MNCs and India: Creating Mutual Value'.

In February this year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley lowered corporate tax rate to 25 per cent for businesses with turnover up to Rs 250 crore. However, for businesses with over Rs 250 crore turnover, 30 per cent tax remains.

The minister will present the interim Budget for 2019-20 fiscal on February 1, 2019.

Mehta, who is also Chairman of CII National Committee on MNCs, said that restrictions on the royalties paid by Indian subsidiaries to their parent companies has been a major concern for MNCs in the recent times.

Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has reduced the royalty payment to 2 per cent on listed companies, which is adversely affecting sentiments of Indian subsidiaries to list in the country's stock exchanges, he said.

""The distinction created between listed and unlisted companies can discourage participation by foreign companies in the country, thereby adversely affecting transfer of advanced technology, research and development in India by the foreign companies,"" he added.

Further, he also suggested the government to relax local sourcing norms under single-brand retailing.

""Certain restrictive clauses like sourcing norms have undermined the realisation of full benefits of the measure,"" Mehta said, adding that there was a need for harmonisation of Indian standards in line with the global standards when it comes to the regulatory and policy environment in the context of MNCs.

Talking about intellectual property rights (IPR), he said, issues are being faced in the form of inadequate effective enforcement mechanism of rules and limited resources are leading to rising application backlog.

He said that India remains high on the global business radar and it is the right time for India to leverage upon it through a stable and progressive business environment.

""India has the potential to be the engine of growth for the global economy for years to come. If we maintain the momentum, we could be a USD 6-7 trillion economy by 2030, and if we bend the curve we could be a USD 10 trillion economy by 2030,"" he added.",455,-0.11901533603668213

Sharekhan's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL will acquire 100% stake in GSK Consumers for a deal value of Rs. 31,700 crore. Under the share swap deal, GSK Consumers will get 4.39 shares of HUL for 1 share held (resulting in equity dilution of 8.5%). Though the swap ratio is favourable for GSK Consumers, the deal is EPS accretive for HUL as it brings in incremental PAT of Rs. 700 crore (13% up as per FY2018 financials), while equity capital gets diluted by just 8.5% due to the deal. Moreover, the company would further gain from synergy benefits and consolidate its leadership position in the high-growth and high-margin health food business.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy recommendation on the stock and upgrade the PT to Rs. 2,071.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We remain positive on HUVR's acquisition of Glaxo Consumer Healthcare given that it will be 1) EPS accretive by 5% in FY20 and ~7.75% in FY21 2) market leading brands like Horlicks and boost with more than 63.4% volume share in Rs77bn MFD industry 3) strong R&D and pipeline of nutritional products and 3) scalability to foods and refreshment business as combined sales exceed Rs100bn. HUVR expects significant scalability and synergy benefits from 1) 3x distribution and direct reach than GSK 2) distribution gains in pharma channel which is HUVR's weak point 3) cost reduction in advertising, supply chain and overheads and administration which will give margin accretion of 800-1000bps over time. We believe that synergy benefits will start accruing from FY21 and estimate an EPS uptick of 7.75% and 8.25% in FY21 and FY22.

Outlook

We estimate pro-forma EPS of Rs40.9 for FY21 and value the stock at 46x thus arriving at target price of Rs1880 (1703 earlier). We expect one-time dividend in FY21 given that GSK has cash of Rs38bn in its books and HUVR has 80% dividend payout. Retain Hold.

Transaction multiple at a premium to Zydus-Complan deal



Deal transaction earnings accretive even without synergies



Substantially increases HUL’s presence in F&R – 28% of sales



Significant scope for synergies coming from distribution & premiumisation



Need for category innovation leads to additional execution risk

In a matter of few months two of the topmost brands in the Indian health food drinks (HFD) market have switched owners. Almost sequentially, Complan has been lapped up by Zydus Wellness and now Horlicks has found a new owner – HUL

Broadly speaking there is a bit of flux in the Indian FMCG space as far repositioning, acquiring or testing beverage space is concerned. Impressions of that can be seen hot beverage segment (Coca Cola – Costa), non-carbonated space (Varun Beverages manufacturing Tropicana) and milk (Tata Sons rejecting M&A proposal for Prabhat Dairy).

As far as Indian health food drinks market is concerned, stagnancy in category growth might now change with HUL pushing for product innovation and premiumisation, advertisement push and strengthening the distribution reach.

What’s the deal?

In an all-equity deal, 4.39 shares of HUL are being swapped for every share in GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare India (GSKCH) bringing the equity valuation at Rs 31,700 crore in line with the current market cap of GSCH. Taking account of cash in the balance sheet, enterprise value is about Rs 28,000 crore and brings the EV/EBITDA at 32x and EV/Sales at 6.5x which is at a premium to Zydus – Heinz deal (4x EV/Sales and 20.4x EV/EBITDA) but broadly inline with other key deals in the Indian FMCG space like Emami’s acquisition of Keshking (6x EV/Sales) and HUL’s acquisition of Indulekha (8x EV/Sales).

Deal transaction is EPS accretive even before accounting for synergy benefits.

The deal brings in the full portfolio of health food drinks - Horlicks, Boost, Viva and Maltova and expected to close by Dec 2019.

Deal also includes a consignment selling contract to distribute OTC products like Sensodyne, Eno, Crocin, and Otrivin for a period of five years.

Post-merger Unilever’s ownership would fall to 61.9 percent (from 67.2 percent) and GSK Plc would hold about 5.7 percent of the merged entity. Unilever doesn’t retain any call option to buy out GSK’s stake in the merged entity.

Increases the presence in Foods & Refreshment space

HUL’s Foods & Refreshment (F&R) division constitutes 19 percent of the net sales and with this merger it scales up to more than Rs 11,000 crore business (28 percent of sales, post-merger).

The segmental margin at present for F&R Indian division is 15 percent which is lower than other divisions - beauty and personal care (26 percent) and home care (18 percent). However, with this merger segmental margins in F&R improve and inch closer to the group level.

Growth in the category

Though the HFD category and particularly malt-based drinks segment have had a slower growth in last few years, HUL is hopeful of 9 percent CAGR growth (CY17-22e) on account of various levers. Large youth population (37 percent below 19 years), high disposable income and persistent nutritional needs present strong structural demand drivers. Further lower penetration of 22 percent (rural: 14 percent) and specific health needs provides an opportunity for market development.

HUL is hopeful of growth acceleration based on wider distribution reach and category’s potential in north and west regions. HUL’s direct reach is more than 4 times than that of GSKCH. Further, GSKCH’s revenue from the north and south region was a mere 6 percent and 5 percent respectively which can change with the company’s innovation and channel placement.

Substantial scope for synergies

HUL emphasizes full synergy benefits of 800-1,000 bps to the margins on account of cost efficiencies and premiumisation. Innovations thereby competing with the likes of Pediasure (Abbot) and Protinex (Danone) can be expected. Further, there seems to be a lot of scope for cost rationalisation particularly for heads like employee cost, rent, and utilities. Scale benefits are expected to kick in with regards to advertising and promotional cost and raw material sourcing. Similarly overlap in distribution and logistics can be reduced.

However, HUL has to continue paying royalty on Horlicks which is about 2.9 percent of GSKCH sales and to that extent other expenses would remain higher.

Taxation benefits to accrue

HUL is likely to have tax benefit on account of goodwill treatment. This transaction would help HUL record goodwill on the books which can be amortised. For GSK, share swap structure helps in lowering of taxation burden compared to outright cash deal which would have been subjected to huge LTCG tax.

Overall, we find this deal transaction earning accretive and believe that synergy benefits are worth watching out for. However, a lot comes on HUL’s shoulder not only in terms of bringing synergy benefits but also in terms of category innovation. And therefore there is an element of execution risk.

With this transaction, HUL’s urban exposure has increased for the time being. Taking account of synergy benefit of 300 bps on the margins for the HFD category in the FY21, the stock is currently trading at 47.6x the FY21e earnings.

Brokerages CLSA and Edelweiss maintained their 'outperform' ratings on Hindustan Unilever after it decided to merge GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare with itself.

The transaction values the total business of GSK Consumer India at Rs 31,700 crore. Following the issue of new HUL shares, Unilever's holding in HUL will be diluted from 67.2 percent to 61.9 percent and GSK Plc, including group companies, will own 5.7 percent of the merged entity.

The acquisition of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (SKB) by Hindustan Unilever (HUVR) for Rs 31,700 crore will make Hindustan Unilever the largest listed foods company in India.

Brokerages feel that the deal is likely to be EPS-accretive for HUL and investors who have a time horizon of more than a year can hold the stock with a target placed above Rs 2,000.

GSK Consumer Healthcare is the market leader in the HFD (health food drinks) category, with iconic brands such as Horlicks and Boost, and a product portfolio supported by strong nutritional claims.

The GSK Consumer India business delivered a total turnover of around Rs 4,200 crore in the year ended March 2018, primarily through its Horlicks and Boost brands.

Edelweiss maintained its 'outperform' rating on HUL, which is also its top sector pick with a target price of Rs 2,030. This translates to gains of a little over 10 percent its closing price on December 3.

The brokerage highlighted that due to the merger -- (i) the share of foods and refreshment (F&R) in the company's revenue pie would jump from 18.4 percent to 27.8 percent; (ii) EBIT margin for the F&R segment would improve from 15.6 percent to 17.8 percent; (iii) EPS would increase 4.5 percent in FY20, without factoring in synergies and cost-savings for HUL.

""With the Health Food Drinks category slated to grow at 9 percent through CY22E and HUVR’s ability to drive penetration coupled with its distribution muscle, we are confident it would clock double-digit revenue growth in SKB’s portfolio in the medium term,"" Edelweiss said.

Once the merger is completed, HUL expects the business to grow in double-digits in the medium-term and margins to be accretive to the company after synergy benefits are realised.

""The turnover of our foods and refreshment business will exceed Rs 10,000 crore and we will become one of the largest foods and refreshment businesses in the country,"" Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman, and Managing Director, HUL said.

Reacting to the news development, CLSA maintained its outperform rating on HUL and hiked its target price from Rs 1,750 earlier to Rs 2,010.

It views the deal as clear positive for HUL and EPS accretive even without synergy. GSK’s core brands are highly underleveraged. The core brands provide relevant scale, growth potential, and profitability, said the note.

Another brokerage firm, UBS maintained its neutral rating on Hindustan Unilever with a target of Rs 1,800. The deal is EPS accretive despite the exit premium given to GSK shareholders. There are concerns regarding the relevance of Horlicks which may be unwarranted.

ICICI Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL reported a healthy set of numbers with revenue growth of 11.1% YoY on the back of 10% volume growth. The strong volume growth was mainly on account of double digit growth seen across all segments in addition to new launches gaining traction. Home care (34% of revenue), personal care (47% of revenue) and foods & refreshments segments (19% of revenue) grew 12.4%, 10.4% and 13.3%, respectively Operating margin rose 162 bps YoY to 21.9% despite a 74 bps contraction in gross margins. The EBITDA expansion was on the back of employee expenses, marketing expenses and other overheads to sales declining 49 bps, 33 bps and 154 bps, respectively Led by healthy sales growth, strong margins and higher other income, net profit for the quarter grew 19.5% YoY to Rs 1525 crore.

Outlook

Though cost pressure is increasing, we believe downside risks to our estimates appear low as higher growth from improving volumes and pricing action along with HUL’s cost efficiencies provide visibility for future earnings growth. We remain confident about the company’s volume led growth backed by new launches and premiumisation. We believe HUL is well placed to fulfil rural demand by its product innovation, speed and agility to cater to evolving consumer needs. We expect HUL to report revenue, PAT CAGR of 13%, 20.7%, respectively, in FY18-20E. We believe maintaining double digit volume growth on a high base will not be sustainable. We expect 7-8% volume growth for the next quarter. We upgrade HUL to BUY rating with a target price of Rs 1800.

2Q19 performance remained robust 4th consecutive quarter of double digit volume growth (10% UVG) and 23.1% Adj. PAT growth, stable demand scenario, normal monsoons and sustained double digit growth in Home care. HUL is well placed to gain from Premiumisation in Home Care, success in naturals with Lever Ayush, Indulekha etc., strong growth in emerging categories (premium laundry, hand wash, Liquid dish wash, Hair conditioner, Face-wash and Green tea) and gains from supply chain, data analytics and efficient inventory management. Rising crude oil prices, depreciating INR and competitive actions in select categories pose a near term challenge, although long term outlook remains intact.

JM Financial's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s 2QFY19 key operating metrics comprising volume growth of 10%, revenue growth of 12% and 160bps expansion in operating margin were undoubtedly strong and commendable but were all bang on expected lines and no more a massive positive surprise as such. We expect the stock to be more range-bound hereonwards. Focus would be more on what the volume delivery for 3QFY19 and thereafter would be, since ‘double-digit volume growth’ would be in the base from 3Q onwards. Management remains quite confident and upbeat; key commentaries: 1) Demand outlook is stable. 2) Rural growing ahead of urban. 3) Focus on volume-driven growth and improvement in operating margin. 4) Crude increase and currency depreciation are the key watch-outs.

Outlook

HUL’s execution and delivery capabilities remained the best-in-class, but stock is still somewhat priced for perfection, notwithstanding the recent 12-13% correction from peak.

Dolat Capital's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL’s volume performance was in line with our estimate (+10%) while the operational performance was a beat. Volume growth was led by – (1) improvement in rural growth (1.2-1.25x urban) (2) and increase in sales reach. We believe that the performance was encouraging as in the fourth consecutive quarter the company has delivered double digit volume growth and margin expansion. We expect that the volume growth would reduce to single digit due to unfavorable base; 6%+ volume growth over a medium-term can be taken sanguinely considering the size of the company. GM and EBITDA margin expansion on an unfavorable base (highest Q2 EBITDAM in 10 years+) indicates that the margins have not peaked yet and the company would continue to gain from its operating efficiencies.

Outlook

Going ahead, we believe HUL would benefit from favorable monsoon this season, GST benefits and rural expenditure by government. However, crude price surge is the key headwind. Continue to value HUL at 55x to arrive at TP of `1,848 (` 1,844 earlier). Maintain Accumulate.

Hindustan Unilever share price corrected 3.5 percent on Monday morning as brokerage houses turned mixed on the stock after September quarter earnings.

The stock was quoting at Rs 1,517, down Rs 51.65, or 3.29 percent, on the BSE at 09:48 hours IST.

Macquarie, which has maintained 'outperform' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,870 (implying 19 percent potential upside), said Q2 net profit growth is ahead of estimates driven by higher EBITDA margin, and demand environment has continued to improve with Q2 volume growth of 10 percent.

""The company remained our top pick in India consumer space. We are building 9 percent CAGR volume growth into estimates in FY19/20 and expect gross margin to recover on price increases,"" it added.

Global brokerage house CLSA also retained its 'outperform' call on the stock, but slashed target price to Rs 1,750 from Rs 1,950. It said the company managed to comprehensively beat Q2 estimates. After several quarters, personal-care growth is in double-digits, the brokerage added.

HUL remains a compelling story and any further weakness is an opportunity to add, it advised.

The FMCG major reported 19.5 percent year-on-year growth in standalone profit at Rs 1,525 crore driven by strong volume growth and operational performance.

Revenue during the quarter increased 11.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 9,234 crore with volume growth of 10 percent, which was ahead of Street expectations of around 7-9 percent.

Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman and Managing Director said, ""In the near term, we expect demand to be stable. Our strength of agility and responsiveness gives us confidence to navigate the headwinds arising from crude inflation and currency depreciation.""

Meanwhile, some brokerage houses remained neutral to bearish on the stock as they said earnings are already priced in and do not indicate any upgrades. The stock rallied 115 percent during January 2017-August 2018 period followed by a 15 percent jump since September 2018.

Morgan Stanley retained its 'Underweight' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,260 per share, citing higher valuation and potential disruption from small brands, though company beat Q2 earnings estimates by 5 percent.

Phillip Capital has maintained 'neutral' rating and raised target price to Rs 1,760 from Rs 1,720 as it believes the current valuation (50x FY20 EPS) does not fully factor all risks and the company may not be in a position to fully pass on raw material inflation.

Crude oil is one of the raw materials for the company. So any increase in oil prices will have an impact on its earnings if the company does not pass on the hike to consumers. HUL hiked product prices in last two quarters and brokerages expect it to increase prices in Q3 as well.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, have increased 28 percent year-to-date, and 47 percent in last one year.

Hence, Axis Capital believes rising input cost pressure, especially in home care segment, has started to dent gross margins.

Credit Suisse has maintained its 'neutral' rating on the stock as HUL earnings are in-line with estimates and will not lead to any earning upgrades, but it feels the company has many levers to expand margins in second half of FY19, even as input costs rise.

HUL had reported volume growth of 12 percent in June quarter 2018 and 4 percent in September quarter 2017. HUL saw its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth.

""Our well-established savings programme and leverage in other expenses have enabled us to mitigate material inflation and drive margin improvement,"" the company said in its filing.

On the operational front, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) grew by 20 percent to Rs 2,019 crore and margin expanded by 170 basis points to 21.9 percent compared to year-ago period.",639,0.4122381666127373

Hindustan Unilever (HUL), India's most valuable pure-play consumer goods company, appears to be losing ground in the oral-care segment.

In a post-earnings concall with analysts and investors, HUL Chief Financial Officer Srinivas Phatak said that the company's performance in the oral care segment has been below expectations. However, he did not reveal individual category numbers.

The company includes oral care figures within the personal care segment.

""Central and North markets have performed well but overall delivery in the oral care segment was below expectations,"" Pathak said in a concall.

""We need to make more efforts as the market is reshaping and dynamics are changing,"" he said.

The CFO was quick to add that the oral care business has not been doing well across. According to analysts, a few segments like oral care continue to witness heightened competitive intensity.

In oral care, Colgate continues to report de-growth in volumes and a resultant erosion of market share. HUL has similarly lost its market share due to the popularity of Patanjali's Dant Kanti brand.

Dabur, however, has been able to improve its share, guided by its presence in South India, and new product launches.

According to the latest numbers, Colgate is a clear leader in the oral care segment with close to 54 percent market share, followed by a distant HUL with around 19 percent market share. Dabur has a market of 17 percent market share, and Patanjali has a share of little over 7 percent.

HUL today reported a 19.51 percent increase in its net profit for the September quarter to Rs 1,525 crore on account of double-digit growth across categories. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 1,276 crore during the same period last year.

Sales during the quarter under review stood at Rs 9,138 crore, as against Rs 8,199 crore in the year-ago period, up 11.45 percent.

Pathak said while demand is expected to be stable in the near term, the company will watch out for currency depreciation and the rise in crude oil prices.

The CFO also said the company had increased prices of a few of its home-care products by 2-3 percent during the quarter gone by. The company's home-care product portfolio includes brands such as Domex, Vim and Surf Excel.

Revenue from home-care products stood at Rs 3,080 crore, up 12.44 percent, compared to Rs 2,739 crore reported in the corresponding quarter last year.

Revenue from the personal care segment during the quarter under review was at Rs 4,316 crore as against Rs 3,910 crore a year earlier, an increase of 10.38 percent.

HUL's food and refreshment product portfolio, which includes brands like Kissan, Brooke Bond Red Label, Bru, and Kwality Wall's, accounted for Rs 1,704 crore of the company's revenue during the quarter, as against Rs 1,526 crore a year earlier.",477,0.08852077614177357

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever will announce its earnings for the second quarter on October 12. Overall the July-September period was strong for consumer goods companies including HUL, brokerage houses said.

The shift in demand from unorganised to organised players after the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST), price hikes during the quarter, cost-saving strategies and rural growth are likely to boost HUL earnings growth to double digits in Q2 (YoY), research firms said.

The sharp rise in crude oil prices is likely to have less impact on numbers, they said.

""Volume growth will be driven by a continued shift in demand from unorganised/small players to organised players in large categories like soaps and detergents,"" Antique Stock Broking said.

Additionally, the rural recovery is also expected to sustain and aid demand during the quarter, it said. ""Further, cost-saving initiatives are likely to aid margin expansion. Ad spends will continue to be at elevated levels.""

In September quarter, HUL share price fell 2 percent while it rallied 30 percent during January-August 2018 followed by 15 percent correction from September.

Here are four key factors to look at in Q2FY19 earnings:

Volume Growth

Overall volume growth is likely to be in the range of 7-9 percent, which is expected to boost the company's revenue growth during the quarter, brokerage houses said.

Nirmal Bang expects volume growth in the range of 8-9 percent and value growth of around 4 percent during the quarter.

""Volume-led growth assumption is premised on broad-based demand for its products across categories, improved performance of naturals portfolio and new products like the launch of Brylcream range exclusively on Amazon,"" it said.

Home and personal care segment will continue to drive growth, while the merger of food and refreshment businesses are likely to bring in synergy and efficiency, it added.

Edelweiss Securities expects HUL to record a volume growth of around 8-8.5 percent YoY on a base of 4 percent YoY growth. Q1FY19 saw volume growth of 12 percent on a flat base. So, 2-year average volume growth trajectory of earlier quarters is likely to be maintained, it added.

Revenue Growth

Revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 9-15 percent driven by volume, brokerage houses said.

The company is likely to witness 15 percent revenue growth mainly led by volume growth of 7-8 percent on account of supply chain benefits under GST regime in addition to price hikes of around 5 percent taken during the quarter, ICICI Securities said.

Axis Capital expects HUL to post 12 percent growth in core FMCG business while Edelweiss Securities' projection is the lowest in terms of revenue growth. It expects around 9-10 percent YoY on rural pick up, price hikes and increasing consumer spending. The company is not seeing incremental competitive pressure from P&G in the detergent segment as yet, it said.

Operational Growth

Despite high advertising cost and raw material prices, around 100 bps expansion in margin is likely due to cost-saving strategies and premiumisation, brokerage houses said.

ICICI Securities said the company should be able to report 149 bps expansion in operating margins to 21.7 percent in spite of higher raw material and advertisement costs, benefiting from a focus on premiumisation, cost-cutting and market share gains.

EBITDA margin is likely to expand 120 bps YoY largely aided by gains from cost-saving initiatives/leverage; we expect modest 30 bps expansion in gross margin aided by price hikes, Axis Capital said.

On the costs side, Nirmal Bang said the pressure has accelerated with the crude oil prices rising, but other key raw materials like PFAD, palm oil, etc have declined YoY. Therefore, it does not expect adverse impact of crude in Q2.

As we are approaching mid-October, the derivatives data is still not showing any sign of improvement near support levels of 10,275 and 10,200.

The continuous short build-up by foreign investors (FIIs) indicates caution ahead. Currently, 10,000 levels will act as a major support level for the Nifty where maximum OI has been observed in Puts with more than 40 lakh shares.

However, if data does not improve around current levels we may see the unwinding of a long position and selling pressure in the index.

Call writers were active in 10,300, 10,400 and 10,500 Call strike which indicates limited upside. This clearly indicates a lack of buying interest and discomfort in the market.

On bounce, the index will face strong resistance at 10,400-10,450 levels. Overall data is negative and more weakness can be seen in the coming days. However, on technical ground, the Nifty has next support at 10,100-10,050 spot levels.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 6-7% return in one month:

ACC: Sell| Target: Rs 1390| Stop Loss: Rs 1535| Return 6%

The stock surpassed its 200-days exponential moving average (EMA) on the daily interval in the month of August but could not manage to hold on to its gains and slid below the crucial support of 1500 levels.

The stock has also formed a ‘Head and Shoulder’ pattern on the daily interval and has given a breakdown below its neckline which is clearly a bearish signal.

Traders can take a short position in the range of Rs 1465-1480 for the downside target of Rs 1390 levels with a stop loss above Rs 1535.

Exide Industries: Sell| Target: Rs 229| Stop Loss: Rs 258| Return 7%

After testing 300 levels in the recent past, the stock has been maintaining its downtrend and trading in a downward sloping channel on the daily charts. The stock has been forming lower highs and lower lows which is a bearish sign.

This week we saw a fresh breakdown in prices as the stock slid below its 200-days exponential moving average (EMA) on the daily charts with marginally higher volume.

The negative divergence on the secondary indicators like RSI and Stochastic are also pointing towards more downside in prices moving forward.

Traders can take a short position in the range of Rs 243-247 for the downside target of Rs 229 with a stop loss above Rs 258.

Hindustan Unilever: Sell| Target: Rs 1424| Stop Loss: Rs 1565| Return 6%

The stock has been badly hammered down from Rs 1800 levels to get support at its 100-days exponential moving average (EMA) on the daily interval which is placed at 1620 levels.

However, from the last four weeks, prolong consolidation in prices has kept the stock in the range of 1570-1670.

This week we have observed consolidation breakdown below the key support of 1560 along with descending triangle breakdown which is a bearish signal for the prices moving forward.

Traders can take a short position in the range of 1505-1515 for the downside target of 1424 levels with a stop loss above 1565.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

2QFY19 has seen stable market demand, continuing through 1QFY19. Rural continues to grow ahead of urban (but has still not accelerated to the pace seen a few years ago vis-à-vis urban growth). Rural volumes are now growing at 1.5x of urban while value is at 1.3x of urban. Floods in Kerala and transport strike during the quarter did not have any major impact and was well managed. Channel pipelines are now normal. Modern trade continues growing ahead of general trade, which is positive for premiumization. Management stated that two-year CAGR on volumes should be in the range of 6-8%, going forward, which augurs well for growth in subsequent quarters.

Outlook

HUL not only offers the best earnings growth visibility in large cap Indian consumer space, but also has by far the highest return ratios. Recent price correction of over 10% offers a more attractive entry point. On a target multiple of 52x September 2020 EPS (~20% premium to 3-year average due to significantly improving business fundamentals), we get a target price of INR2,025 (INR2,010 earlier). Maintain Buy.

Global investment firm Credit Suisse downgraded Britannia Industries and Hindustan Unilever to Neutral, which pushed both stocks down by 2.65 percent and 2 percent intraday respectively on Wednesday.

The brokerage house said Britannia valuations indicated little room for upside, though it raised target price to Rs 6,900 from Rs 6,000 per share earlier.

It further said Britannia, the country's largest biscuit maker, is largely a single-category company and its cash conversion is poor versus HUL as well as Nestle India. ""We like the business from a medium-term view.""

In case of Hindustan Unilever, Credit Suisse expects the stock to hit a target of Rs 1,770 per share, implying 7 percent potential upside.

It feels the return of normal competitive activity will cap upside and margin expansion in FY20/FY21 may be capped hereon. ""We cut FY20/FY21 earnings estimates by 2-4 percent. For FY19, margin should expand as the base in Q2/Q3 is favourable.""

At 11:26 hours IST, Britannia stock price was quoting at Rs 6,195.00, down Rs 148.35, or 2.34 percent and Hindustan Unilever was down 1.54 percent at Rs 1,626.05 on the BSE.

The Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) has asked the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks not to register the acronym as a trademark, according to a report by The Economic Times.

The decision could affect fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which also sells natural, Ayurvedic products such as toothpaste and soaps. HUL has been selling such products under the ‘Lever Ayush’ brand for two years now.

A ministry spokesperson told the newspaper, “HUL has applied for registration of trademark Ayush, which, if granted, may lead to confusion among general public.”

According to the report, the consumer goods company has claimed that it had acquired the Ayush brand around two decades ago while the ministry was formed in 2014.

The report cites analysts suggesting that the ministry could be referring to the Lever Ayush brand, for which the trademark is still pending.

The Ayush brand was first registered in 1987 by Jayalakshmi Oil & Chemical Industries while the trademark was sold to HUL in 2001, the report suggested. HUL had started selling the natural beauty products in 2001.

The company had separately applied to register Lever Ayush Plus Therapy in 2007 and the Lever Ayush Device in 2017, the report added. “Lever Ayush is exclusively associated with HUL and we have been using this mark even before the AYUSH Ministry was formed,” an HUL spokesperson said.

The FMCG giant said it had independently adopted the brand name Lever Ayush in 2000 and has launched products under that brand, the report added.",272,-0.9963968396186829

ITC shares rallied as much as 5 percent to hit fresh 52-week high of Rs 301.80 in morning on Friday as brokerage houses remained bullish on the stock after the company started off the financial year 2018-19 on a strong note.

ITC (Rs 3.72 lakh crore) has overtaken Hindustan Unliever (Rs 3.6 lakh crore) in market capitalsation and became the fourth most valued company at Dalal Street after TCS (Rs 7.47 lakh crore), Reliance Industries (Rs 7.06 lakh crore) and HDFC Bank (Rs 5.82 lakh crore).

The cigarette-hotel-to-FMCG major has reported profit growth of 10.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,818 crore with better growth in FMCG business (cigarette + others).

Revenue from operations grew by 7.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 10,707 crore with EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) growing 12.2 percent and margin expansion of 160 basis points.

Overall numbers were in line with expectations but cigarette volumes beat analyst estimates, rising 2 percent against expectations of negative growth.

FMCG business also performed well in June quarter with more than 9-fold increase in EBIT and 14 percent growth in revenue while higher room rates, strong F&B sales and high operating leverage boosted hotels performance.

At 10:02 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 305.25, up Rs 18.10, or 6.30 percent on the BSE.

Brokerage houses remained bullish on the stock, saying potential re-rating is likely going ahead after strong performance in Q1. They expect the stock to return up to 25 percent over a period of one year.

Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 335 | Return: 17%

Q1FY19 earnings were ahead of estimates and it is a good start to FY19. Cigarette business reported good performance with surprising volume growth while FMCG others business reported impressive revenue growth and profitability.

Paper division has good margin delivery while hotel division was good.

Brokerage: UBS | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 350 | Return: 22%

Overall performance was creditable, as it came on a normalised base. Positive cigarette volume growth of 2 percent could improve from here.

Other FMCG business grew despite a high base.

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 360 | Return: 25%

Credit Suisse has maintained Outperform rating on the stock with increased target price at Rs 360 from Rs 350 earlier.

After cigarette business saw a revival, which was a significant improvement, the potential re-rating could start playing out.

Overall Q1 net profit was ahead of estimates and EBITDA growth was highest growth in nine quarters.

Brokerage: Kotak Institutional Equities | Rating: Add | Target: Rs 330 | Return: 15%

Q1 earnings print was ahead of expectations with positive cigarette volume growth and modest EBIT growth.

Subdued topline growth in FMCG was a key disappointment, but Kotak reiterated Add rating with increased target price at Rs 330 from Rs 315 earlier as it remained constructive on the stock with favourable risk/reward ratio.

Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 345 | Return: 20%

ITC can outperform the sector over next 6-9 months and continues to like the stock given favourable risk-reward.

Jefferies believes double-digit EBIT growth will sustain.

Brokerage: Deutsche Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 350 | Return: 22%

Cigarette volume grew by 1.5 percent after declining for 3 quarters. We see high probability of rational tax increase in FY19.

We view the stock as cheap with significant premiumisation potential.

KR Choksey's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) posted its Q1FY19 results which were above our estimates on YoY basis. Net revenue for Q1FY19 stood at INR 94.8 Bn (+11.2 YoY), as against our estimate of INR 92.8 Bn. A revival in consumer sentiments and pick-up in consumer demand, especially in rural India has resulted in volume momentum during the quarter. The top line was mainly driven by Foods & Refreshments segment, which reported revenue of INR 17.8 Bn (+8% YoY). EBIDTA stood at INR 22.5 Bn (+20.6% YoY), with OPM at 23.7% (+185 bps YoY). Reduction in purchase of trade goods by 20% on YoY basis has resulted in higher EBITDA and OPM during the quarter. PAT for Q1FY19 stood at INR 15.3 Bn (+19.2% YoY), with NPM of 16.1% (+107 bps YoY). An increase in other income by 19.5% YoY has resulted in higher PAT and NPM during the quarter.

Outlook

At CMP of INR 1,640 HUL is trading at P/E of 54.5x for FY20E. We assign P/E multiple of 59.8x and revising the target price to INR 1,800 with “ACCUMULATE” rating on the stock representing an upside of 9.8%.

ICICI Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) posted a strong set of numbers with comparable revenue growth of 11.2% YoY on the back of 12% volume growth. The strong volume growth has been mainly on account of double digit growth witnessed across all segments in addition to new launches gaining traction. In terms of comparable numbers, home care (34% of revenue), personal care (47% of revenue) and foods & refreshments segments (19% of revenue) grew 20%, 14% and 14%, respectively Operating margins expanded 185 bps YoY to 23.7%. Comparable margin expansion (net of excise, input credit and fiscal exemption arising out of new facility in Assam) was 100 bps despite 27.4% increase in advertisement spend during the quarter. The higher spend has been mainly on the back of a slew of new launches Led by healthy sales growth and strong margins, net profit for the quarter grew 19.2% YoY to Rs 1529 crore.

Outlook

We remain confident about HUL’s commitment towards volume led growth backed by new launches and premiumisation. We estimate the company will report revenue and PAT CAGR of 12.7% and 21.9%, respectively, in FY18-20E. However, on account of a sharp price rise, we maintain our HOLD rating with a revised target price of Rs 1800.

JM Financial's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL delivered another strong quarter but that is somewhat par for the course now, considering its recent results delivery plus the stock’s heady valuation (59x NTM EPS). There was no massive surprise element this time round, though, to drive another leg of decisive upmove from an already elevated level, in our view. The stock had rallied 8-10% each after 2Q-3QFY18 results and up a massive 16% between 4QFY18 report and now - we expect reaction to be more lukewarm this time round, given that there was nothing in 1QFY19 report to prompt another round of earnings-upgrade. Key numbers: 12% volume growth (base volume was flat implying 2-year volume CAGR of 5.8% vs 7.4% for 4QFY18; 3QFY18 was 3.2%), 16% comparable sales growth and 100bps of ‘comparable’ margin expansion.

Outlook

Growth was more broad-based this time round with double-digit volume growth across divisions but Home-care was again the key performance driver (6th consecutive quarters of >25% EBIT growth) while Personal Care underperformed relatively (LTL margin down for the 4th quarter running). Delivery-engine remains well-oiled but stock is priced for perfection.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We are cutting HUVR from ""Accumulate"" to Hold given valuations at 53xFY20 EPS after factoring in 16.4% PAT CAGR over FY18-20 and 52% run up in past 1 year. 1Q19 performance remained robust with 12% UVG and 21% Adj PAT growth, recovery in demand scenario and sustained growth in naturals portfolio and Home care. HUL is undertaking realignment of its manufacturing and supply chain post GST which will reduce costs and expand margins over the coming years. HUL is well placed to gain from Premiumisation in Home Care, success in naturals with Lever Ayush, Indulekha etc. and strong growth in emerging categories (premium laundry, hand wash, Liquid dish wash, Hair conditioner, Face-wash and Green tea). Rising crude oil prices, depreciating INR and competitive actions in select categories pose a near term challenge, although long term outlook remains intact.

Outlook

We value the stock at 46xDec20 EPS and arrive at target price of Rs1703, (1627 based on 46xSept20 EPS). Downgrade to Hold.

Dolat Capital's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUL reported strong Q1FY19 volume and operational performance abetted by – (1) favorable rural base (2) normalisation of trade channels (3) revamp of rural growth and (4) increase in sales reach. We believe that the performance was encouraging as the company has consistently in the third quarter delivered double digit volume growth and margin expansion. We expect that the volume growth would remain high in the coming quarters considering revival in the rural markets - 6%+ volume growth over a medium-term can be taken sanguinely considering the size of the company. GM and EBITDA margin expansion at an unfavorable base (highest Q1 GM in 10 years+) indicates that the margins have not peaked yet and the company would continue to gain from its operating efficiencies.

Outlook

Going ahead, we believe HUL would benefit from the favorable base, favorable monsoon this season, GST benefits and benefits of seventh pay commission. Value HUL at 55x to arrive at TP of `1,844. Maintain Accumulate.

Edelweiss' research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) Q1FY19 revenue, EBITDA and adjusted PAT growth of 11.2%, 20.6% and 22.5%, respectively, came in line with our estimates. The 12% YoY volume growth also came in line with our estimate. What’s even more encouraging is that the growth was broad based aided by gradual improvement in demand. Gross margin expanded ~197bps on account of favourable mix and judicious pricing. EBITDA margin also rose 185bps YoY despite ad spends jumping 27.4% YoY (up 155bps YoY)—the right strategy in our view.

Outlook

New launches, performance of Indulekha & Ayush and revival of rural demand are potential triggers. Maintain ‘HOLD’ as from current level (52.7x FY20E EPS), the stock offers limited upside.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever started off the financial year 2018-09 on a mixed note as profit and domestic volume growth and profit met analyst expectations while profit missed estimates.

The stock has touched fresh record high of Rs 1,779 intraday on Monday ahead of earnings announced after market hours.

The share price rallied 23 percent during the quarter ended June and shot up 30 percent in 2018 so far, on top of 65 percent gains in previous year. In fact, it more than doubled since 2017 on hope of rural growth and normal monsoon.

The overall growth was also partly due to low base in year-ago.

Here are five key takeaways from April-June quarter earnings:

Profit

The company said profit on standalone basis grew by 19.2 percent to Rs 1,529 crore for the quarter ended June, backed by domestic volume growth and operational performance.

Profit in same period last year was Rs 1,283 crore. Analysts estimates for the profit were at around Rs 1,535 crore.

Revenue

Revenue from operations increased 11.2 percent to Rs 9,487 crore in Q1FY18 compared to Rs 8,529 crore in corresponding period last fiscal.

Analysts estimated revenue at around Rs 6,700 crore.

""We have delivered another strong performance in the quarter, with double digit volume growth across all three divisions and further improvement in margins,"" Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman and Managing Director said in a statement.

He feels crude volatility and currency led inflation are key risks going ahead. ""We will continue to manage business dynamically while driving operational efficiencies.""

Operational Performance

EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) surged 20.6 percent to Rs 2,251 crore during the quarter compared to Rs 1,866 crore in same period last year and margin improved by 183 basis points to 23.73 percent.

HUL said cost of goods sold were lower on account of mix, judicious pricing and a strong saving program, but advertising and promotions were stepped up to support innovations, activations and respond to competitive actions in the market place.

Volume Growth

Combined market capitalisation of nine of the 10 most valued companies surged by a whopping Rs 1,58,882.34 crore last week, helped by an overall strong broader market and smart surge in the valuation of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) continued to rule the market cap chart followed by RIL, HDFC Bank, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), HDFC, ITC, Infosys, Maruti Suzuki India, Kotak Mahindra Bank and SBI in the week to Friday.

ITC was the sole loser in the top 10 list.

After a phase of consolidation, the market posted its biggest weekly gains in six months in the week gone by. But the rally was led by select large-cap stocks like Reliance Industries and TCS, and was not a broad-based one.

Hope of better earnings growth in Q1FY19, stability in the rupee and crude oil prices, and stable global cues boosted investors' sentiment.

The Nifty managed to end the week a tad above the 11,000-mark, gaining 2.3 percent, while the Sensex hit a record high of 36,740.07 and ended 2.5 percent higher at 36,541.63.

But the broader markets underperformed the benchmark indices, with the BSE Midcap index gaining just 0.3 percent and the BSE Smallcap index gaining only 0.85 percent during the week.

After such a sharp rally in benchmark indices, the market is expected to consolidate in the coming week before moving towards its earlier record highs, experts said.

According to them, stock-specific action is also likely as it would be an action-packed week, with a lot of big corporate earnings (including those of nine Nifty stocks) scheduled to be announced.

""We may witness profit-booking in the coming week,"" Rahul Sharma, Senior Research Analyst, Equity99, told Moneycontrol.

""The focus will now shift on management commentary and guidance in the coming months which most fund managers will use it as an opportunity to reshuffle their portfolio,"" Sharma said.

A similar sentiment was echoed by other market participants as well.

""We will continue to see stock-specific approach as heavyweights like HDFC Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Ashok Leyland, Zee Entertainment, Ultratech Cement, MindTree, Bajaj Finance, and Kotak Mahindra Bank are scheduled to report their quarterly earnings,"" Gaurav Jain, Director at Hem Securities, told Moneycontrol.

Here are 10 key factors that will keep traders busy next week:

Earnings

With the June quarter results season kicking off, investors will been keenly watching the various earnings announcements that are scheduled to take place in the week to come.

In the past week, TCS' earnings beat analysts' expectations, while those of IndusInd Bank were stable. IT major Infosys reported a mixed set of numbers for the quarter gone by.

More than 100 companies will declare their earnings for the June quarter this coming week, including Hindustan Unilever, Zee Entertainment, ICICI Lombard, Ashok Leyland, UltraTech Cement, Mindtree, Bandhan Bank, Reliance Communications, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, RBL Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ABB India, Wipro, L&T Finance, Bajaj Auto and HDFC Bank.

Hindustan Unilever

The Indian subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever Plc is likely to report a 18.6 percent year-on-year increase in its April-June quarter net profit to Rs 1,538 crore on Monday.

According to a Reuters poll of analysts, the FMCG major's revenue is seen rising 14.73 percent YoY to Rs 9,638 crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) will likely rise 19.2 percent to Rs 2,224 crore.

Brokerages expect the company's volume growth to be in the range of 11-14 percent, as against a flat volume growth in the year-ago period because of disruption in trade channels before the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST).

The management's commentary on rural demand and the company's pricing strategy in the wake of rising prices of some commodities, especially crude oil, are key things to watch out for.

HDFC Bank

HDFC Bank, the country's second largest private sector lender, is expected to report a rise of over 20 percent in its net profit for the quarter ended June.

Brokerages said its net interest income is seen rising 15-20 percent and that it could also report a healthy other income number.

""We expect 20 percent YoY growth in advances along with stable net interest margin (NIMs). Non-interest income should be healthy, growing 21 percent YoY. We expect elevated provisioning to continue (as has been the trend since last 5 quarters). Deposits are expected to continue to show strong traction,"" KR Choksey said in its report.

Commentary on growth outlook for FY19, increasing competition in the retail space and consequent margin pressure will need to be monitored along with credit cost guidance, the brokerage said.

Prabhduadas Lilladher said the bank would continue to report steady earnings growth but that its NII will be slightly weaker as NIM could be under pressure. ""Loan growth will be led by unsecured credit, home loans (as bank bought back good quantum) and corporate book,"" it said.

Kotak too expects the lender's NII growth to be marginally lower than its loan growth of around 20 percent. ""NIM will decline 10 bps QoQ. Loan growth on the corporate side (NCLT cases refinancing) could be strong along with retail (mostly led by unsecured loans),"" the brokerage said.

Bajaj Finance

Bajaj Finance is expected to report another robust set of numbers for the June quarter. Brokerages estimate the company's bottomline to rise 35-45 percent YoY and its net interest income to increase 30-40 percent. Assets under management (AUM) are seen increasing 35 percent.

""For Bajaj Finance, Q1 and Q3 are seasonally strong quarters in terms of asset growth. We expect AUM to increase by 37 percent YoY to Rs 94,093 crore led by the consumer finance segment and in that mainly aided by the consumer durable segment,"" ICICI Securities said in its research note.

The brokerage said the company's calculated NIMs are expected to come in higher than 11 percent. ""No negative surprise is expected on the asset quality front. PAT of Rs 869 crore is estimated, up 44 percent YoY,"" it said.

KR Choksey expects Bajaj Finance's AUM to grow 35 percent YoY, owing to the company's dominant position in the consumer finance segment.

""We expect stable NIMs of 11.5 percent to aid NII growth of 29 percent. Reducing asset quality pressure should translate into lower credit costs, aiding PAT of Rs 830 crore, up 37 percent YoY,"" KR Choksey said.

The brokerage said that cost structure will need to be monitored as the company has been making investments in tech and digital (as part of BFL 2.0) and expanding its branches.

""Further, commentary on reviving SME lending and scaling up BHFL (housing finance sub) will need to be watched out for,"" it said

Kotak expects the NBFC to report loan growth of 35 percent, which along with a stable NIM, will push NII up 36 percent. ""Cost-income will remain stable at 44 percent YoY,"" the brokerage said.

Macro Data

WPI along with Manufacturing, Fuel and Food inflation data for June month will be released on Monday. WPI rose by 4.43 percent in May, after a 3.18 percent rise in the prior month.

Foreign exchange reserves for the week ended July 13, and deposit and bank loan growth for the week ended July 6 will be announced on Friday.

Technical Outlook

In the passing week, the Nifty surpassed psychological 11,000-mark for the first time since February 1, 2018 and managed to hold the same at close, forming bullish body candle.

On top of that technically, it did not break its Thursday's intraday low of 10,999.65, which indicated that the market may consolidate further before moving towards earlier record high of 11,171 seen in January.

Experts feel the index has to close above Thursday's intraday high of 11,078.30 to show strength that can push it above 11,100 and then to earlier record high.

""The index finished off the week above the higher end of the range 10,600-10,900. Hence, 10,900 may now act as the pivotal support for the next week. Candle pattern on the weekly chart suggests, index bulls are quite confident about the benchmark index making higher highs,"" Stewart & Mackertich Wealth Management said.

Hence, traders and investors may again accumulate blue-chip stocks on dips, it added.

Further, thorough technical study of the weekly as well as the daily chart patterns suggests, Nifty broader trading range for the coming week is expected to be 10,900-11,120, the report said.

""In the near future, we may witness profit-booking in the coming week as Nifty formed a 'Shooting Star' which is treated as a short-term reversal pattern,"" Rahul Sharma, Senior Research Analyst, Equity99 told Moneycontrol.

He expects the short-term trend to reverse only after Nifty trades below the low of 10,999, which is also a crucial support while resistance is around 11,100-mark.0

IPO

The Rs 1,125-crore initial public offering of TCNS Clothing will open for subscription for three days during July 18-20, 2018.

The IPO comprises an offer for sale of 1,57,14,038 equity shares by Onkar Singh Pasricha, Arvinder Singh Pasricha (promoters), Anant Kumar Daga, Saranpreet Pasricha, Angad Pasricha, Vijay Kumar Misra and Amit Chand (other selling shareholders) and Wagner Limited (investor), which will constitute up to 25.63 percent of the post-offer paid-up equity share capital.

Ashish Chaturmohta

Domestic equity markets got off to a negative start to F&O expiry week, amid trade war concerns. The Nifty lost 0.6 percent to close at 10,753 on Monday.

The market breadth was in favour of declines with two share declining for every one gaining. After Friday’s rally, the market failed to show follow through action on the upside.

The index has been facing resistance at the falling resistance trend line connecting the highs of 11,172 and 10,929 levels. It faces resistance at 10,835-10,860 levels and needs to clear this hurdle which will confirm strength on the upside. On the downside, 10,700 levels is now critical support level from where buying emerged last week.

The rising support trend line connecting the lows of 9,952 and 10,418 levels comes around 10,700 levels. The triangle pattern formation emerges with the market at a critical juncture from where a break out on either side will provide direction.

A break below 10,700 levels will see resumption of the downtrend and the Nifty might retest 10,550 levels. On the upside, a rally above 10,860 levels can see the index moving rally towards 10,929 levels which is its May high.

In Nifty options, 10,800, 10,700 and 10,600 puts witnessed large amount of unwinding, while 10,800, 10,900 and 11,000 calls saw a significant amount of writing activity, suggesting upside is likely to be capped and that lowers levels may be tested.

Here is a list of top 5 stocks that could return 7-11 percent in the next 1 month:

Hindustan Unilever Limited: Buy| CMP: Rs 1,615| Stop loss: Rs 1,580| Target: Rs 1,750| Return 8%

The stock is in a long-term uptrend forming higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily and weekly charts. After the recent run-up move in the price, the stock has been consolidating its gains at all-time high levels between Rs 1,625 and Rs 1,550 odd levels for the last one month.

The 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) has been providing support on dips and the stock has been moving higher. Current bounce back has also been from the average.

RBL Bank Limited: Buy| CMP: Rs 559| Stop loss: Rs 535| Target: Rs 620| Return 11%

The stock has been trading sideways to negative between Rs 600 to Rs 450 odd levels for more than a year now. It has formed a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern on the weekly chart and witnessed a breakout on strong momentum and high volumes couple of weeks back.

After hitting a 52-week high of Rs 570, the price has corrected on below-average volumes to test the breakout level and then bounced back. The Relative strength index has given positive crossover with its average.

Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips to Rs 552 with a stop loss below Rs 535 for a target of Rs 620 levels.

Lupin Limited: Buy| CMP: Rs 913| Stop loss: Rs 880| Target: Rs 1,000| Return 9.5%

Since then the price has been trading in a narrow range on below-average volumes consolidating its gains. It has formed a bullish pole and flag continuation pattern on the daily chart which is typically expected to give a breakout on the upside.

JM Financial's research report on Hindustan Unilever

The Chairman’s statement refers to FY18 as the ‘seventh consecutive year of both topline growth and margin improvement’ – we don’t think there are many other companies who can boast of margin-expansion for seven years in a row. Other positives include: 880bps improvement in ROE, 17% growth in cashflow from operations plus 39% FCFF growth, working capital fell further to -10.9% of sales vs -9.3% - these are now par for the course. What we found interesting were: 1) The way royalty has been classified this year in the annual report to now exclude ‘fees for central services from parent company’ which is no longer being clubbed as part of ‘royalty’ – this re-classification pegs royalty rate at 1.9% of net sales and is now below the 2% threshold specified by SEBI above which shareholder approval could be required under the new proposals. 2) HUL’s contribution to exchequer fell 21% YoY while its net profit rose c.20%. A large part of this decline is likely attributable to the reduction in GST rates on HUL’s portfolio, benefits of which, as per management, has been entirely passed on to consumers through effective price reductions.

Outlook

Stock seems priced for perfection to us – even if profits grow 20% p.a. over each of FY19-20E, a 50x PER on that earning would yield a mid single-digit return vs CMP.

Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) is planning to use artificial intelligence (AI) to predict customers' grocery needs, according to a report by Mint.

A software with AI functionality will be used to track a customer's record over the previous three months.

How will the software work?

According to the report, the list of items a customer has purchased will be saved along with quantity and date of purchased at a grocery shop.

Helped by AI technology, the shopkeeper will be able to check purchase history of a customer. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

“HUL’s data strategy would be how do we acquire, how do we store, how do we use this data and how do we manage it. In this VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) world, HUL will prefer to disrupt than be disrupted,” the company said, according to the report.

According to the report, the company will be using predictive analytics, named Jarvis which uses AI technologies that will gauge demand, volume, sales, and profit, the report suggests. HUL is also aiming to focus on e-commerce. Currently, 1.5 percent of its overall revenue comes from e-commerce.",199,

Two years after splitting its foods and refreshments (F&R) business into two separate units, FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) today said it will integrate the food and refreshment categories in South Asia effective July 1.

""This integration will help HUL increase organisational agility and better serve local consumers while harnessing the advantage of global scale. The integration of these two categories is also in alignment with the structure of Unilever globally,"" HUL said in a regulatory filing.

On June 2, 2016, HUL had announced that it will split its F&R business into two separate units in line with its global category structure.

As per the new integration, Sudhir Sitapati Executive Director, Refreshments at HUL will be redesignated as Executive Director F&R and will be responsible for integrated F&R business.

Geetu Verma, Executive Director Foods, India will be moving to the Dutch port city Rotterdam as Global VP-Nutrition & Natural Platforms, Unilever.

""This is a new role designed to grow Unilever's presence in the health and well being sector,"" the company added.

HUL said the F&R business has delivered consistent growth in India.

""It lends significant scale to Unilever in the region and will continue to be a strategic priority for the business. The company believes this integration will help drive synergies, become more agile and consumer centric,"" it added.",230,0.9998953193426132

Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) is planning to launch traditional breakfast options such as khichdi and upma, The Economic Times reports.

The move is a departure from their previous strategy to introduce consumers to a global menu.

The new products will be launched under the company's ayurveda brand Ayush. The products will be made of jowar, bajra and other millets.

The products will give competition to the ready-to-cook breakfast products of MTR, Kellogg's, PepsiCo and Marico.

The brand will also provide stiff competition to Baba Ramdev's Patanjali, which plans to launch Indian breakfast products later this year, the report added. Patanjali already sells ready-to-eat oats and cornflakes.

""Lever Ayush Foods marks our entry into the health and naturals food segment. With our brand vision of traditional ingredients being made contemporary, we will be able to democratise the benefits of ayurveda-inspired recipes to the Indian consumer and do our part in making India healthy,"" Geetu Verma, executive director - foods at HUL, told The Economic Times.

The company will address consumers' health concerns, which stem from the use of preservatives in packaged foods, the report added.

Motilal Oswal

For the third consecutive quarter, all consumer companies under the coverage of Motilal Oswal which have a rural reach of over 30 percent have stated that rural growth has outpaced urban growth.

Rural demand had been the fulcrum of the strong volumes witnessed by the sector in the years leading up to FY14 but had slowed down in FY15 and FY16 because of drought, and in FY17 because the impact of demonetization had negated the potential positive benefits of a normal monsoon.

While urban volume growth has remained fairly resilient at mid-single-digit levels, rural growth, which was growing at the 1.5-2x urban growth in the years leading up to FY14, declined to flat and even negative levels in the years that followed.

Factors which are fuelling rural growth are normal monsoon in FY18, low base effect, increase in MSP in FY18, an increase in rural allocation in recent budgets.

There are four factors in particular which brighten the prospects of a further recovery in rural demand to earlier high levels:





Initial reports by both Skymet and IMD indicate that the monsoon is likely to be normal in FY19.



Unlike the preceding two years, there will (hopefully) be no disturbances like demonetization/GST implementation, impacting purchasing power or product availability.



Likely spate of new launches in FY19, as demand trajectory is improving.



Distribution expansion by most companies over the past 3-4 years will start bearing fruit.

Motilal Oswal has a buy rating on all four stocks that have a high rural exposure which include names like Hindustan Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Dabur India and Emami. Hindustan Unilever, Emami and Britannia Industries remain top rural picks from a medium-term perspective.

Hindustan Unilever:

Five key trends are particularly relevant for Hindustan Unilever, resulting in an elevation in its earnings growth trajectory compared to the past:





its rapidly improving adaptability to market requirements,



its recognition of Naturals as a key subsegment across categories,



continuing strong trend towards premiumisation;



extensive plans to employ technology, and



renewed emphasis on margin growth through ZBB and other cost-saving efforts. Allied with best-of-breed RoE, Hindustan Unilever remains sole buy in the large-cap FMCG universe.



Motilal Oswal believes Emami remains a credible long-term play due to:





healthy growth likely in existing product categories where it has a dominant market share,



best-of-breed R&D spend and A&P spend, resulting from innovative products as well as ability to back up innovation with strong marketing, and



much-needed efforts on improving direct distribution reach.

At 29.4 times its estimated earnings per share for FY20, Emami is inexpensive relative to peers, particularly given the healthy long-term earnings growth opportunity and mid-30s return ratios.

Britannia Industries:

While Britannia is currently an urban company because rural is only around 20 percent of sales, a combination of:





its remarkable efforts in distribution ramp up- both in direct and total reach over the past four years, and



its success in its new strategy of Low Unit Packs of its premium products as well as 'Tiger' Creams have resulted in tremendous growth in the hinterland states in recent years with FY18 being particularly strong.

The management is targeting 33 percent of sales from rural. Rapidly expanding distribution, continuing investments in R&D and significant expansion of its own manufacturing indicate the immense confidence that management has on the growth prospects.

Colgate Palmolive India:

Motilal Oswal is optimistic on Colgate Palmolive’s earnings prospects, given:





its impressive execution after a delay in the herbal portfolio launch – the two products launched have seen a good response, and more products will be rolled out under the Vedshakti umbrella, and



its high rural market share of 60 percent, which makes it a promising play on rural recovery. Patanjali had severely impacted business initially, but the threat is perceptibly reducing.

Even on FY18 EPS, Colgate Palmolive trades at 10 percent discount to our ex-cigarette and alcohol consumer peer valuations. With return ratios superior to peers barring Hindustan Unilever, such discounts are unwarranted.

Dabur India:

The much-vaunted earnings revival in the sector appears poised to come through, and rural-dependent plays are likely to be at the vanguard in FY19.

Dabur has addressed the market share loss issue in its two key categories of Juices and Honey, while Oral Care continues to do very well. With an expected EPS CAGR of 16 percent going forward (v/s less than 12 percent CAGR over FY14-17), Motilal Oswal values the stock at 42x March 2020E EPS (10 percent premium to three-year average) and derive a target price of Rs 435.

Relative to other three rural plays, DABUR has a much more diversified product portfolio and is not dominant in many of them. Weaker competitive advantage, therefore, results in some risks to earnings projections. RoE is also weaker than the peers mentioned above.

The Nifty is now trading above its crucial short-term moving averages and today’s intraday low of 10,524 will be of big importance in the coming week, suggest experts. A break below this level could again put further pressure on the index amid expiry week volatility.

On the upside, the next target for the index is placed at 10,733 levels but bulls will be able to take full control of the index if it surpasses 10,929 which was recorded on May 15, 2018.

The Nifty which opened at 10,533 slipped marginally to hit an intraday low of 10,524. Bulls took control of the index and pushed Nifty above 10,600 to hit an intraday high of 10,628 before closing the day at 10,605, up 91 points.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,543.47, followed by 10,481.73. If the index starts moving upward, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,647.47 and 10,689.73.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 26,273.6. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 26,094.8, followed by 25,916.0. On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 26,389.0, followed by 26,504.4.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR has reported a robust 11% volume growth and 240bps margin expansion as benefits of cost efficiency programs and improved product mix have boosted profitability. Medium term outlook looks encouraging given 1) gradual pick up in rural demand 2) sustained benefits from GST 3) normalisation of trade channels 4) low base for 1Q and 2Q19 and 5) success of new launches in naturals segment. Although HUL expects increase in competitive activity and higher input costs, sustained benefits of Premiumisation in Home Care, success in naturals with Lever Ayush, Citra, Indulekha etc. and strong growth in emerging categories (premium laundry, hand wash, Liquid dish wash, Hair conditioner, Face-wash and Green tea) will enable steady margin expansion. We slightly tweak our numbers and increase EPS estimates by 2% for FY19 and 1% for FY20.

Outlook

We remain positive on the long term structural story; however, expect back ended returns post 53% returns in past 1 year. We retain Accumulate with a target price of Rs1555 at 43xSept20 EPS (Rs1387, 42xMarch 20EPS earlier).

Dolat Capital's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Q4FY18 posted robust volume and operational performance abetted by – (1) favorable rural base (2) normalisation of trade channels and (3) revamp of rural growth. We believe that the performance was encouraging considering HUL reported 8.5%/7.4%/18.0%/15.4% revenue/volume/EBITDA/APAT CAGR over Q4FY16-Q4FY18 compared to 0.6%/4%/11.7%/18.3% over Q4FY15-Q4FY16. In addition, HUL reported better volume performance compared to peers like Dabur, BCL, Marico, GCPL, etc. We expect that the volume growth would remain high in the coming quarters considering revival in the rural markets - 6%+ volume growth over a medium-term can be taken sanguinely considering the size of the company. GM and EBITDA margin expansion at an unfavorable base (highest Q4 GM in 10 years+) indicates that the margins have not peaked yet and the company would continue to gain from its operating efficiencies. Going ahead, we believe HUL would benefit from the favorable base, favorable monsoon this season, GST benefits and benefits of seventh pay commission.

Outlook

We value HUL at 50x to arrive at TP of `1,614. Upgrade to Accumulate.For all recommendations report, click here

Hindustan Unilever, which hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,603.60 per share, surpassed cigarette-to-soap major ITC in terms of market capitalisation in intraday trade on Friday to become the fourth largest valued company on the BSE and most valued firm in the FMCG space.

HUL’s MCap stood at Rs 347,103 crore when it touched its 52-week high on Friday, whereas ITC's MCap was Rs 346,052.78 crore at around the same time.

Outperformance by HUL helped the company surpass ITC. HUL has been gaining momentum, while ITC has merely held on to the same level where it was in the last one-year.

In the last one year, HUL rallied from Rs 1,006.35 per share recorded on May 17, 2017 to Rs 1,569.25 per share seen on May 17 this year, which translates in an upside of nearly 56 percent. On the other hand, ITC slipped to Rs 279 per share on May 17 from Rs 281.85 per share recorded on May 17, 2017. This translates in a fall of little over a percent.

Most global brokerage firms maintain a strong buy on HUL post its Q4 result. They have raised their target price for the FMCG major which translates in an upside of six percent. In the case of ITC, most global brokerage firms maintain their recommendation on the stock with a 12-month target price of Rs 340 per share.

Here’s what global brokerage firms are recommending on both ITC and HUL post Q4 results:

Global brokerage firms on HUL:

CLSA: Outperform| Target raise to Rs 1,650 from Rs 1,575

CLSA maintains an outperform rating on HUL post Q4 results but raised its target price to Rs 1,650 from Rs 1,575 earlier. Hindustan Unilever's 11 percent volume growth is best in class, said the CLSA note.

The management commentary is also fairly positive, with a decisive pick-up seen in the rural growth. “The rural segment has improved but we need to wait a few more quarters to establish any trend,” added the note.

Credit Suisse: Outperform| Target raise to Rs 1,675 from Rs 1,530 earlier

Credit Suisse maintains an outperform rating on HUL post Q4 results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 1,675 from Rs 1,530 earlier.

HUL saw a strong pick-up in volume growth trend while margins expanded despite a jump in ad spend. The volume growth is at 11 percent mark which is a significant acceleration in the trend on the base of 4 percent, said the Credit Suisse note.

The management still looks to expand operating margins in FY19 despite the expectation of a rise in inflation led by higher crude oil prices.

Morgan Stanley: Underweight| Target raise to Rs 1,260 from Rs 1,120

Morgan Stanley maintains an underweight rating on HUL Post Q4 results but raised its 12-month target to Rs 1260, from Rs 1120 earlier.

The Q4 suggests worst in terms of volume growth for the industry, but worst may well be over. The brokerage firm estimate around 9 percent volume growth in FY19. HUL stocks trade at 30 percent premium to last 12-year average price to earnings ratio.

Global Brokerage firms on ITC:

Morgan Stanley: Overweight| Target: Rs 320

Morgan Stanley maintains an overweight stance on ITC post Q4 results with a target price of Rs 320. Cigarette volumes declined 2.5 percent which was broadly in line with estimates.

The key positive from the Q4 result was the cigarette EBIT growth which stood at 7.6 percent. Overweight rating is premised on the expectation of a steady cigarette tax policy, said the report.

CLSA: BUY| Target: Rs340

CLSA maintains a buy rating on ITC post Q4 results. The Q4 was in line with our expectation although other businesses were much weaker.

The Cigarette volumes declined around 3 percent on a YoY basis, a shade worse, highlighted the CLSA report. FY18 capex was around Rs33bn while the dividend payout was at less than 70 percent.

Jefferies: BUY| Target: Rs 330

Jefferies maintains a buy rating on ITC post Q4 results with a 12-month target price of Rs 330. The Q4 revenue, EBITDA, and PAT came broadly in line with our estimates.

There was a strong improvement in FMCG segment profitability. Jefferies expects FY19 to be a recovery year for the cig. business given likely lower tax hikes, it said in a report.

Hindustan Unilever is likely to report 12.03 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in the net profit at Rs. 1,326.5 crores, as per a Reuters poll of equity analysts.

Net sales are seen rising 9.26 percent YoY to Rs. 8,850 crore, according to the poll.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) are likely to increase 9.5 percent YoY to Rs. 1,900 crore.

Brokerage firms expect volume growth to be in the range of 6-8 percent.

The company will announce its financial results on May 14.

This will be the first full quarter after the company cut down product prices across its portfolios.

Nirmal Bang in its report said, “We believe that encouraging response for Lever Ayush, continuing premiumisation trend, its disproportionate share in modern trade channels, growing presence in both mass and premium naturals segments, new launches and signs of rural growth coming back on track could help the company to post strong volume-led growth.”

Analysts said that on the cost side, its initiatives like Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) will continue to bring down the overheads, but there will be some pressure on gross margin because of rising cost of crude oil.

Despite the pressure on input prices, analysts expect operating margin to grow 170 basis points YoY led by a higher share of the premium portfolio and cost optimisation measures.

Growth in rural markets, a growth of naturals portfolio, premiumisation trend and input prices are the key things to watch out for during the earnings presentation.",256,0.7034539803862572

The Nifty rallied 6.2 percent in April after falling 8 percent in February and March which resulted in a strong bull candle on Monday's daily candlestick chart. Formation of a strong bullish candle suggests that momentum is strong and there is a higher possibility now for the index to hit levels closer to 10,900, experts suggest.

The index has been forming higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart for the last three trading sessions which indicates that the supports are gradually shifting higher.

However, owing to relentless strength displayed by the bulls in the last five weeks a pause or minor correction can’t be ruled out going forward. Experts advise traders to keep a stop below 10,600 for all long positions.

The Nifty which opened at 10,705.75 on Monday slipped marginally to hit an intraday low of 10,704.60. It hit an intraday high of 10,759 before closing 47 points higher at 10,739.35.

The Nifty50 which reclaimed its crucial psychological resistance level of 10,600 made a bullish candle on the daily charts on Thursday. The index took support at its 5-days exponential moving average (DEMA) for the third day in a row.

However, Nifty witnessed selling pressure around its crucial resistance level of 10630-10640. Hence, for bulls to regain control of D-Street, a close above 10640 is required which would open fresh target towards 10900 in May series, suggest experts.

Option data suggests an immediate trading range in between 10500 to 10700 and traders are advised to remain on the long side. Level of 10500 will act as crucial support for the index. Investors should keep a trailing stop loss below 10,530 for long positions.

Fresh Put writing was seen at 10500 and 10600 strikes while significant Call writing was seen at 11000 and 10700 strikes.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,575.54, followed by 10,533. If the index starts moving upward, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,644 and 10,670.

The Nifty witnessed selling pressure post opening but managed to retrace about 50 percent of its intraday losses which made a ‘Hanging Man’ kind of pattern on the daily charts.

The market witnesses a significant selloff in the trading session just like we saw in Wednesday’s trading session but still manages to recoup some of the losses and closes below the opening level.

The index opened at 10612.40 which was similar to its intraday high of 10612.60. Bears pushed the index below 10600 to hit an intraday low of 10536 before closing at 10,570, down. The index closed below its 5-days exponential moving average (DEMA) placed at 10572.

Traders are advised to remain cautious ahead of F&O expiry on Thursday as there could be wild movements on either side. But, as long as 10500 holds, bulls have nothing to fear, for now.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Market demand has been improving gradually over the past few quarters. Encouragingly, growth has been broad-based across categories and regions.Central India continues to do better than the rest of the regions for HUL, in line with the company’s strategy. Although rural performance has improved substantially, rural demand growth is yet to reach the buoyant historical levels, when it was 1.5-2x of urban demand growth. 3QFY18 had the benefit of a low base, which would be missing in 4QFY18.

Outlook

Consequently, we expect 18.8% EPS growth over FY17-20, as against 6.1%/10.6%/10.7% EPS CAGR over the last 3/5/10 years. We maintain our Buy rating with a revised target price of INR1,515 – a target multiple of 46x and moving to Mar’19E EPS (5% premium to three-year average due to significantly improved business fundamentals).For all recommendations report, click here

We met Mr. Sanjiv Mehta, MD & CEO of Hindustan Unilever (HUL). Key takeaways were: i) Long term opportunity in India remains attractive; ii) HUL remains agile as the Indian consumer is changing, riding global consumer trends; iii) The company is focused on bigger and faster innovations like Lever Ayush (did well in most geographies); iv) Categories of the future are growing at 2.5x HUL’s growth rate; and v) The company is getting future-ready by inculcating a growth mind-set, enriching capabilities, high performance anatomy along with purpose and values. In our view, new launches, clinical validation of Indulekha and pan-India roll out of Ayush along with revival of rural demand are potential triggers. Maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

We envisage HUL to be key beneficiary of anticipated rural recovery and herbal push. We estimate better-than-expected volume growth (trend too indicates the same) and with rural revival in the offing, we retain our target multiple of 47x and arrive at TP of INR1,518 on FY20E EPS.

Kalra, a seasoned global marketing professional was hired by Snapdeal in 2016 from Unilever.

While Kalra confirmed that she is now an employee at McKinsey & Co, she declined to comment on her immediate role. Snapdeal did not respond to an email.

According to a person privy to the development, Kalra will be helping clients in designing marketing campaigns at McKinsey & Co., which she joined in December.

Kalra's exit comes at a time when Snapdeal is trying to get back on its feet in the market after facing a turbulent year.

The company which was in talks for a merger with the larger rival Flipkart last year called off the deal talks.

In August 2016, Snapdeal announced Rs 200 crore as a marketing budget for a 360-degree campaign in the run up to Diwali.

It was soon followed by the company unveiling its new logo and the Unbox Zindagi tagline in a bid to re-position itself as it faced tough competition from rivals Flipkart and Amazon. The company also changed the color combination of its logo to vermello instead of the earlier red and blue combination.

Snapdeal advertised the campaign heavily across all media -- TV screens, airports, YouTube, metro and bus stations.

While the high decibel brand campaign helped the company garner attention, it couldn't rescue it from the downfall that came after the investors including Softbank declined to pump in more money.

Kalra has pursued a post graduate diploma from the Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow.

Towards the end of last year, company’s key executives Rajiv Mangla and Anup Vikal too put in their papers.

“We have issued anti-profiteering notices to three more companies on Friday. Primary investigations have begun,” a source in know of the matter told Moneycontrol.

MUST READ | Notices to car dealer, realtor for not passing on GST benefits to customers

The development comes less than a fortnight after the finance ministry sent first set of notices under anti-profiteering mechanism to a Bareily-based Honda car dealer and real estate developer Pyramid Infratech.

Last week, Moneycontrol had reported that few more companies, including an FMCG firm, would come under the government’s scanner for profiteering and not passing on the benefits of reduced taxes and input tax credit under the new indirect tax regime--Goods and Services Tax (GST).

Currently, Director General Safeguards, the investigative arm of the department of revenue under finance ministry has started an investigation in these three cases.

DG Safeguards has asked these firms to provide their balance sheet, trial balance and profit and loss account for last one year.

In the next three months, the body will have to establish if it is a case of profiteering, the official said, adding that the final findings of the investigation will then be sent to the National Anti-Profiteering Authority (NAA).

NAA is the top decision-making body under GST’s anti-profiteering mechanism, headed by a chairperson BN Sharma and four technical members.

Under the GST-related laws, the government had introduced an anti-profiteering clause to ensure businesses transfer the benefit of the tax credit to the consumer by making products cheaper.

The framework of the body comprises a standing committee, screening committees in every state as well as the Directorate General of Safeguards. If consumers feel that the benefit of a rate cut is not being passed on to them, they can approach the state’s screening committee for relief.

The government has received a total of 169 fresh complaints under GST’s anti-profiteering mechanism, for not passing on to consumers a reduction in price. The establishment of the authority has become even more significant now as the government cut rates of over 300 items since the rollout of GST, out of which prices of 211 products were brought down on November 15.

Two applicants have alleged that Hardcastle Restaurants, through their outlet Mc Donald’s Family restaurant charged the same amount for “Mc Cafe Latte” before and after November 15. (Read the notice here)

Similarly, a Ghaziabad-based consumer has complained that popular apparel and cosmetic outlet Lifestyle International Pvt Ltd did not pass on the entire benefit of tax reduction after November 15 on “Maybelline Fit Me Foundation”. (Read the notice here)

Besides, another consumer has alleged that Jaipur’s Sharma Trading Co had kept the price of Vaseline “VTM 400ml” between September and November, despite rate cut. (Read the notice here)

In November, that Cabinet approved setting up of National Anti-Profiteering Authority and appointed the Chairman and the four technical members. It was only in last week that the government released the official form for anti-profiteering under GST that can be used by a consumer to register a complaint.

HUL is the best play on two structural trends -- premiumization and shift to organized due to GST. We expect OPM to increase by 350-400 bps over FY17-20E on multiple margin tailwinds. Maintain BUY with revised TP of Rs 1,400 based on forward P/E of 44x. We justify a higher than usual target P/E given the 19% EPS CAGR over FY17-19E.

JM Financial's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We believe the HUL stock could continue to do well on the back of this result, whether or not we agree with the heady valuation of 49-50x NTM EPS that it currently trades at. Sales grew 10% on comparable basis with volume growth of 4% - inline with expectations but not really great, especially considering the favourable base - volumes were down 1% in the base quarter; management cites the continued slackness in rural demand to be the reason for the slower pace of recovery. Margin sprung a big positive surprise again and helped boost earnings a great deal – like-to-like expansion was to the tune of 180bps led by strong GPM expansion (c.240bps like-to-like, as per our workings) and cost-efficiencies program (‘Other Expenses’ up merely 1%) which were partially offset by higher A&P (Ayush national roll-out). This drove 20% growth in EBITDA (3% ahead of forecast) but was, however, not entirely reflected in Segment results (+11%) - a function of re-grouping of some cost-items.

Outlook

We maintain our BUY rating on the stock with unchanged TP.For all recommendations report, click here

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Hindustan Unilever

HUVR's 2QFY18 net sales rose 5.9% YoY to INR83.1b. Domestic consumer business grew 10% YoY, with 4% underlying volume growth. EBITDA increased 19.5% YoY to INR16.8b (est. of INR15.6b) and PAT (bei) by 14.2% YoY to INR12.4b (est. of INR11.9b). EBIT margin expanded by 390bp YoY for Home care, 130bp for Personal care, 110bp by Foods and 280bp for Refreshment.

Segmental performance: Home care and Personal care revenues were up 13% and 8% YoY, respectively. Sales of Foods and Refreshments - the relatively small segments - were up 10% and 11% YoY, respectively.

Gross margin expanded 320bp YoY to 52.7%. High ad spends (+150bp YoY) and a slight increase in employee costs (+20bp YoY) were partially offset by lower other expenditure (-70bp YoY). Thus, EBITDA margin expanded 230bp YoY to 20.2%. Comparable margin expanded 180bp YoY.

1HFY18 comparable domestic consumer business grew 8% YoY, with EBITDA margin expansion of 170bp YoY.

Concall highlights: (1) Expect gradual improvement in rural demand. (2) Input costs starting to inflate. Management expects further inflation. (3) Lever Ayush now available nationally across channels, but with a focus on urban areas.

Outlook

Revival of rural growth is already underway, and is likely to pick up steam. HUL has all the levers for earnings revival in place, especially when the imminent rural recovery is allied with the benefits of low base of preceding years, return of price part of sales growth, lower promotion spends and continuing premiumization. 2QFY18 again demonstrated the company's ability to grow volumes in a difficult operating environment, increase advertising levels and yet report robust profitable growth. Consequently, we expect EPS CAGR of 18% over FY17-20, well above 6.1%/10.6%/10.1% on 3-year/5-year/10-year EPS CAGR. Return ratios and dividend yield are best-of-breed. We maintain target multiple at 10% premium to 3-year average (effectively 48x Sep 2019E EPS), leading to a TP of INR1,440. Maintain Buy.For all recommendations report, click here

Edelweiss' research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) 4% YoY volume growth in Q2FY18 came in line with our estimate, while 20% EBITDA spurt was marginally ahead. The volume growth is decent considering: (i) quarter was characterised by GST transition; and (ii) sub-par CSD performance. HUL’s ad spends were aggressive—up 20.2% YoY (peers cut back)—largely to back new launches like Ayush and Citra, which is the right strategy, in our view. Sustained cost rationalisation measures led to comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 180bps YoY. New launches in the natural space (skincare under brand Citra), clinical validation of Indulekha as well as pan-India roll out of Ayush are potential triggers. Maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

Long-term positive; maintain ‘HOLD’ . We envisage HUL to be key beneficiary of anticipated rural recovery and herbal push. At CMP, the stock is trading at 44.4x FY19E EPS. On better-than-expected EBITDA, we revise up FY18/19E EPS 3.0%/0.7%, respectively, and also our target multiple to 45x (earlier 44x) to arrive at revised target price of INR1,290 (INR1,253 earlier). Maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ since at CMP stock offers limited upside.For all recommendations report, click here

Anubhav SahuMoneycontrol Research

It has been a smooth transition to GST for Hindustan Unilever (HUL) as it posted a volume growth of 4 percent. Volume pick-up was broadly uniform with both urban and rural areas benefitting from a lower base and restocking. While we acknowledge the improved operating performance, the key factors to monitor would be the traction in natural portfolio, premiumisation trend and the pick-up in rural growth. Investors need to be watchful about raw material cost inflation and the competitive intensity.

Quarterly update: Comparable sales growth of 10 percent YoY

HUL posted a like-for-like sales growth of 10 percent, taking GST accounting impact into consideration, with a volume and pricing mix of 4 percent and 6 percent respectively. Comparable EBITDA margin improvement of 180 bps YoY was driven by lower cost of goods that was partly offset by higher advertising spend and employee costs.

While the surge in raw material costs was lower than the topline growth, in the near term, inputs costs are expected to edge higher.

As far as GST transition is concerned, company took price cuts of about 3‐4 percent which had partially offset gains on the input taxes received.

CSD (Canteen Stores Department) channel uptick

Unlike some of the other FMCG players, HUL reported fast recovery in the CSD channel (~7 percent of HUL’s sales) wherein sales to the channel is now 85 percent of the normal level. While a part of the uptick could be related to restocking from the diminished levels in the last quarter, the company has guided for near normalcy in the near future.

Wholesale channel remains a laggard but sale through modern retail channel has picked up.

Gradual improvement in rural areas

Volume pick-up was similar in both urban and rural areas. Further, HUL expected a steady improvement in rural demand with near normal monsoon, government’s spending on infrastructure and support from MSP (minimum support prices) for the crops in place.

Premiumisation trend continues; focus on naturals

With premium portfolio roughly contributing 25 percent of sales, HUL’s management appeared confident on the premiumisation trend. The company mentioned double-digit growth in brands like Surf and Rin. In personal care, Indulekha hair oil witnessed strong growth.

The foods segment reported 11 percent YoY with strong support from Kisan and new variants in Knorr.

HUL’s recent focus is on the naturals range led by its Lever Ayush campaign, which is positioned for the intensely competitive ayurvedic/naturals category.

Oral care remains a let-down

While HUL is pursuing a new Lever Ayush push for the oral care, overall oral care growth remains subdued, impacted by intense competition and market share loss to Patanjali and Dabur.

Elevated valuations

Overall, HUL posted a good recovery in volume and had a relatively smooth transition through GST. While its focus on the natural portfolio is worth noting, competitive intensity cannot be wished away. Key trends to watch out in near term are premiumisation, competitive intensity led by Patanjali and pick-up in rural growth. The stock trades at an expensive valuation of 45x 2019e earnings that leaves little room for near-term upside.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Wholesale in the south and west regions has returned to normative levels. Other parts are still lagging, though. Cash and Carry is picking up some slack from the slowdown in wholesale. For July sales, offline reconciliation on GST has been done with all leading distributors. It will take until October for complete reconciliation. Canteen Stores Department (CSD) is going through a transformation on checks and balances. Thus, up-stocking has not yet happened. Sales are not completely normal even now from this channel. Rural demand is expected to improve gradually. Early to call out now. There have been clear signs of pressure on small players; expect market share improvement for organized and larger players with direct reach.

Outlook

We expect HUVR to report 18% PAT CAGR over FY17-19, as against 6.1% in the last three years, 10.6% in the last five years and 10.7% in the last 10 years. While valuations are not cheap at 45.2x FY19E EPS (given potentially strong earnings growth), we believe premium valuations are justified, particularly as return ratios and dividend yield remain best-of-breed. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a target price of INR1,400 (46x Sep’ 2019E EPS; 10% premium to three-year average valuations).

Campaigns for the two fairness variants -- Fair & Handsome Instant Fairness Facewash and Fair & Handsome 100 per cent Oil Clear Instant Fairness Facewash -- were contested by HUL on grounds of use of language and misleading the consumer among others, the spokesman said.

Pidilite Industries: SELL| Target Rs. 753 | Stop-loss Rs. 798 |Upside 5%

Despite gaining a momentum during the closing week, Pidilite Industries traded on consolidation mode through the week and lost about 3 per cent on weekly basis with a negative bias.

We have a SELL recommendation for Axis Bank which is currently trading at Rs. 489.7

Hindustan Unilever: BUY| Target Rs. 1195 | Stop-loss: - Rs. 1125 | Upside: - 4%

Hindustan Unilever came under pressure throughout the week despite marking a weekly-high at 1208 level but it failed to cohere on the level. On weekly basis, the stock was down by about 3 per cent despite the gaining momentum.

However, the volume growth witnessed during the same timeline didn’t support the uptrend movement in price.

On the weekly chart, the stock made a marginal upward trend supported by volume despite closing on a negative trajectory. This formation may confirm the end of further consolidation during the next week opening trade.

The technical outlook suggests a relative buy regime at the current price. Further, the stock is facing an upper circuit at 1208 level witnessed during last trading session followed by a support level at 1120.

We have a BUY recommendation for Hindustan Unilever which is currently trading at Rs. 1152.8

Axis Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Net sales, EBITDA and Adj. PAT grew 5%, 14% and 15%. FMCG volumes stood flat YoY, affected from GST led destocking in Jun-17. On the back of cost efficiencies and stable input costs, OPM expanded 176 bps YoY to 21.9% YoY. Gross margin expanded 90 bps YoY to 51.4%. GST led issues continue in July but should get sorted in next few months.

Outlook

Volume growth should see uptick in H2FY18E. Valuation at FY19E P/E of 42xis justifiable given the strong earnings growth and the fact that it is the best play on two structural trends (premiumisation and shift from unorganized due to GST).

Outlook

HUL being the largest player in consumer sector has seen improvement in margins with single digit growth in Q1FY18. HUL strategy to remain same like investing in its brands, focusing on core business with innovative products and margin and volume lead growth with improvement in cost across its segments. However with slow demand on rural area it focus to remain on improving demand. With GST implementation we believe there will be win-win situation for consumers as there will be reduction in price of certain products which will benefit consumers. HUL being market leader in many of its categories we expect revenue growth of around 5% in FY18E & FY19E, while EBIDTA and PAT margins to be around 18.1% and 13.2% in FY19E. At CMP 1158, HUL is trading at EPS of INR 23.2 its FY19E and we are revising the price target to INR 1206 with “HOLD” rating on the stock and an upside of 4.2% as we remain optimistic about the demand scenario, premium products of the company, brand recall, innovative products, etc against its competitors.For all recommendations report, click here

Edelweiss' research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported in-line Q1FY18 revenue growth of 4.9% YoY, while EBITDA (14.1% YoY) and PAT (14.9% YoY) growth surpassed estimates. Volumes remained flattish versus our 1-2% YoY dip estimate; this is commendable, especially in light of destocking by CSD as well as trade channel imbalance on GST rollout from July 2017. Benign raw material prices helped gross margin expand 91bps YoY and 104bps QoQ. This, coupled with cost rationalisation (ZBB strategy) and calibrated A&P spends, aided EBITDA margin jump 173bps. New launches in the natural space (launched skincare natural brand Citra) as well as pan-India roll out of Ayush have been successful. We envisage HUL to be key beneficiary of GST and recovery in the staples space. Maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

We expect HUL to be key beneficiary of share gains helped by GST. Increased launches in the natural space and higher GST rate for herbal products are likely to boost share gains. At CMP, the stock is trading at 40.6x FY19E. On better-than-expected Q1FY18 numbers, we revise up FY18/19E EPS 2.6%/4.2%, respectively, and also our target multiple to 44x (earlier 40x) to arrive at revised TP of INR1,253 (INR1,106 earlier). We maintain ‘HOLD/SP’.

ITC which got hammered on Tuesday after the government increased the cess on cigarettes but it is unlikely to lose its charm among fund managers, suggest analysts. The smart money is unlikely to move out considerably from ITC or HUL.

The number of funds holding ITC increased from 376 recorded in the month of May to 381 in the month of June with an aggregate market value of Rs16,593 crore, according to Morningstar India data.

On the other hand, the number of funds holding HUL decreased from 219 funds in the month of May to 211 funds in the month of June with an aggregate value of Rs3664 crore.

The decision of GST Council meeting earlier this week to increase the cess on cigarettes wiped out Rs50,000 crore of investors’ wealth on Tuesday from ITC when the stock crashed nearly 13 percent.

The stock had plunged 15 percent in intra-day trade on Tuesday, the sharpest fall in a decade, to hit a low of Rs 276.4 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The increase in cess, according to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, was taken to “reduce profiteering by companies and harm to public health,” but that didn’t go well for investors.

After a sharp fall, there were reports that smart money might move into HUL which might become the next favoured choice for investors in the FMCG space.

However, analysts which Moneycontrol spoke to have a mixed view as 2 out of 3 experts feel that ITC will still attract smart money as HUL is trading at slightly stretched valuations.

“We believe ITC will give superior returns after Tuesday’s fall. In past as well, tax rates have been increased on several occasions. This could be a temporary phenomenon and the FMCG major is available at reasonable valuations compared to other FMCG players,” Rahul Shah, VP - Equity advisory, MOSL told Moneycontrol.

“On one hand, HUL trades at a rich valuation. The biggest problem with the sector is volume growth, so after this event, we might see some volume de-growth in ITC. But, lower valuation augurs well for ITC,” he said.

Increased compensation cess on cigarettes leads to 8-9 percent increase in effective tax rate for ITC. If ITC takes a price hike then it might lead to lower sales and single-digit EBIT growth in the cigarette business.

Reacting to the news event, most global brokerage firms have already downgraded the stock and lowered their respective target price.

Credit Suisse downgraded ITC to neutral from outperform and also slashed target price to Rs310 from Rs400 following cut in FY18-20 estimates by 10-12 percent.

Morgan Stanley, too, downgraded the stock to equal-weight from overweight and reduced target price to Rs 285 from Rs 395, saying it is a clear negative with obvious impact on volume growth and valuation multiples.

According to the research house, ITC will need 12-13 percent weighted average cigarette price hike here on with around 20 percent price increase in KSFT segment to offset the tax increase.

Given that ITC has already taken around 4 percent price hike versus an average of FY17, it expects an incremental 8-9 percent pricing action over the next few days, said the report.

Investors should understand that the fall in ITC's share price is a temporary phenomenon seen due to a hike in the effective GST rates on cigarettes.

“If we have a look at the past tax increase on cigarettes in the past budgets the history suggests it is a non-event from a profitability point of view. In fact, falls arising from such an event always was a great opportunity to invest,” Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities told Moneycontrol.

“The 5-year CAGR sales growth of ITC has 6.74 percent while HUL's sales have grown by only 4.2 percent. ITC's profits have increased by 6.25 percent 5-year CAGR while HUL's have increased by only 3.2 percent 5-year CAGR. This shows that even after the tax hikes, ITC performs better than HUL,” he said.

Modi further added that the smart money is more likely to move to ITC because HUL is currently trading at a PE and PB of 66 and 37 times respectively while ITC is trading at PE and PB of 36 and 8.52 respectively.

Commenting on the price action, Modi said that ITC's stock plummets at every tax hike and then start rising again in 20-25 days. This is the right time to buy the stock.

However, some analysts are of the view that HUL will find some flows trickle into the counter post increase in cess on ITC after the FMCG major reported a stellar performance in the June quarter.

HUL delivered a stellar performance in Q4FY2017, beating D-Street expectation with high single digit revenue growth and OPM improving by almost 100bps despite a significant increase in the raw material prices.

“HUL is a better play in the FMCG as it will be one of the key beneficiaries of implementation of GST and recovery in the rural demand,” Kaustubh Pawaskar, analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.

“We expect volume growth to improve in H2FY2018 and would gradually improve in the subsequent years. So, it becomes a better play in the large cap FMCG space. We believe that investors might opt for stocks with better-earning visibility in the term coupled with decent valuations at the current juncture and wait for a better entry point to enter HUL,” he said.",909,-0.20056946410073173

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever is expecting the rural demand to revive on good monsoon and loan waivers to farmers by some states.

Besides, HUL is looking up to its trade partners to soon attain ""normalcy"" post GST and is working closely with them to restore it.

""We are expecting rural demand to build back gradually and good monsoon would help in that direction. Rural demand has been on weaker side for last few quarters and we are hoping that with a good monsoon coming, it will turn,"" HUL Chief Financial Officer P B Balaji said.

Why Monsoon Is Critical For India And Its Economy

On the impact of GST on rural areas, he said: ""Rural trade has more impact of GST in comparisons to the urban trade because they are taking time to understand it.""

Earlier, he said rural trade was growing faster than the urban but now it is almost growing at a similar level.

""... the fact is that loan wavers are happening, money would be in the hands of the rural people. Infrastructure investment, better support prices, these things should start putting money back in the hands of people,"" said Balaji in a post earning conference.

According to Balaji, trade stocks are building back to normalcy post GST.

""We need to work with the trade to ensure whatever concerns they have and clarification they require. We are closely working with them to address it,"" he said.

Large retailers as well as the modern trade retailers barring the first one week, most of them are back on track and they are buying normally.

However, CSD were of big concerns as they were out of market for almost 45 days and have started buying from last two three days only, he added.

""We have to work with them closely to ensure that they restock them as they would be running on a very thin pipeline,"" he added.

Balaji said there are some confusion in the market at the level of small dealers and the company is helping them out.

""These are the priority for us for one month to ensure that it is sorted out and we are back in business as usual post GST as we were in pre GST,"" Balaji added.

""The build up is expected to be gradual over the next few months because of the wholesellers. We need to carry them along and explain the situation and take them forward in the journey,"" he said.",476,-0.011972179015477499

Hindustan Unilever shares touched a fresh record high of Rs 1,190, up 3.2 percent intraday Tuesday ahead of earnings for the quarter ended June 2017.

The FMCG major is expected to report flat growth in profit at Rs 1,175 crore against Rs 1,174 crore in same quarter last fiscal, according to analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Revenue is seen rising 2.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 9,040 crore while operating profit may increase 4 percent to Rs 1,700 crore and margin may expand 20 basis points to 18.8 percent compared with year-ago quarter.

Underlying volume growth is seen in the range of 2 percent degrowth to 2 percent growth against 4 percent each in year-ago quarter and previous quarter.

Analysts expect 2-3 percent revenue growth in personal care segment (soaps, shampoos, skincare & oral care, cosmetics) that contributes 50 percent to total revenue and 70 percent to EBIT.

According to them, home care segment (Surf Excel, Rin, Wheel, etc), which accounts for 30 percent of revenue and 20 percent of EBIT, may post 1-2 percent revenue growth.

Analysts feel any announcement of bonus, special dividend or buyback may enhance shareholder value as Unilever PLC had said that they were looking at various ways to expedite enhancement of shareholder value (after rejecting Kraft’s takeover deal).

The stock gained more than 38 percent in 2017 on hopes of normal monsoon, revival in earnings growth etc.

HUL Chief Financial Officer P B Balaji took home a salary of Rs 8.33 crore for the period under review, although he also did not get any raise in 2016-17.

According to the company's Annual Report, the ratio of compensation of Mehta to median renumeration of employees stood at 138.44 per cent and that of Balaji at 81.36 per cent.

However, HUL Executive Director, Supply Chain, Pradeep Banerjee and Executive Director, Legal & Corporate Affairs and Company Secretary, Dev Bajpai received hikes of 8 per cent each in their salaries and took home Rs 4.75 crore and Rs 4.69 crore, respectively.

In the case of Banerjee and Bajpai, the ratio of their salaries to median renumeration of employees was at 46.48 per cent and 45.93 per cent, respectively.

Stating that the increase reflected the market practice, HUL said: ""The renumeration paid during the year is as per the renumeration policy of the company."" However, the percentage increase in the median remuneration of the company's employees for the financial year was 3.42 per cent only.

The company had 5,976 permanent employee on its roll as on March 31, 2017.

Average percentage increase made in the salaries of the employees other than the managerial personnel in FY2016-17 was 5.57 per cent whereas the increase in the managerial remuneration was 3.1 per cent.

The average increases every year is an outcome of the company's market competitiveness as against its peer group companies, the company said.",285,0.9916664958000183

Edelweiss' research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported in-line Q4FY17 revenue growth of 6.4% YoY, while EBITDA (12.2% YoY) and PAT (7.6% YoY) growth surpassed estimates. Volume growth of 4% YoY was a sharp recovery from the 4% YoY dip in Q3FY17 with domestic growth of 8% YoY aided by healthy pricing growth (recouped after many quarters).

Outlook

HUL is key beneficiary of share gains helped by GST. Increased launches in natural space will contain share loss and propel growth. However, success of new launches is key. Impact of cannibalisation on core portfolio is a monitorable. At CMP, the stock is trading at 36.5x FY19E. We maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ with target price of INR 1,106.

ICICI Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

We believe that in sync with the global parent’s outlook on margin expansion, HUL’s margin will also improve led by premiumisation and thrust on rationalisation of marketing expense. The company is taking initiatives for effective and efficient marketing spends by rationalising on campaigns and media platforms.

Outlook

We are, thus, estimating revenue, PAT CAGR of 9.2%, 13.4%, respectively, in FY17-19E with 210 bps margin expansion in the same period to 19.6% in FY19E. We reiterate out BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 1120/share.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Domestic consumer business rose 8% YoY, with underlying volumes growing 4% YoY (adjusted for pipeline correction, 2.5%-3% growth v/s est. of -0.5%). EBITDA increased by 12.2% YoY to INR 16.5b (est. of INR 14.6b) and adj. PAT by 6.2% YoY to INR 11.2b (1.4% above estimate).

Outlook

With forecast of normal monsoon, HUL has all the levers for earnings revival in place, especially when allied with benefits of low base of preceding years, return of price part of sales growth, lower promotion spends, continuing premiumization and government schemes (DBT implementation, a 24% increase in rural outlay in the budget, farm loan waiver in Uttar Pradesh, etc.). Return ratios and dividend yield are best-of-breed. We target 45x FY19E EPS (5% premium to 3-year avg.), resulting in TP of INR 1,165.

Shares of Hindustan Unilever swung between gains and losses through the morning session despite steady Q4 results as the global selloff could have rubbed on to the stock. Profit booking due to stellar run in the past few sessions could also have dragged the stock.

The FMCG major had posted 6 percent rise in its March quarter net profit at Rs 1,183 core against Rs 1,114 crore posted during the corresponding quarter of last year. Its volume growth came in much ahead of what analysts polled by CNBC-TV18 had accounted for.

Analysts have largely cheered the results and have given positive views on the stock. The ones with positive views see an upside potential of 17 percent, while analysts with bearish tones see 27 percent downside.

Brokerage: Macquarie | Rating: Outperform | | Target: Rs 1,062 | Upside: 6.4%

The brokerage observed that HUL’s domestic volume growth of 4 percent was supported by re-stocking the trade channel. A higher volume growth also becomes the key catalyst for the stock, it said.

Macquarie also increased earnings by over 2 percent for FY18/19 on higher margin. The rating of outperform is based on recovery prospects in FY18 and margin rise, driven by parent strategy.

Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,150 | Upside: 15%

Jefferies said that the FMCG major remains its top pick in the large cap consumer space. Analysing its results, it said that robust growth in sustained refreshments such as tea delivered broad-based, double-digit growth. Meanwhile, modest growth in packaged goods such as Knorr growth was impacted by a strong comparator. Weakness in demand and increase in competition can put pressure on earnings estimates, the brokerage firm added.

Brokerage: Nomura | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,057 | Upside: 4.7%

Nomura observed that a sequential improvement in volume growth signifies recovery post demonetisation. It also sees pricing action returning to the portfolio.

The global research firm maintained revenue growth estimates at over 13.5 percent for FY18 and FY19, while margin estimates were increased to build in over 70 basis points improvement in margins to FY19.

Having said that, Nomura sees a challenge in further potential upside from current levels. Its top picks from the sector include Emami and Dabur India.

Brokerage: Citi | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,050 | Upside: 14%

Citi said that while results were better than other companies, better value was seen in ITC and Emami. It tweaked revenue growth by over 1 percent for FY18 as it dialed back some expected price hikes. The target multiple, Citi said, is pegged to the trailing 3-year average.

Brokerage: Bank of America Merrill Lynch | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,110 | Upside: 7%

Monsoon, buyback or special dividend and GST-linked gains in the second half are key triggers to the stock. Price hikes will support margin. The global investment firm does not expect large valuation de-rating, given the improving earnings growth trajectory.

Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Neutral| Target: Rs 1,025 | Upside: 17%

Broad-based growth witnessed across categories was impacted by high base, JPMorgan observed. The downside risk is on topline growth if the volume growth recovery is slow. It recommends buying into dips.

Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Underweight | Target: Rs 795 | Downside: 21%

The global brokerage firm said that an important lever of margin expansion will be brand and marketing investments’ savings. It sees a risk of de-rating if the market doubts volume growth recovery with respect to the company.

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 1,100 | Upside: 13%

Credit Suisse said that FY18 margin can expand over 100 basis points as the company has many tools to save margin. It sees consumer demand is improving but still subdued. The global brokerage firm also sees a disruption in Q1 on the back of a GST roll out. It raised earnings estimates by over 2 percent on expectation of better margin.

Brokerage: Goldman Sachs | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 788 | Downside: 27%

Goldman Sachs increased FY18-20 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 6-8 percent to reflect higher sales growth and margins. Faster rural recovery, higher GMs are the key upside risks, while high input costs and competition are the key downside risks.

At 15:16 hrs Hindustan Unilever was quoting at Rs 987.20, down Rs 19.15, or 1.90 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week high of Rs 1,014.00.",800,0.4002488578359286

JSW Steel

Brokerage: Citi | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 225

The global brokerage firm cut earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 2 percent for FY18 and raised it by 4 percent for FY19. It believes impact on China steel prices is on sentiment than demand.

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 240

The brokerage firm raised FY18 earnings per share (EPS) by 4 percent given higher sales volume guidance. With coking coal rates stabilising, domestic prices/ export offers are a key for the company.

Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 220

Morgan Stanley continues to project higher steel prices in FY18 over the previous fiscal. It said that guidance of 5 percent volume growth implies 92 percent utilization in FY18 and muted growth in the next fiscal.

Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 225

It expects multiples to hold up even as debt inches up. Expansion by the firm is timely, given the implied profitability protection. Any large acquisition could be negative for the company if funded entirely by debt. Key risks include very weak domestic demand and higher costs.",767,0.15103394676137855

Axis Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Volume growth should improve to 2-3% in Q4FY17 (vs. 4% decline in Q3FY17) and should see further uptick in FY18E. We estimate net sales/EPS CAGR of 13%/18% over FY17-19E. Valuation at FY18EP/E of 39x is not cheap but reasonable vs. peers (Nestle, Marico, APNT trade at 45x).

Outlook

After maintaining a neutral call on HUVR for past two years, we upgrade it to BUY on the back of (i) multiple margin tailwinds, (ii) slow but steady improvement in volume growth and (iii) reasonable valuations vis-à-vis peers. Our TP of Rs 1,010 is based on forward P/E of 36x.

A hostile takeover bid by US major Kraft Heinz recently has led Dutch-British transnational consumer goods-maker Unilever Plc. to evaluate its operations in terms of the value creation for investors.

The company, which has a multitude of brands catering to its consumers’ daily needs, is considering selling off its spreads division and has announced share buyback worth USD 5.3 billion this year, apart from raising dividend by 12 percent.

Here’s a look at how these decisions by the parent company could affect the Indian arm Hindustan Unilever. HUL, with annual net sales of over Rs 32,400 crore contributes roughly 14 percent to Unilever’s emerging markets business. The EM business, in turn, contributes roughly 57 percent to Unilever’s total sales.

The Indian unit, which had taken to aligning businesses in line with the global structure, had in June last year separated its foods and refreshments business into two categories. Under the new arrangement, these units might have to be re-merged.

It is interesting to note that while this business segment contributes nearly 50 percent of Unilever’s overall global revenue, in India, it contributes less than one-fifth. However, there is significant growth opportunity for this business. A Goldman Sachs (Asia) report suggested the size of the foods and beverages market in India, including alcohol and tobacco, in 2015 was USD 100 billion.

The more challenging part for HUL will be contributing to Unilever’s plan to trim costs to achieve an operating margin of 20 percent by 2020. This translates to a jump of over 350 basis points from 16.4 percent posted by the parent in 2016. HUL posted EBITDA margin of 17.5 percent in the nine-month period up to December 2016.

While HUL’s personal care segment is already above the targeted margin, the home care segment, where margins currently languish in single digits, might face the strain. Another area of high competition is the packaged foods business. HUL has had a patchy past in this segment and even as revenues have trebled in the past seven years, it has been unable to grow much in size. This business, covering products like flour, salt, sauce, jams, soups and ice creams under brands like Annapurna, Kissan, Knorr and Kwality Walls, has generated only Rs 2,117 crore in FY16 with margin of barely 5-6 percent.

With competitive pressures mounting, forgoing market share for profitability could prove detrimental. So, if the parent insists on meeting targets, HUL might simply have to let go of certain segments.

Advertising expenses is an area which the company could contain. Advertising expenses have been about 11-12 percent of its revenues for a little over a year now.

But as is the major fallout of any cost-cutting exercise is the measures taken to trim overhead expenses including manpower. An Economic Times report today suggests HUL might be considering job cuts. Layoffs, the report says citing sources, could be to the extent of 10-15 percent and could be accompanied by a freeze or reduction in new hiring.

According to its FY16 annual report, HUL has 18,000 employees on board its Indian factories and offices. This includes managerial staff of over 1,500.

Analysts suggest while HUL already gives away a chunk of its net cash generated from operations in dividends, the parent’s drive to increase shareholder value might cause strain on the Indian arm's balance sheet and up the risk of higher royalty pay-out which has already more than doubled in the past four years. As per the royalty agreement, Unilever can increase the payment up to 3.15 percent of HUL’s turnover by FY18.",601,-0.20050954818725586

With each passing day, the micro data from companies makes the macro GDP numbers look puzzling.

Savour the latest takeaways from the analysts’ call of Bharat Financial Ltd. The microfinance company said that improvement in collections has been slow: 4.4 percent of the portfolio has remained overdue for more than two months. In the normal course, this course would have been recognised as NPA (along with income reversal). In addition, the shortfall in collections in the off book (6-12 percent) i.e. loans lent through business correspondents. In the quarter before demonetisation, the company had only 0.1 percent of gross non-performing assets or GNPAs.

While Equitas Holdings and Ujjivan Financial Services —other finance companies that lend to small borrowers have not yet given us the latest tally — saw scars in their Q3 performance. Fresh loan disbursements fell 20-25 percent from the previous quarter and that was because the collection of dues fell from their usual 99 percent-plus levels. Equitas it had loan defaults of Rs 145 crore, which it didn’t have to recognise because of the Reserve Bank of India’s relaxed rules.

Going up the food chain, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services said its GNPAs would have risen to 12.5 percent from 11.1 percent in the previous quarter but it was saved by RBI’s relaxed rules. Shriram Transport would have seen a jump in bad loans from 6.6 percent to 7.3 percent. Both saw barely any growth in loans.

The lack of demand or purchasing power of the Indian consumer was writ large on two-wheeler sales. Hero Moto, Bajaj and TVS saw sales dip by 5-22 percent in the months of November and December against a growth in sales of about 4 percent in the previous quarter. In fact, even in January and February, these companies continued to report 5-10 percent of lower sales from year-ago levels.

Among consumer companies basket, Asian Paints reported a 3 percent growth in Q3 volumes versus 12 percent in Q2 and 16 percent in the third quarter a year ago. Hindustan Unilever saw a 4 percent contraction in sales against a 6 percent growth year ago and 1 percent contraction in the previous quarter. Dabur saw a 5 percent contraction in volumes versus a 4.5 percent growth in the previous quarter, though its year-ago quarter saw poor volumes. And Britannia saw a 2 percent volume growth in Q3 versus an 11 percent growth year ago; while Marico saw a 4 percent contraction as against a 10.5 percent growth in sales volumes year ago.

The GDP numbers themselves show that the gross value added (GVA), which is growth, net of taxes, has slowed to 6.6 percent. But even this growth wouldn’t have been 6 percent had not the previous year’s number been revised lower just a few weeks before the release of the Q3 GDP numbers. The CSO’s revision of the 2015-16 GDP numbers of January 31 this year was puzzling. Overall, GDP growth was revised higher from 7.6% to 7.9%. The GVA for Q1, Q2 and Q4 were revised higher. Only for Q3 of 2015-16 the GVA was revised lower by about Rs 12,000 crore.

Even in the flattering 6.6 percent GVA — not counting the farm output and government spending — would have risen by only 5.8 percent.

Finally, making a mockery of the entire data collecting exercise is the GDP from the expenditure side which indicates that private consumption in the third quarter rose by 10.6 percent in the October-December period. If the top 10 listed consumption companies have reported contraction in sales volumes, it is tough to see which part of India was consuming so much.

One hopes the woefully divorced macros and micros of the Indian economy will be patched up somewhat next year when the revised GDP number for 2016-17 will be announced.",644,-0.7069616847568088

Moneycontrol BureauHaldiram's, the desi snack-maker, which began as a small-town enterprise is now a global phenomenon and is giving its competitors a run for their money.

The brand understands the India palate very well and is now twice the size of Hindustan Unilever’s packaged food division or Nestle Maggi, and its turnover is more than the India turnover of the two American fast food companies Domino’s and McDonalds’s together, states an Economic Times article.

Haldiram’s besides being a market leader in traditional snacks is also bigger than its five rivals combined– Balaji Wafers, Bikaji Foods, DFM Foods, Bikanervala and Prataap Snacks.

Despite the strict scrutiny from the food regulator amid Maggi issue, revenues of Haldiram’s grew 13 percent and crossed FY16 revenues of Rs 4000 crore.

The company operates in three different regions. One is Haldiram Snacks and Ethnic Foods caters to the northern region. Two, Nagpur-based Haldiram Foods International serves the western and southern regions and a much smaller Haldiram Bhujiawal caters to the eastern markets.

The now famous brand which started with a small shop in Bikaner in 1937, is owned by the Agarwal family. It has survived many a disputes and break-ups but is still standing strong and tall.

It is the second largest Indian food brand after Parle.

Kamal Agarwal, fourth-generation member of the founding family said, “We have increased our reach and developed products in-house that ensure quality control. We also understand Indian palate well and that comes handy while launching new products,”

The packaged products business that now contributes over 80 percent of the revenues for the company, initially started off with restaurants and casual dining.

The famous western snack giants like Pepsi Frito Lays and ITC Foods is now slowly entering into Haldiram’s turf like Pepsico’s Kurkure which now has 16 variants of Indian Namkeen and Paper Boat is soon to enter this category.",321,0.6655457417170206

From soap and shampoo to cement and automobiles, businesses have seen the demonetisation move punching red marks on their balance sheets, even as they continue to put on a brave face on hopes for ""long-term gains from this short-term pain"".

An analysis of the latest-quarter results of listed firms shows that the government's ambitious exercise of withdrawing old Rs 500/1,000 notes led to adverse impact on businesses across the sectors, though not many have publicly criticised the move and the likes of Rajiv Bajaj are only an exception.

The companies having acknowledged the negative impact of the demonetisation move in their financial statements for the October-December quarter, although mostly by expecting it to be a positive game-changer and a 'new normal' in the very next sentence, include giants from the groups like Ambanis, Tatas, Birlas, Mahindras, ITC, Hindustan Unilever, Dabur and Bajaj.

""Pace of domestic demand growth slowed down due to demonetisation of old currency notes during the quarter.

However, demand is expected to revive as the effects of demonetisation are absorbed and the economy readjusts to the new normal,"" Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) said.

Regarding its Reliance Retail unit, RIL said the demonetisation led to cautious buying by customers for a short period, though some segments actually saw faster growth during that time - a trend largely attributed to digital payments.

At petro outlets also, there was a tepid growth in sales on a quarter-on-quarter basis, which the company said, was due to demonetisation since Reliance petro outlets were not allowed to accept demonetised currency unlike PSU outlets.

In an investor presentation, Aditya Birla Group's UltraTech described the note ban as ""short-term pain and long-term gain"" and listed a number of short-term adverse impact such as ""acute liquidity crunch"", reduction in purchase volumes as also impact on GDP and currency rates.

However, for long term, it expected a number of benefits such as fall in inflation and interest rates, increase in public spending and strengthening of organised sector.

Ultratech said the segments most impacted immediately included daily wage earners, transporters, households and retail sales, while for cement sector in particular it expected demand to be impacted due to cash squeeze in system.

Tata Group firm Titan Company, in a quarterly update for third fiscal quarter, said all its consumer-facing businesses witnessed a ""drastic slowdown for a few days"".

While the sale in modern retail and dedicated retail channels recovered soon after, ""the sale in the trade channel in watches (the multi-brand outlets) has taken a hit and is yet to recover as most transactions in these outlets have been on cash basis,"" Titan said last month.

On November 8, 2016, post the demonetisation announcement by the Prime Minister, many Tanishq stores experienced a huge rush of buyers and sales were abnormally high. After that, there was a brief period of lull post which Tanishq's average daily sales were close to the average daily sales pre-demonetisation, the company added.

Mahindra and Mahindra said the auto industry was impacted due to demonetisation in the third quarter, with all segments of auto and tractor industry showing substantial drop in demand during November and December 2016, while the impact was more on rural sales than in the urban areas.",547,-0.568967308316912

He now expects FY18 Nifty earnings growth of 17 percent with small downside risk due to margin concern.

Hindalco

Citi has reiterated buy rating on Hindalco, with increased target price at Rs 235 from Rs 200 after third quarter earnings. With limited capex, the brokerage house expects debt-to-equity at 1.2x by FY18 from 1.4x currently. Long-term fundraising of up to USD 750 million indicates company's aim to deleverage, it says, adding focus is on the growth of downstream products.

Morgan Stanley says December quarter earnings were in-line, with momentum strong in aluminum business driven by higher realisation & lower cost while copper business was miss driven lower by-product realisation. The brokerage house has overweight call on the stock, with a target price at Rs 219.

HPCL

CLSA has downgraded HPCL to sell from outperform, with increased target price at Rs 540 from Rs 480 and EPS for FY17 by 8 percent & by 1-2 percent for FY18-19. Core refining margin was disappointing for third straight quarter, the brokerage house says, adding it relaxed EV/EBITDA multiple to 7.5x from 7x earlier.

It sees low chance of a further large inventory gain to boost profits. Any slowdown in marketing volume growth may question valuation of company, it says. CLSA feels value of stake in Bhatinda refinery increased to USD 1.2 billion as it raised multiple to 2x.

Nomura continued like oil marketing companies and its pecking order is IOC, HPCL and BPCL. The brokerage house has retained buy call on the stock, with target price at Rs 560, though it feels refining was marginally weaker, with reported Q3 gross refining margin at USD 6.4 a barrel.

NMDC

Credit Suisse has maintained underperform rating on NMDC, with target price at Rs 120 (implying 17 percent downside), saying while FY17 EPS is lowered by 3 percent, it incorporated a 1-3 percent rise in FY18/19 EPS.

The company missed Q3 expectations largely on multiple write-offs, but it should benefit from exports as margin may rise due to higher iron ore rates, it feels. Credit Suisse believes the local oversupply would keep rate hikes in check.

As Q4 earnings were in line, Citi has maintained neutral rating on NMDC, but increased target price to Rs 150 from Rs 130 as it raised FY17-19 profit by 11-57 percent on better prices & volumes.

Motherson Sumi

Citi has maintained sell call on Motherson Sumi, with target price at Rs 245 after Q3 results were broadly in-line with estimates. Strong earnings were driven by healthy business and EBITDA included Rs 34.6 crore of forex gain.

SMP missed estimates, where EBITDA was impacted by startup cost of new plants. Growth in standalone revenue was driven new models and higher content per vehicle. There was no immediate impact on orders due to expectation of border tax in US, the brokerage house says.

Citi feels revenue growth target of USD 18 billion for FY20 seems optimistic and priced in. The stock may see potential derating in case of a possible FY20 revenue target miss.

Nomura has retained buy rating on Motherson Sumi, with increased target price at Rs 405 as it expects domestic business to sustain healthy 17 percent FY17-19 revenue CAGR.

It has retained 16.5 percent/18.5 percent revenue CAGR FY17-19 for SMR/SMP led by healthy order wins and expects PKC acquisition to be largely EPS neutral on FY19 estimates, the research firm says.

Overall, Citi lowered its FY18-19 revenue & EPS estimate by over 7 percent, 2 percent post Q3 result and expects stock to perform as it delivers strong 34 percent+ EPS CAGR over FY17-19.

Petronet LNG

After stable Q3 numbers and earnings trajectory is at inflection point, Morgan Stanley has overweight rating on the stock with a target price at Rs 403. Volumes are strong and supported core earnings.

Goldman Sachs feels Petronet LNG's Q3 EBITDA was in-line and net income beat due to lower tax rate. The brokerage house does not expect a major stock price reaction.

Sadbhav Engineering

CLSA says Q3 execution saw a marked pick-up led by roads EPC. It believes financial closure on new roads should drive a rebound in execution and expects an EPS CAGR of 29 percent over FY17-19.

It likes company's focus on roads & tolls in the traffic-rich western corridor. The stock is also a play on mining, it says.

The brokerage house has a buy call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 345.

GSK Consumer

JPMorgan has overweight call on the stock, with a target price at Rs 5,830, though Q3 earnings disappointed on sharp revenue decline.

Tata Motors

According to Deutsche Bank, US tax reforms could be highly disruptive for global auto companies. The brokerage house has a buy call on the stock, with target price at Rs 575.

Hindustan Unilever

While maintaining a buy call on HUL, with target price at Rs 1,000, Bank of America Merrill Lynch says demonetisation-led impact on domestic sales is waning quickly and it is positive about emerging prospects and hence margin goals restated.

Increase in raw material costs is expected to be passed on and GST may cause initial disruptions, but benefits are large, it feels.

AIA Engineering

Nomura feels mining market share gains has been driving growth. Hence, it raised FY18/19 EPS by 4-8 percent on mining market share outlook improved. The brokerage house has a buy call on the stock with increased target price at Rs 1,650 from Rs 1,475.

Godrej Consumer

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has retained buy call on Godrej Consumer, with a target price at Rs 1,665 as demonetisation-led overhang is not as bad as feared.",927,0.41746026561373756

ITC is in the process of hiking prices of some of its cigarette brands. Distributors and dealers claim that the new packs with higher prices will hit the market in a few days. In the premium category (Classic) the price hike is 13 percent. For instance, a pack of Classic, which cost Rs 123/125 for a pack of 10 before the Budget, will now be priced at Rs 139/Rs 140. India Kings, which was priced at Rs 135 will now be priced at Rs 150, which is an increase of 11 percent. Price of Goldflake Kings will also increase from the current Rs 123/Rs 125 to Rs 139/Rs140. ITC sells numerous cigarette brands, some of which are Silk Cut, Navy Cut, Insignia, Lucky Strike, Capstan and Scissors. Prices of the other brands have gone up by Rs 4-5 per pack.

The price hike comes after excise duty on cigarettes was hiked by 6 percent in the Union Budget, which was lower than the 10 percent estimated by the Street. This is the sixth consecutive year when prices have been hiked, but the magnitude has been lower than the past. Analysts are expecting the company to clock single-digit volume growth in FY18. According to Jefferies, punitive excise duty regime on cigarettes has forced ITC to take a sharp price increase and hurt volumes in the past; FY18 looks like a benign year for cigarette volumes (we are building in 6 percent volume growth for FY18 currently).

Says Ambit Capital, this (6 percent excise hike) is significantly positive for the stock as it indicates the balance that the government is trying to maintain between curbing consumption and earning tax revenue from cigarettes. The stock was trading at a 20 percent discount to Hindustan Unilever and the broader FMCG universe, as a result of the overhang of punitive excise duty hikes. The stock has rallied post-Budget as the hikes were milder than expected.

However, GST continues to be an overhang for the stock. If the GST rate on cigarettes is not tax-neutral the stock could again come under pressure. Analysts believe that even if the GST rate is 40 percent the negative impact on the stock would be limited, as the stock continues to be trading at a discount to other FMCG stocks.",393,-0.33324044942855835

Sweden-based indoor air purifier maker Blueair is looking at leveraging HUL's vast sales infrastructure here to tap the Indian market.

Blueair was acquired by HUL's parent Unilever last year.

Besides, Blueair has also deferred plan to set up a manufacturing/assembling unit here after the change in ownership.

""In the marketing side, we have enough synergy. Uniliver and HUL has been here for many many years. It is more like an Indian brand. They have a very large network in sales and other aspects and all that is going to help us as a company,"" said Blueair Director West & South Asia Girish Bapat.

He further added: ""Wherever there would be synergy, we would use it."" However, Bapat declined to elaborate saying: ""It's too early for us to talk about that."" He further added that Bluair would maintain a separate corporate identity despite acquisition.

In August 2016, Unilever PLC had announced signing of an agreement to acquire Blueair.

""In terms of our restructuring and ownership change, we are reworking on those plans in terms of assembly/ manufacturing unit. But it's definitely on the cards,"" Bapat added.

To expand its retail presence, Blueair has tied up with leading pest control and home cleaning services firm Hicare, which would take its product to 200 cities through direct to home sales and service.

The Budget-induced optimism got a leg to stand on as the Sensex today pushed higher for the fourth day by scoring 199 points to close at 28,439 -- a 4-month high -- after hopes built up that RBI might go in for a rate cut at the Wednesday's policy meet.

The NSE Nifty retook the crucial 8,800-mark today.

At its last policy review in December, RBI in a surprise move had decided to leave rates unchanged, but this time a lower retail inflation and fiscal discipline as shown in the Budget have prompted calls for RBI to remain accommodative.

Global leads aligned as most Asian shares ended higher, tracking weekend gains in the US on better-than-expected jump in US jobs and a move by President Donald Trump to cut back financial regulations, accelerating buying pace by investors.

The 30-share Sensex ended up 198.76 points, or 0.70 percent at 28,439.28, its highest closing since September 23 last year when it had closed at 28,668.22. Intra-day, it sprang to a high of 28,487.28.

The gauge had rallied 584.56 points in the previous three sessions after the presentation of the Budget on February 1.

The NSE Nifty regained control of the 8,800-mark and added 60.10 points, or 0.69 percent, at 8,801.05 at the close. On September 23, the index finished at 8,831.55.

""Markets continued to be buoyant on the expectation of rate cut by RBI and positive global cues. We are seeing continuation of rally in the rate sensitive sectors led by reality, banks and FMCG which were also supported by Budget related sops,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.

Major European indices stayed in the positive zone, too.

Data showed that foreign institutional investors bought shares worth Rs 353.84 crore last Friday, adding to the level of optimism.

The rupee appreciated for the 9th straight day to trade at a fresh 2-1/2 month high of 67.14 (intra-day) against the dollar, keeping the overall mood upbeat.

A good 22 stocks in the 30-share Sensex pack advanced while 8 turned lower.

Sun Pharma led the charge by surging 4.20 percent while ICICI Bank zoomed 3.18 percent.

Adani Ports, Axis Bank, Hero MotoCorp, ITC Ltd, HUL, GAIL, NTPC, Asian Paints, Wipro, RIL, Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and L&T supported the ongoing bull run.

BSE realty jumped the most (up 1.90 percent) followed by FMCG (1.28 percent), healthcare (1.27 percent) and consumer durables (1.27 percent).

Broader markets remained in the green too, with the mid-cap index advancing 1.10 percent and small-cap 0.88 percent.

Realty stocks continued their upward journey, buoyed by the infrastructure status to affordable housing in the Budget 2017-18 to encourage investment in the segment, which offered tax sops to developers to complete unsold inventories.

Reliance Securities shares its list of four fundamental stock picks that it believes offer significant upside from current levels, along with its investment rationale on each.Dabur India – Target Price - 330Investment Rationale- Benefiting from Rising Share of Ayurvedic Products: Dabur has a strong heritage and most of its products are based on herbal platform. Over the past few years, there has been an increasing awareness about Ayurveda, resulting in emergence of new players i.e. Patanjali and fresh focus of large MNCs like HUL (Ayush) and Colgate (Vedshakti) to introduce products based on Ayurveda. Existing players like Dabur having strong brands and wide distribution network would continue to benefit from the same.- Strong Portfolio of Brands: Dabur has a robust product portfolio catering to different segments. It has 3 brands with turnover of more Rs 1,000 crore and 16 brands with turnover of more Rs 100 crore, which significantly reduces dependence on single product for sustaining growth.- Focus on Rural Markets: Dabur derives around 50 percent of its domestic business from rural areas. After two successive years of drought, the country witnessed normal monsoon last year, which is expected to aid good agricultural growth in coming quarters., Meanwhile, in the Union Budget 2017-18, the Government has increased overall allocation to rural, agriculture and allied sectors by 24 percent, which should benefit players like Dabur.Outlook & Valuation

Weak consumer demand environment and higher competitive intensity led to underperformance by Dabur in the past few months. However, with new product introductions, recent budget impetus and stable input cost scenario, we believe that the growth trajectory would be higher in the coming quarters. Based on expected EPS of Rs8.4, the stock currently trades at 32.5x FY18E earnings.HCL Technologies - Target Price - 963Investment Rationale- Revenue Momentum Remains Decent: HCLT's revenue rose by 1.3 percent qoq (3 percent qoq in CC terms) in 3QFY17, primarily led by Engineering Services (+5.9 QoQ, +7 percent in CC terms). We believe reiteration of management guidance by and large is a positive sign. The company expects CC revenue growth at around mid-point of guidance of 12-14 percent (10-12 percent in USD terms at current exchange rates). Including acquisitions, growth is likely to come in at 11-13 percent in USD terms and 13-15 percent in CC terms.- Niche Acquisitions to Boost Capabilities & Addressable Market:HCLT recently acquired an engineering services and design firm, Butler Aerospace, LLC for a consideration of USD 85 mn. The acquisition – which was completed w.e.f. January 1, 2017 – will be EPS-accretive. Earlier, it had also acquired engineering services and PLM specialist Geometric, which will further unleash growth opportunities in Engineering Services practice.- Deal Momentum Remains Healthy: Over the past several quarters, HCLT has been consistently winning new deals worth USD 1 bn, which augments revenue visibility. We expect ramp-up of these deals to provide necessary impetus to sustain double digit above-industry revenue growth in FY18E. We expect HCLT to deliver 13 percent CAGR in dollar revenue over FY17E-FY19E.Outlook & Valuation

We believe that consistent performance of different segments out of HCLT’s business portfolio offers some visibility of broad-based and sustainable growth, going forward. We expect IMS to sustain healthy growth. Valuation seems reasonable at 12.8x FY18E EPS.Pidilite Industries - Target Price - 827Investment Rationale- Pidilite is a dominant player in India’s adhesives & sealants and construction chemicals industry with iconic brands like Fevicol, M-Seal, Fevikwik and Dr. Fixit.- Over the years, Pidilite has successfully leveraged on its core strengths to drive growth. That includes an expertise to identify underserved segment where consumer demand is not being fulfilled, Intervention with a brand in a commoditised space to fill the demand, and Significant focus on developing, nurturing and enhancing relationship with the chain of influencers as well as the end-users.- Owing to significant enhancement in management bandwidth to transform the Company from ‘Professionally run by Family’ to run by ‘Family of Professionals’, Pidilite has laid foundation for sustainable growth.- Pidilite’s core strengths continue to remain intact despite near-term headwinds on volume growth front due to weak consumer demand.Outlook & ValuationWe expect Pidilite to post revenue and earnings CAGR of 12 percent and 15.3 percent through FY16-19E. We estimate that Pidilite would report consolidated sales of Rs 6,580 crore and Rs 7,540 crore and net profit of Rs 990 crore and Rs 1,160 crore in FY18E and FY19E respectively. Based on expected EPS of Rs22.6, Pidilite currently trades at P/E multiple of 29.8x FY19E earnings.Federal Bank - Target Price - 100Investment Rationale- Over the last few quarters Federal Bank is continuously delivering healthy growth in profit and loan book. Its net profit grew by 26.4 percent yoy & 2.2 percent qoq to Rs 210 crore in 3QFY17 led by 30.8 percent yoy & 9 percent qoq growth in NII and 43.7 percent yoy & 0.7 percent qoq growth in other income.- Corporate loan grew by 53.2 percent yoy & 13.7 percent qoq to Rs 25,500 crore led by working capital financing to corporate. Change in top management along with better product offering aided the growth in its corporate book.- Management continues to focus more on Corporate & SME loan segments instead of earlier strategy of focusing on SME & Retail loan segments. Its NIM is expected to be at around 3.2-3.5 percent in next 4-5 quarters.- CASA ratio jumped by 362bps on account of 24 percent qoq growth in current deposits and 18.5 percent qoq growth saving deposits. Management expects 1/3rd of incremental CASA deposits will remain with the bank in long term.Outlook & ValuationWe believe that Federal Bank is coming out of the scenario – marked with higher provisioning and continued stress on assets quality for last few quarters – with moderation in fresh slippages and improvement in loan book. We expect healthy traction in earnings owing to robust growth in loan book, moderate credit cost and healthy margins. We continue to reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock with Target Price of Rs100 based on 1.9x FY18E Adjusted book value.",1006,0.0

Malini BhuptaMoneycontrolIn uncertain times, defensive sectors are good places to hide, but a contrarian view this time around would be more profitable. Even though 2017 is expected to be a year of uncertainties, equity strategists are advising cyclical stocks over safe havens.While impact of GST rollout and pace of economic recovery after demonetisation are known domestic variables, Trumponomics and the impact of protectionist policies adopted by several developed economies remain key global uncertainties. In such challenging times, a good place to hide would be defensive sectors like consumer, pharmaceuticals and IT services, but this time around the market is betting on cyclicals, in the hope that infrastructure spending will get a boost in this year’s Budget.Don't expect consumption to revive anytime soonThe economy may be limping back to normalcy after high value currency notes were invalidated in November; consumer companies are not likely to see a 'U’ shaped recovery. Small wonder then that the market is placing its bets on cyclical stocks. While IDFC Securities expects relatively higher fiscal stimulus on the consumption side (compared to capex), it believes the move will only help bring consumption demand back to normal levels (which was dented by demonetization). Hence, the brokerage prefers non-consumption themes – B2B businesses, high dividend yield stories and businesses with stronger outlook outside the country.Earnings of cyclicals to outpace defensivesEarnings recovery in some sectors is another trigger for select cyclicals. Given that select commodity prices have been moving up, earnings trajectory of metal companies is expected to improve. Religare Capital Markets expects earnings growth of energy and metals to rise to 16.5 percent while IT is expected to report stagnant earnings. Cement, construction & infrastructure and capital goods are among the few sectors that are expected to report double-digit earnings growth. According to Motilal Oswal Securities, December quarter’s earnings growth would be driven by cyclicals – cement, capital goods and oil & gas are expected to post 24 percent, 59 percent and 42 percent earnings growth, respectively. Consequently, the share of defensives in overall earnings will also decline in FY17.Budget to give a leg-up to cyclicalsThe immediate trigger for cyclical stocks will come from the Budget, scheduled to be presented by the Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on February 1. By now it is an accepted fact that the government will deviate from the path of fiscal consolidation and stimulate the economy by transferring more money in the hands of tax payers to ease the pain of demonetisation. If this were to actually happen in a meaningful way, consumption would get a boost. But given the FM's limited fiscal room, a section of economists believe that the stimulus may come in the form of higher capital expenditure by the government.Morgan Stanley’s base case view is that the government will not use fiscal stimulus to revive domestic demand, considering the starting point of tight fiscal space. Sectoral analysts at the global investment bank expect the Budget to be positive for autos, cement & metals, consumer, Internet and e-commerce, media and real estate. Most economists and strategists do not expect remonetisation to substantially revive consumption to levels higher than the pre-note ban era.Scorecard for key stocksTop Performers of 2016 Hindalco (+83 percent), Yes Bank (+59 percent), Tata Steel (+51 percent), BPCL (+42 percent) and Power Grid (+30 percent).Worst performers of 2016Idea (-49 percent), BHEL (-28 percent), Aurobindo (-24 percent), Sun Pharma (-23 percent) and Bharti Infratel (-20 percent) were the worst performers.Winners for five straight yearsSix Nifty stocks – Eicher, Maruti, IndusInd Bank, Zee Entertainment, Asian Paints and Kotak Mahindra Bank – delivered positive returns for five straight years.Stocks that delivered negative returns for first time in five year.Stocks delivering negative returns for the first time in the last five years wereAurobindo, Lupin, M&M, HUL and HCL Tech.",638,0.0

Unilever reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales on Thursday, hurt by demonetisation in India and an economic slowdown in Brazil.

The maker of Dove soap, Knorr soup and Marmite spread said underlying sales rose 2.2 percent in the quarter. That compared with analysts' average expectation of 2.8 percent, according to a consensus compiled by the company, and growth of 3.2 percent in the third quarter and 4.7 percent in the first half of the year.

For the full year, sales growth was 3.7 percent, below the 3.9 percent analysts were expecting.

Unilever Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly told Reuters the company was targeting growth in the range of 3 to 5 percent for 2017, but that the first quarter would be below that, due to the issues in Brazil and India, and the timing of Easter.

ICICI Direct's research report on HUL

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) posted better-than-estimated performance for the quarter despite an unfavourable environment. Revenue declined 1.2% YoY to Rs 7512.5 crore against our estimate of Rs 7065.0 crore. Volumes declined 4.0% YoY which was set off by similar increase in realisation. The company undertook price hike mainly in the personal care segment to pass on the impact of increase in input cost. Home care and refreshment segment witnessed growth of 1% and 8.1%, respectively. However, personal care declined 2.7% YoY.

Outlook

Additionally, we have a positive outlook on rural sales with the expected thrust on rural development in upcoming Budget (rural sales contribute 35% to HUL’s revenue). Hence, we expect revenues to grow at a CAGR of 6.6% in FY16-19E and profitability to grow at 8.5% CAGR for same period. We reiterate our BUY recommendation, keeping our target price unchanged at Rs 978/share.

Edelweiss' research report on HUL

Demonetisation impact was prevalent across categories, though it varied depending upon the channel & geography mix and product category. Home care segment grew 1% YoY with Surf clocking double digit growth. Personal care sales dipped 2.7% YoY impacted further by price hikes in the personal wash segment which resulted in soft volumes (price hikes in Q4FY17 will impact volumes further).

Outlook

Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) Q3FY17 revenue (down 1.2% YoY) surpassed estimate as volumes (4% YoY dip versus 7% forecast) were better despite demonetisation and calibrated price hikes. Overall, underlying price growth of 4% YoY was led by price hikes in personal wash. Amidst rising input prices, overall gross margin fell 64bps YoY and 163bps QoQ and 76bps YoY margin dip was largely due to lower operating leverage (ad spends remain competitive and fell mere 32bps YoY). Though premiumisation trend has sustained, recovery will be gradual with easing in liquidity situation, particularly in the mass end. Success of new Ayush range is a key monitorable. Maintain ‘HOLD’.

Some sectors/stocks remains laggards. Based on our experience of over 16 years as Financial Astrologer, stocks of astrological supported sectors outperform resulting in exorbitant gains irrespective of market behavior, either bull market or bear market.

During last Samavat 2072 among other sectors – SUGAR & PAPER sectors were predicted by us, received strong astrological support & out performed. Many stocks from Sugar sector appreciated by 600-900 percent. It should be recalled that sugar sector, despite strong remained laggard for many years and started performing only after astrological support came.

Malini BhuptaMoneycontrolWinners & Losers for 2017Demonetisation isn’t after all the giant slayer of the economy, as was feared by some economists and strategists. As December data starts to trickle in, it is becoming clear that the impact is not uniform across sectors and businesses. Be it tolling at roads, sales of select segments in automobiles or viewers at multiplexes, data suggests that the impact of demonetisation could be easing somewhat. Anand Mahindra, Chairman and Managing Director of Mahindra Group tweeted on Thursday: “Auto and tractor retail sales showed resilience at the tail end of the month, which augurs well for the economy. Even more interesting, our December construction equipment sales were up sharply. Evidence of government infrastructure spending gaining ground.”In the month of December, M&M’s tractor sales were up 9 percent YoY to 14,047 units, mainly due to a lower base in the comparable period last year. Interestingly, total automotive sales were down 4 percent to 36,363 units, much better than estimates. The passenger vehicle segment declined 8 percent and LCV sales grew 14 percent YoY.Ravi Pisharody, Head of Commercial Vehicle Division at Tata Motors, is of the view that the January to March period is extremely critical as it will demonstrate how the consumers are behaving post-demonetisation. Commercial vehicle sales were expected to decline by 30 percent in December but large players like Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland only demonstrated a decline of 9-10 percent. IRB disclosed to stock exchanges on Thursday that its gross daily toll revenues in December were up 3 percent against October and that traffic is back to normal level is highly optimistic. Passenger car-maker Maruti seems to be surviving the demonetisation storm better than others and is expected to improve marketshare even further. Virendra Mhaiskar, CMD of IRB Infra, one of the largest integrated road operators in the country, told Moneycontrol.com in an interview that the impact of demonetisation has faded and things are back to normal.Clearly, there is no clarity on how demonetisation will play out but December data isn’t as bad as was anticipated by most. If the current trend continues then things could improve in the coming quarters for some sectors. For this to happen the supply of cash by the central bank has to happen on a war footing.Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Chief Economist at State Bank of India, believes that by the end of January 67 percent (earlier estimate was 75 percent) of the currency could be replaced if printing continues at the current pace. Explains Ghosh, Group Economic Adviser, State Bank of India, “By February, at this rate, RBI could thus print as much as 80-89 percent of the total currency. Either way, contrary to market perception, things will be closer to normal by February-end as opposed to predictions of the crisis lasting longer.” If this actually happens, the bounce-back in GDP may be faster than anticipated.Not all are this optimistic, however. IIFL says it is difficult to project how much and how long demonetisation will impact the economy. However, the general expectation that demonetisation will have a transient impact and that activity will revert to the earlier trend within a quarter or two is highly optimistic.The impact of demonetisation on the economy will play out in three ways: 1) Liquidity drying up will impact consumption by households. Businesses that have so far transacted in cash (but are not necessarily generating black money) will also take a huge hit. The migration to digital modes of payment will take time. 2) Incomes and jobs will be lost as small businesses in the hinterland take a hit. 3) The biggest impact will be loss of confidence – both of businesses and individuals – due to a policy uncertainty will also impact economic activity.Sectors to WatchInformation TechnologyWhile there was some concern from the market following Donald Trump’s victory, market believes that India may not be the focus of the president elect’s protectionist policies. IIFL expects the sector to gain from currency depreciation. In the near-term the sector may benefit from improvement in the US economy. Longer term issues will continue to keep stocks under some pressure.UtilitiesHealth of the power sector has improved following the UDAY Scheme. Power companies with assured RoE (return on equity) models could benefit. Valuations are not stretched after the recent correction.AutomobilesDiscretionary consumption has come to a grinding halt post demonetisation. Automakers expect that some amount of buying will come back as confidence returns. The cash crunch has hurt the two-wheelers the most with sales declining by 30-35 percent month-on-month and new bookings for four-wheelers are also down by the same number. Emkay Global prefers Hero MotoCorp & Maruti Suzuki for FY18/FY19 as the demonetisation storm passes in the coming quarters and as spending picks up pace. The brokerage is also bullish on Tata Motors thanks to its strong product pipeline in JLR and margin improvement on account of currency benefitsCementThe sector to is expected to end the fiscal with a slight contraction in demand against an estimated growth of 5 percent. Demonetisation has hurt the sector and with real estate coming under pressure, recovery may take longer. According to Emkay Global, cement stocks are expected to remain under pressure in the near term due to low demand, which is also aggravated by cap on currency withdrawal.ConsumerAmbit Capital in its January 3 note says the FMCG sector has not priced in demonetization/GST disruption. Sales will be hit by liquidity crunch, stalling wholesale channel, weakness in rural demand thanks to job losses coupled with farmer distress and deferment in discretionary spending. Near-term demand is likely to be hit by 10-20 percent. Distribution channels below the distributor has been disrupted and this would impact reach. In these circumstances, companies like ITC and HUL would gain as the channel prefers financially strong companies in times of crisis.",975,0.0

After meeting management of HUL on demonetisation, CLSA bets on the FMCG stock while Morgan Stanley feels ITC is a better bet in the sector.

HUL management is positive on India growth story and believes both demonetisation and GST will be significant growth drivers. However, the company is concerned that market growth will likely be affected for a few months, and recovery will be gradual, led by urban markets. The key concerns are poor consumer sentiment, trade de-stocking, and liquidity squeeze, especially for the wholesale channel

Likewise, CLSA is also convinced that HUL is leaving no stone unturned to lead on way to recovery led by urban markets. It adds that southern region has already started recovering due to higher banking density/penetration. The brokerage firm likes HUL given its broad-based portfolio, strong distribution reach and superior execution. It maintains outperform rating on the stock with target price of Rs 925 per share.

However, Morgan Stanley is not convinced and recommends switching to ITC where it sees more compelling risk-reward. It argues that potential sharp improvement in volume growth for home and personal care (HPC) categories, led by good monsoons and Seventh Pay Commission appear less likely post demonetisation. It says HPC categories will benefit from pipeline filling in Q4FY17.Posted by Nasrin SultanaFollow @NasrinzStory",223,0.4995291829109192

Harish Manwani (62), chairman of Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), is in the reckoning to take on the chairmanship of Tata group where a battle rages between ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry and Tata Sons, the holding company of the Mumbai-based over USD 100-billion conglomerate.

According to British channel Sky News, Manwani, the former chief operating officer of the Dove-to-Marmite consumer goods giant, is being lined up as a possible successor to Cyrus Mistry, who was ousted last month.

The emergence of a potential new chairman so soon after Mistry's exit - which sent shockwaves through the Indian corporate establishment - could ease concerns about the management of the group, which also has major interests in power, chemicals and consumer goods, the channel reported.

In a sudden and dramatic turn of events last month, Mistry was unceremoniously removed as the chairman of Tata Sons and replaced by his predecessor Ratan Tata in the interim, triggering a confrontation between the single-largest shareholder and the Tatas.

Returning to Tata Sons after the abrupt removal of Mistry, Tata has moved quickly to consolidate his grip over the USD 103-billion salt-to-software group by seeking to remove the ousted chairman from boards of group firms.

TCS has called an EGM on December 13, Indian Hotels has convened it on December 20 and Tata Chemicals on December 23 to seek Mistry's ouster.

Abhay Laijawala of Deutsche Bank says he has been cautious on the market since late June fearing global macro uncertainties. Some of these partially materialised in October 2016 as sovereign bond yields in the developed market hardened significantly.

In addition, the global political calendar is filled with risk events over the next year and this he believes will continue to be an overhang for financial markets.

He continues to suggest a cautious stance. He raises IT services to neutral, lower healthcare to underweight, raise overweight on energy further.

Reliance Industries, Maruti, Tech Mahindra, Shree Cement and HDFC are now top picks, Laijawala says. (Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com)

Meanwhile, Mahesh Nandurkar of CLSA says with another important step taken on November 3, India moves a step closer to GST implementation.

The GST council has agreed on a five-slab structure. This is a huge simplification from the nearly 100+ tax rates that exist today, he feels.

He says the council has moved product categories to the nearest tax slabs and hence the positive and negative impact will likely be limited to 3-4 percent.

According to him, GST implementation by April-July 2017 appears more certain now.

Nandurkar says on the basis of limited information released by the Government, preliminary analysis suggests that consumer staples such as HUL and Colgate, consumer durables like Havells and Crompton and multiplex players should benefit. Services like airlines, telecom, insurance; textiles and Titan should be negatively impacted. ITC could see a relief rally.",260,-0.9997409731149673

Edelweiss's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) Q2FY17 revenue growth of 1.4% YoY was slightly lower than our estimate as volumes dipped 1% YoY (negative after 7 years). EBITDA and PAT jump of 5.1% and 9.0% YoY, respectively, was in line. Price hikes (3% overall) in the personal wash segment impacted volumes-price-volume equation will improve gradually. Deflationary environment is behind as gross margin dipped 17bps YoY and 195bps QoQ, though margin expanded 65bps YoY riding 107bps YoY ad spend savings (remains competitive). Brands in the premium segment continue to do well. Management commentary of worst being behind the company lends comfort. Maintain ‘HOLD’.

We estimate 13% YoY EPS CAGR over FY16-18. We remain positive on long-term prospects led by margin and volume recovery. Key risks are rising competition and moderating rural demand. At CMP, the stock is trading at 35.2x FY18E EPS. We maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ with target price of INR 910.

Moneycontrol BureauRising input costs and consequent jump in skincare product prices translated into weak sales numbers for the third quarter for global MNC Unilever, much in line with analysts’ expectations. A post-result presentation by parent Unilever Plc cautioned there could be one more quarter of pain.

India’s largest consumer goods company by sales saw a sequential increase in key inputs like crude oil, light liquid paraffin, and copra. On a year-on-year basis, though, these prices were lower, an article in Mint today said quoting a Reliance Securities’ note.

Also, inputs for some other products like palm fatty acid distillate used to make soaps increased by 30 percent YoY, while milk prices were higher by 14 percent.

As the impact of a favourable monsoon and Pay Commission hikes is yet to play out into increased demand, analysts expect muted volume growth of 3 percent for the ongoing quarter -- an extension of the tepid growth in last 14 quarters with mid-single-digit numbers.

The performance over these past quarters looks particularly interesting, considering analysts had predicted moderating growth when Unilever increased stake in its Indian arm to over 67 percent through an open offer.The stake increase by the parent was seen as a major bet on the India story by the UK-based parent, though there were concerns over higher royalty payments and tax increases, which analysts said could weigh on earnings growth for at least two years since.",246,-0.20496512651443483

A hands on person with an elephant’s memory is how AskMe’s employees define nearly 55-year old Sanjiv Gupta, who was running the show at the AskMe Group.

Gupta has however been media shy and would refrain from giving interviews much often. He is also not also not available on social media sites. May be his early troubles with the infamous stint at actor Amitabh Bachchan’s firm ABCL during the 90s has taught him a lesson, to remain media shy.

Let’s go back in history and the career of Sanjiv Gupta.

With ABCL and then Coca-Cola

After a stint at Hindustan Unilever, Gupta was appointed the chief executive officer of Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Ltd in the 1990s. A December 2009, Open Magazine report quotes Sunil Doshi, who had made the original business plan for ABCL saying that he was expecting Gupta to become the vice-president and not the chief executive officer. But it happened otherwise.

He is also quoted to have termed it as a “disaster”. Doshi left the venture after a fall out with Gupta on difference in the issues of management style, the report says.

“During ABCL’s quick decline and after its bankruptcy, the popular view was that the company’s problems centred around the way it was run, as well as its priorities,” the report says. ABCL had run into huge debts and ran into rough weather.

“Sanjiv Gupta may have worked with many multinationals before and after ABCL but ABCL is a film company and it is unlike the other multi-nationals. It doesn’t make products,” says Komal Nahta, film trade analyst to moneycontrol.com.

“Film-making is a completely different exercise. You cannot apply the other business principle to this and run the company in that way. So definitely that is where one must have gone wrong. Till you don’t have a person who understands film and film-making, you can’t expect the company to grow,” Nahata adds in context of Gupta’s stint at ABCL.Gupta then moved on to Coca-Cola as the executive vice-president and then moved on to become the chief executive officer of the American brand’s business in India.It was during his tenure that the beverage maker got embroiled in the pesticide controversy.

He conceptualised the plan for an Aamir Khan campaign to improve the image of the Coca Cola brand, post the pesticide controversy.

Cousins at The Getit Infoservices Journey

Getit Infoservices which used to run Yellow Pages brand since over two decades was being run by Siddharth Gupta and Ramesh Gupta, since 1986.

Sanjiv joined his cousin Siddharth Gupta at Getit after Coca Cola. Sanjiv Gupta is closely related to Siddharth and Ramesh Gupta, as per reports.

Malaysian investor Astro in 2010 had acquired 50% stake in Getit Infoservices. Earlier in 2008, VC firm Helion had picked up 10% in Getit Infoservices for a reported Rs 20 crore.

Internet base was increasing in India and the area of classifieds was hotting up.

It was in February 2013, that Network 18 Group divested its Infomedia Yellow Pages and AskMe to Getit Infoservices Pvt Ltd, terming it as a non core asset. (Disclosure: Moneycontrol is currently owned by the Network18 Group.)

The stake in Astro increased thereafter in Getit Infoservices which launched GetitBazaar and later renamed it as AskMeBazaar.

War of words with Malaysia’s Astro

The whole Getit group is currently marred with uncertainty and has suspended operations due to lack of funds.

Astro has claimed that it had informed the management of Getit which runs AskMe brand about its inability to fund the group further in 2015 itself. It has also said that the management focussed more on brand building and marketing (huge capital guzzling exercise) than focussing on meeting the key performance indicators.

""It is complete lie from Astro that they had given an ultimatum to management in 2015.

In fact, they approved the funding till April 2016 in the board meeting which was based on future projections,” says Gupta.

Gupta has claimed that given that 2015 was a year of boom for e-commerce companies, significant funds were allocated for marketing and acquisitions to scale up the business. He has also alleged that these strategies were duly sanctioned by Astro.

“In fact, they clearly asked management to increase spending so that they would get higher valuations when the company got a term sheet from an investor in January 2016. The investor later withdrew because of the tainted image of Astro and Maxis in India,” he adds.

Well, Gupta is not a person who accepts defeat easily. At least that’s what the people who have worked with him have to say. Let’s see Gupta can now revive the future of 4,000 employees at stake with a management buyout from Astro.

Who will pay employee salaries?

Neither Astro nor Gupta is willing to answer this most urgent question.

""Astro is 99 percent owner and legally bound to pay salaries. I am no longer part of management as clearly defined in the NCLT order dated 28 September 2016,” says Gupta, who is interacting via a Delhi based handler. He is known to be very active on WhatsApp.

“They have money in the bank and are paying select employees and vendors and themselves and credit card bills worth 15 Lakh,” he adds.

“I myself have not been paid and am asking for my dues,” he laments.

“I am happy to pay employees if Moneycontrol can get the MBO done!,"" Gupta summarises.

Housing credit as a percentage of non-food credit at 11.8 percent is at levels last seen in July 2008, but below the 13.3 percent peak. Further, housing loans as a percentage of total in India are among the lowest in the world, he says.

Mishra expects both these trends, falling/low rates supporting home loan growth and a sclerotic banking system allowing interest margins to sustain. Pay commission will further support growth, he feels.

He remains positive on LIC Housing Finance, HDFC and Indiabulls Housing Finance.

Meanwhile, Anish Damania of IDFC says the trend of positive surprises and operational strength has continued so far in Q1FY17.

Based on operational performance in Q1FY17, top buys within Nifty are Zee Entertainment, SBI and HDFC Bank, he adds.

Damania also prefers Tata Motors and Aurobindo Pharma that are yet to report results. Top sells are Dr Reddy's Labs, HCL Technologies and Hindustan Unilever.",182,0.50007264316082

Sidhartha Shuklamoneycontrol.comThough it is seen as one of the bright spots in the global economy, India's consumer confidence as measured by a Nielsen index has dipped. India has ceded the top slot to Philippines in the June quarter, after having topped the list in the March quarter.

The index measures perceptions of local job prospects, personal finances and immediate-spending intentions in a country to calculate the confidence consumer index. Consumer confidence levels above and below a baseline of 100 indicate degrees of optimism and pessimism, respectively.

Two back to back droughts did hit the rural demand scenario while at the same time the urban demand did not see much pick up either.

“In India, the dip in the index in the second quarter hints at caution for consumers, with the hardening of fuel prices, rising inflation and concerns around the monsoon,” the report said.

These factors have bred a cautionary sentiment in the Indian consumer which has led to more savings against discretionary spending.

Earnings of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies in this quarter is a clear reflection of this sentiment as most the players in this space have disappointed street estimates.

FMCG big shots like HUL, ITC, Dabur and Godrej Consumer, all reported disappointing set of first quarter earnings which signifies that consumer firms and the staples industry is facing a slowdown as the Indian consumption story fades due to lack of macro stimulus.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Varun Lohchab had said, ""Industry volumes have been slowing down. Lever (HUL) feels the heat more due to competition from small players. But most of the FMCG stocks are fully valued and given the earnings outlook, they will be pressured.""

NOT ALL HOPE IS LOST

Given the recent reforms that have been passed by the government and a good monsoon this year the demand is likely to pick up from where it left.

""However, the Indian consumer has remained quite optimistic over the last few quarters, and this may be just a temporary dip,” the Nielsen report said.

-Implementation of the seventh pay commission should boost the consumption story in India.

-The passage of the goods and services tax (GST) bill will have a temporary impact on inflation post its implementation its long term gains will overshadow the immediate inflationary impact it brings.

According to a Credit Suisse report, GST will have a major impact on consumer stocks.

""We expect full excise paying companies such as HUL, Colgate and GSK to gain as indirect taxation for them could come down from the current 24-26 percent to 17-19 percent. Companies with exemptions could see margin gains from service tax offsets. Paints and appliances currently bear a high indirect taxation of 24-25 percent, which could substantially reduce under GST to 17-19 percent. This will help gain share from the unorganised sector,"" the CS report said.

-The onset of a good monsoon this year is expected to revive the ailing rural economy and improve the urban demand as well.Follow @shukla_05sid",508,-0.2541809890951429

Advertising watchdog ASCI has pulled up Patanjali Ayurved,HUL, PepsiCo, Britannia, Pizza Hut, Amazon, LG Electronics,Voltas, Axis Bank, AirAsia and Flipkart, among others, for running misleading ad campaigns.

The Customer Complaints Council of Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) received 155 complaints in May, out of which it upheld 109 cases, it said in a statement.

It upheld 10 complaints against yoga guru Baba Ramdev- promoted Patanjali Ayurved for products such as Jeera Biscuit, Kacchi Ghani mustard oil, Kesh Kanti and Dant Kanti, among others.

The advertising regulator had earlier upheld six cases against Patanjali in April and March 2016.

Patanjali Ayurved failed to substantiate its claim before the regulator regarding ads for products such as Divya Swasari Pravahi, Dant Kanti, Kesh Kanti and CCC upheld them ""as misleading by exaggeration"".

Queries sent to HUL and Pepsi did not elicit any response.

However, Patanjali questioned the manner in which the decisions were passed and alleged that some rival MNCs are behind the move.

""They cannot pass any judgment against the non-members.

There are several judgments against them (ASCI). Its order is not binding on any non-member,"" a company spokesperson said, adding that it is exploring legal options in this matter.

""Moreover, they do not have any expert on ayurveda and life sciences and are deciding the matter. They do not have any fact finding procedure or a laboratory and decide the case in a meeting only,"" he added.

ASCI also pulled up beverage major PepsiCo India for its campaign 'Har Bottle par Paytm Cash pakka' as it was ""misleading and luring the consumers to buy Pepsi bottles, with a minimum hope of getting some cash back through Paytm."" ""The advertisement itself does not clarify the main condition for the offer of it being mobile number specific.

Also, the disclaimers in the advertisement were not in the same language as that of the voice over,"" it said.

Britannia Industries' claim of ""100 per cent whole wheat bread"" was found ""misleading by ambiguity as the whole wheat content in the product (Whole Wheat Bread) is in the range of 50 per cent to 65 per cent and other solid content in the product is coming from other sources."" Yum! Restaurants, which runs the Pizza Hut chain, was pulled up for its advertisement on 'Any Pizza Any Size @ 199 each when you buy 2 Pizzas' as ""misleading by omission"".

Tata Group firm Voltas' ad campaign claiming to run 'two air-conditioners at the cost of one' was found ""misleading by omission of disclaimers giving reference to the comparison being made between a Voltas All Star Inverter AC and a conventional start-stop AC"".",448,-0.9230448007583618

ICICI Direct's research report on HUL



Hindustan Unilever’s (HUL) volume growth came in muted at 4% for Q1FY17 vs. our expectation of 5%. As per Ind AS, net sales grew 3.6% YoY to Rs 7987.7 crore (I-direct estimate: Rs 8434.2 crore). Sales growth in home care, personal care, foods & refreshments was 6.8%, 2.1%, 4.7% & 5.4%, YoY, respectively EBITDA margins improved 85 bps to 20.1% (I-direct estimate: 17.4%). Soft input costs (down 101 bps as % of sales) & lower A&P spend (down 56 bps as % of sales) aided in margin expansion PAT increased 9.8% YoY to Rs 1173.9 crore (I-direct estimate: Rs 1049 crore) on the back of higher EBITDA and exceptional gain of Rs 70.8 crore mainly due to one-time write-back of provision. HUL has proposed setting up of a plant in Assam at an investment of Rs 1000 crore to increase production capacity of personal care products. It is expected to be operational in early 2017.

The government’s focus on rural development bodes well for HUL as rural India contributes 35% to its sales. In its highest ever spend on MNREGA, the government increased it to Rs 43800 crore (up 22% YoY) in FY16. Besides, it allocated Rs 87700 crore towards rural development as a whole in Budget 2016. Going ahead, we believe rural incomes will witness a major boost as the progress of monsoon has been as expected by IMD. We estimate sales growth & profitability growth of 8.8% & 13.8% CAGR, respectively, in FY16-18E for HUL. We maintain BUY recommendation with a target price of Rs 1000/share.

Sidhartha Shuklamoneycontrol.comThe government will soon be appointing merchant bankers to help it find a buyer for its minority stake in 51 companies which it holds through the Specified Undertaking of UTI (SUUTI) fund. The government will kick of its divestment plans in three blue chip companies. SUUTI was formed in 2003 as an extension of the United Trust of India (UTI). It comprises 51 companies -- 8 unlisted and the rest listed companies. Through SUUTI, the government holds minority stake in these companies and is planning to divest its shareholding. The government is mulling to divest through an offer for sale (OFS), block deal, bulk deal or just by a regular sale on stock exchanges.

The fund includes listed companies like HUL, RIL, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and a host of Tata Group firms.

For the purposes of divestment, SUUTI has segregated the companies into three groups. Group A consists of 3 blue-chip companies -- Axis Bank, L&T and ITC. Group B has 8 unlisted companies, while Group C has the remaining 40 listed companies.Through SUUTI the government holds 11.53 percent stake in Axis Bank, 11.17 percent in ITC and 8.16 percent in L&T which are placed in Group A and are up for divestment first.

Source: http://www.suuti.in/RFP-25072016.pdf As per Monday's closing, the government's holding in Axis Bank is worth Rs 14,818 crore, in ITC Rs 33,908 crore and L&T Rs 12,057 crore.

The complete sale of these three blue-chip stocks can fetch the government Rs 60,785 crore based on yesterday's closing price.

Stocks in Group A will be easier to divest because of their high demand in the market. The rest of the companies in Group B and C may comparatively be a hard sell. The investment bankers -- who will be hired for three years -- will have their job cut out.Follow @shukla_05sid",315,

In a separate filing, LT Foods said: ""To further accelerate the company's strategy of global expansion, acquisition of these iconic brands will serve as an important milestone in the journey of LT Foods and strengthen company's position in Middle East market"".

In March this year, HUL had signed an agreement with LT Foods (owner of Daawat brand)for sale of its rice exports business for a consideration of Rs 25 crore as it looks to exit non-core businesses.

The Competition Commission of India (CC1) had approved the said acquisition via its order dated May 12, 2016.

HUL said the deal envisages transfer of the brands and inventory for a consideration of Rs 25 crore.

The brands registered a turnover of Rs 51 crore as per audited financials for the year 2014-15.

Axis securities research report on HINDUSTAN UNILEVER Below estimates:Net sales/EBITDA/adj. PAT grew 4%/8%/6% vs. consensus est. of 7%/8%/9%.Volume growth at 4% was below consensus estimate of ~5%. Management called out for higher stress in the overall demand situation and highlighted lower demand in general trade/ mass categories/ smaller pack sizes indicating heightened stress in rural. Gross margin was up 101 bps YoY at50.5% (up 20bps QoQ) but was offset by higher staff costs. EBITDA margin increased 88bps YoY to 20.5%as A&P declined by 2% YoY.

We expect slow recovery in volume growth. OPM is at the highest level since CY03; hence, meaningful margin upside appears difficult. We cut our FY17-18E EPS by 2% each to factorin lower sales growth. We now estimate 10%/12% sales/EPS CAGR over FY16-18. Maintain HOLD with target price of Rs810 (Rs825 earlier), based on 33x forward P/E.

HUL has always been facing challenging environment. It is the market leader in some of the category but still we remain cautious for the demand to pick up by the consumers. HUL showed sustained margin growth for Q1FY17 but going forward with price rise of raw materials we believe that margins would be hurted. Premium category products would bring in gain but at the cost of higher advertisement spends. With its continuous spending behind brands, innovative products and driving operational efficiency it's long term outlook remain positive.

Moneycontrol BureauFMCG major Hindustan Unilever's stock has given handsome returns to investors over the last nine quarters. The disappointing first quarter results were only a blip in an otherwise strong track record.In the period under review, the stock gave the highest returns of over 18 percent in the September quarter of 2014, and exactly a year later it touched a low of over -11 percent. It shows that out of the last 9 quarters the stock has given positive returns 8 times. The stock outperformed the benchmark Sensex 5 times in the period. HUL Vs SensexFrom the start of FY15 till the first quarter of FY17, HUL gained a whopping 49 percent against Sensex's 20 percent in the same period. Results Corner: Yesterday, HUL declared its first quarter results for FY17. Its net profit rose 9.8 percent at Rs 1,174 crore in April-June quarter from Rs 1069.2 crore in the year-ago period. This was aided by a one-time write-back of provision benefits arising from plan amendments.In Q1, its total income was up marginally 3.6 percent at Rs 8128.2 crore compared to Rs 7844.5 crore year-on-year.",195,0.9999927282333374

Though investors are busy offloading HUL shares after a disappointing June quarter, few analysts still find potential in the FMCG major. HUL's net profit rose 9.8 percent at Rs 1174 crore in April-June quarter from Rs 1069.2 crore in year-ago period. In Q1, its total income was below expectations, up 3.6 percent at Rs 8128.2 crore compared to Rs 7844.5 crore year-on-year. Its volume growth in Q1 was at 4 percent from 6 percent on annual basis but unchanged on sequential basis. Ad-spends for the quarter contracted by 60 basis points (bps). While slowdown has been across markets, the rural demand has been weaker.

So, why are analysts bullish?

Macquarie has an outperform rating with a target of Rs 940 per share betting on higher sales volumes growth and improvement in demand scenario. The brokerage is positive as the management expects normal monsoons and 7th pay commission payouts may revive demand growth over medium term. HUL management has reaffirmed their guidance of continued improvement in operating margins despite the recent increase in commodity costs.

With a view that goods and service tax (GST) will be a key trigger for HUL, Credit Suisse has an outperform rating. It has set a target price of Rs 930 per share. The brokerage firm believes that if GST standard rate is 18-20 percent, it could be a positive for HUL and can lower the indirect tax rate by 300-500 basis points for HUL. GST is likely to be passed in the ongoing monsoon session of Parliament. HUL hiked prices of soaps in few months and the brokerage firm expects deflation in soaps to end in Q2FY17.

Credit Suisse also adds that after HUL opens a new factory in Assam with an investment of Rs 1000 crore it will have an excise exemption for 10 years and income tax exemptions. The facility is likely to be ready by early 2017, in which case HUL's excise and income tax rate could gradually go down as production ramps up. However, there are concerns about its rural slowdown especially like Maharashtra, AP and Karnataka, which are also the severely drought effected areas. ""While the good monsoons this year should help improve the trend, this may take a couple of quarters to play out,"" it says in a report.

Bank of America Merill Lynch also has a buy rating with a target price of Rs 1020 per share. It is betting on monsoon, GST and 7th Pay Commission to boost the stock. It says a likely normal monsoon with 45 percent of the company’srevenue from rural markets, HUL will be a key beneficiary if the GST is implemented, disbursement of the 7th Pay Commission-linked wage hikes could help urban demand/personal care and a possible buyback/special dividend will drive it. It also adds that a strong 18 percent earnings per share (EPS) CAGR is likely to support a premium valuation.

Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating with a target of Rs 945 per share, positive on high visibility of strong operating margin expansion even in a likely inflationary environment. Dabur is the only other consumer stable stock that the house has an overweight rating.

""If we were to adjust for a one-time credit of Rs 48 crore for employee costs in Q1F16, operating margins expanded by 150bps YoY. This, in our view, was the keypositive for the quarter,"" it says in a report. However, it is worried about rural demand. Morgan Stanley does not expect a material recovery in rural demand for the next 2-3 quarters and there may be a risk of trends moderating further. The management indicated that premium brands, large packs and modern trade are performing better than economy brands, low unit packs and general trade, respectively.

Deutsche Bank has a hold rating with a target of Rs 900 per share and the feels that the cautious rural outlook is not surprising. It expects 15.3 percent earnings CAGR in FY16-18 and believes consumption recovery is adequately priced in. It agress that new factory in Assam is likely to provide upside to consensus estimates for FY18-22.

The brokerage firm says that Q1 performance reflects the struggle – low price growth has a flow-through effect on profit growth at a time of low volume growth. It disagrees that HUL is at the beginning of inflation-led revenue growth in FY2017. ""Some commodities likesuch as palm oil have risen 9 percent/ 50 percent in the past three/sixmonths, inflation in inputs in general is unclear. Given the likelyfeeble rural consumption recovery, we see a lag between cost inflation and price increases as HUL focuses on volume growth. We expect HUL to moderate adspends in FY2017E to manage EBITDA margins, as competitive intensity is low,"" it says in a report.

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs has a neutral rating with a slashed target of Rs 664 per share. It has also cut our FY17-19 EBIT by 1-6 percent to reflect slower volume growth but cut EPS estimates by only 1-4 percent, to factor in tax benefits. It is concerned about a premiumisation-led strategy in an environment with high competitive intensity and limited affordability for urban mass consumers.

Its personal care growth was impacted in Q1 by price deflation in soaps and weak growth for oral care. Home care growth was led by shift towards premium detergents, partly led by lower price premium and partly by a better uptake for machine detergents. However, CLSA has an underperform rating with a target of Rs 885 per share. It says that the change over to IndAS did impact several line items in the income statement but the key change was in segmental reporting (soaps moved to personal care now). Q1 growth was volume-led while realisations wereflat on annual basis.Suggesting to sell HUL, Citi states that growth is elusive. However, it feels that personal-wash category deflation should ease over the next one-two quarters and cost saving programmes on inputs continue to drive margin expansion.

IDFC has an underperfom rating with a target price of Rs 809 per share. It is cautious that further weakness in market demand comes as a negative for the industry as a whole and has resulted in HUL not being able to better itsvolume growth performance of Q4FY16.

The brokerage firm says that HUL's overall size and rural mix restricts it from significantly outperforming the market in spite of the company continuing to execute its strategy of being innovative, premium and competitive effectively on ground. Given volume growth challenges, IDFC has reduced FY17 volume growth assumption to 6 percent from 7 percent ""However assuming an external factors led recovery, we assume a 8 percent volume growth for FY18 and improvingprofitability for HUL,"" it says in a report.

FMCG major HUL today said it plans to invest of about Rs 1,000 crore to set up a new facility at Doom Dooma in Assam, while announcing a change in its management committee after the resignation of ED and VP, Sales & Customer Development, Punit Misra.

The new manufacturing unit will be in the vicinity of the existing factory premises in Doom Dooma. It is expected to be commissioned in early 2017 and will augment the production capacity of personal care products for HUL, the company said in a statement.

""This investment is subject to receipt of requisite approvals and clearances,"" it added.

At present, Hindustan Unilever Ltd has a manufacturing facility in Doom Dooma Industrial Estate of Upper Assam set up in 2001 and houses three units that produce personal care products (shampoo, skin creams and toothpaste).

""With over 15 years of operating experience in the state and considering the support from the state government and the local community, HUL has decided to set up the new manufacturing unit in Assam,"" it added.

Assam has been looking at attracting investment into the state by offering favourable policies that encourage and incentivise companies to set up manufacturing units.

It is also intended to encourage suppliers to establish units for packing material supplies, and it is expected that the new unit will lead to the creation of ancillary, logistics and warehousing opportunities within the region, HUL added.

""Given the attractive outlook that the company sees in personal care, the additional capacity will support the growth ambition and enable the business better serve its consumers,"" the statement said.

HUL has a wide footprint of manufacturing operations with over 30 factories located across India.

On the management committee change, HUL said Misra has decided to leave HUL to pursue an external opportunity.

Subsequently, Srinandan Sundaram, currently Vice President, Skin Care, will take over from Misra as the Executive Director, Sales & Customer Development, and will join the HUL Management Committee. The change will be effective from 1st September, 2016.

HUL CEO & Managing Director Sanjiv Mehta said: ""Under Srinandan's leadership, the Hair and Skin Care businesses have seen strong growth fuelled by innovations and brilliant marketing.",373,0.9980524629354477

Manish Hathiramani, Proprietary Trader & Technical Analyst at Deen Dayal Investments and owner of manishhathiramani.comKey levels to watch out for:NiftyYesterday, the markets were languid - vacillating in a 50 point range with lackluster volume. We could attribute this tepid movement to an extended mood of the Eid holiday. It is quite possible that volumes pick up from Monday onwards as we kick into a new week of trading. Key resistance:The key resistance of Nifty is 8400 in the short term - maybe for the July series. Until we do not conquer that level on the back of healthy volumes, I do not suppose we will see a meaningful up move. Crucial support: On the converse, 8150 is a key support level which the market must hold. So, we do not pass the baton in the hands of the bears. If we can cross 8400, we could see 8500-8600 and if we break 8150, the markets could go down to 8000. Stocks We are in a market which is very stock specific and not sector specific as it used to be before. Vedanta and Hindalco Industries have been active on the positive side today while Tata Steel closed in the negative. The HDFC twins were positive in the financial space while State Bank of India and ICICI Bank closed in the negative. Bullish playsI am of the opinion that the following stocks are interesting trading picks over the next few sessions:Hindustan Unilever for a target of Rs 950Lupin for a target of Rs 1740Axis Bank for a target of Rs 560Bharat Heavy Electricals for a target of Rs 150",278,-0.6012066006660461

Axis Direct's research report on Hindustan Unilever



As part of our ‘Rural Demand’ series, we met with Mr. Punit Misra, Head of Sales, Hindustan Unilever (HUVR) to gauge how the demand scenario is shaping up in rural. Rural demand remains stressed with small population group villages that have high dependence on agri-income being hit the most. Mass categories and brands have been most impacted but premiumization as a trend has not been affected much and remains a key growth driver for the sector. With expectation of good monsoon, management believes demand can improve soon on the back of better sentiment although income growth can take time.

The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions. We like the strategic direction and execution at HUVR but believe EPS growth will be restricted to 12-13%. We estimate net sales/EPS CAGR of 11%/13% over FY16-18. Valuation at FY18 P/E of 37x leaves little room for upside or error. Maintain HOLD with target price of Rs 825 (Rs 790 earlier), based on 33x forward multiple. At CMP of Rs 883, the stock trades at 41.9x/36.8x FY17E/FY18E EPS of Rs 21.1/24.0.

Moneycontrol BureauBrokerage house Deutsche Bank has trimmed its Sensex target to 27,000 from 29,000 earlier, citing global uncertainty in the wake of ‘Brexit.’“As the long and complicated process of political and economic separation of the UK from the EU unfolds, financial market volatility will remain elevated,” says the Deutsche Bank note, adding, “until the dust settles, the risk of markets reacting irrationally will stay elevated.”The brokerage has advised clients to invest in sectors that have the least exposure to global macro. The only exception is pharmaceuticals as a strong dollar will benefit companies having a sizeable exposure to the US market.“Among the domestic sectors, utilities, tractors, oil marketing companies, cement, consumer staples stand out.

Moneycontrol Bureau CLSA has retained underperform rating on HUL as it finds valuations to be expensive but raised target price to Rs 885 from Rs 800 per share. After single-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth for the past few years partly due to fiscal headwinds, CLSA expects HUL to post 15 percent earnings CAGR over FY16-19. The brokerage firm is impressed by HUL's performance as the FMCG company generated 110 percent return on average equity (ROAE) and maintained 100 percent dividend payout in FY16. Analysing HUL's annual report, CLSA says that despite a 49 percent annual rise in capex, free cash flow (FCF) increased 16 percent. As per its estimates, HUL may see over 20 percent CAGR in FCF in FY16-19. ""Interestingly, HUL is already in the midst of seeking approvals to transfer Rs 2200 crore from the general reserve to the profit and loss account – this would be utilised to return money to shareholders, although the form this would take is still unknown,"" it says in a report. Its margins in January-March quarter beat street estimates but volume growth was dismal. Post Q4 results, most analysts were bullish on the stock but concerns over rural demand and monsoon still persist.HUL posted net profit at Rs 1090 crore in January-March quarter, up 7 percent from Rs 1018 crore in corresponding quarter last fiscal. Total revenue in Q4 rose 3.5 percent at Rs 7945 crore against Rs 7675 crore in year-ago period. However, volume growth of 4 percent (YoY) in the quarter was disapointing. In Q4, gross margins rose 240 basis points (bps) at 52.6 percent versus 50.2 percent YoY. Raw material costs slipped 2.9 percent at Rs 976 crore but advertising spends increased 6.3 percent at Rs 1090 crore.Shares of HUL fell 2 percent intraday on Thursday.

(1) Domestic business grew 4% YoY in FY16, with underlying ahead-of-market volume growth of 6% and EBIT growth of 10% YoY.

(3) Rural demand remains tepid.

Neelkanth Mishra of Credit Suisse (CS) says Q4 was better-than-expected with 46 percent of Nifty companies beating CS estimates, the highest in nearly three years and 34 percent missed CS estimates, the lowest since Q1FY15.

""Beats were concentrated in consumer discretionary, materials, energy and staples; misses in financials, industrials, healthcare and IT,"" he adds.

He believes market confidence in a mid-teen index EPS growth for FY17 should improve.

Mishra says good Q4 numbers support his view that domestic growth is reviving and drag from global links should be lower.

""Outperforms include ICICI Bank, L&T, BPCL, HUL, Tata Motors, Shriram Transport and underperforms include SBI, Bharti Airtel & BHEL,"" he says.",120,0.5000057518482208

F&O expiry, this time around, likely happened on Wednesday as the Nifty started at a good 57 percent rollover, says Manoj Murlidharan of Religare Securities. Usually, the Nifty starts at 52-53 percent rollover before expiry, he adds. Murlidharan has a buy call on Nifty at 7,950 levels. Some stock-specific ideas will be available in trade today. He has a buy call on NTPC with target of Rs 24.2 and stop loss at Rs 21. His other buy calls include Hindustan Unilever with target of Rs 836 and stop loss of Rs 856 and TV18 with target of Rs 38.10 and stop loss at Rs 42.Below is the verbatim transcript of Manoj Murlidharan’s interview with Latha Venkatesh & Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18.Sonia: Let me start of with some of your stocks you have a buy on NHPC, and you also have a buy on TV18 today?A: If you are looking on to the Index, I guess I won’t be wrong if I say the expiry was yesterday because if we see the amount of rollovers that has happened Nifty usually started 50-52 percent and we are starting at a good 57 percent. It is the Bank Nifty which is almost a 6-7 percent odd. Ideally, as I there would be some stock specific move. We are looking to the concept of Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) buy and we feel NHPC would be a buy at Rs 22.10 we recommend that with a stop loss of Rs 21 and we are expecting a target of Rs 24.20 on that. The second buy call would be on TV18. At Rs 38.10 we would recommend that, this is strictly on the basis of the rollover yet to get into the next contact of June. Stop loss of Rs 36 we are expecting a target of Rs 42.Hindustan Unilever would be a buy as well, but we would recommend buying it at Rs 836 with a stop loss at Rs 827 and a target of Rs 856 on that.",344,

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) has received fair trade regulator CCI's nod to sell its rice exports business to Delhi-based LT Foods.

The deal, announced in March, allows transfer of the brands and inventory to LT Foods for Rs 25 crore, which owns Dawat basmati rice brand.

In a tweet, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it has approved ""acquisition of rice business of HUL by LT Foods"".

HUL's decision to sell the business is in line with its strategy to exit non-core operations while continuing to drive its growth agenda in the core packaged foods segment, the company had said.

The rice export business, primarily carried out under the brands Gold Seal Indus Valley and Rozana, will be sold to LT Foods Middle East DMCC, a group company of LT Foods.

HUL began exporting premium Basmati rice in 1985 under the brand Gold Seal Indus Valley to various countries in the Middle East and Europe, which was subsequently extended to other brands and geographies.

The brands registered a turnover of Rs 51 crore, audited financials for 2014-15 showed.",191,

Moneycontrol Bureau

Investors are still positive on Hindustan Unilever as its margins beat street estimates but volume growth was dismal in January-March quarter. Shares of the FMCG major jumped over 2 percent intraday on Tuesday.

Though a bit cautious, most analysts are bullish on the stock but concerns over rural demand and monsoon still persist.

Credit Suisse maintains outperfrom rating and cut earnings forecasts by 4 percent as volume trajectory has deteriorated. The brokerage firm expects a couple of soft quarters for volume growth, but believes that price growth will improve. It says that HUL's breaking consistent band of 5-6 percent growth in past eight quarters is due to realignment of channel spends and a general slowdown in rural demand.

Bank of America Merill Lynch reiterates buy rating with an unchanged target of Rs 975 per share as it believes that key negatives like rising tax rate and removal of excise benefits, are now behind us and possible share buybacks/special dividends may also support the stock. It is optimistic that HUL can be a key beneficiary of revival in demand led by a likely normal monsoon, 7th Pay Commission-linked wage hikes, softer lending rates, and consumer savings linked to crude oil.

Macquarie has an outperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 940 per share, and expects medium term growth potential. Value growth was impacted by the phasing out of excise duty incentives, one-time credit of excise duty refund in the base quarter and price cuts as lower commodity cost was passed on to consumers.

Nomura also maintains buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1040 per share. The brokerage firm expects HUL to be a beneficiary of any uptick in consumption.

Morgan Stanley reiterates overweight rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 945 per share. Key positive for the quarter was personal products operating margin expansion of 410 basis points. It feels that performance of key brands (Rin, Wheel and Lifebuoy) for HUL along with improved margins in the personal products segment, could drive earnings growth of 16 percent for F17. The highlight of the quarter for personal products, it adds, was operating margin expansion of 410 bps YoY.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank has a hold rating, stating that the stock is in ""no man's land again"". According to the brokerage firm, HUL's Q4 performance reflects the struggle in staples – price deflation or low price growth has a flow-through effect on profit growth at a time of lower volume growth in the industry.

It disagrees to the belief that price deflation has bottomed and that we are at the beginning of inflation-led revenue growth for HUL in FY2017. It expects HUL to moderate ad spends in FY2017 to manage EBITDA margins, in an environment of relatively lower competitive intensity from regional/smaller players. Considering the earnings miss and the cautious outlook on rural consumption, it has lowered FY16-18 earnings by 2-5 percent.

CLSA still holds a underperform rating with a reduced target of Rs 800 per share stating that deceleration in volume growth is a worrisome trend. It has cut earnings per share (EPS) by 2-3 percent over FY17-18. It warns that a gradual uptick in input prices along with a muted near-term demand trend still poses downside risk. It also feels that revenue growth may get some support from a rise in input prices though we are concerned about revised forecast of 9 percent revenue growth in FY17.

IDFC maintains its underperform rating with a concern that with rural growth not seeing a revival as yet, volume growth challenges will persist at least in the near term. It has reduced FY17 earnings by 3 percent and FY18 earnings by 4 percent to factor in weak performance across core segments.

HUL posted net profit at Rs 1090 crore in January-March quarter, up 7 percent from Rs 1018 crore in corresponding quarter last fiscal. Total revenue in Q4 rose 3.5 percent at Rs 7945 crore against Rs 7675 crore in year-ago period. However, volume growth of 4 percent (YoY) in the quarter was disapointing. In Q4, gross margins rose 240 basis points (bps) at 52.6 percent versus 50.2 percent YoY. Raw material costs slipped 2.9 percent at Rs 976 crore but advertising spends increased 6.3 percent at Rs 1090 crore.

Betting big on Dabur, Morgan Stanley feels it is the best-positioned staples portfolio in India. It has an overweight rating on Dabur with a target of Rs 325 per share. It is confident that the stock may be re-rated as investor confidence on growth visibility improves while steady earnings growth and better performance in the international business works in favour for the company.

Morgan Stanley says that Dabur has underperformed HUL, Godrej Consumer and Marico over the last six months by 10-34 percent on concerns of rising competition. It is positive that over FY2016-18, Dabur will become the most expensive staples stock in their coverage versus one of the cheapest now. Investors are likely to pay a premium for its strong product portfolio

The brokerage firm adds that Dabur is best placed to extend its core product portfolio with forecasts of a normal monsoon rains.

Accordin to Morgan Stanley, companies that are able to drive successful innovations to capture new consumers will emerge as winners. ""Dabur has the ability to launch highly differentiated product offerings across its product portfolio, catalyzed by likely buoyancy in consumer sentiment from income growth and lifestyle changes, recent success of Patanjali and increasing awareness of Ayurvedic products,"" it says in a report.

At 11:38 hrs Dabur India was quoting at Rs 264.35, down Rs 1.15, or 0.43 percent on the BSE.

Neelkanth Mishra of Credit Suisse says commodity prices have rebounded from 25-year lows hit in January 2016 and prices are up for most large commodities.

In some prior years, the rebound fizzled in April/May with seasonal demand weakness but that seems unlikely this year, he feels.

According to him, concerns on metals may soften long enough to necessitate a tactical portfolio change.

""We cut underweight on financials and flip to overweight on metals, funding it from low-growth sectors such as IT and utilities. We maintain overweight on HUL, BPCL, Maruti Suzuki, and HDFC & underweight on SBI & Bharti Airtel,"" Mishra says.",112,-0.4537235051393509

The market rally, which has been seen in last five to six weeks, needs a bit of consolidation, says Jyotivardhan Jaipuria Founder & MD Veda Investment Managers. Lot of global as well as domestic factors has been responsible for this rally. Jaipuria, who is bullish on domestic money, says that Nifty may touch 9,000 mark before the end of this year. Ashwini Gujral of ashwinigujral.com says that looking at the current momentum, it isn’t far when Nifty re-visits 7,900-8,000 level. The main trigger for this market is the monsoon forecast, Gujral says adding that: “since markets discount the future it will be easier to absorb whatever negative surprises are there.”Among emerging markets (EMs), the best performing market so far has been Brazil on back on low commodity prices. “In this sort of a rally, India actually does not do as well as a lot of other emerging markets do because India is treated like a safe haven,” Jaipuria says. However, even if this rally ends, India is likely to do well among EMs, he adds.With expectations of an above average monsoon, tractors and two-wheelers are likely to do well. “The delta change is probably going to be the biggest in tractors followed by the two-wheelers because the rural story will play out,” Jaipuria says adding that four-wheelers will continue its volume uptrend. Banking sector, which has been reeling under stressed asset situation, will start performing better once commodity prices stabalise. Another positive for banks is more risk-on from foreigners who mostly invest in corporate banks, he says. Cement sector is expected to perform well in longer period based on the recent momentum. However, Jaipuria expects stocks to dip as earnings will not be great.

The most underperforming sector so far has been IT last year. “IT is probably is one of the best performing sector year-to-date,” he says, but adds that likleiness of rural and urban sector performing well will keep IT understated.“IT, pharma and consumer probably will underperform most of these risk-on rallies,” he says adding that that growth in these stable sectors will be in low double-digits.Below is the transcript of Jyotivardhan Jaipuria and Ashwani Gujral's interview with CNBC-TV18's Anuj Singhal and Sonia Shenoy.Sonia: The last time when we spoke with you on this show, things were really different and now look where we are. We have crossed the 25,000 mark on the Sensex again. Do you think that the best is yet to come?Jaipuria: Probably from now, the market needs a bit of consolidation. We have had a very good rally in the market for the last 5-6 weeks. But, one thing which I must caution is, there have been a lot of India specific factors which have turned positive. A lot of this rally is still a very global rally. So, if we see global markets from the G20 Summit in China which was at the end of February, most global markets have had a rally and the turning point there in the globe was really since that day the dollar has started depreciating and which like people say, probably there was a Shanghai accord which helped that fact. But whether there was a Shanghai accord, it was a rally in the dollar which helped commodities go up, which has helped the equity markets go up and that is one overriding factor which probably adds to the positive we have seen on India.Anuj: Sceptics would say that even the Wednesday rally, while it looked good, actually paled in comparison to the big global rally that we had. And in fact, even week to date, even Indian market has underperformed the MSCI emerging market. But, going forward, do you think our market will play more catch up to correct some of the year to date underperformance. We of course underperformed in February, ahead of the Budget fears. That out of the way, do you think some more catching up is required for our markets?Jaipuria: I guess what we have seen and the reason India has been underperforming is we have seen the massive risk on rally. So, if we see the emerging markets, the best performing market is Brazil which is like from year to date, if you take dollar terms, Brazil is up over 30 percent. Since February end, Brazil is up 20 percent in dollar terms. So, Brazil has been one star outperformer because the commodities have done very well and that has been helping Brazil. In this sort of a rally, India actually does not do as well as a lot of other emerging markets do because India is treated like a safe haven. But, I would think over the course of the year, India would still be one of the better performing emerging markets because I do not think this rally is something which will continue and continue for a long time. In fact, my worry is that if this dollar strength now starts to taper off, because it is hurting Japan and it is hurting euro and I do not know what stand they will take. Somewhere the central banks there may have to make some move to try and depreciate their currency and that could see this rally coming a bit into question mark.Sonia: Let us talk about some big sectors which moved this week. One of them was autos. I am going to name a couple of stocks for you and tell me where you see more value. Hero MotoCorp which has hit a new high at Rs 3,150. Tata Motors, which has rallied 15 percent in just one week and then you have some of the smaller companies like TVS Motors that are sitting at new highs as well. Where do you see more potential now?Jaipuria: For me it would be probably, if you look at the next 6-9 months, I would be most bullish on the tractor people followed by the two-wheelers and the four-wheelers. So, that would be my pecking order because if we get a good monsoon, the tractors are the ones which are going to give you the biggest bang for buck because you will have a huge swing coming there. In the four-wheelers we have seen a strong performance over the last 12-18 months in terms of volumes. So, though volumes still continue to be strong, the delta change is probably going to be the biggest in tractors followed by the two-wheelers because the rural story will play out.Anuj: The leader of the current market rally, just this month’s rally has been ICICI Bank. Of course, from oversold ground we have seen a big rally in some of these economy facing banks. ICICI, Axis, even couple of PSU Banks. Do you think some more valuation play is left in some of these banks even if the underlying problems are still intact?Jaipuria: More than valuation, probably what is helping them is again commodities. So, if commodities start to do well, some of the problems which you see in a lot of these banks, whether it is the private sector or the public sector, who have lent to corporates will probably get sorted out. So, we have seen commodity rally globally. We have also seen because of the import price that steel sector in India is starting to do well. So, that is one thing which is helping. The second is also the risk on. As we get risk-on, people are more willing to buy some of these. And some of these large private sector banks are the banks which foreigners buy the most. So, they are some of the most over-owned companies for foreigners, so whenever foreigners start getting more bullish these are the stocks which go up disproportionately, and the converse also happens when we fall, they fall disproportionately also.Sonia: You spoke about the tractor manufacturers and how you are bullish on them, the other pocket that has once again comeback in the limelight is the cement space so names like ACC, Grasim some of them are sitting at new highs. Is there still a lot of potential here or would you be concerned about sub-par earnings keeping the stocks upside capped.Jaipuria: We see cement do well over the two year-three year frame, but we will probably get better chances to buy at the quarterly results are not going to be greats. So, probably some of the stocks will tend to slip, so these are things you would want to buy when the stock prices come down rather than buy it at today’s prices.Anuj: The underperforming sector has been of course in the context has been IT. Ex of Infosys we haven’t too much by way of TCS or couple of other stocks. What do you think is happening here and incrementally would you want to put some more money in IT.Jaipuria: If you just step back actually IT is one of the best performing sector year-to-dates apart from best performing sector year-to-date is the metals, which of course as nobody owned and so it has done very well. So IT is probably is one of the best performing sector year-to-date. It is a play which for people it has become we buy IT when nothing else really looks good. IT and even pharma and consumer probably will underperform most of these risk-on rallies, because it’s become a very stable sector where growth in going to be the low double-digit but it is not a sector which is going to excite either way. You can’t expect a 25 percent earnings growth here. You probably look at between 10-15 percent earnings growth going forward. So it’s underperforming more because everything else is starting to look good so people are willing to take more risk on the gone in names. I would not be very positive on IT for this year, because my view is that we will get like domestic consumption both rural and urban doing well. There will be some pockets where investments will pick-up also, so I would be probably neutral to slightly underweight on IT.Sonia: The top that we hit in January 2015 was 9000 on Nifty now there are some hopes that at least we can make an attempt to get there. Do you get a sense that before the end of the year we could be seeing those levels yet again.Jaipuria: I look at fiscal year, so before the end of this fiscal year, we probably should be hitting those levels or coming close to it.Anuj: What about the domestic sentiment, we have seen the domestic participation in this market has remained intact barring that two or three month period when the market went through that massive correction, the domestic flows have supported the market throughout last year and they continue. We haven’t seen big outflows yet. Do you think they will continue to support the market.Jaipuria: I am quite positive on the domestic money coming into the equity markets because of two things - one is as we get market rallying, the midcaps will do well and that always support domestic inflow. The second is we have to think of the alternate for lot of domestic retail investors so real estate used to be the biggest thing for them followed by gold and both of these asset classes are coming into question marks returns from them are slipping and to that extent equities are starting to look good. As interest rates come down, even people may start thinking as a saver I don’t get too much money if fixed deposit let me move a bit to equities.Anuj: We were talking through the week that the good part about this market was that a lot of people would have managed to buy the dips and they would have been rewarded with the kind of move that we had on Tuesday and Wednesday. However going forward what is your next advice. Do you think this is a market which has given clear indications of seeking much higher levels and may be sticking with long positions would work. Or is there temptation to book some profit may be early next week?Gujral: People who book losses late lose their money before everybody else. People who book profits early are the second ones who lose their money but they lose it over a period of time. Unless you have big profits in the market you cannot offset your losses.The kind of massive bar that we had in March, the idea was that if we pullback into that bar, you buy and the market will be able to reward you. How many days did we correct? Hardly 5 days and again is the market at fresh highs. So, that shows you what kind of momentum and buying is visible at lower levels. So, I would not be surprised that we should soon cross 7900-8000 band and move on even further.If this market was weak your correction would not have ended in 5 days. Given that 7500 which is way higher than 6800 is now that base, downside seems fairly limited.Sonia: You have been telling us repeatedly that one should accumulate stocks in your portfolio and the time is now. If you had to identify 2 or 3 stocks that one can accumulate at this juncture for the longer term 1-2 years, what would they be?Gujral: Importance of this monsoon forecast cannot be underplayed because that really gives the positive trigger to look for beyond these results. That really puts the market in very good shape to accept bad results because bad results are history and good monsoon is still to happen. So, since markets discount the future it will be easier to absorb whatever negative surprises are there. So, clearly it is a time when things like M&M Financial which used to be Rs 400 stock has now begun to show momentum. It has had one good month, the second month has also started fairly well. So, out here you could see targets of Rs 350 and that is for a normal monsoon period where it recovers from bad results to average results.Mahindra & Mahindra which has broken out today, when you see this kind of a large bar, obviously some big money has really travelled into the stock and that is the time when retail should get in. Any sort of correction on Mahindra & Mahindra I think in the next 6 odd months you could easily do Rs 1700.Similarly Maruti seems to have bottomed out and there in the weeks to come you could easily see Rs 4200 which is its 200-day moving average. So, it is a mean reversion that will happen in Maruti.Anuj: What about something like Tata Motors which was up 10 percent this week or ICICI Bank which clearly drives markets more with the kind of weight that it has and that was up 9 percent this week?Gujral: Tata Motors has been doing well for longer than Maruti has been. However again double bottom at about Rs 280. I think next target here is about Rs 430. Once Rs 430 zone is taken out you basically have Rs 150 upside to Rs 580-600. So, double bottom, all kinds of longer term accumulation patterns are happening.Similarly ICICI Bank, I spoke about this last month also that it has really made a bottom at lower levels and just a mean reversion means Rs 280-300 type of target. You can just see the way these stocks are moving - 6 percent on ICICI Bank is not a small move. So, people who are creating these moves chances are plan to hold it for much longer time.Sonia: You did speak about the monsoon theme that one can still play at this juncture. Are there any other themes that you like, cement did exceptionally well in the last fortnight, sugar did well at one point in time but there was some profit taking. So, any thematic stories that you would like to play for the next couple of months?Gujral: Monsoon, what does help it? Not only agri and chemical stocks, things like BASF, Bayer CropScience, PI Industries, Escorts, these things have been totally beaten up, out of favour, nobody owns them. These are the stocks you buy but it helps overall consumption.So, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Symphony, Dabur, what have you, everything tends to move up. So, basically a good monsoon means that at least 50 percent of your market starts moving higher instead of just IT, pharmaceutical trying to support it. So, basically a good monsoon will spread itself all over the consumption space plus things which are directly related to agri. So, all of those spaces should move up from here. Anuj: For last many weeks you have been talking about correction of the under ownership in metals and names like Cairn India. Do you think large part of that has played out or do you see some more rally in names like Hindalco going forward? Gujral: The point is that the markets move much further than anybody expects. At 9,200 nobody expected 6,800. So, we have just seen 10 percent of our market move which is really nothing. Things tend to double, triple in a market cycle, so I won’t be surprised if Tata Steel can tomorrow get up to Rs 380-400. That would be just a doubling of Rs 200 price. So, there is much more ahead. Everybody had gotten out of metals and commodities totally over the last couple of years and just average weighting them and things just improving a little bit will lead to those prices. So, I don’t think it is fair to say that the re-rating is done or from here you should have downside. Markets are like a beast, once you leave a beast where it will stop that only the beast can decide. So, chances are that if you are cautious now, you will repent at 8,400. So the idea should be to get fully invested and hold for the longest period of time so that you are able to take advantage when the good news actually comes in from the effect on monsoon.",3030,0.0

Edelweiss's research on Consumer goods sector.We estimate the consumer goods universe (ex United Spirits, Nestle) to clock YoY revenue, EBITDA and PAT growth of 5.3%, 10.7% and 9.3% (5.4%, 13%, 9.1% spurt in Q3FY16), respectively. Sales growth will continue to be primarily volume led. Though production was hampered for a few days in parts of North India due to the Jat agitation, it is unlikely to impact sales significantly. Gross margin expansion will sustain YoY, benefits of which will partly be ploughed back in to ad and promotions; A&P to remain high for most companies due to stiff competition, especially from players like Patanjali, Sri Sri Ayurveda etc. Phasing out of excise benefit will impact growth of Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Pidilite,GSK Consumer, Britannia and Colgate. We remain positive on urban recovery in H2FY17 led by the Seventh Pay Commission, interest rate cuts and OROP implementation. Rural growth is likely to revive with a lag as monsoon forecasts predict good rainfall in FY17. Budget’s INR900bn allocation to rural development and proposal for 100% rural electrification bode well for rural demand, if implemented.

Morgan Stanley is bullish on HUL and has added the FMCG stock to APxJ and GEMs focus lists. The brokering firm has removed Infosys instead.

Analyst Nillai Shah says that key trigger for HUL stock will be acceleration in volume growth led by market share gains driving price to equity multiple expansion. He is also optimistic that input cost benefits will start lapping in July 2016. ""At this time, companies will need sharp increases in volume growth or sufficient margin flexibility to meet market earnings expectations,"" Morgan Stanley report says.

The firm has also upgraded Infosys to overweight. According to Shah, HUL is the best placed stock among peers.

Hiwever, HUL's October-December quarter earnings was disappointing with profit sinking 22.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 971 crore despite lower raw material prices. Exceptional loss, slow revenue growth and lower other income hurt profitability. Revenue increased 2.7 percent to Rs 7,981 crore in quarter ended December 2015 compared to Rs 7,774 crore in corresponding quarter of last fiscal with volume growth of 6 percent

At 11:03 hrs Hindustan Unilever was quoting at Rs 863.90, down Rs 7.45, or 0.85 percent on the BSE.

Hindustan Unilever’s Lakmé and TRESemmé, Marico, Hindware, ICICI Prudential, Sun Pharma, Philips and Cargill were some of the brands that were felicitated for their innovative products.



It was a fun-filled night full of music, psychedelic lights, laughs, friendly rivalries and even stronger revelries at the ninth Product of the Year Awards, 2016 India edition, on 19 March, at Blue Frog, Mumbai. The event, showcased some of the best products in the country that were filtered through a pan India consumer survey conducted by their Research Affiliate Nielsen India. The OOH partner was Future Media. Zee Business was the media presenter and DNA was the print partner.



The host, Cyrus Broacha disarmed the audience with his trademark humour, including the fact that the show was on the night of the India Pakistan World T20 game, and joked that if Pakistan won then everyone would be forgiven for attending the award show.



Following this, a video on winning products was showcased with bytes from leading names in the FMCG sector, as well as bytes from some jury members who lauded the unbiased nature of the awards.



Raj Arora, CEO - Product of the Year India, while speaking of the awards that are now almost three decades old, said that the idea behind the awards was to get consumers directed to the best products in the market and also to reward manufacturers for their quality and innovation. He mentioned that a large number of winners continue to report a meaningful upward tick in their sales and market share.



The guest of honour, Rana Barua, CEO - Contract Advertising , said, “It is an interesting concept because we as advertisers, deal with clients and try and understand the product. Innovation is an important word. It is a must for every brand. When classical organizations decide to change and play the game of innovation, that is when we know a company is successful. The key is to stay relevant,” he said.



Vijay Udasi, Sr. Vice President - Nielsen India, addressed how and why e-commerce India has evolved. “E-commerce industry is pegged at USD 16 billion, with 61 per cent focusing on travel.

LT Foods said the acquisition of Hindustan Uniliver Ltd's (HUL) branded rice business will help the company to strengthen position in the middle-east market.

The company, which sell basmati rice under Daawat brand, has entered into an agreement to acquire the HUL's branded rice business, including 'Gold Seal Indus Valley' and 'Rozana' brands that registered a turnover of Rs 51 crore in 2014-15.

""The acquisition will strengthen our position in the middle-east market as it gives us an entry in the markets of Qatar, Oman and Bahrain and in addition to strengthening our existing presence in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait,"" LT Foods said in a regulatory filing.

Apart from GCC markets, the brands also enjoys latent equity across India, North America, some of the European Union and Asian countries, it added.

LT Foods said the total cost of the acquisition is about Rs 25 crore and the same would be funded by debt and internal accruals.

""The middle-east has the largest basmati rice consuming population. It accounts for almost 80 percent of the total basamti consumption in the world. This region being critical market and our limited presence with only 15 percent of our total revenue coming from the geography is now getting addressed by this acquisition,"" LT Foods MD VK Arora said.

""This acquisition will help us penetrate and establish in countries like Oman, Qatar and Bahrain where we have no presence. It will broaden our basket of offerings of brands with a high recall value,"" he added.

LT Foods can leverage the distribution networks of these two brands while gain from synergies of the supply chain management and back-end processing.

""These synergies will give us an improved margin profile.

We could target to triple the current annual turnover of these brands in 24-30 months timeframe,"" Arora said.

LT Foods offers branded basmati rice, value-added staples and organic food under brands -- 'Royal' and 'Daawat'. The company posted a revenue of Rs 2,780 crore in 2014-15 fiscal.

The company has five manufacturing units in India, two packaging facilities in US and in addition deploys five more third-party facilities to manufacture food products.",364,0.9992502927780151

Jubilant investors are hurriedly buying shares of ITC as brokerages are bullish on the stock. Shares of ITC surged 10 percent intraday on Tuesday. In his Budget proposal for FY17, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley hiked excise duty on cigarettes to 10-15 percent but that has not deterred any sentiment. The magnitude of excise increase for cigarettes is not as steep as compared to prior excise hikes.

Credit Suisse has upgraded the stock to outperform with an increased target price of Rs 370 from Rs 298 per share. It says that quantum of excise hike is a relief as compared to previous years. Stating that the company's valuation is attractive at 19 times FY18 earnings, it expects ITC EBIT growth to return to double digits.

Morgan Stanley also overweight rating with a target price of Rs 400 per share. It says that ITC will need 4-5 percent price hike to offset increase in excise. This is the fifth consecutive year of excise hike and ITC has passed on excise hike by way of gradual price hikes in the past. In FY15-16, excise duty was hiked 25 percent in cigarette lengths less than 65mm and 15 percent increased for lengths over 65 mm. However, Morgan Stanley sees a 13-14 percent retail price hike in FY17 and a volume growth of 6 percent.

Deutsche Bank has a target price of Rs 400 per share, expecting an 11 percent earnings growth for FY1. However, it still feels ITC's volume may be still capped due to high prices.

ICICIdirect has a buy rating with a target of Rs 387 per share. It believes a 5-6 percent price hike is likely. ""We have modelled volume de-growth of 3 percent each for FY17 & FY18 and price increase of 10 percent each for FY17 & FY18. We expect net sales CAGR of 9 percent & earnings CAGR of 8.6 percent in FY15-18,"" it says in a report.

Edelweiss feels the excise duty hike will have a negative bearing on ITC’s cigarette volumes. It expects 6-7 percent decline in cigarettes volume in FY17 versus 10 percent decline witnessed in FY16when weighted average excise hike was 13 percent. It expects ITC to hike cigarette price by 7-8 percent in select packs. ITC has already seen 11 consecutive quarters of volume fall. ""Various rural initiatives announced in the Budget augur well for overall rural consumption which has tapered off in the recent past,"" it says.

ITC’s key product tobacco-based items mainly cigarette sales volume saw a moderate decline in December quarter to 4.5 percent after four quarters of double digit declines. ITC’s cigarette sales volume has fallen over 20 percent in the last three years due to steep increases in taxation and subsequent price hikes.

Bank of America Merill Lynch has a buy rating on valutaions. It says that despite higher potential, ITC now prices in a 10-year EBITDA CAGR, similar to that for cigarette firms in mature markets, making valuations compelling.

ITC is the cheapest consumer stock in India and Nestle, HUL and Marico are most expensive. Credit Suisse pegs FY17 PE for ITC at 24 times against HUL at little over 35 times. According to the brokerage, valuation differential between ITC and HUL is the largest in 10 years.

At 12:14 hrs ITC was quoting at Rs 319.90, up Rs 24.10, or 8.15 percent on the BSE.

The Nestle brand managed to retain only 42 percent share in January while ITC's Yippee grabbed 33 percent, reported Economic Times.

While Maggi regained the No 1 slot in instant noodles in January, ITC Foods' Sunfeast Yippee has covered much ground and came a close second with a 33 percent share. The category, dominated by Maggi until May 2015, has become fragmented with others such as Nissin's Top Ramen and Cup Noodles, Ching's Secret, Wai Wai and HUL's Knorr having caught up.

After a sharp sell-off the market gained in last hour of trading. The Nifty recovery about 150 points from days lows. The Sensex ended up 189.90 points or 0.8 percent at 23381.87 and the Nifty was up 60.20 points or 0.8 percent at 7108.45. Market experts suggest the short-term trend seems to be cheerful as against the medium-term trend.Market expert Ambareesh Baliga believes this continuous volatility is confusing the people and the bears seem to be more confident than the bulls. According to him and Sudarshan Sukhani of s2analystics.com it is completely possible for Nifty to go even below 6800 levels. So for Baliga Nifty between 6850-7200 is a no trade zone and he would only buy only if the range is broken on the downside or upside.Sukahni clearly believes the market hasn’t bottomed out but thinks a relief rally could take Nifty to 7400 levels even. There is definitely one more down leg left for the market, says Mehraboon Irani of Nirmal Bang Securities but as of now the house has started buying for their clients, especially stocks like Infosys which he thinks should be part of core portfolio for a one-year time frame. The house in the recent past also bought into Tata Motors, Motherson Sumi, ICICI Bank even though the next 1-2 quarters could be a challenge for the bank. However, Irani cautions that one should be careful while entering into midcaps or smallcaps because if the market falls another 3-4% then they could suffer the most. In largecaps too one needs to be selective.For trade tomorrow, Sukahni would buy the Nifty because the price action according to him is conducive to buying opportunity. He would buy HUL, Torrent Pharma and short sell BEML. However, Gujral says he would rebuild positions tomorrow itself.

Moneycontrol bureau While Indian consumer sector is already grappling with a rural growth slowdown, newly launched Patanjali is further eating into these companies’ volumes. According to Credit Suisse, Ramdev's herbal brand of products is giving a tough competition to companies like Dabur and Colgate.

In a report, the brokerage says that Patanjali's impact was clearly visible in October-December quarter with Colgate seeing flat volumes on annual basis and Dabur seeing a revenue decline in its health supplements business. The yoga guru's brand has a basket of product ranging from honey, health drinks, fruit juices, sweets, cookies, spices, tea, flour, muesli, pickles, soap, balms, shampoos to noodles, which are gaining popularity gradually.

Dabur India’s volume growth fell to -2.5 percent in Q3 as it was also facing juice supply issues. Its Q3 net profit rose 12.6 percent at Rs 318.5 crore from Rs 282.8 crore in corresponding quarter last fiscal. Its Q3 net sale was up marginally by 2.4 percent at Rs 2122.4 crore from Rs 2073.6 crore year-on-year. Nepal disturbances impacted Rs 108-109 crore on sales and profit was hit by Rs 39-40 crore.

Earlier, Credit Suisse had downgraded Colgate warning that it is facing a stiff competition in the dental cream category by Patanjali. Despite fairly limited distribution the herbal brand, patanjali enjoys a 4-5 percent market share. It had said that that Patanjali’s share may cross double digits in toothpaste category over the next few years after it expands distribution in 2016.

However, the brokerage feels that companies such as HUL which are well diversified are not seeing such an impact by Patanjali. Hul's Q3 earnings disappointed analysts with profit sinking 22.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 971 crore despite lower raw material prices. Exceptional loss, slow revenue growth and lower other income hurt profitability. Revenue increased 2.7 percent to Rs 7,981 crore in Q3 compared to Rs 7774 crore in corresponding quarter of last fiscal with volume growth of 6 percent.

Overall, adjusting for one-off headwinds such as the weak winter, juice supply issues and the growth of Patanjali, Credit Suisse believes underlying consumer demand remains stable. ""Aggregate volume growth in Q3 was 5 percent (YoY), 40 basis points lower than Q2. Rural growth has converged with urban growth for the past 2-3 quarters,"" it adds.Patanjali is in an exclusive partnership with Future Group to sell products in all Big Bazaar outlets. Future Brand is eyeing Rs 1000 crore in 20 months with Patanjali. Patanjali products is also available at its own 5000 retail outlets. In 2015, Unilever was the biggest products partner for Future Group, fetching it around Rs 1300-1400 crore.

ICICIDirect's research report on HUL

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported its Q3FY16 numbers, which were in line with our estimates on the volume growth and margins front. However, net sales grew 3.2%, lower-than-expected, to Rs 7822.9 crore (I-direct estimate: Rs 8059.2 crore). Volume growth was 6% whereas aggressive price cuts led to realisation de-growth for HUL. Sales growth in S&D, personal products, beverages & foods was 0.8%, 5.6%, 7% & 11.8%, YoY, respectively Operating margins improved 80 bps to 17.9% (I-direct estimate: 17.8%) on the back of softer RM cost (293 bps decline as percentage of sales) despite 165 bps increase in A&P spend as percent of sales PAT declined 22.4% YoY to Rs 971.4 crore due to presence of exceptional gain of Rs 396.6 crore in Q3FY15 and exceptional loss of Rs 79.6 crore in Q3FY16 coupled with 175 bps increase in tax rate

With strong brands in the growing aspirational segments, HUL, aided by an improvement in margins (17.5% in FY16E, 18.2% in FY17E & 18.7% in FY18E), is strongly placed to capture a revival in consumer demand, going forward. We estimate sales growth & profitability growth of 8.2% and 10.3% CAGR, respectively, in FY15-18E. We value the stock at 37x its FY18E EPS of Rs 26.7 and arrive at a target price of Rs 1000/share with a BUY recommendation.

Religare's research report on Hindustan Unilever;

Hindustan Unilever posted in-line volume growth of 6% YoY for Q3FY16, but a phasing out of excise duty benefits and price declines led to below-estimated net sales growth of 3.2% YoY. EBITDA margins were in line at 16.3% (+75bps YoY) led by a stronger gross margin, partially offset by higher A&P spends. Adj. PAT was up 2.7% YoY to Rs 10.3bn. We cut FY16-FY18 EPS by ~1% to build in lower topline growth. Upon rollover from Sep’16 to Mar’17, our TP remains unchanged at Rs 950. Valuations at 35x/30x FY17E/FY18E EPS look reasonable. BUY.

Topline growth of 3.2% YoY led by volumes: Despite sustained volume growth of 6% YoY, HUVR’s Q3FY16 net sales grew at just 3.2% YoY to Rs 78bn due to a higher-than-expected impact of price deflation and the phasing out of excise duty benefits. Soaps & detergents (S&D) continued to see price deflation, growing at a sluggish rate of 0.8% YoY despite double-digit volume growth in key brands Surf and Rin. Personal products (PP) too grew at a tepid rate of 5.6% YoY, affected by the delayed winter and a one-time realignment of channel spends. Food/beverage revenues were up 11.8%/7% YoY. Near-term growth for HUVR would be led by a pick-up in urban demand as rural growth remains under pressure.

Margins in line at 16.3%: EBITDA grew 8.3% YoY to Rs 12.7bn (RCMLe 13.2bn) with margins up 75bps YoY to 16.3% (RCMLe 16.4%) – this was led by a 295bps YoY improvement in gross margin to 52.2%, which was partially offset by a 165bps YoY increase in A&P spends (to 14.5% sales). S&D EBIT margins were flat at 14%, PP improved 110bps YoY to 28.9% and beverage margins were up 225bps YoY to 17.6%. Adj. PAT inched up 2.7% YoY to Rs 10.3bn with other income growing by 16% YoY, while the tax rate increased 175bps YoY to 31%.

Maintain BUY: We pare our FY16-FY18 EPS estimates by 1% to build in lower sales growth. We maintain BUY on reasonable valuations of 35x/30x FY17E/FY18E earnings and roll over to a Mar’17 TP of Rs 950.

On the earnings front, markets will be eyeing the results of big names like TCS, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, Zee Entertainment and IndusInd Bank, among others.

Participants would also be tracking IIP data for November and consumer price index and wholesale price index data for December. ""In the coming week, we have a lot action as government will release key macroeconomic data which will built the market sentiments. ""Apart from this, Q3-FY16 corporate earnings and sentiments in the global markets and movement of rupee against the dollar and global crude oil price movement will dictate trend next week,"" said Vijay Singhania, Founder-Director of discount brokerage firm Trade Smart Online.

According to domestic brokerage firm Reliance Securities, the short-term trend is likely to be dictated more by ""global developments as compared to the India Inc's earnings' scorecard, where no significant improvement is expected."" Advising traders to be cautious, Reliance Securities said that investors should focus on quality companies' stocks as these counters accumulated during such challenging times tend to yield great returns over the medium-to-long-term.

Yoga guru Ramdev today said Patanjali's atta noodles is on course to oust Maggi as the top noodles brand in the country in the next few years, and the 'swadeshi' FMCG company will overtake all multinational firms in the consumer goods space, barring Hindustan Unilever (HUL). ""Patanjali atta noodles will soon oust Maggi as the top noodles brand in the country. Currently from about a 100 tonnes, our production of atta noodles will be increased to 300-500 tonnes,"" Ramdev told reporters at a conference here.

""Barring HUL, we will overtake all other multinational companies. These companies are taking money out of the country,"" he added. Patanjali, which is slowly capturing bigger share in market by introducing array of products at a lower price, will also divert 100 percent of its profits towards social service, he said.

He added that Patanjali is keeping its production costs low compared with MNCs, in order to keep the product price reasonable. In the next five to seven years, Patanjali expects to earn profits of Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore, and will divert it to non-profitable causes. Ramdev said that his persistent campaign against black money and corruption over the last five years has created awareness among masses, but it will take time for the government to fulfill the aspirations of the people.

""We have been persistently campaigning against black money and corruption since the last 5 years. The result is that people are aware of realities. Also, the country got rid of dynasty politics and a man from a humble background, who sold tea for a livelihood became the Prime Minister.

But, it will take some time (for the government) to fulfill all the aspirations of the people,"" he said. Ramdev is also planning to open a chain of schools across the country, based on vedic-cum-modern education called Acharyakulam, for which he is awaiting government permission. ""We will build a self-sustainable model, and every state should have 2 to 3 such educational institutions,"" he said.",343,

Raveena Singhmoneycontrol.comWith a Rs 2,000 crore revenue, Patanjali Ayurved Limited (PAL) has set the charts ablaze when it comes to growth. But the Baba Ramdev-backed brand may just be getting started. A report by brokerage firm IIFL claims the company is on course to clock revenues of Rs 20,000 crore by 2020, something that can have profound implications for both the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry at large and several listed players in particular.""What makes Patanjali a credible threat is that it does not try to beat other FMCG companies at their game; it changes the game for them,"" says the report, titled Patanjali: Injurious to Listed FMCG Health authored by IIFL's Percy Panthaki.The company, it says, enjoys several advantages over peers. It is associated with a personality followed by millions: Baba Ramdev. The combined with other factors such as price discounts, the appeal of the ayurvedic/herbal/natural platform and a desire to consume Indian brands makes for a winning formula.The IIFL report says that the company may gain double-digit market share in 10 of 25 categories it analysed, including Ayurvedic medicine, honey, ghee and chyawanprash.The companies that are expected to be impacted the most from Patanjali's are Colgate, whose revenues could be hit by 7.8 percent. ""Patanjali has already garnered more than 5 percent market share and we believe that as general/modern trade distribution ramps up, market share would further increase to 13 percent by FY20,"" says the brokerage.Dabur could be next, given Patanjali's overlap with Dabur products, such as Ayurvedic medicines, chyawanprash, honey, hair and skin care.""In some of the categories such as honey and Chyawanprash Patanjali has a high right to win as it resonates with Patanjali’s core brand values of health and wellness,"" according to the report.Other FMCG players such as ITC and United Spirits may escape the Patanjali onslaught, considering that they dominate product lines (cigarettes and liquor, respectively) that the latter considers unhealthy and against its philosophy. Market leader HUL can take a moderate hit, the analyst reckons.However, the company's sterling growth has prompted rivals into action. HUL, for instance, has already revamped its Ayurveda brand 'Lever Ayush' to re-position itself in the naturals space. Dabur has decided to ramp up its line-up of Ayurvedic products significantly.In a recent interview with CNBC-TV18, Dabur CEO Sunil Duggal said it was too soon to evaluate Patanjali's impact on its business, and expressed belief the company would hold up to competition.But as the brokerage report says, the battle lines are clearly drawn.",424,0.0

Having learnt their Maggi lessons hard way in 2015, the FMCG sector is desperately looking for a brighter new year with hopes pinned on revival in rural demand and push from e-commerce even as an enhanced regulatory glare would keep them on toes with regard to safety of products. While poor rainfall impacted rural consumption of FMCG products during 2015, heavy rains in Chennai and some other parts towards the year-end also hit the companies hard including in terms of impact on their production facilities. But the biggest hit came from ban on the popular Maggi noodles, which was subsequently lifted on court orders but led to greater scrutiny on all instant food products.

While Nestle India has relaunched the instant noodles brand, the issue brought to the fore the food safety issues as although questions also emerged about the testing standards of various government laboratories. Nestle is estimated to have taken a hit of Rs 450 crore and had to destroy over 30,000 tonnes of the instant noodles. ""The MAGGI issue disrupted business during the year and the shock is much larger than what the company alone has faced or what our results have indicated. It impacted thousands of workers, suppliers, partners, farmers, distributors, truckers, retailers and other stakeholders who constitute the Maggi brand,"" a spokesperson for Nestle India said. Impacted by the ban, Nestle India reported a standalone loss of Rs 64.40 crore in the April-June quarter for the first time in 15 years. In the subsequent quarter, its standalone net profit dipped by over 60 per cent.

The Maggi ban impacted instant noodles business of other companies as well including the conglomerate ITC. ""The instant noodles category was impacted and witnessed a significant decline in sales volume when the controversy broke out,"" an ITC spokesperson said. At the same time, the FMCG companies including HUL, ITC, Marico and Dabur were facing challenges of low demand on account of dip in the rural income due to scattered rains bundled with deflation of commodity prices in 2015, which forced them to slash the price of soaps and detergents and increase spending on advertising and promotions.

Although, there was general optimism about the overall economy, this was not seen getting translated into higher consumer spending. Many FMCG firms also faced liquidity issues due to an overall increase in cost of funds. The only silver lining was seen in the urban markets where modern retail chains and e-commerce boom emerged as new lucrative sales channels for them.

The companies are now betting on these channels to expand to rural markets as well. According to the latest government data, the consumer non-durables sector saw a growth of only 0.1 per cent during the six months period of April to October, as against 1.1 per cent growth in the same period of last year.",481,-0.9885738015174865

Continuing its drive against misleading commercials, advertising industry watchdog ASCI has upheld complaints against 54 campaigns in September, including those of Godrej Consumer, Marico, Philips Electronics and HDFC Bank. Customer Complaints Council (CCC) of Advertising Standard Council of India (ASCI) upheld 13 complaints of misleading advertisements from personal and healthcare category, seven in telecom and broadband category and six in e-commerce category, during the month. The CCC has upheld complaint against GCPL for its Godrej No 1 Soap after it failed to substantiate the claim that it was the purest soap.

""The claim in the advertisement, 'India's No 1 Purest Soap', was not substantiated with comparative data of ""purity"" of this product versus other products. Also, the claim, by implication, denigrated other soaps in the same brand category,"" the advertising regulator said. Philips Electronics TVC for modular switches, in which it had shown spraying of liquid on the switches was found violating the code as it was ""a dangerous practice which is likely to encourage minors to emulate such acts in a manner which could cause harm or injury"".

Private sector lender HDFC Bank failed to substantiate its offer for two wheeler loan approval in 15 minutes and found it to be misleading. ""Loan approval in 15 minutes was not substantiated. Also the claim, 'Only KYC required to avail a loan', is misleading as other documents are also required to be submitted to avail the loan facility and the terms and conditions in the advertisement cannot over-ride the claim in the advertisement,"" it added.

It had also upheld five complaints against leading telecom operator Bharti Airtel, in which four were for promotions of its 4G services and one was for broadband service. While, e-commerce firm Flipkart was also pulled up for two of its claims by ASCI. Flipkart had on its website claimed the MRP of Tek-Tron velroc safety outdoor shoes as Rs 599, while actual printed MRP on the product was Rs 499 and offered on discounted price.

Software major Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) emerged as the biggest wealth creator in the past five years, while MMTC and Reliance Industries topped the list of companies where investors lost the most, says a study. According to wealth creation study conducted by financial services company Motilal Oswal, TCS created wealth worth Rs 3,458 billion for the period 2010-15, followed by ITC (Rs 1,565 billion) and HDFC Bank (Rs 1,540 billion). Wealth creation is the process by which a company enhances the market value of the capital entrusted to it by its shareholders, the study said.

""TCS has emerged as the biggest wealth creator for the period 2010-15, retaining the top spot it held even in the previous two study periods (2009-14 and 2008-13),"" the study said. Other companies in the top-10 list are Sun Pharma (4th), Hindustan Unilever (5th), HCL Tech (6th), HDFC (7th), Tata Motors (8th), Infosys (9th) and Axis Bank (10th). Drugmaker Ajanta Pharma emerged as the ""fastest"" wealth creator for 2010-15, while Titan Company was ""the most consistent"" for generating wealth for its shareholders.

As per the study, the ""top 10 wealth destroyers"" during 2010-15 are MMTC, Reliance Industries, SAIL, NMDC, BHEL, Jindal Steel, NTPC, Hindustan Copper, Vedanta and Tata Steel. Together, these companies destroyed wealth worth Rs 6,494 billion during the past five years. ""The total wealth destroyed during 2010-15 is Rs 14.6 trillion, 43 percent of the total wealth created by top 100 companies,"" the study said, adding this ""is a significant jump from the previous five-year period"".

Eight of the top 10 wealth destroying companies are engaged in global commodity business. The only exceptions are BHEL and NTPC, both PSUs. Further, six of the top 10 wealth destroyers are public sector companies, the study said.

Sector-wise, consumer/retail ranked as India's biggest wealth creating industry over 2010-2015 followed by financials and technology sectors. The study ranked top 100 companies in terms of wealth creation.

Neelkanth Mishra, Credit Suisse says while India remains among the fastest nominal GDP and earnings growth economies, global weakness could be an overhang.

Despite rich valuations, he stays overweight on consumption and underweight on financials.

Mishra has an outperform rating on Tech Mahindra, HUL, UltraTech Cement and Tata Motors. He recommends trimming positions in SBI and Bharti Airtel.

Meanwhile, Mahesh Nandurkar, CLSA says looking at the consensus earnings trend over the last six years, considerable investor anxiety exists over FY17 earnings forecasts.

While FY17 earnings will likely get downgraded, earnings growth should still be near 15 percent, which would be far superior than the 7 percent average earnings growth seen over the past five years, he feels.

Nandurkar believes earnings recovery in FY17 should be driven by improved revenue growth as the economic recovery becomes more visible, operating leverage leads to margin improvement and most importantly, the base effect.

""Base effect-led earnings growth improvement should be visible from H2FY16 itself, with pharma, auto, cement, Reliance Industries, leading the trend, he says.",181,0.3332110544045766

Similarly, complaint against LG Electronics was upheld as its advertisement ""claims India's only true water purifier which was not adequately substantiated."" Complaint against Bharti Airtel was upheld for its Airtel Broadband advertisement claiming ""offer of Airtel Broadband 60 GB @ Rs 1099 with unlimited calls, was not substantiated with evidence of the customers who have availed this scheme.""

There is less stress per unit of return and you don’t suffer reinvestment risk. There are other benefits like power of compounding, freedom to pursue other business, family and personal interests. Ultimately it all boils down to the hurdle rate. See the picture below – which basically says why “Run & risk falling” when you can “Walk your way” to financial independence. Earlier we used to run screeners for cheapness (e.g. IFB Industries) and try to understand if the business is sound. But now we start with great business models (e.g. Agro Tech Foods Ltd.) and look for reasonable returns in the long term. Margin of safety is more in quality than in price and mistakes tend to be more of opportunity cost rather than loss of capital. Our rationale behind the thought process is that owning equity is like owning a business where a hired CEO is working for us and will quarterly report to us by con calls and/or investor presentations. Also owning equity has many benefits over running own business which are described in the table here: In owning equity, we get another benefit which is the potential to multiply the scarce resource of “Time”. As Tim Ferris says, “Be neither the boss nor employee, but the owner. To own the trains, and have someone else ensure they run on time.” Meaning owners of business are not limited by the amount of time they put in the business. The best doctor also can’t work for more than 15-16 hours a day. But in business we can multiply man hours by delegating, because here a hired CEO is working for us and we don’t need to manage business every day and night. For expensive stocks valuations in the near term one can wait for some opportunities as temporary underperformance corrects the stock but when you wait there is a chance you might miss the stock. Look at CRISIL chart below, in last 10 yrs it gave 2 brief opportunities to accumulate below a trailing PE of <20. To explain why standard valuation matrix is not the best measure to value such great businesses, we take some examples below:

: In the above examples if we look at P/E multiple then we might not invest in any company out of above four because they all look so expensive.: If we don’t look at P/E and we say that I buy all great businesses then we might end up buying Gillette also which is extremely overvalued (will discuss more on it later).If we face such problems then what is the solution to the problem.There are 3 aspects:I.: How durable and wide the moats areII.: Small size in relation to the addressable sizeIII.when no earnings are there.Let us discuss all of them below:I.: It is important to judge the depth and longevity or durability of moat and if the moat shrinks and disappears, a buy and hold strategy will not save you. In a nutshell, can you visualize whether company’s product/services shall be in demand 10/20yrs down the line & can we think that despite competition company has some competitive advantage vis-à-vis others to serve that demand? II.: Let us compare the parents of two Indian listed companies AgroTech Foods and HUL.Now let’s compare their Indian operations, one can clearly see that AgroTech has just scratched the surface in India.We take another example of Gillette and for simplicity sake we just focus on blades and shaving segment which accounts for all the profit of the company currently and add back oral care capex…We then use reverse discounted cash flow on it, that is -what is the growth rate in free cash flow (FCF) implied by the market in the current valuation of the company

*Growth rate of 51%= using market Price of 4904, as on 1st April, 2015

BLADE & RAZOR PRESENT SALES (Rs Cr) (June 30, 2015) CAGR% PROJECTED SALES 10YRS (Rs. Cr) GILLETE (Grooming)

1385

25%

12898 Overall Indian Market (As per Corporate PPT)

3683

9%

8719

Under reasonable assumptions of terminal growth rate of 4% & discount rate of 12%, we get to know that implied growth rate of FCF for Gillette is about 51%. And if FCF of Gillette has to grow by 51% then its sales should grow by at least 25-30%. And if it grows by 25% what happens is given below in the table, Gillette becomes even bigger than market size, which is impossible. So this framework, kind of gives a ceiling to the valuations for a company.In a nutshell, to summarise the framework - for a great business we see how wide and durable the moat is (that can sustain for 10/20/30 yrs) and then we calculate the growth rate implied in the current valuation of the company. We then project market share of the company vis-à-vis size of the market. Then we can take a call whether the implied gain in market share figure looks possible or not. For example, Gillette. III.: We may have missed Kaya if we had our investment thesis based on numbers only. Where there are no earnings- We look at how much downside risk exists. Let us understand with the example of Marico Kaya.a.Marico Kaya total market cap.~ Rs 300Cr. at the time of listing & Rs 180 Cr. cash equivalent in its balance sheet. b.Reputed Marico brand at this market cap & a 13 yrs history of the company, at the verge of turnaround, the size of opportunity is huge with respect to its enterprise value. c.Pan India specialist play on skin cured.Management started buying shares from open market e.Active management role taken by Harsh Mariwala in the new company who has a history of scaling up Marico to a size of Rs 26,000 crs (Sept 2015) from Rs approx 426 crs (Dec 1997).Once the company starts performing and delivering earnings you can again apply the durable moat framework discussed before to value the company.",1102,0.6185992360115051

Prabhudas Lilladher’s research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever posted 7% volume growth and 6.8% EBITDA growth in a scenario of benign commodity costs and price deflation in Soaps and Detergents (~48% of sales). HUVR seems on strong wicket as its strategy of premiumisation and market development provided double digit volume growth in key brands like Surf, Rin, Dove, Pears, FAL, Lakme, Tresemme, Bru and Knorr. HUVR’s volume led focus is likely to drag sales and EBIT growth in near term, however it will gain meaningfully in the next cycle, given that it has invested ahead of its competitors on 1) product innovations 2) marketing and distribution revamp 3) market development in premium segments across categories.

We are reducing our estimates by ~5‐7% to factor in higher price deflation and promotions in S&D. We remain positive, given strong growth strategy, high dividend payout of 75%, and ROE and ROCE exceeding 100% and 140%. Retain “Accumulate” with a target price of Rs 850 (Rs 900 earlier).For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Dolat Capital's research report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever Q2FY16 result was below estimate with net sales up 4.1% (est: 6.8%) on back of a 7% volume growth in the Domestic consumer business. Operating performance was below expectation with just 41bps margin expansion. We believe that HUL P/E multiple in the past has been driven more by the operating margin expansion. Lower than expected expansion in margin due to focus on volume and higher competitive intensity may result in de rating of P/E multiple.

We have reduced our earnings estimate by 5-7% to factor in 1) lower growth, 2) lower margin expansion and marginally higher tax assumption.

KRChoksey's research report on HUL

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) reported net sales growth of 5% Y-o-Y and de-growth of 2% Q-o-Q to INR 79553.9 Mn for Q2FY16. Domestic consumer business grew ahead of market at 5%, led by underlying volume growth of 7% for the quarter. EBITDA margins for Q2FY16 saw a drop by 192bps Y-o-Y and slight improvement by 41bps Q-o-Q to 16.7% and stood at INR 13258.6 Mn. Net profit for the quarter saw a decline by 9%Y-o-Y and grew by just 2% Q-o-Q with PAT Margins was down by 97bps Y-o-Y and 20bps Q-o-Q.

Valuations & Outlook: The business environment remained challenging for HUL with weakening demand from rural & urban market. HUL with its market leader in categories like Soaps & detergents, packaged foods, premium personal care products, etc., the company has delivered another volume growth quarter. We expect that HUL will continue to grow at 9.5% in FY16 and 10% FY17 backed by investment in brands with cost efficiency & innovation of new products which will continue to give healthy volume growth and improvement in operating margins. The near term outlook is largely dependent on pickup in Rural & urban markets. We are expecting margins to remain stable at current levels as advertising, sales & promotion expenses are likely to remain higher which will compensate lower input prices. The stock is currently trading at a P/E of 34.6x FY16E and 31.3x its FY17E earnings. We maintain our “ACCUMULATE” recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs. 865 giving an upside potential of 8.5%.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Edelweiss' report on Hindustan UnileverWe continue to remain positive on HUL's ability to grow ahead of the market and its pricing power due to initiatives in distribution expansion (direct coverage increased from 0.9mn in 2009 to 3.2mn in 2013) and product innovations. Commodity price correction will continue to aid gross margin expansion in FY16, though we expect partial benefit to be continued to be passed on to customers via promotional offers/select price cuts to keep competition at bay. Cost savings and mix improvement will help margins to improve structurally. With likely urban recovery, the company (higher urban exposure at 55%) is well placed to benefit. We expect higher investment in A&P to support brand equity, aid market development for future categories and to counter pick up in competitive intensity. Key monitorables: (i) rural growth which may moderate due to erratic rainfall, slowdown in rural wage growth, muted hikes in support prices for crops; and (ii) increase in competitive intensity due to softer commodity prices. However, with an anticipated recovery in urban demand and commodity correction to aid EBITDA margin expansion, we expect HUL to potentially benefit. We maintain target P/E of 36x FY17E EPS arriving at a target price of INR865. We maintain 'HOLD/ Sector Performer'.HUL, the largest FMCG Company in India, was formed by merging three subsidiaries of Unilever in 1956. At present, Unilever Plc holds a 67.2% stake in the company. HUL’s portfolio of products covers a wide spectrum including soaps, detergents, skin creams, shampoos, toothpastes, tea, coffee, packaged foods and branded atta. Powerful brands and an envious distribution network (direct coverage of 3.2mn outlets) are HUL’s primary strengths. The company operates through segments—soaps & detergents, personal products, beverages, foods, exports, and other operations.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Moneycontrol Bureau

Shares of Hindustan Unilever slumped 3 percent intraday on Thursday. There was not much to cheer in the FMCG major’s September quarter results.Its net profit in Q2 declined 2.6 percent to Rs 962.2 crore on slower growth in revenue and operational performance, while price cuts hit margin. Higher tax rate hurt HUL's Q2 and also there was an exceptional income from sale of properties in base quarter (Q2FY15).

CLSA retains sell rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 740 per share. It has revised FY16-18 earnings per share by 6 percent and tweaked revenue growth assumptions and also lower margins, particularly in soap and detergents. It is also concerned that the risk of a further slowdown in rural markets persists while an urban recovery may take time.

While CLSA likes management's focus on growth but says HUL's strategy of being competitive offset bulk of the gross margin expansion as advertising and promotions (A&P) rose to a 19-quarter high. Gross margin expanded 320 basis points (bps) on annual rise to 50.1 percent but was largely ploughed back as A&P spends rose 225 bps YoY to a 19-quarter high of 14.6 percent.

Revenue growth of 5 percent (Y-o-Y) was impacted each by excise duty hikes and product price cuts. Input price deflation had a severe impact on soaps & detergents where revenue growth moderated to just 2 percent (Y-o-Y).

UBS maintains neutral rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 925 per share. It believes HUL's strategy to place appropriate market-leading products across different formats and improve its product quality through innovation will drive revenue growth and sees personal products to be the company's next growth driver.

It expects volume growth of 8-10 percent compared with base case estimates of 5-6 percent in FY15-17. It also assume higher realisations from an improved portfolio mix, as well as lower raw material costs and other expenses. ""We assume HUL would be able to push through price increases of 6-7 percent. In this case, we would estimate a fair valuation of Rs 1150 per share,"" it says in a note.

Motilal Oswal also maintains a neutral rating with a revised target price of Rs 810 stating that worsening of rural consumption trends is a key risk. It has reduced estimates by 4 percent given the lower pricing contribution to revenue and Q2FY16 EBITDA miss. It adds that unlike peers, benign commodity cost environment is not translating into robust profit growth for HUL. Deflationaryenvironment and absence of material volume recovery pose a potential threat toFY17 earnings, it adds.However, Societe Generale is impressed by HUL's Q2 perfermoance and sees a volume growth uptick. Though its reiterates a buy rating on the stock but slashed target price to Rs 925 per share. It has also revised FY17 estimates by 4 percent, adjusting for deeper price discounts and a higher tax rate.

'While price cuts and increased sales promotion costs partly eroded the commodity-tailwind benefits, gap with regional players is narrowing and urban sentiment is improving. Hence, we were are not surprised by the pick-up in the pace of premiumisation. The Q2FY16 volumes uptick is testimony to this trend and we remain confident that HUL will maintain its position as market leader,"" Societe Generale says.

Shares of Hindustan Unilever gained 2 percent on Tuesday after Macquarie upgraded it to outperform from a neutral rating. The brokerage house kept its target unchanged at Rs 900, implying an 8 percent upside.

Despite consumer demand continuing to remain slow, especially in the rural markets, HUL management reaffirmed its guidance of maintaining competitive volume growth and modest improvement in margins.

According to the company's management, rural demand is weak due to lower wage inflation and muted growth in agri-income. Its laundry and personal wash segment is also seeing slow growth. However, the company is growing ahead of the laundry category growth led by higher priced brands like Surf and Rin. But the growth in mass brand Wheel remains short of expectations as it faces competition from the regional brands. In personal wash, the advertising and promotion (A&P) spends continue to remain high especially at the mass end. The growth in premium brands, Dove and Pears, has been higher than the mass brands.

With increase in competitive intensity, the company's personal products growth is also slowing. ""In the shampoo segment, HUL has reacted swiftly to the price actions by P&G by cutting prices on certain SKUs of Clinic Plus, Dove and TRESSemme brands,"" Macquarie says.

Also, the impact of the ban on Nestle's Maggi noodles is slowly ebbing and the company is now seeing sales of its Knorr brand starting to stabilise.

Macquarie continues to remain positive on HUL's medium-term growth potential. ""While the near-term demand remains sluggish, it believes the recent stock price correction (20 percent decline in the last six months) provides a good buying opportunity from a mid-to long-term perspective,"" it says. However, the brokerage house has lowered its FY15-18E earnings by 5 percent on lower sales growth expectation.",302,-0.10006733238697052

ICICIdirect.com's report on Hindustan Unilever (HUL)""Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has announced that it has signed an agreement for the sale and transfer of its bread and bakery business under the brand ‘Modern’ to Nimman Foods Private Ltd., an investee company of the Everstone Group. The details of the transaction amount have not been disclosed by the company and it is subject to statutory approvals and requisite clearances. HUL and Everstone will work together to secure the necessary approvals to complete the transaction over the next few months. HUL had acquired the ‘Modern Bakery’ business from the Government of India when the latter decided to divest its stake in the loss-making PSU Modern Foods India Ltd. (MFIL) in 2000. HUL had paid ~Rs 105 crore for 74% stake in MFIL. It acquired remaining 26% stake in 2002 for ~Rs 44 crore. HUL’s bread and bakery business consists of white and sweet breads, health and wellness breads and value-added bakery products such as cakes, muffins, buns, pavs, cream rolls, oats bread, rusk under the ‘Modern’ brand name. The Modern business currently has six manufacturing units at Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kochi, Kolkata, Hyderabad and a network of franchisees across India.""""The Modern Bakery business was reported under the ‘Branded staple foods’ category in the segment reporting for HUL’s foods business for FY15. Branded staple foods, which included sale of breads, wheat flour, iodised salt and rice in consumer packs, clocked net sales of Rs 465.1 crore in FY15. According to the company, Modern business’ annual turnover is currently ~Rs 250 crore and it is a profitable business. Thus, the Modern business did not contribute much to HUL’s topline of Rs 30171 crore. We estimate that the bakery business was on the lower side on the margins as well as earnings fronts. We believe that HUL’s Modern business faced challenges in the form of low growth in the bread industry, alternate breakfast options and low entry barrier in the bakery segment. We believe that HUL has taken this step to divest as part of its strategy to exit noncore businesses while maintaining its focus on the core packaged foods business. HUL’s packaged foods portfolio consists of brands like Kissan (jams, ketchups, squashes), Knorr (soups, soupy noodles, meal makers), Annapurna (salt, wheat flour) while Kwality Walls and Magnum include frozen desserts/ice creams. With strong brands in the growing aspirational segments, HUL, aided by an improvement in margins (17.6% in FY16E & 18.6% in FY17E), is strongly placed to capture a revival in consumer demand, going forward. We expect that the stock will continue to command a premium over its peers. We estimate healthy sales growth & profitability growth of 11.1% & 12.9% CAGR respectively in FY15-17E. We value the stock at 40x its FY17E EPS of Rs 25.4 and arrive at a target price of Rs 1017/share with a BUY recommendation"", says ICICIdirect.com research report.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Shares of HUL extended losses, dragging over 1 percent intraday on Wednesday. As part of its strategy to exit non-core business, the FMCG company has sold his bread and bakery business Modern to Nimman Foods, an investee company of Everstone Group.

HUL's bread and bakery business comprises range of white and sweet breads, health and wellness breads and bakery products such as cakes, muffins, bans, cream rolls under the brand name Modern brand name. Currently it owns six operating manufacturing units.

HUL's April-June quarter was disappointing as net profit grew 0.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,059 crore, impacted by one-time profit on sale of investments in the base quarter, higher tax rate and lower other income.

Total income from operations grew by 5 percent to Rs 8,105 crore in the quarter ended June compared to Rs 7,716.34 crore in the same quarter last year.

At 11:57 hrs Hindustan Unilever was quoting at Rs 800.30, down Rs 2.15, or 0.27 percent on the BSE.",175,-0.48309969902038574

Fast moving consumer goods company Hindustan Unilever has been ranked 41 on the list, followed by TCS at rank 64 and Sun Pharma at rank 71 in the Forbes list of The Worlds Most Innovative Companies. The list has been topped by Elon Musks California-Based Tesla Motors which has a market capitalization of USD 25.5 billion.

Musk has inherited (former Apple CEO) ""Steve Jobs' mantle as the cult favorite CEO. And his electric car company has grabbed Apple's creative crown,"" it said. On Hindustan Unilever, Forbes said the company had over 35 brands spanning 20 distinct categories.

India's largest IT company TCS, with a market cap of USD 80.3 billion, appears on the list for the eighth time. The company took a major step toward bolstering its digital services when last month it announced a training program in digital technologies for a third of its workforce. In the past year it crossed the milestone of employing 100,000 women, meaning that one out of three employees is now a woman, Forbes said.

Sun Pharma had a market cap USD 39 billion and India's largest drugs company appears on the list for the fourth straight time. Billionaire Dilip Shanghvi who owns more than half the company pipped Mukesh Ambani earlier this year to become the richest man in India. The list also includes software company salesforce.com on the second spot, followed by Amazon (8), Hermes International (22), Netflix (27), MasterCard (36), Starbucks (45), Adobe (74), Coco Cola (81) and Cognizant (96).

Forbes said companies are ranked by their innovation premium: the difference between their market capitalisation and a net present value of cash flows from existing businesses. To be included in the list, firms need seven years of public financial data and USD 10 billion in market cap. Forbes said only those industries are included that are known to invest in innovation.",358,0.9189850687980652

Homegrown FMCG player Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) on Wednesday reported 39 percent rise in net profit at Rs 199.23 crore for April-June quarter of this fiscal, boosted by cheaper raw materials and a massive spurt in rural sales following product innovations. The firm had reported a net profit of 143.45 crore in the first quarter of the previous fiscal. This is the eighth successive bottomline growth for the city-based company.

Total income of the Adi Godrej-led company increased 10.39 percent to Rs 2,114.46 crore from Rs 1,915.9 crore for the comparable quarter last fiscal. ""We have posted good broad-based growth for eight straight quarters,"" GCPL managing director Vivek Gambhir told PTI in a concall on Wednesday. The company saw a value growth of 14 percent in branded business and volumes spurted 13 percent in the said quarter, he said.

Attributing the higher numbers to ""a combination of factors, including lower raw material prices, product innovations, and activations,"" Gambhir said the company has posted double-digit growth in both rural and urban areas, with rural growing 1.6 times the urban markets."" In contrast, the market leader HUL reported a flat growth in June quarter net income at Rs 1,059 crore due to subdued demand in rural markets, which contributes a whopping 35 percent of its total sales. GCPL is also powering its growth in international markets through acquisitions. The company will acquire the remaining 40 percent stake in Chilean hair colour and cosmetics company Cosmetica Nacional to gain its full control.

""We will complete the acquisition in a month,"" Gambhir said. He, however, did not disclose the size of the deal. The company is also looking to completely acquire the operations of the African hair care company Darling Group Holdings in a phased manner.

""We are in a joint venture partnership with Darling Group in some African markets and have acquired their business in other countries. Over the next two years, we will completely take over the Group's operations in Africa,"" Gambhir said.",342,0.9785725673039755

Prabhudas Lilladher's report on Hindustan Unilever

""HUVR posted 6% volume growth and 17.3% EBITDA growth in a scenario of benign commodity costs, slowing rural demand and heightened competition from unorganised players, which shows the success of management strategy to sustain share and achieve volume-led growth. After the success of FAL and Axe, HUVR is looking at reigniting growth in Wheel and Oral care. We believe that HUVR will gain from uptick in demand in the next cycle, given that it has invested ahead of its competitors on 1) product innovations 2) marketing and distribution revamp 3) development of future growth segments and 4) aggressive pricing and marketing strategy in low demand low input cost scenario. We are reducing our estimates by ~5% to factor in higher price deflation in S&D and 20% decline in financial other income. We remain positive, given strong growth strategy, high dividend payout of 75%, and ROE and ROCE exceeding 100% and 140%. Retain accumulate with a target price of Rs 879"", says Prabhudas Lilladher research report.

Clamping down on mis-labelling of 'health supplements', food safety regulator FSSAI proposed banning sale of these products as 'medicines' and announced new norms for products based on ayurveda, sidhha, unani and other traditional health systems. Under the new draft regulations announced late, the companies can't claim that their nutraceuticals and health supplement products are for therapeutic and curative purposes. ""Every package of food or health supplements shall carry the words FOOD or HEALTH SUPPLEMENT... the term NOT FOR MEDICINAL USE shall be prominently written on the label,"" as per a draft order issued by FSSAI, which recently created a flutter by banning the popular Maggi noodles. Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has also proposed the maximum usage levels for cow's milk, buffalo's milk, camel's milk, ghee, curd, butter, honey, gold, gold foil, silver, pearl in ayurveda, siddha and unani ingredients based products. The limit has been fixed as maximum usage levels per day for use as a health or food supplements which are based on ayurveda, siddha and unani.

The regulator will finalise the safety norms after receiving comments from all stakeholders on the draft note. FSSAI said that the benefits of specialty foods containing ingredients based on ayurveda, unani and siddha and other traditional health systems of India, should be shown by science based evidence. On Thursday, industry body Assocham had released a knowledge paper suggesting that FSSAI should come up with safety norms for nutraceuticals and dietary supplements.

In the paper, the industry body said about 60-70 percent supplements in the nutraceuticals market, which has potential to grow to USD 12.2 billion in the next five years, are fake and such unregistered and unapproved products should be recalled. India accounts for 1.5 percent of the global nutraceuticals market. Heinz, Kellogg's, Nestle, Hormel, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals are key players in this segment.",319,

Food safety regulator FSSAI should at the earliest lay down rules for giving approval of dietary supplements and nutraceutical products manufactured and marketed in the country, an Assocham paper said on Wednesday. Currently, there are no regulatory norms for the approval or monitoring of nutraceuticals, herbals and functional food. However to regulate this segment, Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSAI) had set up a taskforce in May 2013, which submitted its recommendations in April this year.

""Nutraceuticals are gaining popularity but its growth is restrained by lack of a solid regulatory framework which is crucial for medial credibility,"" Assocham National Council of Healthcare and Hospital and Ex-Chairman Sir Ganga Ram Hospital B K Rao said at an event here. The knowledge paper on this issue - released by Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain - noted that the FSSAI should come up with proper guidelines for manufacturing and marketing of neutraceuticals, herbal and functional foods. Presently, 'the draft regulation for nutraceuticals and foods for dietary supplements' is being vetted by the legal department.

The early notification of these norms will help check counterfeit products, it added. Noting that the nutraceuticals and dietary supplements industry has potential to grow to USD 12.2 billion in the next five years, the paper said about 60-70 per cent supplements in the market are fake and such unregistered and unapproved products should be recalled. ""Small committees should be built at block level to check counterfeit products in the market and immediately discard them,"" the paper added.

Considering very low penetration of nutraceuticals in the country, the paper suggested that the government should provide special incentives and subsidies to emerging companies for the industry growth and create awareness about the health benefits of these products. The paper also suggested the government to introduce various functional foods and beverages in Midday Meal schemes to address child malnutrition. Nutraceuticals are the products that offer health as well as medicinal benefits, consisting of prevention and treatment of disease.

Nutraceuticals are categorised into functional foods/beverages and dietary supplements. India accounts for 1.5 per cent of the global nutraceuticals market. Heinz, Kellogg's, Nestle, Hormel, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals are key players in this field.",375,0.9986861348152161

Emkay Global Financial Services has come out with its first quarter (April-June) earnings estimates for the consumer sector. The brokerage house expects Hindustan Unilever (HUL) to report a 22 percent growth quarter-on-quarter (growth of 7 percent year-on-year) in net profit at Rs 1088.4 crore.

Net sales are expected to increase by 10.5 percent Q-o-Q (up 9.9 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 8483.1 crore, according to Emkay Global Financial Services.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are likely to rise by 12.5 percent Q-o-Q (up 12.6 percent Y-o-Y) to Rs 1482.9 crore.

Emkay Global Financial Services's Report on Hindustan Unilever:

Favourable base in soaps & detergents, strong innovation cycle and gradual uptick in personal care will drive 6 percent volume growth and revenue of Rs 84.8bn, up 10 percent YoY. Gross margins should improve 180bps to 50.1 percent on the back of benign PFAD prices, while concerted cost savings will aid EBITDA margin to 17.5 percent, up 40bps yoy. Subsequently, we expect EBITDA to grow 12.6 percent YoY to Rs 14.8bn, but higher tax rate & lower other income will taper APAT growth to 7 percent YoY to Rs 10.9bn.

Overnight, Wall Street ended marginally higher.Closer home, analysts will keenly watch the opening session of Parliament to see if the ruling BJP government can make legislative progress amid much expected political posturing. Key bills such as on land law and goods and services tax, among others are pending, even though opposition parties such as Congress have pledged to disrupt proceedings related to recent allegations of irregularities concerning several leading BJP policymakers.Today will also be likely the busiest day in earnings: Nifty majors such as Infosys, HDFC Bank, HUL, Asian Paints and Cairn India are slated to post numbers.",202,0.5226545929908752

Hindustan Unilever's (HUL) first quarter net profit is seen rising 5.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,110 crore, according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18. Net profit growth may not match operating profit growth due to higher taxes and lower other income.

Overall, analysts expect another decent quarter for the FMCG major. Revenue in the quarter ended June may grow 7.9 percent Y-o-Y to Rs 8,323 crore amid consumer sector growth at 10-year low.

Volume growth may be on the higher side of 5-7 percent range.

Gross margin may expand considerably around 180-250 basis points on the back of lower raw material costs, which in turn may boost operating profit margin. Operating profit is seen rising 13.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,495 crore and margin may expand 80 basis points to 17.9 percent in the quarter gone by.

Analysts feel higher advertising spends may marginally counter gross margin expansion. Fourth quarter saw 150 basis points hike in ad-spends/revenues ratio at 13.6 percent.

Segmental Expectations

They expect good performance from personal products segment that is likely to show 6-11 percent growth (contributes around 30 percent to revenues), which may margins upwards.

Personal products contributed 47 percent to EBIT against 37 percent of Soaps and Detergents in Q4FY15. Soaps and detergents segment (contributes around 50 percent to revenues) may show 4-5 percent growth and 8 percent growth is seen in beverages segment (contributes 13 percent to revenues).",248,0.9597449132374355

Despite the recent rally in the market, Mithil Pradhan of Violet Arc Global Managers does not think it is the right time to go in for profit booking. He is extremely bullish on the market. He is looking for a breakout in sectors such that PSU banks and IT that are not doing too well at the moment.

He recommends investors to continue to stay invested and buy on dips. He is bullish on stocks such as Cipla, Biocon, HUL, LIC Housing Finance and GIC Housing Finance. He also likes the midcaps space, especially names such as Arvind and PVR.

Market expert Shashi Bhushan advises investors to stick to largecap IT companies.

Post UltraTech Cement's first quarter numbers, Mayuresh Joshi of Angel Broking says he liked the stock at lower levels. He says the company's performance on the EBITDA front and bottomline was good. ""It was an all-round performance. But a lot depends on performance sustainability and what the management has to say,"" he told CNBC-TV18.

Joshi also likes Asian Paints despite the fact that it is expensive. He says the stock derives its valuation premium on the back of earnings and also being the market leader in the segment. He believes that the company will benefit from economic revival and capacity addition.

In the banking space, Joshi has a bias towards large private banks.

However, independent market expert Hemindra Hazari says if things stay the way they are and the economic revival takes more time and earnings don't revive any time soon, then the asset quality of private sector banks too will take a hit.",276,0.6000059843063354

Food safety regulator FSSAI on Friday briefed a Parliamentary panel about the Maggi controversy and regulation of toxic contents in packaged food items.

Senior officials of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and Health Ministry made presentation before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Food and Consumer Affairs, headed by Telugu Desam Party MP J C Divakar Reddy.

FSSAI informed about all actions taken by the regulator in last one month against companies selling sub-standard food products, sources said.

Consumer Affairs Ministry officials informed the panel about the growing concerns of consumers regarding safety of packaged food products, they added.

Last month, FSSAI had banned Nestle's Maggi, saying it is ""unsafe and hazardous"" for human consumption after it found excessive levels of lead and taste enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG). Consequently, Nestle had to recall Maggi from markets.

With FSSAI cracking the whip further, HUL withdrew its Knorr Chinese noodles and Indo Nissin recalled its Top Ramen noodles, pending approval from the regulator.

Meanwhile, the Consumer Affairs Ministry has decided to file a complaint with the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) on the Maggi issue.",196,-0.8931512981653214

ICICIdirect.com's report on Hindustan Unilever (HUL)

""Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is aggressively focusing on innovation, driving impactful activations, continuing to increase rural reach, scaling up its technology and tapping upcoming digital marketing channels to promote its brands. We believe that with one of the most extensive portfolios across categories where it is present, HUL is building a strong platform to transform the brand strength into healthy sales growth. However, we believe this would happen steadily as the consumer sentiment gains traction. We expect the near term slowdown to keep HUL’s growth moderate until FY16E. However, with a revival in urban demand and strong brands in growing aspirational segments, HUL is strongly placed to capture booming consumer demand. We maintain our target price of Rs 902/share. Hold the stock"", says ICICIdirect.com research report.

E-commerce major Flipkart on Friday said its chief technology officer Amod Malviya will move to an advisory role at the company, and its engineering head Sameer Nigam has quit.

Sameer Nigam will start his own venture. Malviya, on the other hand, will now be a part of the advisory board that Flipkart has constituted to help manage the direct fast-paced growth that the company is witnessing.

A company spokesperson confirmed the development. Flipkart had recently roped in Unilever executive Sudhir Sitapati as the first member of the advisory board.

It is looking at bringing in people with specific skills in areas like leadership strategy, technology and operations as Flipkart fights rivals in hyper-competitive Indian e-retail sector.

Last year, Flipkart had rejigged its top management with Mukesh Bansal taking over the responsibilities of running the ecommerce business. Co-founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal are focusing on new businesses like advertising and supply chain.",162,

Food safety regulator FSSAI will intensify crackdown on firms selling food products without its approval, following up on the Maggi controversy.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is awaiting reports from various state food safety commissioners who have been instructed to carry out tests on various products earlier this month to take further action.

""There are unauthorised food products being sold in the market. We have increased our surveillance. State food safety commissioners have been asked to put a check on manufacturers putting FSSAI and BIS marks even without getting product approval,"" a senior FSSAI official told PTI.

Noting that the industry should follow self-regulation, the official said, ""Some companies are recalling unauthorised products on their own.

If they don't, we will take strict action. The state food safety officers have powers to confiscate and destroy such products.""

The FSSAI had banned Nestle's Maggi noodles, calling them 'unsafe and hazardous' for human consumption after finding presence of lead and taste enhancer monosodium glutamete (MSG) beyond permission levels. Nestle India had destroyed Maggi noodles worth Rs 320 crore after the withdrawal.

As the food safety regulator cracked the whip on companies selling products without its approval, Hindustan Unilever withdrew Knorr Chinese noodles from the market. Similarly, Indo Nissin said it is withdrawing its Top Ramen noodles. Likewise, global cafe chain Starbucks had to stop use of ingredients not approved by the regulator in certain products served at its outlets in India.

The official said after the Maggi fiasco, state officials have inspected various markets and have found some companies selling noodle products without FSSAI approval.

When asked if FSSAI would take action on other noodles brands for non-compliance of norms, the official said, ""We have asked state food safety officers to submit the report of sample test of other noodle brands in a week. We will assess the data and take a call accordingly.""

After Maggi controversy, Indo Nissin on Monday announced withdrawal of its instant noodles brand 'Top Ramen' from the Indian market on orders from central food safety regulator FSSAI.

Earlier this month, Nestle had to recall Maggi noodles, while Hindustan Unilever also withdrew its Knorr instant noodles brand over safety and regulatory issues.

On June 8, FSSAI had come out with the advisory on product safety testing of all instant noodle products in India after lead beyond permissible limits in Maggi noodles along with taste enhancer Monosodium glutamate (MSG).

""At that time we had sought clarification from FSSAI since Top Ramen product approval is pending with the regulator. They have requested us to withdraw the product until they give the product approval,"" Indo Nissin Foods Pvt Ltd Managing Director Gautam Sharma said in a statement.

He further said Top Ramen was extensively tested in the last few weeks after product safety concerns arose in the category.

""We have tested at two FSSAI accredited independent laboratories and shared the results with FSSAI a few weeks ago. While many Top Ramen samples have been tested by various state FDAs across India, only in two cases slightly higher lead level has been found in the tastemaker,"" he added.

Sharma said the company was meeting state FDAs and sharing test results with them as well as seeking a re-test.

Instant noodles have attracted attention of regulators after FSSAI banned Nestle India's Maggi noodles. Earlier this month, the regulator ordered testing of noodles, pastas and macaroni brands such as Top Ramen, Foodles and Wai Wai sold and manufactured by seven companies to check compliance of norms.

These include Nestle India, ITC, Indo Nissin Food Ltd, GSK Consumer Healthcare, CG Foods India, Ruchi International and AA Nutrition Ltd.

Nestle had destroyed Maggi noodles worth Rs 320 crore after the withdrawal. HUL also recalled its Chinese range of 'Knorr' instant noodles from the market pending product approval from FSSAI.

Further, global cafe chain Starbucks had to stop use of ingredients not approved by the regulator in certain products served at its India outlets.",355,-0.9120152473449707

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) on Monday said it has reorganised its go-to-market operations from traditional four sales branches to 14 consumer clusters to service diverse consumers across channels and geographies.

The company has termed this initiative 'Winning in Many Indias'.

""This model brings us closer to our local consumers and provides us with a more granular understanding of consumers and competitors. It helps us serve our diverse consumer base in more differentiated and relevant ways across the country,"" HUL chairman Harish Manwani said at the 82nd Annual General Meeting.

""This is essential for the long term growth of the company and also fulfils our commitment to contribute to India's growth and development in an inclusive and sustainable manner,"" he said.

Over the last four years, the company has more than doubled its distribution reach, and not only holds 'leadership positions' in traditional trade but also in the emerging modern trade channel, he said.

HUL is also looking at effective ways to engage consumers.

""Today there are more mobile phones than television or radio sets and India is home to the third largest number of internet users in the world. We are using mobile technologies to reach parts of rural India that are still in media dark,"" Manwani said.

According to him, through its mobile radio initiative, 'Kan Khajuria Tesan' (KKT), HUL has provided over 700 million minutes of entertainment to consumers and its brand messages have been heard 425 million times in the last 15 months.

Manwani addressed how HUL's wide manufacturing base of 30 factories across India has helped create industrial ecosystems and can enhance livelihoods in the communities around them.

""Our wide manufacturing footprint has opened up unique opportunities to reach out to communities and build on our larger purpose, which is to make sustainable living commonplace,"" he said.

He added that HUL's experience of developing the local ecosystems around manufacturing units, offers perspective on a 'Make in India' agenda that can be scaled across the country.

Recognising the shift of consumer preference, he said HUL identified the growing opportunity of e-commerce, and is partnering with several e-retailers and bringing global best practices to offer better services to consumers shopping through this channel.

The FMCG giant is also focusing on initiating projects to address sanitation and hygiene issues in urban areas, based on its rural success.

""Our experience in addressing challenges in the water, sanitation and hygiene area will help us be in a better position to support the government's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan,"" he said.

In the last year, the company's domestic consumer business grew by 10 percent, with 5 percent underlying volume growth, ""both ahead of the market,"" Manwani said.",454,0.9733898314562711

After a bad day of slaughter on Greek worries, the market finally managed to pick up some strength towards end. The Sensex was down 166.69 points or 0.6 percent at 27645.15, and the Nifty slipped 54.40 points or 0.6 percent at 8326.70. About 896 shares advanced, 1791 shares declined, and 154 shares were unchanged.

Andrew Holland, CEO, Ambit Investment Advisors (AIA) says even if there is Grexit, it would not be an overnight process and would take months. However, since India is in a much better position than it was two-year ago, so even in a worst case scenario rupee could go to levels of 65 to the dollar and not further than that, says Holland because India is not that exposed to Europe and particularly Greece.

HUL is targeting to become 'Wikipedia of personal care' in India betting high on the business unit. Shares of the company rose 1 percent intraday on Monday when the market is struggling under Greece crisis. Credit Suisse seems to be impressed and convinced that HUL is in the midst of a virtuous cycle of growth and way ahead of peers in its thought leadership and execution. The brokerage has an outperform rating on the stock.

“HUL has a vision of becoming the ‘Wikipedia of personal care’ in India by not leaving any consumer need or positioning in this category. Key successes in FY15 have been the recovery of Fair & Lovely and the launch of Tressemme,” the report says.

The FMCG major’s Win in Many Indias (WIMI)strategy has helped it to increase its focus on local markets and has been a big gain for categories such as detergents, soaps and tea.

However, CLSA holds sell rating with an increased target of Rs 810 from Rs 775 per share as it finds valuation expensive, though it believes HUL is several steps ahead of peers and has solid fundamentals.

After single-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth in FY14-15, partially due to fiscal headwinds (rise in excise duty and tax rates), CLSA expects earnings to accelerate to a 16 percent Cagr over FY15-18.

""There is a high focus across distribution channels, including rural, chemist, modern trade and even e-commerce. Cost saving is also an important focus and several projects are underway to drive this. The company reduced 31 percent of its stock-keeping units (SKUs) which had an insignificant impact on revenue, but meaningful benefits on cost,"" it explains in a report.

At 13:22 hrs Hindustan Unilever was at Rs 892.20, up Rs 5.80, or 0.65 percent on the BSE.

MCG major Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) has decided to recall its Chinese range of 'Knorr' instant noodles from the market pending product approval from the central food safety regulator The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).

HUL's decision to withdraw the product comes a day after reports that Hindustan Unilever's Chinese range of 'Knorr' instant noodles may come under the scanner of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) as the product was not in its approved list.""HUL has decided to stop production and sale of its Chinese range of instant noodles till such time as its application is approved by FSSAI. HUL is initiating a withdrawal of its Chinese instant noodles from the market,"" HUL said in a statement.

It, however, made it clear that ""the discontinuance of manufacturing and sale of Chinese instant noodles is not on account of any safety or quality concerns.""

The FSSAI on Monday issued an order to test more brands of noodles, pastas and macaronis. It listed 33 items manufactured by seven companies approved by it in these categories, wherein HUL's Chinese range of 'Knorr' instant noodles did not feature.

HUL on Thursday said it had submitted an application with FSSAI for product approval for the Knorr Chinese range of instant noodles in February 2015 and the same was pending approval.

HUL's Chinese range of Knorr instant noodles are available in two flavours of Hot & Spicy and Schezwan in the market.

Last week, FSSAI had banned nine variants of Maggi terming them ""unsafe and hazardous"" for human consumption after finding high levels of lead and presence of taste enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG). Nestle India also announced withdrawal of the product from the market.",294,-0.9170382420221964

Mahesh Nandurkar, CLSA said since the March peak, Nifty has corrected by 10.6 percent. “While near-term pressures continue, we highlight that India's long-term story remains attractive & overall market valuation are not expensive,” he added.

“Among the stocks that have underperformed in the fall we like Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, Infosys & Zee Entertainment from a secular basis and ICICI Bank, UltraTech Cement & Sobha keeping in mind the long-term cyclical recovery story. Our other buy ideas include Bharti Airtel, Maruti, HDFC Bank and Coal India,” said Nandurkar.

Neelkanth Mishra, Credit Suisse said half of Nifty companies missed earnings estimates, the highest proportion in years.

As fiscal headwinds to growth recede, he continues to expect the pace of earnings cuts to improve substantially from here.

The market put out a very poor show on Monday with benchmark indices ending at 2015 lows. The Sensex closed down 245.40 points or 0.9 percent at 26523.09, and the Nifty was down 70.55 points or 0.9 percent at 8044.15. About 784 shares advanced, 1859 shares declined and 171 shares were unchanged.

Oil, metal, pharma and FMCG stocks were major laggards in trade today. Nilesh Shah of Envision capital feels the bull market hypothesis is not being challenged despite fall. This market will spend one more quarter trying to find a bottom, he says.

Shares of HUL slipped 2 percent intraday on Monday. Brokerage CLSA retains a sell rating on the stock. After a single digit earnings per stock (EPS) growth in FY14-15, partially due to fiscal headwinds it expect HUL’s earnings growth to now accelerate to 16 percent CAGR in FY15-18.

“We however find stock fully valued at 40xFY16CL earnings and retain sell,” it reiterates in a report.

CLSA says that company’s annual report indicates that consumer confidence has increased but has not yet translated into significant improvement in FMCG market conditions. Also strong return on equity (RoE) at 110 percent though lower asset led to a 10 ppt annual drop, decline in operating cash flow and free cash flow, negative working capital (rose Y-o-Y) and continued high focus on product innovations, distribution expansion, cost savings are some of key highlights of HUL’s performance in FY15.

In January-March quarter its fourth quarter net profit rose 16.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,018 crore compared to Rs 872 crore in the year-ago period. The bottomline was supported by exceptional gain of Rs 179.4 crore (against Rs 66 crore Y-o-Y) from the sale of properties/subsidiary and operational performance during the quarter but higher tax cost restricted growth in profits.

Total income from operations grew by 8.2 percent to Rs 7,675 crore during January-March quarter against Rs 7,094 crore in the same quarter last year with volume growth of 6 percent (against forecast of 4-7 percent).

At 13:25 hrs HUL was at Rs 815.00, down Rs 14.85, or 1.79 percent on the BSE.

Emkay's report on Hindustan Unilever

Operationally In-line; Hereon volume uptick critical: Retain Hold

Results operationally in-line, but misses on PAT. Revenues at Rs 76.8bn, up 8.2% yoy with volume growth at 6% yoy. EBITDA margins improve 200bps yoy to 17.2% led by gross margins, but APAT grew 10.7% yoy to Rs 8.9bn due to lower other income

Domestic volumes steady at 6% yoy led by soaps & personal products. Demand trends still muted, but expect rural penetration, higher market activities and likely urban uptick to drive growth. We factor for 8/9% volume growth in FY16/17E

Most input cost benefits factored in. Margin expansion now hinges on mix improvement, cost control and improvement in growth trajectory. We factor 150bps yoy EBITDA margin expansion to 18.4% by FY17E

Expect 17% earnings CAGR over FY15-17E, but would depend on higher growth, especially in personal products and mix improvement. Valuations still in high quartile. Retain HOLD with price target of Rs 750/share

""It was an operationally steady quarter with healthy gross margin expansion. We expect earnings CAGR of 17% over FY15-17E, but it purely depends on growth uptick and rise in premiumisation from hereon. Valuations continue to trade in high quartile despite absolute stock price underperformance; we maintain HOLD rating with price target of Rs 750/share"", says Emkay Global Financial Services research report.

ICICIdirect.com's report on Hindustan Unilever

Hindustan Unilever’s Q4FY15 results were in line with our estimates on the back of 6% volume growth. However, net sales grew 8.9% YoY to Rs 7555 crore (I-direct estimate: Rs 7708.7 crore) with limited realisation growth as it has taken ~5% price cut since January 2015. Sales growth YoY in S&D, personal products, beverages & foods stood at 5.6%, 13.4%, 12.3% and 13.6%, respectively

Operating margins improved ~190 bps to 17.2% (I-direct estimate: 16.8%) as benign commodity prices lowered RM cost as percentage of sales by ~310 bps. HUL channelised these savings to raise A&P spend by Rs 188 crore, increment of 150 bps as percentage of sales

With exceptional income of Rs 179.4 crore from sale of property, PAT increased 16.7% YoY to Rs 1018 crore (I-direct estimate: Rs 988.9 crore)

""We expect the near term slowdown to keep HUL’s growth moderate until FY16E. However, with a revival in urban demand and strong brands in growing aspirational segments, HUL is strongly placed to capture booming consumer demand. We maintain our target price of Rs 902/share. Hold the stock"", says ICICIdirect.com research report.

Venus in Gemini, Mercury and Mars in Taurus. Lord Rahu in Virgo. Pluto in Sagittarius. Neptune in Aquarius and Uranus in Pisces. Sun will shift to Taurus on May 15, 2015.

Following sectors will be getting astrological support:

Personal care sector will be receiving astrological support. Buy Hindustan Unilever, Colgate Palmolive, Dabur India, Bajaj Corp and Godrej Consumer Products on every decline.

Hospital sector will continue receiving astrological support. By Apollo Hospitals, Dr Agrawals Eye Hospital, Indraprastha Medical Corporation, Lotus Eye Care Hospital, Regency Hospital etc on every decline. This sector was predicted last week also and during the week, Dr Agarwal and Regency Hospital shot up by 15-24 percent.

Food process sector will also continue receiving strong astrological support. Buy Jubilant Foodworks, Britannia Industries, Nestle India, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, Flex Foods,KRBL, Vadilal Enterprises etc on every decline. This sector was also predicted last week and during the week – Britannia, Flex Foods, Nimbus Foods Industries, NHC Foods and Milkfood moved up by 4.6-11 percent.

Buy Amtek Auto, Bharat Forge, Motherson Sumi Systems, Lumax Auto, Omax Autos, Sundaram-Clayton, Phoenix Lamps etc. This sector was also predicted last week and during the week, Remsons Industries, Menon Pistons, Phoenix Lamps, Rasandik Engineering Industries (India), Shivam Autotech and Omax Auto moved up by 5-17 percent.

NBFC/housing finance sector will be receiving astrological support.

Accumulate Arvind and Asian Paints on every dip.

Every very year with commencement on new Samvat (Hindu New Year), astrologically, based on planetary position, certain new sectors start getting astrological support and outperform, while others remain laggard.

Always be very cautious, when some main planets i.e. Rahu, Ketu, Jupiter and Lord Saturn are changing their houses. It may be that certain sectors which were continuously getting support for long time may stop receiving support due to change in position by above planets and stocks of those sectors starts coming down, resulting in losses. This is common reason, why most people loss money.

One should trade only in the stocks of that sectors which are getting very strong astrologically support.

Sectors which get very strong astro support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

Moneycontrol Bureau

Reliance Securities remains neutral on HUL with a target price of Rs 825 per share. The brokerage is concerned that price wars (if any) in soap and detergents (S&D) as well as personal products (PP) categories may impact margins for the segments and will warrant a re-rating of the stock. It also states that faster than anticipated revival in volume growth holds an upside risk.

""With all signs indicating towards lower growth from rural India owing to negative macro economics, given HUL’s prominent presence in rural India volume growth in sales will remain in mid-single digit for the company in FY16. We factor increase in operating margins by an average 55 basis year-on-year aided by mix improvement and benign input costs,"" it says in a report.

Its fourth quarter profit rose 16.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,018 crore compared to Rs 872 crore in the year-ago period.

The bottomline was supported by exceptional gain of Rs 179.4 crore (against Rs 66 crore Y-o-Y) from the sale of properties/subsidiary and operational performance during the quarter but higher tax cost restricted growth in profits.

HUL continued to post double digit growth in its personal products, beverages (tea and coffee) and packaged foods.

On Friday, the stock closed at Rs 894.60, up Rs 28.90, or 3.34 percent on the BSE.

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) matched result street estimates with the fourth quarter profit rising 16.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,018 crore compared to Rs 872 crore in the year-ago period.Sanjay Manyal of ICICI Direct believes the company may not be able to grow at the rate it has shown in the past quarter but expects the margins to improve hereon.

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview to CNBC-TV18

Sumaira: The topline at Rs 7,675 crore and profits at Rs 1,018 crore odd. How did these two numbers look to you and what is your assessment of what the volume growth this time around could be?

Jain: Actually the topline is a little slower than what we were expecting and we were expecting a slightly higher number and the bottomline is actually better than what we were expecting. So, what we were expecting is that they will pass on a lot of the cost deflation in terms of lower prices to be able to get better volume growth for this quarter as they took a five percent decrease in prices on a weighted average basis across soaps and detergent which is close to 50 percent of their topline and so we were expecting that a lot of the margins will be passed on to consumers but it seems that they have been able to retain some part of the margin expansion from cost of materials on their P&L as well and so this augurs really well for the company.

Nigel: We have the volume number as well. That has come in at around six percent, what was your estimate of the same? We were estimating a number of around four to seven percent.

Jain: Six percent is broadly in line with what we were expecting and overall this definitely points to a very good quarter I would say both in terms of margin and topline could be higher but given the price cuts that they have taken it was anticipated that the price component might be a little slower.Nigel: What is your first take, the numbers look fairly good?

Manyal: If you see the volume numbers, it looks good. We were expecting around 6 percent and it came in at 6 percent. We need to see this kind of a trend continues at least for two or three quarters to get a good signal that this is a consistent kind of a growth. There has been a slowdown reflected in the rural areas so it would be very difficult for the company to continue this kind of growth in the coming quarters. However, at this point of time this quarter it seems 6 percent is a good number. However, we need to again look this number because of the low base also there could be a high growth of 6 percent.

Nigel: What about the operating margins? Our calculations has come in at around 17.7 percent and on the EBITDA front itself it is giving close to around Rs 50-60 crore beat, if I roughly calculate the number over there it is around a Rs 50 crore beat, what is your take, margins have they surprised positively as well?

Manyal: It is a bit of a surprise but you need to understand because of the sharp decline in the raw material prices, crude prices and other raw material prices this was expected that there would be some kind of increase in the operating margin. The 17.2 number looks pretty decent. What I understand, there will be a further improvement going forward in the margins because raw material prices have consistently stayed low at least in last two or three months though we still need to look how the rupee moves in the coming months. However, what I understand because of further good raw material arrangement we would expect margins to improve going forward.",655,0.6662451724211375

Finance MInister Arun Jaitley Saturday announced an excise duty hike on tobacco to Rs 70 per kg from Rs 60 per kg. The government also increased excise duty on cigarettes by 25 percent for length not exceeding 65 mm and 15 percent for other cigarette categories.Similar increases were also proposed on cigars, cheroots and cigarillos.

The government also reiterated its stance on the goods and services tax (GST) which is expected to roll out from April 1, 2016. State of the industry:

The fast-moving consumer goods industry is battling with stagnant volumes, and slow growth. India's consumer story has just about managed to hold its head above water through 2014 but year 2015 promises to be one of hope, with experts expecting double-digit growth for the sector as inflation has lost some of its bite.

Expectations:

* The Budget wish-list of retail and FMCG sector stroke several familiar notes like the much-awaited goods and services tax (GST), revival in economic growth and improved infrastructure and favourable tax policies.

* FMCG companies were hoping Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's Budget would fire up enough excitement to make customers a bit more liberal when it comes to opening their purse strings.

* Another important issue was category specific tax rationalisation with cigarettes being one key area.

* The sector was also looking for policies targetting India's rural growth in the Budget with rural areas and smaller towns driving overall FMCG and consumer durable growth.

* Government's focus on inclusive growth agenda was expected to increase disposable income in the long run which would lead to rise in discretionary consumer spending, said CARE.

Announcements in the last Budget

* In Union Budget 2014, the government hiked the excise duty from 12 percent to 16 percent on pan masala, from 50 percent to 55 percent on unmanufactured tobacco and from 60 percent to 70 percent on gutkha and chewing tobacco.

* An additional excise duty of 5 percent was levied on aerated waters containing added sugar.Stocks that can be impacted: ITC, Godrej Consumer, HUL, Jubilant Foodworks",353,0.19545182159968785

Credit Suisse warns ITC may see de-rating if excise duty on cigarette is hiked over 15 percent indicating headwinds likely to continue for some more years. The brokerage feels that such an increase will signal an aggressive anti-cigarette agenda where cigarette prices have already gone up 75-100 percent in the past three years and it will be hard to pass on another 15-20 percent hike.

“In this scenario we could see ITC de-rate as headwinds would continue for some more years,” it says in a note.

However, maintaining an outperform rating Credit Suisse says in the past ten years, every dip in the stock on a high tax increase was an opportunity to buy but this time it is different. “The stock could have material upside or downside depending on how the tax increase pans out in the Budget, as this will signal the new government’s stance on cigarette taxation, and volumes are very vulnerable after three years of steep increases,” it adds.

According to Credit Suisse, if the government goes ahead with only 5 percent hike in cigarette excise duty it would signal a return of rationality in cigarette taxation.

ITC now trades at a 40 percent discount to HUL, the highest in the past ten years, and has underperformed HUL by 40 percent in the past one year. It would re-rate rapidly if the overhang of irrational taxation goes away, feels the brokerage firm.

Slow growth in cigarette business impacted overall revenue growth of the company in December quarter. Cigarettes revenue rose 0.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,142 crore dented by price hikes, excise duty and recent increase in the VAT rate in key states (Tamil Nadu, Kerela, Assam).

The FMCG major’s profit grew 10.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,635 crore as against expected growth of 12.6 percent. Other income, which surged 48.85 percent on yearly basis to Rs 582 crore, supported the bottomline in Q3. Net sales rose 2.5 percent to Rs 8,942 crore in the quarter ended December 2014 from Rs 8,727 crore in the year-ago period.

At 09:59 hrs ITC was quoting at Rs 397.45, up Rs 1.55, or 0.39 percent on the BSE.

Chandrakant Sampat, considered by many to be the pioneer of value investing in India, died late evening Sunday. He was 86.

“His greatest contribution to the Indian market was that he shared his immense knowledge about investing by mentoring many aspiring investors,” Ramesh Damani, BSE broker and a value investor himself, told moneycontrol.com

According to Damani, who counts himself among Sampat’s protégés, Sampat was the first investor in India who realized the powerful impact that compounding could have on investments.

“His investment philosophy as simple; identify great businesses and let the power of compounding do the rest,” Damani said, adding that Sampat would look out for businesses that would compound over many years, and not just one or two years.

“What many people do not know about Sampat is that he contributed to the coffers of the BSE through a simple advice that earned handsome revenues for the BSE over the years,’ Damani said.

Sampat is said to have suggested to the BSE that instead of a flat listing fee, the bourse should charge a fee linked to the number of shares the company was planning to issue. Every time the companies announced a bonus issue or raised capital through fresh issue of shares, the BSE would earn additional income.

Sampat was a first generation investor, who began investing in shares in the late 1960s. But his portfolio got a big boost only after multinational companies operating in the country were forced to list on the stock exchanges from the mid-70s onwards.

He began accumulating shares of blue chips like Hindustan Unilever (then Hindustan Lever), Procter & Gamble (initially Richardson Hindustan), Gillette (then Indian Shaving Products), and Colgate, from the time they went public.

Consumer goods firms dominated his portfolio all throughout. He had three main parameters in mind while looking to invest in a company. Minimum capital expenditure, at least a 25 percent return on capital employed (RoCE), and a record of paying generous dividends

He stayed invested in his favourite companies like Hindustan Unilever (then Hindustan Lever) and Gillete for so long that after the dividends and bonus shares, his average cost of acquisition came to a few paise in many cases.

Over the last 6-8 years, Sampat had grown wary of equity investing in general, saying he did not approve of the ways of aggressive managements and promoters, looking to enrich themselves without thought to the environment or minority shareholders. In an interview to moneycontrol.com in July 2013, Sampat said he had become gloomy on capital markets and had stopped investing some time back.

""Today, capital markets are blindly chasing growth achieved through reckless consumption, greed and fiat money,"" he said in that free-wheeling chat.

Prabhudas Lilladher's report on Hindustan Unilever (HUL)

""Although HUVR’s Q3FY15 performance looks disappointing with just 3% volume growth and flat ADJ PAT, HUVR has taken proactive steps to prevent a scenario of 2009 cycle when it reported 4.2% volume decline in 4QFY09. HUVR has cut prices of S&D portfolio by 5% and destocked inventory to ensure sustainable and competitive growth. Although Oral care and Deo’s continue to impact PP growth, sustained traction in hair, skin and color cosmetic is positive. HUVR is looking at higher volume growth, lower realisation growth and modest increase in margins due to crash in commodity prices. We remain positive on HUVR given that it has invested ahead of its competitors on 1) product innovations 2) marketing and distribution revamp and 3) development of new segments in the current downturn. We estimate 20.7% PAT CAGR over FY15-17 and value the stock at 32xDec16 EPS, given the expected acceleration in PAT growth, 75% dividend payout, 100% ROE and 140% ROCE. Retain accumulate on the stock with a target price of Rs 804"", says Prabhudas Lilladher research report.

Most brokerages have retained their neutral to bearish view on the Hindustan Unilever after the company’s third quarter earnings announced Monday fell short of estimates.

A snapshot of brokerage views on the stock post earnings:

Bank of America Merrill LynchRating: Neutral

A sharp 18% year-till-date run up in stock leaves limited upside to discounted cash flow based price objective. Earnings upgrades will be key for the stock performance

CLSARating: SellPrice target: Rs 650

Going ahead, lower input prices would drive up gross margins but realisation-led revenue growth would moderate; EBITDA margin expansion would also be modest due to product price cuts and higher advertising and promotional spends JP MorganRating: Equal weightPrice target: Rs 790

Volume growth is bottoming out and maintain our expectation of a volume recovery in FY16 aided by lower prices and an improvement in consumer sentiment. Price reinvestment would weigh on value growth, although benefits from accelerated premiumisation cannot be ruled out. Credit SuisseRating: OutperformPrice target: Rs 955

HUL has proactively taken price cuts of around 5% in soaps and detergents, a first for the company. However, we see this as an aggressive push for premiumisation as the company sees demand picking up.

CIMB Rating: ReduceTarget: Rs 800

HUL trades at 39.5 times/33.6 times FY16/FY17 price earning multiples, which seem rich given the earnings growth trajectory even in best case if we don’t see heightened competition in the key categories. We recommend that investors use the recent rally to sell the stock.

Barclays Rating: Equal weightTarget price: Rs 913

Trading at high valuations (1-year forward P/E at 35% premium to 10-year average), HUL required a volume/margin beat for further valuation rerating, in our view; thus, with near-term earnings likely to remain weak on muted volume growth, valuations are unlikely to rerate higher.

Morgan StanleyRating: Equal weight

While headline results are weak, underlying trends are encouraging, in ourview. The stock is up 18% year-till-date, and the midcap stocks now trade at around 24% discount to HUL, with arguably higher leverage to falling input costs. With improving earnings visibility, we expect the valuation discount for the mid-caps to narrow.

Deutsche SecuritiesRating: BuyPrice target: Rs 950

We continue to value HUL at 38 times Sep'16 earnings. We believe the higher multiple is sustainable due to: (1) HUL's market share gains in most categories, (2) likely acceleration in volume growth to 12% in FY2016 (estimated)",406,0.09931803666628324

Shares of HUL were beaten down on Monday as 3 percent volume growth in the December quarter disappointed the street. Over-optimism on growth hopes led by slew of brokerage upgrades had earlier driven the stock 24 percent higher year-to-date.

However, the FMCG stock began the retreat soon after the company announced its December quarter earnings; profit after tax before exceptional items stood at Rs 955 crore, down 10 percent compared to same quarter last year. Its third quarter net profit jumped 17.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,252 crore, mainly led by income from a land parcel sale. The oral care business of the company suffered due to rollback of excise duty benefits.

The stock shed 6 percent intraday on Monday, before closing at Rs 892.80, down Rs 49.65 or 5.27 percent.

Analysts are disappointed after the dismal performance and suggest to avoid it at the moment. Naveen Kulkarni, Co-Head of Research at PhillipCapital says the stock will correct a little bit. “In any case we were expecting this quarter not to be particularly strong because the base had a lot of promotional activity. For example in the personal care segment the relaunch of Fair & Lovely was in the base quarter. Also in the oral care category there was lot of promotional activity because of which the base was little higher. So, volume growth on that base has been a little disappointing,” he adds in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

Suruchi Jain, equity research analyst at Morningstar Investment Advisor also feels that the stock is overvalued now and one should avoid it for short term as fundamentals are not supporting it.

Market expert Ambareesh Baliga agrees that the stock is likely to see more correction.

Following sectors will be getting astrological support:

This sector was predicted last week also & during the week - LIC Housing, GRUH Finance, Can Fin Homes, Indiabulls Housing Finance, DHFL and GIC Housing shot up by 6-21 percent.

This sector was predicted last week also & during the week, Cipla, Dr Reddy's and SMS Pharma were up by 6-26 percent.

During last samavat 2070 among other sectors, pharma and IT sectors received strong astrological support and outperformed.

Always be very cautious, when some main planets i.e. Rahu, Ketu, Jupiter and Lord Saturn are changing their houses. It may be that certain sectors which were continuously getting support for long time may stop receiving support due to change in position by above planets and stocks of those sectors starts coming down, resulting in losses. This is common reason, why most people loss money.

One should trade only in the stocks of that sectors which are getting very strong astrologically support.

Sectors which get very strong astro support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

After a heady rally this week on Dalal Street, the market looks all geared up for another busy time ahead. The market recouped previous week’s losses with the Sensex and Nifty rising 2.4 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively after surprise rate cut by RBI and fall in December trade deficit. The rupee also gained past 62/dollar while lower crude prices played havoc.

Corporate earnings of major companies may rule the roost in the week. So, here are stocks that investors and traders are keenly keeping a close eye on.

Reliance

The petrochemical major announced December quarter earnings on Friday post market hours. It matched street expectations by reporting profit of Rs 5,085 crore for the December quarter, down 11.4 percent compared to Rs 5,742 crore in previous quarter on standalone basis.

Its net sales declined 16.9 percent to Rs 80,196 crore during the quarter from Rs 96,486 crore in previous quarter. Gross refining margin for the third quarter of current financial year 2014-15 was USD 7.30 a barrel against USD 8.30 a barrel in second quarter.

Deven Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Shares & Securities said the numbers are comfortable and better-than-expected.

Wipro

The software’s third quarter profit jumped 5 percent sequentially to Rs 2203.1 crore. IT services revenue rose 3.9 percent to Rs 11,344 crore in October-December quarter and dollar revenues increased 1.3 percent to USD 1.795 billion on sequential basis.

Constant currency IT services revenue in dollar terms grew 3.7 percent sequentially USD 1.84 billion, which was within the company's guidance range of USD 1.81-1.84 billion. This constant currency dollar revenue growth was much higher compared to its peers Infosys (2.6 percent) and TCS (2.5 percent).

Dipesh Mehta, IT Analyst, SBICAP Securities says the numbers give confidence of future growth prospects because it was reasonably broad based. The stock is sure to do well going forward, says Mehta. The guidance given by the company too is in line with expectations, he adds.

SpiceJet

The ministry may give clearance to revival plan next week, according to CNBC-TV18 sources. After Kalanithi Maran’s exit, the market is eager to know Ajay Singh’s turnaround plan for the troubled airline company. Also, it will be interesting to see if Singh can avoid an open offer.

The general exemption available under takeover code includes certain schemes of arrangement, subject to conditions. SpiceJet has called its scheme as “scheme of reconstruction”.

Oil marketing companies

HPCL, BPCL and IOC are likely to react to price cut of petrol and diesel. OMCs have slashed diesel and petrol prices by Rs 2.25 and Rs 2.42 per litre respectively. Meanwhile, excise duty on the products was hiked by Rs 2 per litre. This is the ninth straight reduction in petrol prices since August, and fifth in diesel since October.

RK Singh, Former CMD, BPCL, said there could still be some over-recovery by OMCs but one should not forget that oil companies need to have their own fiscal conditions sound so that they can invest, and service large projects in the future.

HUL

The FMCG major is expected to announce its December quarter results on Monday. It is likely to report net profit at Rs 1,091 crore, up 2.7 percent year-on-year. During the period, its total income is estimated to grow 10.2 percent at Rs 7963 crore. Analysts expect 5-6 percent volume growth Y-o-Y in Q3 on a base of 4 percent YoY led by promotions carried in soaps and detergents segment.

Kotak Mahindra Bank

It is expected to report third quarter standalone profit at Rs 439.56 crore, up 29.3 percent compared to Rs 340 crore in the year-ago period. The private sector lender will announce its earnings on January 20. Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, may jump 18.7 percent to Rs 1,083.1 crore during October-December quarter from Rs 912.7 crore in same quarter last fiscal.Other results

Other major companies that are expected to announce third quarter earnings this week are ITC, Biocon, Ultratech Cement, ING Vysaya and Cairn India.

Brokerage house CLSA has retained its sell call on FMCG major Hindustan Unilever with a price target of Rs 650.

Competitive pressures leading to price cuts and higher ad spends, slower revenue growth, flat net profit margins and expensive valuations have been cited as the reasons for the bearish view.

HUL shares have been rallying as a steep fall in crude prices is seen benefiting the company’s profit margins by way of lower raw material costs.

CLSA said HUL would certainly benefit from low crude prices, but the market was over-optimistic in extrapolating huge margin gains.

“While lower oil would drive up gross margins, quantum of product price hikes would go down (certain categories would see even cuts) which would impact revenue growth. Over the past decade, price hikes contributed almost half to HUL’s growth and despite a likely pick up in volume growth, there is a concern on overall growth,” said the CLSA note to clients.

According to CLSA, competition increases during periods of deflation.

“HUL suffered market share erosion in 2009 post sharp input price correction. Paul Polman (Global CEO, Unilever) for example indicated that around 500 detergent players emerged in 2009,” said the CLSA note.

At 42 times FY16 consensus earnings estimate, the stock is not factoring an increase in competitive activity and higher costs which would moderate overall earnings growth, says HUL.",238,-0.598164963722229

ICICIdirect.com's report on Hindustan Unilever (HUL)

""Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has entered into an agreement with HDFC Ltd for the sale of its previous headquarters “Lever House” in Churchgate, South Mumbai. According to media sources, the deal has been inked at ~Rs 300 crore. The property (~1.53 lakh square feet) had previously been leased out to the buyer (HDFC) for a three year period from 2012. HUL has had a slew of property sales in the past few years selling property worth ~Rs 1000 crore since 2012. Considering that the current deal has been done at ~Rs 300 crore, we believe the proceeds would add to the company’s earnings per share by ~Rs 1 in FY15E, increasing it to Rs 20.3. With no major changes in business revenues and earnings for FY16E and FY17E, we maintain our future estimates and a HOLD rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 755.""

""We expect near terms concerns over demand revival to remain an overhang on the stock. However, with a revival in urban demand and strong brands in growing aspirational segments, we believe HUL is strongly placed to capture the booming consumer demand in the next three to five years. We value the stock at 32x FY17E EPS of Rs 23.9 and arrive at a target price of Rs 755/share"", says ICICIdirect.com research report.

10:55am Interview

The boards of state-owned banks need to have more of professionals with domain expertise, feels Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairperson of State Bank of India.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, she said boards of PSU banks had a surfeit of chartered accounts. In addition to them, there also needed to be people with hands on experience in areas like HR, risk management and IT.

Bhattacharya said there was a need to professionalise the entire process of choosing the top management at state-owned banks.

She said the Debt Recovery Tribunal needed to speed up the process of resolving asset issues, and if they were being limited by traditional challenges, those had to be addressed through appropriate laws.

She said unless India had proper bankruptcy laws, it was difficult to have a speedy resolution in a manner fair to all stakeholders.

On willful defaulters, she said the laws had to be stricter than merely making it difficult for errant borrowers to get fresh loans. She said there has to be “an element of fear” as well to enforce discipline.

She said consolidation in the PSU banking space was imminent, but it was a question of timing.

She sees deposit rates coming down further with inflation cooling, and by extension lending rates as well.

“Investment in distribution has increased gap over competition HUL has been focusing on capability building in distribution over the last 3-5 years, which increases its scope to outperform the competition in the medium term. It also positions HUL as the biggest beneficiary of any potential improvement in consumption in 2HCY2015,” Deutsche says in a report.

At 09:31 hrs Hindustan Unilever was quoting at Rs 762.50, up Rs 1.75, or 0.23 percent on the BSE.
