Emkay Global Financial's research report on AXIS Bank

Axis Bank hosted its analyst meet on 23-Nov, to give an update on its GPS (growth, profitability, stability) strategy and the way forward. Bank guides for some systemic growth moderation post the recent RBI action on unsecured/NBFC loans, albeit for own continued outperformance led by its retail+SME growth engine. Bank’s margin is higher by 30bps at 4.1% vs its base guidance of 3.8%; it targets retaining some structural gains due to organic PSL build-up via Bharat Banking and a better portfolio mix, despite rising CoF. Asset quality is holding up well, with NNPA at 0.4% and no immediate sign of stress; but Bank guides for some LLP normalization and plans to uphold contingent provisions for now. However, it guides for an elevated opex, given retail/digital infra build-up causing a drag on RoA@1.8% (>1.9-2% for peers). We believe Bank needs to shore-up its CET 1 (2Q @14.6% vs large peers @>15%), more so post the impact (~50bps) from the recent RBI action; but it guided that it has no such plans, due to its effective capital management/higher RoE (17-18%; partly due to higher leverage).



Outlook

Valuations remain low at 1.6x FY25E ABV vs large peers’ at >2x; thus, we retain BUY with TP of Rs 1,300 (on 2x Sep-25E ABV; subs value of Rs83/sh).

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

We attended AXSB analyst day wherein the management demonstrated its ongoing investments in building robust digital capabilities to support sustainable business growth. The key focus revolves around delivering comprehensive digital journeys and enhancing customer experiences. Through diverse digital capabilities and strategic partnerships within the ecosystem, AXSB is experiencing significant growth and establishing itself as a robust customer acquisition engine. AXSB has been reporting strong growth in the Retail and Mid-corporate segment, which along with MSME would remain the key growth driver. The bank suggested for continued investment in the business, given a favorable environment, and thus, enabling 4-6% higher growth than the system over the medium term.

Outlook

We estimate AXSB to deliver FY25E RoA/RoE of 1.9%/16.6%. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR 1,150.

Axis Bank shares gained around 0.6 percent on November 24 as brokerages retained their bullish stance on the private lender following an analyst meet.

On November 23, Axis Bank held an analyst meeting to offer an update on its GPS (growth, profitability, stability) strategy and the way forward. The bank told investors and analysts that initiatives to improve deposits are paying off with a ramp-up of ‘wealth’ clients, corporate salary accounts and rise in share of lendable/ retail deposits, according to Jefferies.

As of 10.35am, shares of Axis Bank were trading at Rs 1,003.25.

Among investor concerns over the years has been Axis Bank’s slow deposit growth, to which the management explained the growth looks lower because the bank focussed on improving the quality of deposits. The outflow rate of deposits has reduced by 550 bps to around 23 percent, which is at par with peers. As a result, there has been a 25 bps uptick in NIM through the cycle. The bank also aims to grow its deposits through various initiatives.

The Citi acquisition has enabled the bank to become a “premium customer” franchise in cards and wealth, Jefferies said. One third of the richest Indians are the bank’s wealth customers, making it among the top three players in wealth.

The bank’s management is confident of maintaining an 18 percent RoE, and reiterated that the lender does not need to raise fresh equity even after the RBI’s new norms. Axis Bank has delivered 18 percent RoE over the past five quarters. HSBC said that the 18 percent RoE will allow the private lender to accrue capital internally.

“Axis Bank has attained a self-sustaining capital structure. While credit cost will move up from current lows, there will be other offsets in terms of contribution from new investments, which shall keep RoE intact,” Nuvama Institutional Equities said.

The bank is bullish on its digital offerings, noted CLSA, as the lender has continually invested in tech and analytics. About 23 percent of personal loans are disbursed digitally. Digital sourcing within the personal loan segment yields an additional 150 bps due to the absence of negotiation opportunities in physical mode, coupled with a 50 bps increase in fees, said Motilal Oswal.

Most depositors have multiple bank accounts, and it has always been difficult for customers to visit different bank branches or navigate through different banking apps to track the balances and spends from these accounts.

To simplify managing finances for customers, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have launched single-view dashboards, which display account information across bank accounts, on their mobile apps and internet banking platforms. Axis Bank's single-view dashboard is named one-view, while that of ICICI Bank is called iFinance.

So, how does one bank get access to information about other bank accounts maintained by the account holder? This is possible thanks to the account aggregator ecosystem.

“This feature offers a seamless banking experience and provides convenience to customers by eliminating the need for multiple mobile banking applications,” said Sameer Shetty, President & Head – Digital Business & Transformation, Axis Bank.

This will ensure an easy, quick snapshot of all their bank transactions at the click of a button.

Sidharatha Mishra, Head - Digital Channels, ICICI Bank, said, “With iFinance, we are enabling our customers as well as customers of other banks to view their account data in one place and provide them with better control over their finances.”

How it works

Existing customers of ICICI Bank have access to iFinance through its Internet banking portal and mobile applications. To initiate the process, log in to your ICICI Bank net banking or mobile application. Choose iFinance and do a mobile OTP verification. The OTP is sent by Setu, a Reserve Bank of India-regulated account aggregator.

Then choose the bank accounts you want to link. Verify the accounts via OTP and track your bank accounts using the iFinance feature.

To link your accounts on Axis Bank’s mobile application with the one-view feature, the process remains the same. Here, the OTP for mobile verification is sent by Finvu, another RBI-regulated account aggregator.

The banks’ customers do not have to pay a fee to use the account aggregator-enabled features.

Insights into your saving, spending patterns

The customers get a comprehensive view of transactions across all the bank accounts (savings and current) in one place.

Mishra said, “It offers a comprehensive view of your bank statements, including bank balances, top spending and income categories, expense breakdowns, daily inflows, expenses, and balance analysis.”

It allows customers to download and email transaction details from their linked accounts.

How accurate is the data displayed?

The accuracy of the data displayed depends on the accuracy of the information shared by other banks. The banks rely on the data provided by the financial information providers (FIPs) and do not alter or modify it in any way.

“It is essential to regularly review your transactions and balances to ensure accuracy,” said Mishra.

Can I rely on this feature to make financial decisions?

No. This feature from the banks is intended to provide you with a consolidated view of your bank accounts. The banks will not provide investment or financial advice on the basis of the information. You can use the information to cut down on spending and invest your savings better. Any financial decisions you make should be based on analysis and consultation with financial experts.

Can I delink my accounts from other banks at any time?

Yes, you have the flexibility to delink your accounts from other banks at your convenience. For this, simply go to iFinance on the ICICI Bank net banking or mobile app and revoke the consent using the link provided. This will remove the data of that bank account from iFinance.

If you want to re-link the delinked accounts at any time, you will have to follow the same process as you did while linking the accounts initially.

Is the linked bank account safe?

“Yes, linked bank account data is safe. We prioritise the security and privacy of your financial data. We adhere to industry-leading security standards to protect your information,” claims Mishra.

Account aggregators provide a secure way of sharing information that has customer consent and data privacy as its core design principles. It is data-blind and cannot see the actual data.

The central bank has raised credit risk weights on unsecured consumer loans by increasing the capital requirements for such loans as concerns have been growing over these borrowings.

Axis Bank on November 17, said that the bank has already taken corrective measures, as necessary, to align the procedures in line with the stipulations of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

""The Bank has already initiated/taken corrective measures, as necessary, to align the operations/procedures in line with the stipulations of the RBI, ""Axis Bank said in its statement.

The statement of the bank came a day after RBI's letter stated that the bank has been imposed a monetary penalty amounting to Rs. 90.92 lakhs for non-compliance with certain directions issued by RBI on ‘Reserve Bank of India (Know Your Customer (KYC)) Directions, 2016’, ‘Loans and Advances – Statutory and Other Restrictions’, ‘Guidelines on Managing Risks and Code of Conduct in Outsourcing of Financial Services by banks’ and ‘Code of Conduct for Opening and Operating Current Accounts’. The press release issued by RBI is attached herewith.

""This penalty has been imposed in the exercise of powers vested in RBI conferred under the provisions of Section 47 A (1) (c) read with Section 46 (4) (i) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, ""said RBI's statement on November 16.

Axis Bank shares fell over 2 percent on November 17, a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) tightened norms for personal loans and credit cards to check the unbridled growth in this segment. The central bank has raised credit risk weights on unsecured consumer loans by increasing the capital requirements for such loans as concerns have been growing over these borrowings.

At 10:00 am, Axis Bank shares were trading 2.47 percent lower at Rs 1,000.90 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). So far in 2023, the stock has rallied 6 percent, underperforming benchmark Nifty 50 which has risen around 8.5 percent during this period.

According to analysts, higher unsecured credit risk would adversely impact the capital adequacy ratios (CARs), which provides a quick idea of whether a bank has enough funds to cover losses and remain solvent under difficult financial circumstances. CLSA and Citi denoted up to a whopping 230 basis points (bps) impact in the CAR (capital adequacy ratio) of lenders.

According to foreign brokerage Citi, Unsecured credit risk weight rise adversely impacts Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) by 36 bps for Axis Bank. Note that CET1 is the highest quality of regulatory capital, as it absorbs losses immediately when they occur. The tier I capital consists mainly of share capital and disclosed reserves.

The fall in Axis Bank share price also comes after RBI took stringent action against the bank, imposing a monetary penalty of nearly Rs 91 lakh. The penalty is a consequence of Axis Bank's non-compliance with specific directives outlined by the RBI.

This regulatory action stems from the findings of the statutory inspection for supervisory evaluation, conducted by the RBI with reference to Axis Bank's financial position as of March 31, 2022.

The inspection revealed several deficiencies in regulatory compliance, including the bank's failure to preserve records related to customer identification and addresses in specific cases.

Amidst warning by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on banks’ aggressive growth in unsecured lending, Axis Bank is closely monitoring its unsecured retail loan portfolio, said Amitabh Chaudhry, managing director and chief executive officer (MD and CEO).

“We are not taking additional risks in unsecured lending but others are taking risks and hence we are keeping a close eye on our portfolio. We have not seen any major concerns,” Chaudhry said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

Chaudhry also said their partnerships with fintech companies and the unsecured business with them has not seen any risks.

“We have partnerships with fintechs and we have seen any risks.”

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB delivered good numbers as core PPoP beat PLe by 8.2% led by better NII and fees; opex was a drag. As net slippages were controlled, provisions were lower leading to better profitability. NIM positively surprised yet again at 4.19% (beat by 24bps) driven by (1) strong QoQ growth in higher margin segments of PL, SME and SBB (2) intentional slowdown in housing and (3) lower deposit growth of 1.6% QoQ resulting in higher LDR. Bank expects NIM to remain at healthy levels due to change in product mix towards retail/SME. RTD growing by 4.4% QoQ was another positive. Balance sheet construct is being calibrated towards higher margin segments and granular deposits.

Outlook

However, deposit growth needs to catch-up for sustained loan growth of 17%+. CITI integration and business investments would keep opex elevated. With likely RoA of 1.7% for FY25/26E, we maintain multiple at 2.2x but raise TP to Rs1,250 from Rs1,170 as we roll forward to Sep’25E ABV. Retain ‘BUY’.

Axis Bank is well capitalised with a self-sustaining capital structure for funding organic growth, its managing director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry has said. He said the bank expects to grow higher than the industry average on the credit side. It would be 400-600 basis points higher than the industry in the MSME segment this fiscal.

To fund business growth, he said, the bank has adequate capital to take care of its needs during the current financial year. ""Our overall capital adequacy ratio, including profit, stood at 17.84 per cent with a CET 1 ratio of 14.56 per cent. The Bank accreted 18 bps of CET-1 capital in Q2 FY24 and 54 bps in H1 FY24.

In March this year, Axis Bank completed the acquisition of Citibank's consumer business and non-banking financial company (NBFC) consumer business. The bank paid Rs 11,603 crore for the acquisition. The sale excludes Citi's institutional client businesses in India.

Axis Bank is the fourth-largest issuer of credit cards with a total base of 8.6 million cards, and the deal added about 2.5 million credit cardholders, making it one of the top three card businesses in the country. On the interest rate, Chaudhry said high rates are going to stay for some time as many have indicated.

Last week, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said interest rates will remain high, and any change will depend on the way the world evolves. ""Interest rates will remain high. How long will they remain high, I think only time and the way the world is evolving will tell,"" Das had said.

In the wake of the ongoing geopolitical crisis, major central banks across the world have raised their key policy rates to deal with high inflation.

The bank has created a distinctive 'Bharat Bank' unit with tailored rural products, an increased footprint through branches and a digital presence, partnerships with facilitators like Common Services Centers (CSCs), and village-level entrepreneurs enabled by multiple agri-commodity-focused ecosystems, he said.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB’s PAT grew 10% YoY to INR58.7b (in line) in 2QFY24, driven by healthy NII growth (19% YoY/3% QoQ) and contained provisions, despite high opex. NIMs improved 1bp QoQ to 4.11% (vs. a decline for many peer banks), aided by higher liquidity deployment (~500bp QoQ decline in LCR ratio) and a better asset mix. Loan growth was healthy at 23% YoY/4.5% QoQ, while deposit growth was muted (+1% in 1HFY24). The C/D ratio thus increased to ~94%. A decline in fresh slippages (to INR32.5b) and healthy recoveries led to a sharp decline in GNPA ratio. Restructured book was under control at 0.19%. We change our earnings estimates by -1.7%/2.1% for FY24/FY25 and expect FY25 RoA/RoE of 1.9%/16.6%. Retain BUY.

Outlook

We change our earnings estimates by - 1.7%/2.1% for FY24/FY25 and expect FY25 RoA/RoE of 1.9%/16.6%. We retain our BUY rating with a TP of INR1,150 (1.7x FY25E ABV).

Emkay Global Financial's research report on AXIS Bank

Even with stable margins vs contraction seen across peers, Axis Bank reported a 4% miss on PAT, at Rs58.6bn/1.8% RoA, mainly due to higher opex. Bank claims the higher opex included a one-off cost towards re-valuation of card rewards and IT/infra expenses that led to cost-to-assets (C/A) of 2.4%. That said, Bank aspires for 2% C/A in the medium term which looks challenging, given the retail portfolio & infra build-up. Though credit growth has been healthy at 18% YoY/5% QoQ (adjusted for the Citi portfolio acquisition) in 2Q, deposit growth has been slow, at 18% YoY/1% QoQ, which the bank claims is been due to balance-sheet management, reflecting in stable margins. But given the higher LDR @93% and moderate LCR at 118%, Bank needs to accelerate deposit growth in 2H which should thus weigh on NIMs. We fine-tune FY24-26E earnings, factoring-in the frontloading of opex, but expect the bank to log healthy RoA of ~1.8% in FY24-26E, albeit lower than peers (≥2%).

Outlook

Given the <15% CET 1 vs peers, Bank will need to shore-up its capital buffer at some point, if not sooner. We retain BUY, with new TP of Rs1,300/sh (earlier Rs1,260), rolling forward on 2xSep-25E ABV & subs value of Rs83/sh.

Sharekhan's research report on Axis Bank

Healthy credit growth (+4.5% q-o-q), stable NIM (+ 1 bps q-o-q), higher core fee along with lower credit cost helped the bank to sustain RoA at ~1.8% on a standalone basis in Q2FY2024 despite higher cost pressures (up +6% q-o-q including one-off). Core credit cost was at 46 bps vs. 54 bps q-o-q annualised. NIMs surprised positively as the increase in the cost of funds (+14 bps q-o-q) was fully offset by higher yield on advances. However, overall deposit growth (+1% q-o-q) lagged credit growth (+4.5% q-o-q) despite strong traction in retail term deposits (+4% q-o-q), driven by a lower share of retail term deposits (~35%) and weak CASA growth. Headline asset-quality trends saw a sharp improvement q-o-q on the back of lower slippages at 1.8% vs. 2.3% q-o-q (annualised calculated based on 12M trailing loans). Slippages were lowest in the last 12 quarters.



Outlook

We believe marginal pressure on NIMs along with elevated cost ratios would be offset by strong asset quality and, in turn, lower credit cost in FY2024E. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,140. The stock currently trades at 1.9x/1.6x its FY2024E/FY2025E core BV estimates.

ICICI Securities research report on Axis Bank

Despite higher non-staff opex, Axis Bank (Axis) reported better-than-expected Q2FY24 PAT of INR 58.6bn (6% beat) led by stable NIM QoQ and strong loan growth (up 4.5% QoQ). Unlike its peers, which saw 25–35bps QoQ decline, stable NIM at Axis was a key surprise (NII beat of 4%). However, we highlight that there is a sharp differential in deposits growth FYTD at Axis (~1%) versus peers (9–10%). We note that the bank has levers on opex going ahead; that said, envisaged growth and competition could keep opex elevated, in our view. Overall, we see the bank reporting stable RoE of ~17% for FY23-26.



Outlook

Maintain BUY with an unchanged target price of INR 1,150, valuing the stock at ~2x FY25E core banking book and INR 80 for subs value. Key risks are elevated cost ratio impacting RoAs.

The Nifty50 touched 200-day EMA (exponential moving average 18,830) intraday on October 26, for the first time since April, which is expected to be crucial area to watch out. If the index decisively breaks the same 18,600-18,500 can be possible targets on the downside, but in case of rebound given the index at oversold levels in terms of momentum indicator (RSI), the 19,000 is an immediate resistance, experts said.

The Nifty50 tanked 265 points or 1.4 percent to 18,857 and formed Three Black Crows candlestick pattern on the daily charts, which is bearish pattern. The BSE Sensex was down more than 900 points at 63,148, while the Nifty Midcap 100 index fell over 1 percent and Smallcap 100 index slipped third of a percent.

Stocks that performed much better than broader markets included Axis Bank, Swan Energy, and KNR Constructions. Axis Bank gained 1.7 percent at Rs 972 and formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with healthy volumes after Inverted Hammer kind of candlestick pattern in previous session, which is generally a trend reversal pattern formed at the downtrend.

Swan Energy rallied 6 percent to Rs 329 and formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily scale with above average volumes. The 20-day EMA has been acting as a good support for the stock for several sessions now and in previous session, it has seen High Wave kind of pattern formation with robust volumes.

KNR Constructions has tested 200-day EMA (Rs 258) during the current week but the same acted as a good support for the stock. The stock lost 0.7 percent amid high volatility, but formed bullsh candlestick pattern with long upper shadow and small lower shadow on the daily timeframe, with above average volumes, after Doji kind of candlestick pattern in previous session.

Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Swan Energy

The counter is into a rising channel from last few sessions. Additionally, on the weekly charts the stock has given a breakout from Cup and Handle chart formation. Therefore, up move from the resistance zone for the bullish continuation rally is very likely to continue in the coming trading sessions.

For the traders, Rs 315 would be the key support level to watch out. Above which the uptrend structure should continue until Rs 355.

KNR Constructions

The stock witnessed short-term correction from the higher levels. On daily charts, the counter has reversed its trend from its important support zone. The formation suggests a revival of the uptrend from the current levels.

As long as the stock is trading above Rs 255, the bullish formation is likely to continue. Above which, the counter could move up to Rs 285.

Axis Bank

The counter was into a sloping channel from the past many sessions. Eventually, its downward move stopped near the important demand zone. Moreover, the strong rebound in the counter from its demand zone on daily scale suggests that the bullish momentum to remain in the near future.

Unless it is trading below Rs 939, positional traders retain an optimistic stance and look for a target of Rs 1,040.

Axis Bank surprises with strong margin in Q2 FY24, tailwinds to continue

Global brokerage firm CLSA shared a ‘buy’ rating for Axis Bank with a target price of Rs 1,200 per share, adding that the Q2 margin performance fared better than peers. “One of the key positive was Axis Bank’s stable net interest margin (NIM) performance, as peer lenders like ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank saw margin contraction in Q2,” they said.

Axis Bank’s NIM expanded by 15 basis points (bps) on-year to 4.1 percent in Q2FY24 amid lower cost of funds. Sequentially, it was flat.

Moreover, the management guided for limited increase in funding costs over coming quarters, which could further support margins going ahead.

Asset quality, loan growth help Axis Bank Q2 profit growth

Jefferies analysts' said that Axis Bank's firm asset quality and steady loan growth helped to book a healthy profit in Q2. However, growth in operating expenses due to investments in new technology, employee increments, and expenses related to Citi integration weighed on profit, they added.

Axis Bank’s net profit rose 10 percent on-year to Rs 5,864 crore in Q2FY24 aided by 19 percent on-year rise in net interest income (NII) and controlled provisions.

Jefferies further said that the bank’s return on equity (RoE) of 18 percent during the quarter bodes well for the future as well. Valuation-wise, analysts said adjusted price-to-book (PB) at 1.5 times (x) FY25 is attractive.

Axis Bank asset quality robust, but analysts concerned about deposits growth

Meanwhile, analysts at Motilal Oswal leaned support towards Axis Bank’s healthy asset quality picture. “Asset quality of Axis Bank remains robust with slippages declining further and recoveries remaining strong,” the brokerage firm said, sharing a ‘buy’ rating on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,150 per share.

The lender’s non-performing assets (NPA) declined by 77 bps on-year to 1.7 percent in Q2, while net NPA slipped 15 bps YoY to 0.36 percent.

However, analysts remained watchful of deposit accretion of the bank as it will be critical to sustain healthy loan growth (highest in over 7 years). Axis Bank’s loan book grew 23 percent on-year in Q2, whereas deposit growth was up 18 percent on-year. As a result, CASA ratio stood at 44 percent in the September-ended quarter.

“We change our earnings estimates by -1.7/2.1 percent for FY24/FY25 and expect FY25 RoA/RoE of 1.9/16.6 percent for Axis Bank,” added analysts at Motilal Oswal.

The Nifty Bank index shed nearly 1 percent on October 13, led by losses in Axis Bank and SBI after the lenders were downgraded by UBS.

While Axis Bank fell more than 2 percent, SBI shares were down 1.5 percent intraday on the NSE after the international brokerage house lowered their ratings on concerns of a rise in credit losses. ""Indian banking sector's risk-reward is turning equal,"" UBS said.

""We raise our credit cost forecasts for the India banks we cover by 5-10bps in FY25,"" UBS said in its report, adding that SBI and Axis Bank's Return on Assets (RoAs) are more sensitive to credit cost changes than large peers. The brokerage estimates FY25 EPS for SBI and Axis Bank at 22 percent and 10 percent below consensus.

SBI downgraded on narrow margins, rising credit costs

From the 'buy' rating, UBS has downgraded SBI to 'sell', and cut the target price to Rs 530 from Rs 740 as it raised credit costs by 10bps and cut the EPS by 5 percent. The downgrade is attributed to anticipated declines in RoA and Return on Equity (RoE) by FY25. The bank's narrowing margins and increasing credit costs are seen driving these potential declines.

Follow out market blog to catch all the live action

Considering relatively low CET1 versus peers, potential regulatory tightening on unsecured loans would limit loan growth or trigger dilution for SBI. The stock at one-time FY25 price to book value does not appear expensive but a likely decline in profitability may result in downside, analysts at UBS noted. The brokerage warns that SBI could face escalating credit costs, and its ability to manage these costs while maintaining profitability will be crucial in the coming years.

Limited upside seen in Axis Bank

The Axis Bank stock has been downgraded to 'neutral' and its price target has been lowered to Rs 1,100 from Rs 1,150. The private lender's margins are peaking and credit costs are near bottom. Its RoA is set to to contract in FY25, said UBS. In the next three quarter, single-digit growth is expected in net interest income (NII). The brokerage sees limited upside potential in the stock.

In the last one year, the Axis Bank stock has risen around 24 percent, outperforming the Nifty Bank index which has risen 14 percent during this period. Public sector lender SBI has underperformed Nifty Bank in the past year, rising around 10 percent.

The Nifty Bank index is trading at 1.9x one-year forward P/BV, below its 2.2x 10-year average. While valuation seems inexpensive to UBS analysts, they see limited scope of a re-rating, considering expectations of slowing earnings growth, owing to potential NIM compression and an uptick in credit cost. It also sees increasing default risks in retail unsecured loans, which is likely to push up banks' credit losses by 50-200bps. The risk of regulatory tightening is high, it said.

Broad-based selling, weak global cues, monthly expiry and inflation fears fanned by rising oil prices dragged the Indian market almost a percent lower on September 28.

At close, the equity benchmark Nifty was down 193 points, or 0.98 percent, at 19,523.50, with all sectoral indices in the red as volatility spiked on the monthly F&O expiry day.

Rising crude stokes inflation fears

""The selling was broad-based, as investors are on alert given the rise of oil prices. If crude continues to stay above the 90 USD level, it will be a threat to inflation and boil the operational margins” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.

Globally, the US GDP data and the Federal Reserve chief’s speech would be closely tracked for clues to future trend. Currently, the combination of higher interest rates and US bond yields is influencing FIIs to stay in the sell mode, he said.

US oil futures jumped to their highest in more than a year as a drop in crude stocks added to worries over tight global supplies. Global benchmark Brent crude futures were up 36 cents at $96.91 after rising to the highest since November earlier in the session.

Sectoral indices flash red

All NSE sectoral indices ended in the red.

The Nifty IT index was down 2.19 percent, Nifty FMCG 1.91 percent and the auto index closed 1.17 percent lower. The Nifty media index was down 1.5 percent, while PSU bank and consumer durables lost more than a percent each.

Nifty private bank, financial services, healthcare, realty, metal, oil & gas and Nifty pharma were down more than half a percent each.

These stocks bucked the trend

Of the 50 Nifty constituents, 42 ended in the red but eight defied the losing momentum.

L&T was the biggest gainer, up more than 2 percent at Rs 3,025. Bharti Airtel jumped 1.17 percent, while ONGC, Coal India and Power Grid gained around half a percent each. Axis Bank, NTPC and SBI, too, managed to close in the green.

""Both price and momentum indicators suggest that there is a further downside possible for Nifty over the next few trading sessions,” said Jatin Gedia–Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

In terms of levels, 19,500–19440 is the crucial support zone, while 19,625 – 19,650 will act as an immediate hurdle, he said. “We expect the Bank Nifty to drift towards 43,800. On the upside 44,700–44,800 shall act as an immediate hurdle zone,” Gedia added.

The Nifty broke the three-day winning streak on September 18 on the back of weak global cues. At close, the index was down 59 points at 20,133. Global equities fell on Monday as growth concerns tested investors' nerves ahead of a week packed with central bank meetings in five countries. Traders took some cash off the table ahead of the policy decisions that will reveal how major central banks view progress in the fight against inflation.

For the Nifty, primary and intermediate trend remains positive as it has been holding above the 50, 100 and 200-day EMA (exponential moving average). On the weekly chart, the 14-week RSI (relative strength index) is at 71.64, which again suggests it is not extremely overbought and there is scope for more upsides in intermediate term.

On the derivatives side, we have seen aggressive Put writing at 19,800-20,000 levels, which coincides with the 11 and 20-day moving averages placed at 19,918 and 19,771. Therefore, on the downside, 19,770-20,000 could now be considered as an immediate support for the Nifty.

While we do not rule out the possibility of a running correction in the next few days, we believe that the Nifty could move towards intermediate upside targets of 20,600. This target is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci extension of the recent up-move from the lows of March 2023 to the highs of July 2023. Therefore, traders are advised to accumulate longs on decline with a stop-loss at 19,770 on the Nifty on a closing basis.

Broad market indices like Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices have underperformed the Nifty during the last week. We believe that they may continue to underperform for the coming few weeks before they resume their uptrend. In terms of strategy, we recommend having a bias towards Largecaps.

Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:

AMI Organics: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,302 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,220 | Targets: Rs 1,393-1,460 | Return: 12 percent

The stock price has broken out on the monthly chart by surpassing the multiple top resistance of Rs 1,270 odd levels. Momentum Oscillators like - RSI (11) and MFI (money flow index 10) are sloping upwards and placed above 50 on the weekly chart, indicating strength in the current uptrend of the stock.

Bulls successfully regained control from bears, pushing Nifty back above the 20,000 mark. On September 13, it closed above this threshold, marking a historic closing high for Nifty. The prevailing sentiment remains optimistic, contingent on Put writers safeguarding the 19,900 levels. A drop below 19,900 could unsettle Put writers, potentially triggering market corrections.

On the upside, the 20,100-20,150 range is poised to act as resistance. A clear breakthrough above 20,150 might propel Nifty into a sustained upward trend.

The bulls took charge and dominated the market, resulting in the formation of a Bullish Engulfing candlestick pattern on the Bank Nifty index. This pattern signifies a potential reversal of the previous bearish sentiment.

The lower-end support for the index is now established in the range of 45,700-45,600, serving as a strong cushion for the bulls and providing a crucial level of defense against any downward pressure.

Looking ahead, the immediate hurdle on the upside is situated at the 46,000 mark. A successful breach above this level would likely pave the way for further upward momentum, with potential targets at 46,300 and 46,600 levels.

Here are three buy calls for the short term:

NOCIL: Buy | LTP: Rs 249 | Stop-Loss: Rs 235 | Targets: Rs 265-270 | Return: 8 percent

NOCIL has shown significant strength in recent trading sessions. The stock had previously staged a robust breakout from a falling trendline, accompanied by a surge in trading volumes. This breakout signals a reversal of the downtrend.

The momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) is currently trading above the 60 level, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the stock.

For potential investors, the lower-end support for NOCIL is at Rs 235, which is expected to act as a strong foundation, providing support to any potential price declines. Looking to the upside, the stock has the potential to reach targets at Rs 265 and Rs 270.

Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 103.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 90 | Targets: Rs 125-140 | Return: 35 percent

The stock has made a significant breakout on the weekly chart, surpassing the critical resistance level at Rs 102, and this move has been accompanied by robust trading volumes. The stock exhibits a highly bullish sentiment, supported by a pattern of forming higher lows and higher highs on the lower timeframes, signalling a sustained uptrend.

The momentum indicator RSI has surged past the 70 level, indicating robust buying momentum in the stock. In case of a pullback, there is substantial support around the Rs 90 mark, acting as a buffer against potential price declines.

Bank of India presents an enticing prospect for investors, with potential upside targets set at Rs 125 and Rs 140.

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,014.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 990 | Targets: Rs 1,040-1,054 | Return: 4 percent

A collaborative model between banks and fintech companies is a must for overall growth of the financial sector, said Amitabh Chaudhry, chief executive officer and managing director, Axis Bank.

""Fintechs do not have the business reach like banks and banks do not have the tech facility like fintechs. Hence, collaboration is the model both institutions need to work on,"" Chaudhry said at the Global Fintech Festival in Mumbai on September 6.

Additionally, collaboration is coming in rapidly as both institutions understand the new developments in the industry, Chaudhry said.

From the regulations perspective, Chaudhry highlighted that the Reserve Bank India (RBI), has been at the forefront of innovation.

""Fintech model is expected to evolve and regulations from the regulator will be a facilitator and not a hurdle maker,"" Chaudhry said.

Chaudhry also highlighted that the business model of both and fintech companies is evolving with the trends in the sector.

Domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal has reiterated its ‘buy’ call for Axis Bank, saying the private sector lender’s strong retail franchise, business productivity and asset quality make it an attractive choice.

It has a target price of Rs 1,175 for the stock, which represents a potential upside of over 19 percent from its current level of Rs 982.

“Axis Bank has reported steady traction in retail business with the mix increasing to 58 percent in 1Q FY24 from 50 percent in FY19. This occurred even as the bank consciously lowered the share of mortgage in its retail mix to 43 percent from 47 percent in FY22,”Motilal Oswal said in a report.

The proportion of higher-yielding retail loans – comprising mainly personal loans, rural loans, credit cards, and small business banking (SBB) – has increased to 28 percent.

“The rural and semi-urban market remains a key focus area, which we believe should enable sustainable loan growth over the medium term,” it added.

Business per branch of Axis Bank has improved to Rs 3.7 billion in FY23 from Rs 3.2 billion in FY22, while business per employee has also improved to Rs 195 million in FY23 from Rs 178 million in FY22.

Catch all the market action in our live blog

The management has guided to add up to 500 branches in FY24, as it expects branches to play an important role in deposit mobilization from new customers.

Retail and transaction banking fees now form ~93 percent of total fees, signifying the granularity of fee income. This was primarily driven by card fees (up 51 percent YoY) and other retail assets related fees (up 23 percent YoY), which together constituted around 68 percent of total fees.

Axis Bank has also completed the acquisition of Citibank India’s consumer business, including its credit cards, deposits, wealth management, loans, and other retail banking operations. It has also acquired the NBFC business of Citicorp Finance (India).

Motilal Oswal further said the lender’s asset quality has improved significantly over the past few years, with slippages moderating to 1.9 percent in FY23 versus 8.2 percent in FY18, which led to a decline in the GNPA ratio to 2.2 percent in FY23 from 5.1 percent in FY20.

“Axis Bank remains focused on building a stronger, consistent, and sustainable franchise. With asset quality issues behind, slippages and credit costs are likely to stay under control,” it added.

Shares of Axis Bank are up 4 percent on YTD basis, though the 1-year return stands at 30 percent.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank’s (AXSB) annual report highlights the bank’s focus on strengthening its retail franchise and investing in its distribution network and technological capabilities. The bank has laid special emphasis on increasing the mix of retail deposits. In FY23, it reported 21% growth in CASA deposits, surpassing its peers. This facilitated a 100bp improvement in the daily average CASA mix, reaching 44%. The bank continues to invest in digital initiatives to ensure sustainable long-term growth. In FY23, the bank sourced 55% of personal loans digitally vs. 22% in FY18. About 24% of credit cards were also issued through a fully digital end-to-end process. Also, the bank’s market share in credit card has improved to 14.7%, strengthening its position as the fourth largest credit card issuer in the country. The concentration of top 20 advances/deposits improved 105bp/110bp YoY to 8.1%/9.0% in FY23 (11.8% in FY21). The bank has shifted its deposit strategy to ‘CASA + retail term deposits’ and has consciously pruned bulk deposits. AXSB has a strong management team and a well-articulated strategy aimed at delivering 18% sustainable RoE. Asset quality has improved significantly and we estimate RoA to recover further aided by steady loan growth and moderation in opex ratios.



Outlook

We thus estimate RoA/RoE to be ~1.8%/~15.9% by FY25 and we reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR1,175 (1.8x FY25E ABV + INR100 for subs).

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to examine Axis Bank-Max Life Insurance deal, CNBC-TV18 reported on August 31. Max Life Insurance is a subsidiary of Max Financial Services.

The insurance regulator has asked SEBI to investigate if there were violations in determining the fair market value of Max Life Insurance shares.

According to CNBC-TV18, so far, only IRDAI was investigating the share transfers done in March 2021 and imposed a fine as well but now the regulator has roped in SEBI as well.

Moneycontrol couldn't verify the report independently.

This development comes after Axis Bank in an August 9 filing said its board approved raising its stake in the life insurer from 9.9 percent to 16.22 percent, taking the collective stake of Axis entities to 19.02 percent.

The bank would infuse Rs 1,612 crore in Max Life to acquire 14.25 crore shares at Rs 113.06 apiece, a premium of Rs 103.06 a share over the face value of Rs 10 each, it said.

The filing said the objective of the acquisition was to strengthen the bank’s position in the life insurance business.

IRDAI crackdown

On October 13, 2022, IRDAI fined Max Life Rs 3 crore after investigating the transfer of shares to Axis entities in March 2021.

Its investigations showed that Axis Bank on March 15 and 16, 2021 sold shares to Max Financial Service Limited (MFSL) and Mitsui Sumitomo International (MFI) for Rs 166 each. Ten or 11 days later, the shares were bought by Axis entities (Axis Capital, Axis Securities and Axis Bank) from MFSL and MFI for prices between Rs 31.5 and Rs 32.12.

As the IRDAI order pointed out “same equity share is valued differently based on whether Axis Bank is buyer or seller”.

The order said, “The transfer of shares was not done at fair market value determined on a uniform basis, which led to Axis Bank, a registered Corporate Agent of the Insurer along with its group companies, receiving undue monetary gain of significant amounts from such buy/sale of equity shares”.

On October 13, 2022, IRDAI fined Axis Bank Rs 2 crore for not complying with its orders and for making undue gains of substantial amounts through the transaction of these shares.",429,0.015657782554626465

Axis Bank is confident of 18 percent sustainable ROE and believes focus on improvement in funding profile will reduce volatility as well as improve net interest margins, which makes the lender an attractive pick among bank stocks, Jefferies said.

The global brokerage firm hosted CEO of Axis Bank for investor meetings in the US, and released a report based on the discussions.

""One of the key areas of focus for the bank is improvement in funding mix through increase in share of retail deposits (term and savings deposits) to be in line with best-in-class peers: Towards this, there is a broader focus on improved customer experience, reorientation of branch staff, focus on corporate salary accounts and digital banking platforms,"" the report said.

This process can take 18-24 months to play out in terms of improved funding mix and lower cost of funds. Over the past year, rise in share of retail funds has helped reduce outflow rate (now in line with larger banks), which has in turn helped grow loans.

The bank management believes that credit growth for banking can sustain around 12-13 percent levels and that Axis Bank can continue to grow at a 4-5 percentage points higher rate (so 16-19 percent).

""The pricing environment in corporate lending has improved, which allows for greater participation for Axis. Capex cycle is seeing some improvement, but banks and promoters (in general) will remain cautious about pushing capex,"" Jefferies said.

The management also reiterated that the bank doesn't need to raise capital given its CET-1 CAR of 14 percent and ROE (annualised) of 19 percent in 10FY24.

""We expect the bank to deliver 16 percent CAGR in profit over FY23-26, with ROE of 18 percent. We also believe that most inflation in funding cost has gone through earnings and that improved funding mix can help structurally improve NIM and ROA, Jefferies said.

Valuations at 18x 12-month forward adjusted PB is attractive (25 percent discount to ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank) and offer good entry point, it noted.

After nearly 35 percent run in the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices from March 24, there could be consolidation or profit-booking in both the indices in September before resuming an upward trajectory, though medium-to-long-term trend for them is positive, Ashish Kyal, Founder and CEO at Waves Strategy Advisors, says in an interview to Moneycontrol.

Any retracement towards Fibonacci 23.6 percent to 38.2 percent of the rise will be a good opportunity to buy stocks in the midcap and smallcap segments, he advises.

On the pharma, the Chartered Market Technician with vast experience in the capital markets advised that it is a good opportunity to use dips in the sector and stocks as opportunity to buy as the overall medium-to-long-term trend is intact.

The pharma sector has come out of eight years of consolidation and such correction is a healthy sign for the next sustainable up-move, he believes. Excerpts from the interview:

Do you expect the Nifty to decisively break the 19,000 mark this week? Do you see another 5 percent correction from here on?

The Nifty has been breaking below the prior weekly low since the past four weeks. Pullback we saw last week also got sold and prices closed near the lower end of the range. Now, further break below 19,220 can open targets for Gann level of 18,838. Over past few days, prices have been stuck within the range of 19,590 – 19,250 and on August 25, we broke the range there by suggesting that the trend is bearish as of now unless we see close back above the high of August 24, which is at 19,585 levels.

Selling is visible across sectors over the last week. So, over the short term, we might be in sell on rise market but we might see a cut to 18,838 or Head & Shoulder pattern target of 18,620 as long as prices sustain below 19,400 followed by 19,585 levels.

Bank Nifty also showed reversal on the last day of the week as the index found a hurdle near 45,000 levels with support near 43,600. This week, one has to be cautious and wait for this range to break for a trend in that direction. Bank Nifty can provide leading indication for Nifty as well.

Two stocks that can outperform Nifty50 this week, and why?

Axis Bank showed a strong rise in prior week after correcting to the levels of Rs 928 and is on the verge of giving a break above the prior swing high at Rs 990 levels. Any close above this can result into a fresh rally on the upside with the targets of Rs 1,050 levels or higher. The stock also be starting the 3rd wave on upside as per Elliott wave pattern.

Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers has shown a strong pick-up in volumes on the previous three days along with an impulsive rise. The Overall chart pattern looks good as stock has given breakout above the price action resistance area of Rs 120. We can expect pattern target on upside to Rs 135 with Rs 117 as important support.

Do you see more correction in the Nifty Pharma? It has fallen further after recent several days of consolidation...

The Nifty Pharma index has rallied from the lows made in March 2023 at 11,540 to the highs of 15,750 levels. That is a rally of more than 36 percent in just over five months and we are witnessing retracement of that up-move.

Also read: 10 most popular large-cap stocks among PMS to withstand volatility

It is a good opportunity to use dips in the pharma sector and stocks as opportunity to buy as the overall medium-to-long-term trend is intact. The pharma sector has come out of eight years of consolidation and such correction is a healthy sign for the next sustainable up-move.

Over near term, support for the sector is at 14,200 which is also 38.2 percent retracement of the entire rise. So, over the short term, profit-booking is possible in this sector but medium-to-long-term investors can nibble stocks from the space on every dip.

What do you make out of the ongoing consolidation in the Nifty Auto index?

The Nifty Auto index has been moving in a range since the past few weeks but stock-specific action is clearly witnessed in the midcap and smallcap auto ancillary space. CNX Auto is trading near 15,363 after forming a high at 15,912. We see time correction with minor price correction so far.

A break above 15,900 in this index will resume the next wave on upside for a move to 17,000 levels. So, short term consolidation or correction in this index can be ideal opportunity for medium to long term traders to enter into the auto and auto ancillary space.

Do you see the relentless buying continuing in the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices in September too?

Both Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices have shown a rise of nearly 35 percent since March 24. Overall, the medium-to-long-term trend for this sector is positive but in September we are expecting consolidation or profit booking. There is a possibility that the market will take a breather over the near term before resuming the upward trajectory.

So, for traders or investors, use the dips to buy to play out the medium-to-long-term growth story. Over the near term also, not all stocks from this sector might show a sharp correction. It is best to buy leaders that have outperformed during the current rise once they relieve their overbought state. So, any retracement towards Fibonacci 23.6 percent to 38.2 percent of the rise will be a good opportunity to buy the stocks in this sector. In a nutshell, we expect consolidation or profit-booking in September before the strong up move resumes again.

Do you think Apar Industries is done with the rally?

Apar Industries has shown an exponential rise in just over a year. The stock was trading near Rs 556 levels in May 2022 and touched the high of Rs 5,350 on August 21. This is 10 times increase in the stock price. The stock is still trading at 26 times its PE multiple which means the earnings momentum has been strong that backed the exponential rise.

Short-term profit-booking is not ruled out but medium-to-long-term investors can stay invested as long as the stock does not break the support near the Rs 4,000 levels. There will be natural tendency for traders to book profit seeing such exorbitant returns but wealth can be created by sitting tight in these type of stocks unless the fundamental or technical pattern has changed.

Neelkanth Mishra, Chief Economist, Axis Bank, believes the pangs of inflation are short term in nature and the Reserve Bank of India’s Monetary Policy Committee will keep rates on hold for a while.

There has been raging debate over management of inflation in India that shot up in July led by cereal and vegetable prices. It rose above RBI’s target range of 2-6 percent to hit a 15-month high of 7.44 percent.

“The MPC is now targeting 4 percent plus minus 2. There was a belief that the moment inflation gets below 4 percent, MPC will cut rates – that was the wrong expectation to start with. Therefore, I think rates will stay on hold,” said Mishra, speaking to CNBC TV-18. .

The sharp rise in inflation was driven by higher prices for vegetables, with their index rising 38 percent month-on-month, resulting in a 6.7 percent sequential rise in Consumer Food Price Index and a 2.9 percent increase in the overall CPI.

However, prices of some vegetables, especially tomatoes, have come down since then and now it is available at a third of its peak price in July. On the other hand, some vegetables, such as onions, have become dearer.

There was some more good news on the core inflation front, which eased slightly to 4.9 percent in July from 5.1 percent in June. Mishra also said one should focus on this number.

“From India's inflation report, the core inflation numbers were better and that we need to focus on,” said Mishra.

For the RBI's revised forecast of 6.2 percent for July-September to be met, CPI inflation should average 5.6 percent in August and September. This looks unlikely at the moment, with economists seeing inflation remaining elevated around 6.5 percent in August - data for which will be released on September 12 - given the price developments so far.

Thus, expectations of a rate cut have also vanished.

“This expectation many had that interest rates will start falling early next calendar year, I think that was totally misplaced. Thankfully that expectation is now getting corrected. The fear that this will again necessitate another round of rate hikes is not something I buy into,” said Mishra.

Not a big impact on financial cos

Mishra believes the high inflation, and consistently high rates, will not be a big issue for lenders such as non banking financial companies (NBFCs) and banks.

“The longer rates stay on hold, the higher the effective rates are. So, if repo rates stay unchanged for a year, there will be effective tightening,” said Mishra. “I think financial (companies) will do pretty well.”

He also refused to read too much into the imposition of 10 percent incremental CRR (cash reserve ratio), which is likely to suck liquidity out of the system. Mishra said the move was “more tactical”.",517,0.07199554310904609

""It is apparent that the acquisition of stake in CSC e-Governance by Axis Bank was neither solely as an investment nor can be considered to be in ordinary course of business.

""Therefore, the AxisCSC e-Governance acquisition is not eligible for the benefit of the Item 1 of Schedule I (combination regulation) and accordingly, it is immaterial whether the transaction led to acquisition of control or not,"" the regulator said.

Thus, CCI observed that no determination is warranted whether the transaction led to the acquisition of control or not in this matter. Accordingly, the commission found that in relation to the AxisCSC e-Governance acquisition, Axis Bank failed to comply with the regulations.

To avail the benefit of combination rules, the acquirer should not be a member of the board of directors, does not have a right to nominate a director and should not participate in the affairs or management of the enterprise whose shares or voting right are being acquired, as per the order.

However, Axis Bank had/has representation on the board of CSC e-Governance. Further, it had intention to have representation on the board of directors of the company and participate in its management or affairs, thereby it is not eligible for the benefit of the rules.

Domestic indices were on a downhill drive for the fourth straight week on August 18 amid rising worries over food inflation and weak global cues, especially from the US markets.

Analysts pointed out that the rising US bond yields continue to create havoc in world currency markets, fuelling a sell-off in equity markets. The relatively weak macroeconomic scenario – rising domestic inflation, FII fund outflow, China slowdown and the US Fed hints of more rate hikes to contain inflation - is also prompting investors to book profits.

As of 10.28am, the BSE flagship Sensex traded down 271.52 points or 0.42 percent at 64,879.50. The NSE Nifty was down 88.45 points or 0.46 percent at 19,276.80. Broader market indices, which have been resilient in the past weeks, also saw brisk selling. Nifty Smallcap 100 and Nifty Midcap 100 traded lower by 0.4 percent and 0.2 percent.

IT stocks were among the biggest drags on the indices, followed by realty and oil and gas. Banks, especially public sector lenders, were resilient, while some media stocks also saw demand.

Axis Bank and Adani Ports were biggest gainers in the Nifty, while Wipro led the losers along with its peers Tech Mahindra and TCS.

US dollar

Despite a pullback from two-month highs, high dollar levels are a worry for the Indian currency as it managed to hold recent gains. The 10-year US yield dropped to 4.25 percent, having made a new 10-month high of 4.33 percent on Thursday. Resilient US economic data has made investors worried that the US interest rates are likely to remain high for longer and that policymakers may not be done with hikes.

Weak economies

Data early on Friday showed that Japan's core inflation slowed down in July, a result that is likely to support market wagers that the Bank of Japan is in no hurry to phase out monetary easing anytime soon.

Adding to concerns of a deepening crisis in China's property sector, China Evergrande, one of the country's biggest real estate developers, on Thursday filed for protection from creditors in a US bankruptcy court.

China stocks have shed 10 percent from their highs in January, as dismal economic data laid bare the stuttering post-pandemic recovery, with investors remaining unimpressed with just piecemeal support measures from policymakers.

Global markets

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were up 0.1 percent after hitting a nine-month low the session before. It was, however, headed for a weekly loss of 2.8 percent, the third straight week of declines. Japan's Nikkei lost 0.4 percent and was down 3 percent on the week, pushing pressure on Indian stocks.

The S&P 500 lost 33.97 points, or 0.77 percent, to 4,370.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 143.75 points, or 1.07 percent, to 13,330.88. The S&P 500 is down 2.7 percent over the past three sessions, its deepest three-session drop since mid-March. The Nasdaq's 3.4 percent drop over three days marks its deepest three-day drop since February.

Technical view

Technically, prices persist in oscillating within a notably narrow range of 200 points – 19,300 to 19,500. Traders are opting for cautious positions on the index front, awaiting a catalyst for a momentum-driven movement. The trading range is defined by two moving averages, with the 50 EMA defending prices at lower levels and the 20 EMA capping the prices at higher levels.

“Traders are advised to monitor these levels closely and, rather than being swayed by market movements, should engage within this range until a decisive momentum breakout occurs beyond the mentioned limits. Furthermore, the trajectory of the market's future remains in sync with global market developments; hence, vigilant observation of these developments is crucial,” said Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivatives, Angel One.

HDFC Securities' research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank (AXSB) reported a marginal beat on estimates, led by a modest loan growth (+1.6% QoQ on merged numbers) and higher trading gains. Muted recoveries from written-off accounts resulted in elevated net credit costs (50bps annualised). NIMs moderated 12bps sequentially on account of catch-up in funding costs following accelerated TD mobilisation. In addition, given muted sequential growth in overall deposits (CASA down 160bps QoQ to 45.5%), the loan-to-deposit ratio further increased to (~91%), calling for utilisation of excess SLR towards funding the loan growth.



Outlook

We marginally tweak our FY24/25E estimates for higher opex, partly offset by lower credit cost; maintain BUY with a target price of INR1,150 (standalone bank at 2.0x Mar-25 ABVPS).

ICICI Securities research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank (Axis) reported mixed Q1FY24 earnings with in-line PAT at INR 57.97bn and annualised RoA at 1.8% though aided by healthy treasury gains (INR 5.19bn) while business growth QoQ was somewhat soft. We point out that due to Citi integration, most numbers are not directly comparable on either QoQ or YoY basis. While retail term deposits growth at ~5% QoQ was healthy, overall loan growth at 1.6% QoQ was weaker than expected, while NIM contraction (down 12bps QoQ) was in line with our estimates. Core PPOP too, adjusted for Citi integration costs, was soft QoQ. Healthy 36bps net CET-1 accretion (CET-1 now at 14.38%) despite rise in RWA density is a key positive.

Outlook

We estimate the bank to deliver a loan CAGR of 16%, RoA of ~1.6-1.65% and RoE of ~17.0% for FY24E/FY25E. Maintain BUY with an unchanged target price of INR 1,150, valuing the stock at ~2.0x FY25E core banking book.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on AXIS Bank

Despite lower margins yet again and rigidly-higher opex (incl. Citi integration cost of Rs3.9bn), Axis Bank is back in the black, given in-line PAT at Rs58bn/1.8% RoA, mainly on higher treasury gains. Similar to 4Q, Bank logged better than expected credit growth, at ~18% YoY (incl. Citi)/22% YoY (ex-Citi in 1QFY23), but margin slipped again (12bps QoQ), with cumulative contraction of 16bps to 4.1% in the past 2Qs. Fresh slippages were higher at Rs40bn/2.2% of loans, but GNPA ratio improved QoQ to 1.9% due to higher recoveries/woffs. Also, Bank retains the contingent provision buffer, at 0.6% of loans. Bank’s CET 1 ratio too improved, by 36bps QoQ to 14.4% (lower vs peers’ at >15%). We expect Axis Bank to clock 1.8% RoA/18% RoE (inflated due to Citi acquisition goodwill w-off) on merged basis (without factoring-in any equity dilution) over FY24-26E.

Outlook

We retain BUY, with revised TP of Rs1,260/sh, valuing the core bank at 2x Jun-25E ABV + subs/investment value at Rs80/sh.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB saw a good quarter; a lthough core PAT was a miss due to higher opex, NII was 3% ahead to PLe leading to NIM at 4.17% (beat by 17bps). NIM boost was driven by (1) strong QoQ growth in higher margin segments of PL, CC and SBB (2) deliberate slowdown in housing (3) 6% QoQ fall in LCR and (4) lower deposit growth of 0.6% QoQ resulting in higher LDR. RTD growing by 4.5% QoQ was another positive. Balance sheet construct is being calibrated towards higher margin segments and granular deposits which could slightly affect loan growth. However, this should bode well over medium term from a profitability perspective. CITI integration costs and business investments would keep opex elevated.

Outlook

For FY24/25E we raise NIM and opex while reduce provisions resulting in ~3% PAT upgrade. With likely RoA of 1.7% for FY25E, valuation discount to ICICIB (27%) should narrow. We maintain multiple at 2.2x but raise TP to Rs1,170 from Rs1,140. Reiterate ‘BUY’.

Axis Bank, which saw employee attrition of 34.8 percent in FY23, is making ‘constant efforts’ to check the high attrition rate, the private lender's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Chaudhry said on July 26.

The 34.8 percent rate was higher than Axis Bank's FY22 and FY21 attrition, that stood at 31.6 percent and 19.1 percent, respectively.

Chaudhry, in a post-results media call, highlighted that attrition is an industry-wise issue and Axis is making efforts to work on the same.

“Attrition is an industry-wise issue. We are constantly working to make more efforts to work on less attrition, but it is the reality of the industry,” said Chaudhry.

Axis Bank has seen maximum attrition at around 33-35 percent at the junior and branch level, said Chaudhry.

Whereas, after the acquisition of Citi Bank India’s retail operations, around 3200 employees joined the company. On this, Chaudhry said that attrition of these employees is lower than what it was in CitiBank India.

“Attrition of the Citi Bank employees is lower at Axis Bank than in the past three years in CitiBank India,” Chaudhry said.

In the annual report of the bank, the lender saw its attrition in FY23 at 34.8 percent, higher than FY22 and FY21 when the attrition rate was at 31.6 percent and 19.1, respectively.

The integration of Citibank India Consumer Business remains well on track with around 3,200 Citi employees now part of the bank, Axis Bank managing director and chief executive officer Amitabh Chaudhry said in his message to shareholders.

Also, early traction from the Citibank customer base has been quite positive, Chaudhry said. ""Our interactions with several high-value customers suggest their acknowledgement of the seamless transition,"" Chaudhry added.

On March 1, Axis Bank said it completed the acquisition of Citibank’s consumer business. The deal, which was announced in March 2022, saw India’s third-largest private sector bank absorbing Citibank’s consumer businesses, covering loans, credit cards, wealth management and retail banking operations in India.

The deal happened after Citigroup in 2021 announced its decision to shutter its retail banking operations in 13 countries, including India, as part of a global business strategy. Axis Bank put out a video advertisement to welcome Citibank’s 30 lakh plus customers on March 1.

Chaudhry said the bank has already started incremental onboarding of erstwhile ‘Suvidha’ salary accounts on Axis Bank platform for additional locations across the country where Citi was hitherto not present.

""While the acquired Citi business being entirely retail runs at a higher cost, it comes with higher return ratios and is ROE accretive post integration,"" Chaudhry, said adding it does not impede our ability to deliver our aspirational ROE.

The bank has identified over 60 synergy initiatives across the Bank to drive revenue and cost benefits, the CEO said. ""We believe that this integration between two highly complementary institutions will enable us to create the gold standard in the retail space,"" Chaudhry added.

On the results expectations, Kotak Institutional Equities stated that “1QFY24 will have the full impact of Citi (acquired in March 2023) and hence, it is still a quarter that is not fully comparable. The sharp swing in profits (as compared to 4QFY23) is on account of no large one-offs but the bank has indicated that the operating expenses would be higher for integration. We are building a loan growth of ~22 percent yoy (marginally higher qoq). We expect NIM to decline by ~20 bps qoq led by higher cost of deposits”.

The brokerage house further stated, “We expect slippages of ~Rs 40 bn (~2% of loans) mostly led by small-ticket loans. Trends on slippages and overall asset quality should not be too worrisome and broadly stable. We should expect the bank to make higher provisions for expenses pertaining to the merger as well. Citi integration, near-term growth trends and progress of NIM would be the key discussion areas for the quarter.”

On July 21 morning, several Axis Bank credit-card holders got an email from the private lender, saying it had suspended the redemption of their reward points, a big attraction for users. As the news spread, some more Axis Bank customers raised similar concerns on Twitter.

“… a pattern of non-personal usage of your credit card(s) has been observed for the transactions undertaken by you with the following merchant(s), BSPL, Spay Tech Pvt Ltd, Slenpay Pvt Ltd, etc,” the email, a copy of which was reviewed by Moneycontrol, said.

As per the bank’s policies, the credit cards can only be used for “your personal expenses and purposes, and any other transaction (including for business and commercial purposes) is prohibited under the Axis Bank’s card member agreement... ” the mail said.

The mail suggests that the bank noticed users spending money on expenses that are not usually allowed as they earn reward points unfairly.

“Business spends on personal credit cards are against terms & conditions and Axis Bank seems to have targeted users with transactions on specific payment gateways that are used for Business Payments,” said Tejas Ghongadi, Co-Founder, The Points Code.

The Points Code is a platform that helps credit-card users get maximum benefits from credit-card rewards and redemptions.

Axis Bank's decision to block access to redeem reward points for some users engaged in non-personal spending is a commendable step towards maintaining the sustainability of its rewards programme, said Ankur Mittal, co-founder and chief technology officer, Card Insider, a platform that tracks credit-card business.

“By preventing misuse of personal cards for business expenses, the bank ensures that genuine users can continue benefiting from the rewards,” Mittal said.

A history of blocking cards?

Experts who track credit cards say that Axis Bank keeps a close vigil on suspicious spending patterns. In March 2023, it sent suspected commercial use notifications to the high-networth individuals (HNIs) holders of cards such as Axis Magnus and Axis Reserve.

“The bank also has a history of canceling the cashback cards such as Axis Ace and Flipkart Axis Bank credit card if they were found used for business purpose,” said Sumanta Mandal, Founder, TechnoFino, a platform that tracks the Indian credit card industry.

Moneycontrol reviewed one such email that a customer received early this year where the bank asked invoices or proof to prove that all the transactions done in December 2022 and January were for personal use only. Failing which, the bank warned of blocking the cards.

Similarly, in June 2023, the bank informed some customers that their cards were blocked and reward redemption suspended temporarily, as they were suspicious of using them for business purposes, Mandal said.

Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify the veracity of these emails.

“While it may be a good idea to prevent misuse, there are reports of genuine spenders also receiving such notices, which is concerning,” Mandal said.

Ghongadi said some people were gaming the system to make money or earn reward points without actual spends, which is an unethical practice.

Non-compliance with terms, conditions

While applying for a credit card, a customer agrees to certain terms and conditions set forth by the issuer. If these are violated, the issuer can cancel the card.

“This could include using the credit card for illegal activities such as for gambling, money laundering, using the personal credit card for business transactions, or providing false information on the credit card application,” Mandal said.

To avoid this mistake, read and understand the terms and conditions of your credit card. Utilise your personal credit card only for personal expenses and refrain from using it for any business-related expenses or reselling goods.

What should you do if your rewards have been suspended?

If you receive such an email from the bank or the credit card company, you must try and produce invoices of goods and services you paid for through the card.

Typically, the bank sends a weblink, allowing users to submit invoices, online. The proofs have to be submitted within 30 days of getting the mail. You can also use phone banking to get in touch with your bank.

Keep personal and business separate

Experts say it is not a good idea to mix business and personal expenses on your personal credit card. Personal credit cards are meant for personal use and the benefits and rewards are optimised based on individual usage.

“Most issuers have separate business credit cards that are specifically optimised for businesses and have better rewards and benefits for business users,” said Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar.com.

Proper use of a business credit card helps build business credit and also offers a chance to earn additional rewards and benefits.

Many banks draw a strict line between personal and business use of a personal credit card and outline them in their terms and conditions. Others do not have it mentioned but may flag excessive use for business purposes.",873,0.17733978231747946

Axis Bank has revised the features of a popular co-branded credit card, i.e., Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card. The revised features come into effect from August 12. “As of date, Axis Bank has made changes to the product features of only the Flipkart Axis Bank credit card with effect from 12th August 2023,” said an Axis Bank spokesperson.

Here are the key changes in features of the Flipkart Axis Bank Credit Card that the bank has announced.

Change in the Cashback earned

Effective from August 12, spending towards flight and hotel payments on Flipkart and spends on Myntra shall be eligible for 1.5 percent unlimited cashback from 5 percent cashback. This means that earlier whatever your spends were, you used to get 5 percent of that amount back. Now your cashback will come down to 1.5 percent.

Exclusion of payments made towards Government services from Cashback

Payments made towards government services, fuel spends, purchase of gift cards on Flipkart and Myntra, EMI transactions, wallet loading, purchases converted to EMI, utility bill payments, educational services, rental payments, etc. will not be eligible for cashback. This is a significant reduction of benefits as many millennials and young credit card holders typically pay their rents and utility bill payments using their credit cards.

Increased spending limit for annual fee waiver

You will now need to spend a lot more if you wish to see your annual fee (Rs 500) waived. Earlier, you had to spend at least Rs 2 lakh a year to earn a fee waiver. Now, Axis Bank has increased this minimum threshold to Rs 3.5 lakh.

Is Axis Bank reducing benefits on other cards?

Credit card circles were buzzing with rumours over the past week that Axis Bank might also reduce benefits- on Axis Magnus Credit Card; widely acknowledged to be one of the more popular credit cards in India. However, the bank only confirmed the reduction of benefits of the Flipkart Axis Bank credit card.

On July 12, Moneycontrol accessed documents on Axis Bank’s website that detailed the revised terms and conditions of five of its credit cards; Axis Bank Privilege card, Axis Bank Reserve card, Axis Bank Select card, Axis Bank My Zone credit card and Flipkart Axis Bank credit card. However, on the morning of July 13, these documents were no longer available on the bank’s website.

In response to Moneycontrol’s query about the revision of terms and conditions of the five cards, an Axis Bank spokesperson replied, ""as of date"", one card has changed its terms and condition. This will be effective August 12, 2023. As per rules laid down by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banks and card companies have to give a month’s time to cardholders to exit if they do not agree to the new terms and conditions.

Bulls took full control over Dalal Street since later part of the last week and pushed the benchmark indices to uncharted territory on June 30 as we have seen buying across sectors with strong lifting from banking and financial services and technology stocks.

The Nifty50 has seen a breakout of upward sloping resistance trendline adjoining previous record high levels (October 2021 and December 2022) in the opening itself on Friday and remained above the same throughout session. The index jumped 2.8 percent to end at record closing high of 19,189 and formed robust bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts, with maintaining higher highs for 14th straight session.

Even the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) gave bullish crossover on all timeframes, which is a positive sign. Hence, the index is likely to march towards 19,300-19,500 levels in coming days, as long as it holds 19,000 mark, which is an immediate support, then 18,800 levels, experts said.

""Price-wise, we can clearly see a configuration of ‘V’ pattern which has been broken out in the upward direction. The theoretical target of this is much higher but with the short to medium term view, we continue to remain upbeat on the market,"" Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.

As far as levels are concerned, he feels the Nifty can be heading towards 19,350 – 19,500 in the forthcoming week. However, one needs to be very selective going ahead because the low hanging fruit is gone for the momentum traders, he advised.

In between, ""we may see bout of profit booking, but the directional bias remains strongly bullish till the time 18,600 is not violated. Before this, 19,000 followed by 18,800 are to be seen as key supports,"" Sameet said.

Looking ahead, Arvinder Singh Nanda, Senior Vice President of Master Capital Services also feels the Nifty prices seem poised to continue their upward trajectory towards the levels of 19,400 and 19,500. In the event of any correctional fall, approximately around the 19,000 mark, it may present an opportunity to initiate fresh long positions, he said.

Here’s a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on June 28 closing prices:

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

Biocon: Buy | LTP: Rs 265.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 238 | Target: Rs 320 | Return: 20.5 percent

After correcting from an intermediate high of Rs 295 tested in November 2022, Biocon found support around Rs 191 levels in March 2023. These are strong supports as they also roughly coincide with previous intermediate lows.

The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA (small moving average). Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI (relative strength index) too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 263-267 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 238 and target at Rs 320.

Indian Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 292.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 276 | Target: Rs 320 | Return: 9.4 percent

Indian Bank has shown relative strength last week. While the Nifty has gained 2.8 percent last week, Indian bank has gained a healthy 5.42 percent. In the process, the stock has closed above its recent trading range on the back of above average volumes, which augurs well for the uptrend to continue.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 290-294 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 276 and target at Rs 320.

Indiabulls Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 123.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 113 | Target: Rs 140 | Return: 13.5 percent

After touching a low of Rs 91.8 in March 2023, Indiabulls Housing Finance has gradually climbed higher and made higher tops and higher bottoms. In the process, there has also been a moving average crossover as the 20-day SMA has moved above the 50-day SMA.

This positive signal combined with the fact that the stock also closed on Friday above the 200-day EMA on the back of above average volumes, augurs well for the uptrend to continue. Intermediate momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. Recommend a buy between Rs 121-125 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 113 and target at Rs 140.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 987.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 940 | Target: Rs 1,050-1,150 | Return: 16.5 percent

The stock is in a long-term breakout. In the medium term, the stock corrected to retest the breakout level, which stood at Rs 820. However, it soon reversed back and set a new all-time high, which other banks are missing.

The stock is doing well and moving towards Rs 1,050 and Rs 1,150 levels in the coming few weeks or months. The strategy should be to buy 50 percent at current levels and the rest at Rs 965. For this, keep the stop-loss at Rs 940.

LTIMindtree: Buy | LTP: Rs 5,197.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,050 | Target: Rs 5,500-5,800 | Return: 11.6 percent

The stock has formed an ascending triangle after falling from the high of Rs 7,588. It is a base-building structure and a rejection of Rs 5,050 on monthly and quarterly closes above it will result in a rally towards Rs 5,800 with key resistance at Rs 5,500.

In the short term, the strategy should be to buy at Rs 5,200 and place a stop-loss at Rs 5,050.

Century Textiles and Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 861.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 770 | Target: Rs 1,025 | Return: 19 percent

By closing above Rs 850 level, it has completed the corrective pattern on the long-term chart, which will pull the stock towards Rs 1,025, to the minimum level. At the maximum level, it seems possible to get Rs 1,200.

However, to get a better reward for the risk, traders should buy the stock in two tranches. The first tranche should be bought at the current price and the second tranche at Rs 800. Place stop-loss at Rs 770 for the given target.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 987.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 955 | Target: Rs 1,020-1,045 | Return: 6 percent

This stock has been forming a ‘Higher Top, Higher Bottom’ structure and is trading in a rising channel. The 20-DEMA has been acting as a support in corrections, and the stock seems to have resumed its upmove from its support zone.

Hence, positional traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 990-980. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 955 while the targets could be expected around Rs 1,020 and Rs 1,045.

Amara Raja Batteries: Buy | LTP: Rs 681 | Stop-Loss: Rs 648 | Target: Rs 720-740 | Return: 8.6 percent

The stock has witnessed a gradual upmove in last few weeks and has now given a breakout above its previous swing high resistance in Friday’s session. The breakout has been supported with higher than daily average volumes and the RSI (relative strength index) oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum.

Hence, traders can buy this stock on in the range of Rs 682-675 for potential near term target of Rs 720 and Rs 740. The stop-loss on long positions should be placed below Rs 648

Expert: Mitesh Karwa, research analyst at Bonanza Portfolio

Century Plyboards: Buy | LTP: Rs 662.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 630 | Target: Rs 705 | Return: 6.4 percent

The stock has seen breaking out of a downwards sloping parallel channel pattern on the weekly timeframe with a bullish candlestick above the highs of last nine months which indicates bullish strength.

Escorts Kubota: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,248 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,200 | Target: Rs 2,310 | Return: 3 percent

Axis Bank on Monday said it will continue to grow 4-6 per cent faster than the industry in the medium to long term, helped by focus on rural and semi-urban markets, improving digital infrastructure and Citibank India retail business.

Fiscal year 2023 was a breakout year for digital banking platform Axis 2.0 and the early leadership in building proprietary in-house digital native capabilities with full stack engineering, product and a design team of about 400 people have started yielding results, according to Axis Bank Managing Director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry.

""Given the powerful integrated platform we are building, we will continue to grow 400 to 600 bps faster than the industry in the medium to long term.

""The significant strides we made during the year on our customer obsession journey, digital capabilities, Bharat Banking and successful acquisition of Citibank India Consumer Business further give us the confidence in sustaining this performance,"" he said in a message to shareholders.

In March last year, Axis Bank completed the acquisition of Citibank's consumer business and Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) consumer business.

The positioning in the credit cards business has strengthened with the card advances market share improving by 450 basis points (bps) to 16.3 per cent, led by the acquisition of a quality and complementary credit card franchise.

According to the bank's annual report, the liability franchise received a boost with over 100 bps improvement in CASA ratio and access to over 1,600 Suvidha corporate relationships.

The integration of Citibank India Consumer Business remains well on track with about 3,200 Citi employees now integrated into the Axis organisation structure, it said.

Early traction from the Citibank customer base has been quite positive, it said, adding the interactions with several high-value customers suggest their acknowledgment of the seamless transition, continuation of highest levels of service, access to Axis Bank's extensive network of branches and wide product portfolio under the One Axis umbrella.

""We have already started incremental onboarding of erstwhile 'Suvidha' salary accounts on Axis Bank platform for additional locations across the country where Citi was hitherto not present. While the acquired Citi business being entirely retail runs at a higher cost, it comes with higher return ratios and is ROE accretive post integration,"" it said.

It does not impede the ability to deliver aspirational Return on Equity (ROE), the report said.

""We have identified 60+ synergy initiatives across the bank as we look to drive revenue and cost benefits. We believe that this integration between two highly complementary institutions will enable us to create the gold standard in the retail space,"" it said.

During the fiscal 2022-23, the report said the bank witnessed strong growth in deposits and advances led by focus on improving quality and granularity across businesses.

On advances, it said, the bank continued to grow faster than the industry with domestic loan book growth of 23 per cent y-o-y.",484,0.9999924004077911

Axis Bank may look at using ChatGPT’s enterprise version for enhancing communication services with customers, said Sameer Shetty, president and head, digital business and transformation at the private sector lender.

“We may look forward to working on use cases to enhance communication with customers using ChatGPT’s enterprise version,” Shetty said in an interaction with Moneycontrol.

ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model that interacts with users in a conversational way. It is based on a large language model (LLM), a tool that is trained with massive amounts of data and information to accurately predict conversational behaviour.

Global banks like JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank are planning to use ChatGPT-like chatbots and AI models.

Shetty said the banks can use ChatGPT for conversational and personalised services.

“We have some AI experiments in place which may show results in the next 12-15 months. Alongside these use cases, we may look at using ChatGPT’s enterprise version for chatbot service to provide customised information to our customers,” Shetty said.

Currently, Shetty said that the bank uses AI, machine learning (ML) and data analytics tools for internal calculation purposes, to give recommendations to its customers on their spends and banking services and for some other purposes.

“We have revamped our mobile banking application with AI tools to make it more customised and consumer-oriented,” Shetty said.

Why the digital rush?

Banks, both in the private sector and public sector, are working closely on their technology using AI and ML tools to expand digital banking services.

For example, the country’s largest private sector bank, HDFC Bank, has its chatbot Eva, which provides customers and non-customers with information about the lender’s banking services.

The country’s largest bank, State Bank of India, in its annual report for FY23 said that it will enhance the use of business analytics, AI and ML in decision-making and operations.

For Axis Bank, the lender in June 2023 launched One View, a service where customers can link their different banking accounts and manage the same on its mobile application.

This comes after the bank has seen growing demand for digital adoption in the last three years. “Around 67 percent of our total service requests are from digital channels,” said Shetty.

The lender’s results for the FY23 showed that the number of digital transactions increased from 91 percent in FY22 to 95 percent. Other than this, digital loans have also grown across some segments by an average of 94 percent on a year-on-year basis.

“We have made an overall investment in our technology of nearly Rs 1,300 crore in building new data centres, data loss policies and other initiatives,” said Shetty.

Fintech and digital partnerships

Razorpay in May 2023 partnered with Axis Bank and the National Payments Council of India to launch Turbo UPI for making faster payments and reducing potential failures.

HDFC Bank in January 2023 partnered with Microsoft to use Microsoft Cloud services for its digital banking needs.

Among public sector banks, Bank of Baroda in May 2023 partnered with Tech Mahindra to enhance its digital solutions concerning customer complaints and queries.

Shetty said that his bank is also looking at enhancing partnerships with more fintech companies.

After a stellar show in the final quarter of FY23, banking and finance companies emerged as the top picks of analysts in May, with heavyweights like SBI, HDFC twins, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank garnering zero ""sell"" calls.

In contrast, the information technology (IT) pack had to bear the brunt of the Street’s ire as the slowdown in the West and the banking crisis in the US – the bread-and-butter market for India’s software services industry – led to a forgettable quarter

Overall, companies with better earnings visibility scored over their counterparts mired in macro and operational challenges. A bird in hand proved better than two in the bush.

The 'buy' list

The two companies with the perfect optimism score — zero ""sell"" or ""hold"" calls — were SBI Life and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.

SBI Life Insurance Company declared a decent set of numbers in Q4. Net profit rose 15 percent year on year (YoY) to Rs 777 crore, while net premium income climbed 14 percent to Rs 19,897 crore.

The gross written premium (GWP), a key metric to assess an insurance company's fiscal health, jumped 15 percent for FY23 to Rs 67,320 crore.

Analysts were heartened by the all-round improvement in operational metrics.

“The management is confident of delivering 20–25 percent business growth in FY24E on the back of healthy demand and improving penetration owing to regulatory changes. The diversified distribution channels are expected to contribute significantly to the overall growth of the company,” brokerage KRChoksey said in a note.

The company has been maintaining its cost leadership among the private players over the past few years, despite an increase in operating costs led by increased spending on new initiatives, it added.

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), too, posted strong quarterly numbers, with revenues soaring 40 percent to Rs 5,797 crore, supported by Haifa port consolidation.

“As APSEZ embarks on becoming India's largest integrated transport utility company by 2030, it is strengthening its capabilities in all logistics segments (ports, warehousing, last mile delivery, ICDs, etc). Hence, it will offer end-t- end service to its customers thereby capturing a higher wallet share and also making the cargo sticky in nature,” analysts at ICICI Direct said.

In tandem with other Adani group stocks, APSEZ has rebounded following the rout triggered by American short-seller Hindenburg Research’s report in late January. The report accused the port-to-power conglomerate of stock manipulation and other wrongdoings. The group has denied the charges.

APSEZ is up over 87 percent over its 52-week low of Rs 394.95 hit on February 3.

The other prominent names figuring on top of analysts’ buy lists include SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Axis Bank.

Banking and finance firms had a standout quarter, marked by robust disbursements despite rising rates, healthy interest margins and stable asset quality.

Public sector banks’ cumulative profit crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark in the financial year 2023, with market leader SBI accounting for nearly half of the total earnings.

From posting a net loss of Rs 85,390 crore in 2017-18, PSBs have come a long way.

“The banking sector reported a strong 4Q FY23, driven by healthy loan growth, stable margins, and continued asset quality improvements. There were numerous drivers of credit expansion, with the retail and MSME sectors exhibiting robust growth and the corporate book displaying a healthy rebound,” brokerage Motilal Oswal said.

Declining fortunes

JSW Steel topped the pessimism list with 17 ""sell"", nine ""hold"" and just six ""buy"" calls.

Its Q4 performance was mixed -- consolidated net profit rose 13 percent to Rs 3,664 crore, even as revenue from operations stayed flat at Rs 46,962 crore.

The company also said it recorded higher-ever crude steel production as well as saleable steel sales during the quarter.

The narrative around the metal space has turned negative, given that China's demand has not really come up despite its post-Covid reopening, while recession fears in the West are further weighing on outlook.

“Though global steel consumption is facing headwinds due to inflationary pressures, high interest rate pressures, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a slowdown in China, steel demand is robust in the domestic market,” analysts at Motilal Oswal said.

Some of the most prominent names on this list, however, are IT companies.

India’s IT giants have been clobbered by project cancellations, margin contraction and slowing order inflows amid the gathering clouds of recession in the West.

“We remain underweight on IT as a sector. The macro overhang witnessed post the unfolding of regional bank issues in the US and EU impacted the growth and margin exit rates in March 2023. The companies which reported March 2023 results… expect some spillover of this weakness into the June 2023 quarter as well,” said Shibani Sircar Kurian, Senior EVP & Head-Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company.

Initial expectations of margin improvement have been kept under check on account of negative operating leverage, given the sudden ramp-downs the sector had seen.

“Overall, we expect the operating environment over the next two quarters to remain challenging due to the macro issues and cautious stance of companies on discretionary spends,” she added.

Pharma and auto companies, too, attracted a raft of ""sell"" and ""hold"" calls due to factors like revenue collapse post-Covid, negative consumer sentiment due to elevated inflation and demand headwinds.

Road ahead

Analysts say the bulk of Nifty’s earnings growth in FY24 is expected to come from sectors linked to investment and domestic consumption.

“Nifty ended FY23 with an 11% EPS growth on a high base of 34% growth in FY22. Earnings though remain lopsided with BFSI driving almost entire incremental earnings in FY23. With healthy macros, range-bound oil prices, a robust fiscal balance sheets, and moderating inflation, the backdrop for the market is quite optimistic,” Motilal Oswal said.

The Monetary Policy Committee has maintained the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent in its bi-monthly review, while continuing to keep a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook.

Five of the six-member committee voted in favour of maintaining withdrawal of accommodation stance to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target, while supporting growth.

The interest rate decision by MPC is on expected lines, though few experts were expecting a possibility of change in policy stance to neutral.

The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in March-April into the tolerance band, in line with projections, reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures.

Headline inflation is projected to decline in 2023-24 from its level in 2022-23 but would still be above the target, warranting continuous vigil, said the RBI, adding the progress of the south west monsoon is critical in this regard.

The central bank lowered its FY24 inflation projection to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent earlier, and also to 4.6 percent from 5.1 percent for Q1FY24 and to 5.2 percent against 5.4 percent for Q2FY24.

""As the RBI expects inflation to remain within its target range for the rest of the fiscal year, and with growth faring reasonably well, we think the RBI will stay on hold through the rest of FY24,"" Rahul Bajoria, MD and Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics at Barclays, said.

RBI governor Shaktikanta Das in his policy address emphasised the need to bring down the CPI inflation to its 4 percent target consistently, saying that inflation being within the tolerance band itself was “not good enough”, Rahul pointed out.

The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is transmitting through the economy and its fuller impact should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months, the RBI said.

The central bank has maintained its current financial year growth projection at 6.5 percent, while expecting the real GDP growth for Q1FY24 at 8 percent and 6.5 percent for Q2FY24.

The market seems to have already reacted to the MPC move as the benchmark indices rallied sharply in previous session to hit the highest level of current calendar year. Today, the Nifty and Sensex turned volatile with trading in small range.

After the RBI policy decision, we collated 10 rate sensitive stocks that can deliver healthy double-digit return in the short-to-medium term from its closing price on June 7.

However, when taking into account the additional costs associated with harmonizing provisioning policies, operating expenses, and one-time acquisition expenses, the total impact on Axis Bank during the quarter amounted to Rs 12,489.82 crore.

""We see 16 percent CAGR in earnings (adj. for goodwill write-off due to the acquisition of Citi India's retail business in FY23) over FY23-26 led by top-line growth and some cost synergies. Valuations at 1.8x FY24 adjusted PB are attractive and at a 30 percent discount to ICICI Bank. Hence, we see scope for rerating & maintaining our Buy call & target price of Rs 1,150, including the value of bank at 1.9x Mar-25 adjusted PB,"" said Jefferies India in its note to investors.

During the fourth quarter, Axis Bank witnessed an improvement in asset quality. The gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio decreased by 36 basis points (bps) quarter-on-quarter, standing at 2.02 percent. Similarly, the net NPA ratio showed improvement, declining by 8 basis points sequentially to reach 0.39 percent. Gross slippages, which refer to loans turning into NPAs, amounted to Rs 3,375 crore during the quarter, a decrease from Rs 3,807 crore a year ago. Notably, recoveries and upgrades from NPAs in the quarter totaled Rs 2,699 crore.

According to Jefferies India, during the first and second quarters of FY24, Axis Bank will see a compression in margins as the lagged impact of the increase in funding costs unfolds. A significant portion of this impact will be upfronted during these quarters. However, beyond this period, the net interest margins (NIMs) are anticipated to normalize, approaching levels similar to those seen in FY23 for the full year.

""Axis delivered a stable performance in 3QFY23, driven by margin expansion, high other income and improving cost metrics. Business growth was healthy, led by the corporate segment. Asset quality continued to improve, even as slippages increased marginally, compensated by healthy recoveries and upgrades. The restructured book moderated further, while a higher provisioning buffer provided comfort,"" said Motilal Oswal in its recent note.",553,0.7573700770735741
2023-05-30 00:03:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/announcements/razorpay-partners-with-axis-bank-npci-to-launch-turbo-upi-10690191.html,"Razorpay founders Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar.

Fintech unicorn Razorpay on May 30 launched Turbo UPI in partnership with Axis Bank and the National Payments Council of India (NPCI). Turbo UPI aims to make UPI payments faster and reduce potential payment failures.

Merchants can integrate Turbo UPI at the payment gateway, which eliminates the need for customers to go to third-party UPI payment apps. This will allow customers to pay directly from their UPI-linked bank accounts within the merchant app. The additional step of switching apps is estimated to cause almost 5-10 percent of payment failures.

Last week, Paytm, which also has a payment gateway solution, launched a similar product called ""UPI SDK"". Paytm's product supports UPI payments through UPI Lite, as well as Rupay Credit Cards linked to the UPI account. SDK stands for software development kit, or a software plug-in that a merchant can integrate with their payment gateway.

“This is a one-click process and the payment​ is​ completed much faster. Here no PSPs (payment service providers) are required, the merchant app will itself become a UPI App. The merchant will install a Razorpay Plug-in and the customer can directly link their bank accounts to the merchant app,” ​said Shashank Kumar, cofounder and Managing Director of Razorpay, in an interaction with Moneycontrol.

The additional steps involved in using a third-party app like Google Pay or PhonePe can make the payment process cumbersome. Sometimes, messages or notifications for the payment prompt may be delayed, which could result in customers missing the payments. This is one of the reasons why some large digital merchants prefer to build their own UPI payment solutions. For example, Amazon has Amazon Pay UPI, while Zomato recently launched Zomato UPI. Flipkart also has plans to start its own UPI payments solution.

Razorpay claims that Turbo UPI can help businesses achieve a significant increase in the success rate of UPI payments by up to 10 percent. The product also offers insights to merchants on the end-user drop-off pattern, while also enabling merchants to control the end-to-end payment experience of their customers.

While Turbo UPI is still in the pilot stage, Razorpay said that customers of popular apps including Tata StarQuik, Ixigo, FNP (Ferns N Petals), Trainman, and Dhan are among several companies that will soon enable this product on their platforms. Razorpay expects more than a thousand of its merchants to enable this facility over the next couple of years.

“Based on the intelligence and data gathered by our banking partner, Axis Bank, we will pre-select the bank accounts, if the customer has multiple accounts​,"" Kumar added.​ Around 56% of Razorpay's digital payments are done through UPI, indicating the importance of this feature for its merchant partners.

How it works

When a customer makes a payment for a purchase, for example, on Swiggy or Zomato (Merchant app), the payment process, if UPI is chosen, involves transitioning from the Merchant App to a payment app (such as Google Pay or PhonePe, etc.). The customer selects the linked bank account and enters the secure UPI PIN.

The page then redirects back to the merchant app, and a notification is sent to the customer to inform them that the payment has been completed. While this is the standard process currently, there are chances of payment failures due to network issues, drop-off problems, and more.

However, with faster UPI payment solutions, the process can be simplified to a single click, reducing the failure rates. In this case, the customer's bank account is linked to the merchant's app. The customer only needs to enter the UPI PIN while staying within the merchant's app, and the payment is completed.

“The whole thing comes down to a 30-second process. We had been working with NPCI on how to improve this and now we have Turbo UPI…This improves the success rate of payments by at least 10 percent,” said Kumar. ​He​ added that this solution helps merchants to collect data on where the payment stops and helps in servicing a customer better​ next time. “There is better analytics and better visibility of the lifecycle of the customer,​"" he said.​

Razorpay also expects that this move will increase the opportunities and cross-selling choices.

UPI in India

UPI has become the common and preferred mode of payment for end users.

""Daily transactions on the UPI platform may touch 1 billion in the next three years as it reaches its full potential,"" said Dilip Asbe, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of NPCI during a panel discussion at Moneycontrol's inaugural India Fintech Conclave (IFC) in March.",759,0.36672986547152203

The market recouped all its previous week's losses and climbed to the highest level of this calendar year on May 26, thanks to the stellar rally put up by the benchmark indices on Friday. The buying was seen across sectors during the week with Metal, Pharma, IT and FMCG being the biggest gainers.

As a result, the Nifty50 surged nearly 300 points or 1.6 percent to 18,499.35 during the last week, and formed a strong bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts, with consistently making higher high formation for the ninth consecutive week.

Given the strong momentum and breaking of the last eight-day consolidation, the index is likely to march towards the 18,700-18,800 zone in the coming sessions, with support at 18,400-18,300 levels, experts said. Even the Options data indicated that the Nifty50 may climb towards 18,700-19,000 zone, with crucial support at 18,400-18,200 levels.

""We can see breakout happening on daily time frame chart which is likely to unfold the next leg of the rally to head towards 18,700 first and then if the momentum persists, the new high is imminent soon,"" Sameet Chavan, Head of Research for Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

On the flipside, he feels 18,350 followed by 18,200 should be considered as immediate supports.

Ideally, in case of any blip in the current week, Sameet is likely to see buying emerging from the mentioned demand zone. Traders are advised to stick to optimistic stance and use intra-week dips to add bullish bets, he said.

According to, Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio, the coming week is of extreme importance and will decide the trend for the next leg. ""The 18,350-18,400 levels are expected to act as a strong support zone and if held in the forthcoming week, the Nifty will start moving towards 19,000 levels,"" he said.

On the indicator front, the momentum indicator Relative Strength Index RSI (14) is showing a reading of 67 and Nifty is trading above its 200 EMA at 17,671 which indicates strength.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 26 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equities Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

United Breweries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,460 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,300 | Target: Rs 1,650 | Return: 13 percent

The stock started to diverge positively after hitting new lows in the short term. It was at Rs 1,800 level in December 2022 and overall it fell to Rs 1,350 level in less than five months.

Based on key oscillators such as MACD (moving average convergence divergence) and RSI (relative strength index), it is diverging positively, indicating a change in the prevailing trend. Based on it, we can expect a pullback rally in the near term.

The strategy should be to buy 50 percent at current levels and the rest at Rs 1,350. For this, put a stop-loss at Rs 1,300. A pullback could extend further towards Rs 1,650 with a major resistance near Rs 1,550.

Jindal Steel & Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 520 | Stop-Loss: Rs 490 | Target: Rs 580 | Return: 11.5 percent

The stock has completed the first leg of the corrective pattern at Rs 500. It was a price and time-based correction for the stock. It was at Rs 620 and fell to Rs 500 in a span of four months, which is 50 percent of the time the rally displayed from Rs 300 level.

Based on the wave theory, it would start trending higher and preparing for a bigger pullback in the near term. We should be a buyer with a strict stop-loss at Rs 490.

If it breaks Rs 490, it will trigger further correction and may drop to extreme levels. At current levels, buy 50 percent and buy the rest around Rs 505. Keep stop-loss at Rs 490 and target at Rs 550 and Rs 580.

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 927 | Stop-Loss: Rs 904 | Target: Rs 970 | Return: 5 percent

For the last two weeks, the stock is in a tight trading range of Rs 908 and Rs 930. This could be a bullish continuation, which could help the stock move towards Rs 970 levels. The strategy should be to buy between Rs 930 and Rs 920, and place a stop-loss at Rs 904.

Like several Indian money managers, Christopher Wood of Jefferies also seems gung-ho on private banks and capital goods sectors.

In a recent portfolio rejig, Wood has added Axis Bank with a 5 percent weighting and increased investment in Larsen & Toubro by one percentage point in the Asia ex-Japan long-only portfolio.

To accommodate this, he has removed ICICI Lombard General Insurance and reduced the investments in HDFC Bank and Reliance by one percentage point each.

In the India long-only portfolio, Thermax and Axis Bank have been introduced with 5 percent and 6 percent weighting respectively. To make place, ICICI Lombard General Insurance and Maruti Suzuki India have been removed and the investment in HDFC Life has been reduced by one percentage point.

Finally, in the Global long-only equity portfolio, the investments in HDFC Life, BNP Paribas and Schlumberger have been removed and replaced by investments in Axis Bank, TSMC and BYD.

Wood's move comes on the heels of Axis Bank's merger with Citibank's India consumer business. In Q4, the private lender reported a net loss of Rs 5,728.42 crore on account of acquisition costs.

If we exclude this exceptional item, the profit for the quarter would have been Rs 6,625.29 crore, a 61 percent growth from Rs 4,117.77 crore in the same period last year.

The bank's net interest income jumped by 33.1 percent on-year to Rs 11,742.2 crore, while the net interest margin improved by 73 basis points to 4.22 percent.

The stock has gained over 6 percent in the past one month. It is currently trading near Rs 920 level.

After a week of consolidation, the market flexed muscles and made more than a percent gains in the week ended May 12, with the Nifty50 forming a bullish candlestick pattern on the weekly charts after the formation of a shooting star kind of pattern in the previous week.

The index has also continued with higher tops formation for the seventh consecutive week and closed with 246 points gains at 18,315, the highest closing level since last December.

Even the momentum indicators RSI (relative strength index 14) showed bullish bias and MACD (moving average convergence divergence) giving a positive crossover above zero line on the weekly scale. Hence, the momentum can take the Nifty50 towards 18,500-18,700 in coming sessions, if it sustains 18,200 mark which can be near term support, followed by 18,000 being crucial support, experts said.

""The sustenance of Nifty at the higher band of the consolidation zone for most of the trading sessions indicates inherent strength. As far as levels are concerned, 18,200 is likely to cushion any short-term blip, while the sacrosanct support lies around the 18,100-18,000 zone in the comparable period,"" Sameet Chavan, Head Research, Technical and Derivatives at Angel One said.

On the flip side, he feels 18,500 is very much in the vicinity and with ongoing momentum, it is strongly anticipated to get tested soon. At the same time, an authoritative breach beyond the same could trigger the next leg of rally in the upcoming weeks, he says.

Going ahead, he remains sanguine with the current momentum and would advocate the traders to utilize the dips to add long positions in the index.

Mitesh Karwa, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio also feels the coming week is of extreme importance as it will decide the trend for the next leg. ""18,200 levels are expected to act as a strong support zone and if held in the forthcoming week, Nifty will start moving towards 18,500 levels.""

""Highest open interest is at 18,300 on the Call side and 18,200 on the Put side and hence, till the time Nifty is in this range, it is expected to remain sideways,"" Karwa said.

We are of the view that, the short term texture of the stock is bullish and uptrend wave is likely to continue in the near future.

For the trend following traders now, Rs 1,240 or 10-day SMA would act as a sacrosanct support level. Above which, it could rally till Rs 1,315. Further upside may also continue which could lift the stock till Rs 1,335. On the flip side below Rs 1,240 uptrend would be vulnerable.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank (AXSB) saw a mixed quarter; core PPoP at Rs90.8bn missed PLe by 1.8% due to lower NII, although core PAT beat PLe by 16% as provisions dropped sharply QoQ led by improving asset quality. NIM declined by 10bps QoQ due to back-ended growth and higher LCR. However, NIM compression in FY24E could be lower for AXSB as (1) RIDF share declined YoY from 3.5% to 2.3% and (2) share of higher yielding products has increased. Ex-Citi, loan growth was strong at 7% QoQ, mainly led by retail/SME. Deposit outflow reduced by 550bps YoY and for Q4FY23 deposit accretion was healthy at 7% QoQ, due to CASA growth of 9.9%. Bank suggested that pace of branch expansion would increase and achieving a 2% opex to assets could take longer.

Outlook

Hence, we increase opex for FY24/25 by average 4% and lower PAT by 2.3%. Rolling forward to Mar’25 ABV, we slightly tweak our multiple to 2.2x from 2.3x but raise TP to Rs1,140 from Rs1,100. Retain ‘BUY’.

HDFC Securities' research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank (AXSB) reported a one-time loss from accounting for its merger with Citi Bank’s India consumer business, ex of which it delivered a beat, led by strong loan growth (+16% YoY standalone), healthy fee income and lower credit costs (22bps annualised). NIMs moderated marginally (-4bps QoQ) on account of excess liquidity on the balance sheet (LCR at 129%) and catch-up in funding costs following accelerated deposit mobilisation. That said, the loan-to-deposit ratio (~89%) continues to remain high and we believe AXSB will have to further accelerate efforts to match its targeted loan growth (management has guided for loan growth of 400-600bps above industry), which is likely to impede medium term NIMs.



Outlook

We tweak our FY24/FY25E earnings estimates by +3% each to adjust for normalised credit costs and higher opex on continued investments in growth. Maintain BUY with a revised SOTP-based target price of INR1,130 (standalone bank at 2.0x Mar-25 ABVPS).

Sharekhan's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank reported a loss of Rs. 5,728 crore in Q4FY23 on the back of one-time non-recurring items aggregating to Rs. 12,490 crores comprising of (a) full amortization of Intangibles and Goodwill in relation to the purchase consideration paid for acquisition of Citibank India’s Consumer Business; (b) amount charged towards policy harmonization on operating expenses and provisions for Citi business and (c) one-time stamp duty charges paid on the acquisition. Adjusted for non-recurring items, the bank reported PAT of Rs. 6,625 (up 61% y-o-y/ 13% q-o-q) mainly driven by lower credit cost ( only ~15 bps annualized) which was higher than street expectations however on the operational front, bank reported lower than expected PPoP at Rs. 9,168 crore (up 42% y-o-y/ down 1% q-o-q). NIMs were broadly stable q-o-q at 4.22% versus expectations of higher margins trajectory along with higher opex growth (14% y-o-y/ 9% q-o-q) led to weaker performance on operational front than expectations. Overall YoY and QoQ numbers are not comparable due to inclusion of Citi business numbers w.e.f March 01, 2023. Ex. Citi portfolio, deposit growth (+7% q-o-q) sequentially has picked up driven by healthy CASA traction in line with loan growth (+7% q-o-q) which is a key positive. The bank is broadly delivering performance closer to its frontline peers. Strong retail deposits mobilisation remains the key monitorables going forward.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,140. Stock currently trades at 1.7x/1.5x/1.4x its FY2024E/FY2025E core BV estimates.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank (AXSB) reported a loss of INR57.3b led by an exceptional item of INR123.5b (net of tax) towards Citi’s acquisition, policy harmonization and other related costs. Excluding these one-offs, adjusted PAT came in at INR66.3b (+61% YoY, 10% beat), largely driven by a sharp reduction in provisions. NII/PPoP witnessed a miss with margin moderating 4bp QoQ to 4.22% (almost flat on an adjusted basis) in 4QFY23. Loan growth was healthy at 16% YoY and 7% QoQ (ex-Citi), fueled by strong growth across segments. Deposit growth too was healthy with an increase in CASA and retail deposits during the quarter. Fresh slippages moderated to INR33.8b, which coupled with healthy recoveries and upgrades led to an improvement in asset quality ratios. Restructured book was under control at 0.22% of customer assets in 4QFY23.



Outlook

We tweak our estimates slightly and expect AXSB to deliver RoA/RoE of 1.9%/ 18.1% in FY25. Retain BUY with a TP of INR1,100 (based on 1.8x Sep’24E BV).

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) severely cracked down on the MD and independent directors of Karvy Stock Broking Limited (KSBL), marking an inflection point in the stock market scam that siphoned off crores in investor wealth and also prompted deep and structural investor reforms.

The Karvy demat scam, when it came under the public glare, raised thorny issues of regulatory failure and brought to the fore embarrassing shortfalls in SEBI's scope of supervision. One can gauge the gravity and critical attention accorded to this issue from the recent comment of SEBI chief Madhabi Puri Buch, who emphatically spelt out that another Karvy-like event will happen over the regulator's dead body.

In an order delivered by Whole Time Member SK Mohanty, the market regulator has directed Karvy Realty (India) Limited and Karvy Capital Limited, two subsidiaries of KSBL, that were beneficiaries of illegal transfers from their parent company to return an amount of Rs 1,442.95 crore within three months. If the two beneficiary companies fail in returning the transferred funds, NSE has been directed to take control of assets of the two companies, in order to recover the amount. The aforementioned funds were transferred out of KSBL between FY17 and FY20.

The market regulator has also penalised KSBL and its MD Comandur Parthasarathy to the tune of Rs 13 crore and Rs 8 crore respectively for violations of several SEBI circulars and regulations. It has also barred KSBL and Parthasarathy from accessing the securities and dealing in securities, in any manner, for a period of seven years.

Independent directors of the company, namely, Bhagwan Das Narang and Jyothi Prasad have also been penalised to pay an amount of Rs 5 lakh. Both of them have also been restrained from holding the post of director, or any key managerial position or associating themselves in any capacity with any listed public company and any public company for a period of two years.

Lastly, CEO Rajiv Ranjan Singh, who was found to have acted negligently and failed in exercising due diligence has been cautioned and has been directed ""to be careful before associating himself as a director or any key managerial position in any intermediary of the securities market or any listed public company"".

The Karvy demat scam, which first came to light in the second half of 2019, was orchestrated by the brokerage house by pledging securities lying in the demat account of unsuspecting customers. The pledging, which happened behind the customer's back, was done to raise funds from banks and other NBFCs. Loans were raised from the likes of HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, Aditya Birla Finance and others.

In September 2016, KSBL’s outstanding borrowing under the loan against securities (LAS) facility offered by banks stood at Rs 789.41 crore, with the overall borrowing standing at Rs 1,051.36 crore. The said overall borrowing of KSBL increased to Rs 2,032.67 crore by September 30, 2019.

Simultaneously, there was a substantial increase in the pledging of securities by KSBL. The value of securities pledged increased from Rs 202 crore on June 30, 2017, to Rs 1,855 crore by March 2018 and had further increased to Rs 2,700 crore by September 2019.

The regulator also found out that as on September 05, 2019, at least 75 percent of the total shares in all its clients’ holdings were pledged by KSBL to borrow funds for its own use, which included cases where the clients’ holdings were pledged despite such clients having credit balances in their accounts maintained with KSBL.

""The massive asset mobilization drive followed by raising of huge sums of funds from financial institutions by using the securities mobilized from the clients with a promise to pay them interest and misappropriating those funds...speak a tell-tale story of fraud driven by the greed of KSBL and its management to amass thousands of crore of rupees at the cost of its innocent clients, making it a fit case where SEBI needs to send out a firm message to deter the stock brokers and their managements from indulging in such acts of unethical, unfair and fraudulent behaviour as observed in this case,"" the WTM observed in its order.",747,-0.9631926536560058

Shares of Axis Bank slipped over 2 percent in early trade on April 28, a day after the private lender reported a net loss of Rs 5,728.42 crore for the fourth quarter of FY23, largely on account of costs incurred on buying Citi Bank's India consumer business.

The lender reported an exceptional item of Rs 12,489.82 crore during the March FY23 quarter. This exceptional item included the cost of acquiring the business assets and liabilities of Citibank's India consumer business from Citibank NA, as well as the NBFC consumer business from Citicorp Finance (India).

If we exclude this exceptional item, the profit for the quarter would have been Rs 6,625.29 crore, a 61 percent growth from Rs 4,117.77 crore in the same period last year.

Total deposits for the quarter also grew by 15 percent year-on-year to Rs 9.46 lakh crore, while advances increased by 19 percent to Rs 8.45 lakh crore.

The lender's profit was further bolstered by a significant decrease in provisions and contingencies, which dropped by 69 percent on year to Rs 305.77 crore. Sequentially, the decline was even more substantial at 79 percent.

At 10.04 am, shares of Axis Bank were trading 1.95 percent lower at Rs 864.25 on the National Stock Exchange.

Here's what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after the Q4 earnings report:

Macquarie

Global research and broking firm Macquarie has given Axis Bank an “outperform” rating with a target of Rs 940 a share. It, however, says that growth needs to pick up, as losses were as expected.

The firm also believes that credit costs are driving Return on Assets (RoA) for the lender. The bank has prioritised margin over loan growth, which Macquarie has taken note of.

Macquarie also suggests closely monitoring the full impact of the Citibank acquisition on the lender’s performance in FY24.

Also Read: Axis Bank Q4 results: Top four highlights from the earnings report

Jefferies

Jefferies has given a “buy” rating for Axis Bank with a target of Rs 1,150 a share. The broking firm is positive on the bank's Q4 results and says it shows strong core performance, with potential for better growth.

The firm also notes that despite the one-time write-off of goodwill and costs for the Citibank acquisition, core profits rose for the lender.

Though NIM was down, Jefferies says better liquidity can help lift loan growth. The broking firm also highlights that the bank's asset quality remains robust, with CET1 (Common Equity Tier 1) at 14 percent.

Jefferies has raised profit estimates by 2-3 percent and sees potential for the valuation to re-rate.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services

Motilal Oswal Financial Services also highlighted that Axis Bank had a steady performance in the fourth quarter of FY23, with lower provisions and higher fee income driving earnings.

""Asset quality continued to improve, with fewer slippages and positive trends in recoveries and upgrades,"" the broking firm says in its report.

The restructured book was under control, which when coupled with a higher provisioning buffer, gave investors confidence in credit costs.

MOFSL has retained “buy” rating for Axis Bank, with a target price of Rs 1,100.

Nuvama Institutional Equities

In contrast, Nuvama Institutional Equities says Axis Bank reported a weak quarter with too many merger adjustments and a miss on core earnings.

But, as the stock trades at a discount to peers, Nuvama says it makes its risk-reward attractive. The broking firm also sees pressure on Axis Bank's operational expenditures from Citi’s integration and also on NIMs from higher cost of funds.

Nonetheless, cheap valuations support Nuvama's reasoning to retain a “buy” rating on the stock, with a price target of Rs 1,100.

Axis Bank, India’s fourth-largest private sector bank by market capitalisation, is expected to report a 39.7 percent year-on-year rise in net profit — sans extraordinary expenses — when it releases its March quarter numbers on April 27, according to a Moneycontrol poll of three brokerages.

The bank is otherwise expected to report a loss of Rs 5,487 crore in the quarter due to the integration with Citibank. If the extraordinary expenses are excluded, the bank's net profit is seen rising 39 percent to Rs 5,784 crore.

The brokerage house Prabhudas Lilladher expects Axis Bank to report a net profit of Rs 5,902.9 crore, up 43.4 percent year-on-year (up 0.9 percent quarter-on-quarter). Net Interest Income (NII) is expected to increase 40.8 percent Y-o-Y (up 8.3 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs 12,415.8 crore. Pre Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) is likely to rise by 46.2 percent Y-o-Y (up 1.9 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs. 9,452.6 crore.

Brokerage house Kotak Institutional Equities expects Axis Bank to report net profit of Rs 6,492.2 crore, up 56 percent year-on-year (up 9.7 percent quarter-on-quarter). Net Interest Income (NII) is expected to increase by 39.7 percent year on year (YoY) (up 7.5 percent QoQ) to Rs 12,015.8 crore. Pre-Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) is likely to rise by 51.2 percent YoY (up 5.4 percent QoQ).

The brokerage house ICICIdirect expects Axis Bank to report a net profit of Rs 4,959.2 crore up 20.4 percent year on year (down 15.3 percent quarter on quarter). Net Interest Income (NII) is expected to increase 33.1 percent YoY (up 2.5 percent QoQ) to Rs 11,742.8 crore. Pre Provision Operating Profit (PPOP) is likely to rise by 34 percent YoY (down 6.6 percent QoQ) to Rs 8,667 crore.

Kotak Institutional Equities said that “4QFY23 is not a representative of the underlying business as it includes the integration of Citi's business in the portfolio from March, 2023. The bank would be reporting a loss to mark down the goodwill on this acquisition. We expect a like-for-like loan growth to be similar to industry average at ~15% YoY. We are building NIM to be flat QoQ but the variables driving the actual NII performance would be challenging to forecast this quarter.”

“We expect slippages of ~Rs40 bn (~2% of loans) mostly led by small ticket loans. Expect strong commentary on asset quality performance and we see an improvement in NPL ratios aided by stronger recovery/upgradations. We should expect the bank to make higher provisions for expenses pertaining to the merger as well. Citi integration, near term growth trends and progress of NIM would be the key discussion areas for the quarter.”

Acquisition of Citibank’s retail business

In March 2023, Axis Bank said it had completed the acquisition of Citibank’s retail business in India for a final cash consideration of Rs 11,603 crore. Last year, the lender agreed to purchase Citibank’s India Consumer Business from Citibank NA (acting through its branch in India) and the NBFC Consumer Business from Citicorp Finance (India) Limited (CFIL).

Axis, which has a retail book of nearly Rs 4 lakh crore, has acquired about 3 million unique customers of Citibank India, seven offices, 21 branches and 499 ATMs across 18 cities. Citi’s retail book is nearly Rs 68,000 crore in size, of which retail loans account for Rs 28,000 crore. With 1.2 million bank accounts, the total Indian business contributes 1.5 percent in profit to the lender’s global book.",567,0.7143862247467041

Axis Bank, one of India’s largest private banks, is gearing up to launch a new consumer-facing buyers’ platform built on top of India’s Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) framework as it looks to strengthen its e-commerce forays amid a push from the government for deeper penetration of the open network, which is billed to be the UPI (unified payments interface) of digital commerce.

Axis has already designed the platform and will be launching it as a part of its e-commerce segment called Grab Deals, people aware of the matter told Moneycontrol. The platform will initially have only groceries, but will soon expand to other segments, the people said requesting anonymity. The platform will be going live soon and it will be launched in select cities initially, according to the people. Moneycontrol has seen internal documents of the new application.

“Grab Deals has been a part of Axis for some time now and as a part of this new project, the company is revamping the entire Grab Deals platform. While there’s no separate application for Grab Deals yet, Axis will be launching it soon,” said one of the people quoted above.

“The ONDC for groceries will still remain integrated even after Grab Deals goes live on app stores and going forward, the company might launch a separate app for the ONDC platform, too,” the person added.

Axis Bank’s move to launch a new buyers’ hyperlocal application on ONDC comes just a couple of weeks after Walmart-backed PhonePe, India’s most-valued fintech startup, launched a new application called Pincode with a focus on hyperlocal commerce. Axis Bank is also a shareholder in ONDC and holds roughly 8 percent stake.

Axis Bank did not comment on the story.

Besides PhonePe, fintech unicorn Paytm currently has an ONDC platform integrated into its main application. ONDC is an initiative of the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) under the Ministry of Commerce.

ONDC’s rollout started with limited pincodes in Bengaluru last September. So far, apart from Paytm and PhonePe, IDFC, Mystore, Craftsvilla and Spice Money are all buyer-side applications.

The platform takes no money from the government but is funded by banks including State Bank of India, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank, among others.

In March, ONDC expanded into mobility as well apart from food, grocery and e-commerce, as the network onboarded Namma Yatri onto the platform. While two cities are in ONDC’s beta stage, 181 are in the alpha stage.

Earlier this month, at a press conference in New Delhi, T Koshy, CEO of ONDC said the platform has been able to find 37 network participants. The platform is currently working with over 26,000 merchants, offering more than 27 lakh products on its network.",478,0.9906562268733978

Osho Krishan, Senior Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One

The financial year 2022 bid adieu on a positive note as the benchmark index finally made headway to emerge from the slumber phase on the very last day of the year. Despite all the whipsaw moves throughout the week, the Nifty50 index concluded on a positive note, gaining nearly 2.50 percent from its previous close and settling a tad above the 17,350 level on March 31.

Technically speaking, the last two trading sessions construe positive developments and it is highly anticipated to continue the cheerful run in the upcoming financial year. The broad-based buying has levitated market sentiments and can be seen as a sign of progression as we emerged from the slumber phase.

As far as levels are concerned, the bullish gap of the 17,200-17,130 odd zone is expected to cushion any short-term blip, with the sacrosanct support placed around the psychological mark of 17,000 for the time being. While on the higher end, a decisive move beyond the bearish gap of 17,450-17,580 would affirm the trend reversal in the market.

Going forward, we remain sanguine with the current momentum and would advocate the traders to utilize the dips to add long positions in the index in the comparable period.

Here are two buy calls with short-term view:

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 858.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 828 | Target: Rs 892-900 | Return: 5 percent

Axis Bank has seen a decisive spurt in the last two trading sessions, backed by notable volumes on the daily chart, signifying positive development in the counter.

On a technical aspect, the stock is on the verge of a ‘double bottom’ breakout, which is being supported by a positive crossover on the 14-day RSI, adding to the bullish quotient.

Hence, we recommend to buy Axis Bank in the range of Rs 855-858, for a target of Rs 892-900.

TVS Motor Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,077.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,030 | Target: Rs 1,120-1,130 | Return: 5 percent

TVS Motor is in a secular uptrend and hovers well above all its EMAs (exponential moving averages) on the daily chart. The stock has recently seen some buying traction and emerged above the sloping trendline on the daily time frame, adding to a bullish quotient.

The primary indicators align with the trend suggesting a continuation in the movement in a comparable period. Hence, we recommend to buy TVS Motor Company with a target of Rs 1,120-1,130.

A veteran who spent over two decades at Credit Suisse, Mishra is considered one of the foremost experts on the global economy.

According to a Bloomberg report, the Indian Institute of Technology graduate recently resigned as co-head of Asia Pacific strategy and head of securities research at Credit Suisse Group AG and is set to lead Axis Bank’s research department.

Why did Mishra quit Credit Suisse? Mishra declined to comment. However, there is speculation that Mishra’s exit from the second-largest lender in Switzerland is part of a large-scale talent exodus from the bank on account of organisational problems.

For Axis, this is part of chief executive officer Amitabh Chaudhry’s plans to bolster businesses including the wealth management and investment banking business of the lender, according to Bloomberg. Experts said Mishra’s entry could benefit Axis in the long run.

Axis hiring

“Mishra’s strength of the organisation that he's worked for 20-plus years is really positive. And it will add to the capabilities of Axis companies, whether he joins the bank, whether he joins the mutual fund, or Axis Securities. So, it will add actually strength to the existing team,” a former banker said on condition of anonymity.

Zurich-based Credit Suisse lost many senior employees as a result of recent scandals, leadership changes, and legal issues. Axis Mutual Fund hired Ashish Gupta as its chief investment officer earlier this month, according to an exchange filing. Gupta was previously Credit Suisse's head of India equity research. Gupta left Credit Suisse in November, after about 14 years.

“Chaudhry, in the last three and half years, has been hiring some of the best talent across the board,” a former banker said, adding that now Axis is one of the top banks by credit quality, credit growth or any other business metric.

UBS Group AG, Switzerland's largest banking group, agreed to acquire the crisis-hit Credit Suisse Group AG in a historic, government-brokered deal. UBS will pay 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.23 billion) for 167-year-old Credit Suisse and assume up to $5.4 billion in losses, Reuters reported.

Mishra is part of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India and has been an advisor to several committees, including the 15th Finance Commission and the India Semiconductor Mission, according to Credit Suisse’s website.

Currently based in Mumbai with previous positions in Singapore and Taipei, Mishra also advises businesses and has been part of the Economic Affairs Council of the Confederation of Indian Industry for the past few years.

Mishra is a gold medallist from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, graduating in computer science and engineering. He was presented with a Distinguished Alumnus Award, the highest award given by IIT to its alumni in recognition of their achievements.

“Mishra will not face any major challenge – whatever he was doing in an MNC company he will do at an Indian company. He is a capable person, and he will be able to manage it very well,” said AK Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital.",526,0.659079243739446

Axis Bank is “absolutely in no hurry” to raise capital after completing the Citibank deal as the private lender “has sufficient capital for funding organic growth”, managing director and chief executive officer Amitabh Chaudhry said on March 8.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Chaudhry also said valuation for Axis Bank’s acquisition of Citi remained competitive and that the price paid “is around the market valuations”.

“Citibank had a 150-year-old franchise, and the valuations remain very competitive. The deal is well priced if you look at the similarly rated companies in the marketplace. We don’t need any capital to pay for this deal. This will be funded entirely from the existing balance sheet,” he added.

Chaudhary’s comments come after the Mumbai-headquartered bank completed the acquisition of Citigroup’s India consumer business for Rs 11,603 crore on March 1, 2023.

The private lender gained Citibank’s 30 lakh unique customers, seven offices, 21 branches and 499 ATMs in 18 cities across the country.

Citigroup has exited retail operations in 13 markets, including India.

Huge Opportunity

Chaudhry sees the Citi acquisition as a “huge opportunity to leverage synergy benefits” and take Axis Bank products to Citi customers and “bring some of Citi’s best practices to Axis customers”.

“We will improve the overall current account savings account (CASA) ratio of the entity; 60 various initiatives has been identified which will improve the quality of the overall franchise. Average deposit per account will improve by 13 percent,” he said.

The combination of the two would add a huge amount of value. There were also various cost benefits from the acquisition of Citibank's retail assets in India. The integration of these assets with Axis Bank would bring significant value to the business, he added.

One such advantage, he said, was that 97 percent of Citi employees joined Axis Bank. “This will ensure a smooth transition and help in retaining the talent pool of Citibank,” Chaudhary said.

Stock Movement

At 12.19 pm Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 858.10 on the BSE, down Rs 1.35, or 0.16 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 860.80 and an intraday low of Rs 853.10.

In the previous trading session, the share closed up 0.75 percent or Rs 6.40 at Rs 859.45. The stock remained flat in the previous week and declined around a percent in the past month.

Axis Bank is the third largest private sector bank in India with a balance sheet size of Rs 12.2 lakh crore as on December 2022. The bank has a 4,849 branch footprint across the country. Retail and SME comprise around 67 percent of its total loans.

Sharekhan's research report on Blue Star

Further, increase in off-take from channel partners for the summer and improving demand for energy efficient models with smart features are encouraging signs. Performance will be aided by commencement of new AC manufacturing facility. Blue Star’s long-term growth would be driven by favourable demand, market share gains, backward integration and deepening of penetration (launch of affordable mass premium products) and expansion of distribution network through conventional and e-commerce channels. It will be further aided by healthy execution in the project business. The company has low debt, low working capital cycle and healthy operating cash flows. We expect Revenue/PAT CAGR of 19%/34% over FY23-25E. At CMP, the stock trades at ~29xFY25E EPS.

Outlook

We maintain a Buy on Blue Star Limited (Blue Star) with a revised PT of Rs. 1,655, as we envisage boost in sales for RACs and refrigeration products based on prediction of a harsh and elongated summer.

Sharekhan's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank has completed the acquisition of Citibank`s India consumer business and the deal is valued at Rs. 11,603 crore vs earlier disclosed acquisition price of Rs. 12,325 crore driven by some final adjustments. Tier-1 ratio would decline by ~180 bps after this transaction and the bank has indicated that it has comfortable CET-1 levels (~13.78%) to grow without any disruption. Bank is not expecting to approach the market anytime soon for equity capital raise. Management commentary did not suggest any further steep deterioration in customer retention and employee attrition going ahead but it remains a key monitorable from here on. We believe Citi business would be ROE Neutral in FY24 & FY25 for Axis Bank while ROE accretive starting from FY26E and it brings strong value proposition for the existing franchise. The stock currently trades at 1.6x/1.4x/ its FY2024E/FY2025E core BV estimates.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,140.

Private lender Axis Bank may experience a significant profit and loss impact in the March quarter due to the Citibank acquisition, The Economic Times reported on March 3 citing analysts.

This is estimated to result in an accounting loss of Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 6,000 crore due to various one-time expenses such as goodwill formation and provisioning policies, as per the report.

""The cash purchase consideration will result in the formation of goodwill which Axis Bank will be writing off entirely in Q4,"" Suresh Ganapathy, associate director at Macquarie Capital, told ET.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

The analysts also said that the acquisition is not expected to be profit accretive until the end of 2024 as the bank is expected to incur post-integration expenses of Rs 1,500 crore over 18 months.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis-Citi deal concluded on 1stMarch’23 for a consideration of Rs116bn. While acquired asset portfolio at Rs273bn was largely intact (post deal announcement in Mar’22), deposits saw a rundown of Rs102bn to Rs399bn. Hence the deal value saw Rs7.2bn reduction. Capital consumption was lower at 177bps than expected 230bps, hence AXSB’s CET-I ratio would be higher at ~14% by Q4FY23 (estimate ~13%) providing cushion for future growth. Although a <=15% loan CAGR (our estimates) could be self-funded, growing at 20% entail a capital raise. Immediate benefits of acquisition include addition of superior quality CC portfolio (Rs89bn) coupled with CASA boost of 150bps.

Outlook

We expect this business to turn profitable by H2FY25E given (i) post-tax integration costs of Rs15bn and (ii) opex optimization would happen only post integration. As change in FY23E/24E/25E PAT is ~1%, our multiple/TP basis Sep’24ABV are unchanged at 2.3x/Rs1,100. Retain ‘BUY’.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on AXIS Bank

Axis Bank has announced completion (earlier than expected) of the acquisition of Citi Bank’s retail banking business at a relatively lower cost, given the run-down in the business since Mar-22. The expensing of acquisition cost (including goodwill) would hurt the 4QFY23 P/L as also the networth (NW) of Axis Bank, but should provide a boost to the bank’s retail assets growth and also be RoE accretive, given the higher leverage. Key takeaways from the call and our view: The overall acquired deposits base has meaningfully reduced by 21% to Rs399bn (77% being CASA) as at end Feb-23 from Rs502bn in Mar-22, mainly due to Citi customers choosing not to port to Axis Bank. Management believes that this could be due to some customers consolidating their banking relationship, while some have moved to other banks. We believe this could be partly owing to some corporate customers, including MNCs, moving their banking relationship (including employee salary accounts). In our view, the interest outgo on Citi’s retained savings-customers would go up, as Axis’s SA rate is higher at 3-3.5% vs Citi’s 2.5%.

Outlook

We believe the higher deposit run-down, coupled with optically higher loss in 4Q, could weigh on the stock performance. However, we remain long-term positive on the stock, given its improving retail orientation/core profitability, healthy provisioning buffer and reasonable valuations. We retain BUY, with revised TP of Rs1,250/share (based on 2x Dec-24E un-merged standalone bank ABV or 2.1x Dec-24E proforma merged standalone bank ABV + subsidiaries’ value at Rs80 per share).

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB has completed the acquisition of Citibank India's consumer banking business for a cash consideration of ~INR116b. The deal includes the credit card, wealth and retail banking operations of both Citibank India and Citicorp Finance. It has acquired loans/deposits worth INR273b/INR399b, including the credit card book of INR86b. AXSB’s credit card book has increased by 42% to INR292b. Wealth management AUM has risen ~33% to INR3.8t, making it the third largest player by combined AUM. AXSB has added ~2.4m unique customers, complemented by Citibank's affluent customer segment, and gained access to 21 branches and 459 ATMs. It has retained 3,200 Citibank employees. While the overall synergies in terms of cost savings will start to accrue from CY24, the bank will take a one-time hit in its 4QFY23 P&L related to 1) charge-off of Goodwill and other intangibles, 2) policy harmonization cost, and 3) implementation expenses. Thus, the CET I ratio is likely to moderate by ~177bp to ~13.8%. In the long term, the deal’s success would depend on how well AXSB is able to cross-sell its entire bouquet of banking products to Citi customers and gain from Citi’s well recognized digital and operation processes.



Outlook

Factoring in the one-time charge-off and other costs and profitability, we estimate RoA/RoE of 1.9%/17.6% by FY25. We have a Buy rating on AXSB with a TP of INR1,130 (2.0x Sep’24E P/ABV for the standalone bank).

Axis Bank has completed the acquisition of Citibank’s consumer business in an accelerated time frame of within seven months after receipt of approval from the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The deal has been closed with Axis Bank paying a total purchase consideration of Rs 11,603 crore to Citibank India. Axis Bank welcomes the 30 lakh plus customers of Citibank.

Let’s decode what Axis Bank and Citibank customers gained from this deal.

What was the transaction all about?

The transaction comprises the sale of the consumer businesses of Citibank India, which includes loans, credit cards, wealth management and retail banking operations to Axis Bank. The deal also includes the sale of the consumer business of Citi’s non-banking financial company, Citicorp Finance (India) Limited, comprising asset-backed financing business, which includes commercial vehicle and construction equipment loans, as well as the personal loans portfolio.

“The bank has gained access to the large, affluent and profitable customer franchise of Citibank, which aligns well with its premiumisation strategy,” says Amitabh Chaudhry, MD & CEO, Axis Bank. He adds, the premium portfolio and business synergies through this deal will help accelerate and add further momentum to the bank’s already robust plans across priority segments.

Axis Bank improves market share in the cards business

Axis Bank’s position in the cards business improved from 11.4 percent to 16.2 percent. It bagged a quality credit card franchise with one of the highest wallet shares in premium cards.

After this acquisition, Axis Bank expects a healthy accretion to the existing card base. Axis Bank sees 19 percent growth in outstanding cards. Combining both the entities, the outstanding cards are 1.12 crore, as per RBI data for April 2022 to January 2023. The combined annual spending per card is set to increase by around 10 percent.

“With the highest number of transactions per card across the industry and digitally engaged customers, the deal would strengthen Axis Bank’s position in the top eight metros,” says Chaudhry. He adds, it also provides the opportunity to adopt global best practices in client servicing and operations through Citi Phone banking.

Axis Bank gets access to highly affluent wealth customers

From today, Axis Bank gains ready access to highly affluent wealth customers, resulting in a 33 percent addition to the overall AUM of Burgundy Private Banking portfolio, further strengthening the existing franchise. With an added AUM of Rs 94,700 crore across Citi products in wealth management and private banking, the current AUM of the bank’s wealth management portfolio stands at Rs 3,78,500 crore, making it the third-largest by combined AUM in the industry. There is a huge potential to cross-sell Axis Bank’s product offerings to Citi’s affluent customer base.

Benefits for Citibank customers

Citi customers will continue to enjoy the same benefits and privileges with no changes in their existing bank account numbers, credit and debit card numbers, cheque books, IFSC and MICR codes. Citi customers will continue to avail all the rewards, privileges and offers on the cards.

The Citi branding and logo will continue on the existing cards. Those will phase out during the transition period in the next 12 to 18 months.

“The credit card portfolio of Axis Bank varies from Citi, so there is no overlapping of features and benefits. Considering this, we don’t have any plans to merge or discontinue any existing credit cards,” says Arjun Chowdhry, Group Executive & Head of Cards, Payments & Wealth, Axis Bank.

Citi customers will continue to be serviced by the same relationship managers and teams for investments and insurance.

The bank said that all the 21 branches of Citi ""remain fully equipped to serve the incoming customers. All the services to the incoming customers will continue to function as before"", as existing employees move from Citi to Axis.

Axis Bank, India’s third largest private sector bank, on March 1 said it has retained Citibank's 3,200 consumer banking employees post the acquisition, said Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Axis Bank.

The bank made offers to all 3,600 employees of Citibank but 400 employees didn’t accept the offer, said Arjun Chowdhry, Group Executive and Head, Cards, Payments and Wealth, Axis Bank.

During the announcement of the acquisition, Axis Bank had said that it would welcome all the 3,600 employees of Citibank's consumer banking.

""An offer was made to all the employees. It was a voluntary choice from the employees to not agree to the contract,"" Chowdry said.

On March 1, 2023, the bank on Twitter put out an advertisement welcoming Citibank employee.

The retained employees will be working in the same department, managing their existing customers and everything around that would be same, only the brand name would be Axis Bank and not Citi Bank, said Subrat Mohanty, Group Executive and Head, Banking Operations and Transformation, Axis Bank.

The bank paid Rs 11,603 crore for the acquisition announced last year in March. The sale excludes Citi's institutional client businesses in India.

Axis Bank is the fourth-largest issuer of credit cards with a total base of 8.6 million cards and the deal will add about 2.5 million credit cardholders, making it one of the top three cards businesses in the country.

Last year, Axis Bank agreed to purchase Citibank's India Consumer Business from Citibank NA (acting through its branch in India) and the NBFC Consumer Business from Citicorp Finance (India) Limited (CFIL), as going concerns, without values being assigned to individual assets and liabilities to either business.

This was subject to fulfilment of specific conditions and obtaining requisite approvals at a total purchase consideration up to Rs 12,325 crore.

Axis, which has a retail book of nearly Rs 4 lakh crore, has acquired about 3 million unique customers of Citibank India, seven offices, 21 branches and 499 ATMs across 18 cities.

Citi's retail book is nearly Rs 68,000 crore, of which retail loans account for Rs 28,000 crore. With 1.2 million bank accounts, the total India business contributes 1.5 per cent in profit to the lender's global book.

Apart from the institutional banking business, it will continue to focus on offshoring or global business support rendered from centres in Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Chennai and Gurugram.

In April 2021, American banking major Citigroup announced its plan to exit from the consumer banking business in India as part of its global strategy.

The business comprises credit cards, retail banking, home loans and wealth management. The bank has 35 branches in the country and employs about 4,000 people in the consumer banking business.

Axis Bank has completed the acquisition of Citibank’s consumer business. The deal, announced in March 2022, will see India’s third largest private sector bank absorbing Citibank’s consumer businesses covering loans, credit cards, wealth management and retail banking operations in India.

Axis Bank, on March 1, put out a video advertisement to welcome the 30 lakh plus customers of Citibank. “Finding the familiar in the new, is a wonderful thing. Welcome to a dil se open world that feels less new, more you,” Axis Bank tweeted on March 1.

Citibank has now put out a list of answers to customers’ common queries about the transition process. Let’s decode its responses to queries around Citi’s existing products, services, charges, and more.

I have an account with Citibank. Will my bank account details remain the same after this transfer to Axis Bank?

Yes, you can continue using your Citi account for now without any changes in the account number, IFSC / MICR codes, debit card, cheque book, fees and charges. In case of any changes in future, Axis Bank will notify the customers.

“There is going to be a slow transition for a select set of customers from Citi to Axis Bank. That’s a good thing. Otherwise, there would have been a disruption for Citi customers,” says Parijat Garg, a digital lending consultant.

Will I be able to access Axis Bank ATMs after the transfer date, i.e., March 1, 2023?

Yes, you will be able to access any Axis Bank ATM after the transfer date. The number of free transactions currently available to you at Citibank ATMs will be extended to Axis Bank ATMs as well. Any charges currently applicable over and above free transactions at Citibank ATMs will be charged on transactions at Axis Bank ATMs too.

At Axis Bank ATMs you can avail the following services ― balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, PIN change, and mobile number update.

Will Axis Bank continue with Citigold ‘Global Banking Privileges’ for credit card customers after the transfer?

The Citigold Global Banking Privileges include bank account opening service if you are relocating to another country. If you are a frequent international traveller then you get attractive deals at hotel, retail shops, restaurants and access to lounges worldwide. You can even withdraw up to $10,000 instantly from your account as emergency cash while traveling.

Now, after the transfer to Axis Bank, these global banking privileges will cease.

“Ceasing this facility will affect only a small portion of Citi customers because not all customers require these global services while travelling abroad,” says Garg.

“The premium card of Axis Bank has similar benefits. So, Citi customers can apply for those credit cards,” says Raj Khosla, MD, MyMoneyMantra.com.

I have a Citi NRI bank account. Should I expect any changes?

After this transfer, existing NRI deposits (NRE/NRO/FCNR) will continue to earn interest as per rates they were earning on their Citi deposits. But, any new NRI deposits will be as per prevailing Axis Bank rates. The revised SWIFT code for foreign currency inward and outward transactions will be AXISINBB.

You can download the interest certificate and tax deducted at source (TDS) certificate from Citibank Online to determine the amount of interest earned and the amount of tax deducted, respectively.

My investments include mutual fund units, portfolio management service (PMS) and alternate investment funds (AIF) with Citi. What changes should I expect?

Effective March 1, your investments in mutual funds, PMS or AIF will be transferred to Axis Bank (ARN 0019). You can continue to access your investment portfolio and transact in your investment account through bank branches / relationship managers / Citibank online, and mobile banking. Your existing investor risk rating will continue to be valid until its expiry date.

However, you will have to brace up for one key change. You will get access to research reports, product information and investment communication that will be in line with Axis Bank’s house views and policies, instead of Citibank’s.

I had taken my insurance policies through Citibank. What will be the impact on these policies?

Axis Bank will continue to service the insurance policies taken through Citi after the transfer.

The insurance coverage provided by the insurer will continue as it is after this transfer, provided you pay the insurance premiums as and when due.

There will be no change in the premium being paid as a result of this transition because insurance premiums are decided by the insurance company. The insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and you. The bank is merely a distributor between you and the insurance company.

I am using Citibank credit cards. Will there be any change in earning rewards, redemption process, billing cycle and fees for credit cards after the transfer to Axis Bank?

According to Axis Bank, there will be no change in the earning rewards and redemption process after this transfer. Your reward points across Citi credit cards will continue to accrue and remain available for use.

There will be no change in fees, interest charges, billing cycle, payment due date, and bill payment methods for Citi credit cards.

All your standing instructions given to Citi with regard to loan payments, bill payments, or any other account transfer will continue after March 1 as well.

The private sector bank seems to be putting in efforts to make the process of transition as smooth as possible for Citibank customers.

“Axis Bank will go the extra mile to keep Citi customers happy with their customer services, rewards program on credit cards and other services,” says Khosla.

I have an ongoing dispute with Citi credit card related to an outstanding amount. What I should do now?

If you have some disputes related to an outstanding amount or late payment charges with Citi, then clear them soon and make sure your credit history is clean. Once the transition between Citi and Axis Bank gets over, getting a resolution to your card complaints might be difficult and time-consuming. “An unresolved dispute may also reflect in your credit report. In the future, there could be challenges while applying for a loan,” says Garg.

What will happen to my home loan account with Citi after March 1?

If your home loan is fully or partially disbursed and you have consented to transfer it to Axis Bank, the same shall be assigned to Axis Bank. There will be no changes in the terms and conditions of existing credit facilities.

Will there be any change in the benchmark rate for my home loan with Citi after transfer of loan to Axis Bank?

If you have a home loan at Citi linked to the treasury bill-linked rate (TBLR), the same will now be moved to a repurchase agreement rate, i.e. known as a repo rate. An Axis Bank representative will contact you with the process.

If you have a home loan which is benchmarked to Citibank mortgage prime lending rate, base rate or marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR), the same will not undergo any change. In case of any change during the course of transition, Axis Bank will update the borrowers with due notice.

The acquisition of Citibank’s consumer banking business by Axis Bank was completed on February 28, initiating the rebranding of Citi branches with Axis logo.

Recently, Citibank sent messages to its existing customers saying the bank will complete the sale of consumer business to Axis on March 1, 2023. ""We are pleased to now inform you that Citi and Axis Bank will be completing the sale on March 1, 2023,"" said an SMS sent by Citi bank to its customers.

A Citibank spokesperson refused to comment on this story.

On February 25, 2023, Moneycontrol reported that Citibank has removed its signboard from its iconic Kanak building office on Kolkata's Chowringhee Road, as part of the rebranding exercise post the acquisition of its consumer business by Axis Bank in 2021.

It was in this Kolkata office that Citi, as it’s popularly known, began its India operations over a century ago, in 1902. As per the plan, some Citi branches across India will display both Citi and Axis branding, while in other places Axis will replace Citi entirely.

Last April 2021 Citi had said it would exit consumer / retail operations in 13 countries across Asia and Europe, including India. The other markets are Australia, Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.

""There is no change or impact to services at any of our branches because of this change; also, customers have been informed well in advance,"" says Citi bank's reply.

One of India’s oldest foreign lenders, Citibank has removed its signboard from its iconic Kanak building office on Kolkata's Chowringhee Road, as part of the rebranding exercise post the acquisition of its consumer business by Axis Bank in 2021.

It was in this Kolkata office that Citi, as it’s popularly known, began its India operations over a century ago, in 1902. As per the plan, some Citi branches across India will display both Citi and Axis branding, while in other places Axis will replace Citi entirely.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Citibank official confirmed that the process of rebranding had begun. Per the deal structure, the merger will come into effect from March 1, 2023.

“The existing Citi signboard at the Kanak building office will be replaced by both Citi and Axis branding. But in some branches, they have completely replaced Citi with Axis Bank,’’ said the Citi official.

In response to a Moneycontrol query, Citibank said the change in signage is a logical part of the process under the already announced transition of our consumer banking branches to Axis. ""There is no change or impact to services at any of our branches because of this change; also, customers have been informed well in advance,"" says Citi bank's reply.

Further, the bank said both banks are fully committed to a seamless transition for clients and we have assured them of the same through our earlier communication. "" Citi will continue to offer its corporate, commercial and investment banking business, as well as treasury and trade solutions to clients through its dedicated branches for the same,"" said Citi bank.

Last April, 2021 Citi had said it would exit consumer / retail operations in 13 countries across Asia and Europe, including India. The other markets are Australia, Bahrain, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.

The decision surprised customers, employees, and even some competitors of Citi in India. The bank’s employees had no inkling of the decision till the decision was announced globally.

“None of us still have a clue why this decision was taken. Personally, I think it doesn’t make sense, especially for a major market like India where the existing retail portfolio is doing well,” said a former Citi official requesting anonymity.

The Citi’s deal with Axis Bank for the sale of its consumer banking business includes credit cards, retail banking, wealth management, and consumer loans, Citigroup has said.

The transaction also includes the sale of the consumer business of Citi’s non-banking financial company, Citicorp Finance (India) Limited, which includes commercial vehicle and construction equipment loans, as well as the personal loans portfolio.",447,

Axis Bank informed the stock exchanges that the deal to acquire Citibank India’s consumer business and NBFC (non-banking financial company) business of Citicorp is expected to be completed by March 1.

“We now wish to inform you that both parties have made progress on integration and have obtained other requisite customer consents and approvals, as applicable.

Axis Bank on February 21 said it has enabled cross-border transactions in real-time using the unified payments interface (UPI) network. With this, the lender will act as the settlement bank for peer-to-peer (P2P) foreign inward remittance transactions initiated through PayNow by the Liquid Group in Singapore, the bank said in a release.

""A remitter in Singapore using the mobile application of Liquid Group (a non-bank financial institution) can now initiate a remittance by entering the UPI ID of the intended recipient in India,” the bank said.

The partnership will allow users from both countries to make seamless money transfers, Axis Bank said, adding the transactions settled through the UPI PayNow network are available 24X7 on a real-time basis.

Currently, the lender will settle these transactions to beneficiaries holding an account with or are registered on the UPI app of the six banks - the State Bank of India (SBI), Indian Overseas Bank (IOB), Indian Bank, ICICI, DBS and Axis Bank, the release said.

The cross-border UPI transaction initiative is a part of the joint initiative between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to develop cross-border payments between India and Singapore.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong on February 21 launched the cross-border linkage between the two nations using their respective Fast Payment Systems - India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Singapore's PayNow.

The facility was launched through token transactions by Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das and Monetary Authority of Singapore Managing Director Ravi Menon using the UPI-PayNow linkage.

“Launch of the UPI-PayNow linkage is a gift to the citizens of the both countries. This facility will provide low-cost and real-time option of cross-border remittances between two countries. UPI is the most preferred mechanism for payments in India,” PM Modi said at the launch.

“This interlinkage aligns with the G20’s financial inclusion priorities of driving faster, cheaper and more transparent cross-border payments and will be a significant milestone in the development of infrastructure for cross-border payments between India and Singapore,” the RBI said in a statement on the launch.",371,0.9642418424288431

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) recently published a consultation paper on the role and obligations of Mutual Fund (MF) trustees in order to address conflicts of interest among unitholders and stakeholders in asset management companies (AMCs).

In the three-tier structure of the Indian MF industry (sponsor, trustee and AMC), the Board of Trustees, or Trustee Company, holds the property of a mutual fund in trust for the benefit of unitholders.

While MF regulations provide guidelines to address conflicts of interest, there may still remain some areas that require trustees to pay specific attention to.

Potential conflicts may be investments by MF schemes in public issues of the sponsor or associates, sponsor group companies engaging in insider trading or front running by taking advantage of access to MF schemes, as well as sponsors influencing voting by MF schemes.

“An AMC is a profit-making entity. SEBI wants to ensure that there are checks and balances on them. The regulator is always worried about mutual funds because these are the most retail of all the products. The level of regulations has always been the highest amongst all the asset classes,” said Sandeep Parekh, Managing Partner at Finsec Law Advisors.

Here are the key proposals made by the capital market regulator.

SEBI assigns KRAs to trustees

Over a period of time, the regulator has cast various responsibilities over the trustees to ensure that AMCs act in a manner that is not skewed in favour of AMC stakeholders.

In its latest proposal, SEBI wants trustees to be given more power to focus on certain “core responsibilities.”

These include ensuring the fairness of fees and expenses charged by the AMC and monitoring the performance of the schemes against peers/ benchmarks.

Trustees are also expected to investigate alleged misconduct, including market abuse/misuse of information by the AMC and undue influence by sponsors or associates.

Presently, the trustees primarily rely on the AMCs for ensuring compliance with regulations and to confirm compliance in periodic reporting to SEBI.

SEBI is of the opinion that it is crucial that the trustees independently evaluate the extent of compliance by AMCs and not merely rely on submissions /external assurances made by them.

Trustees may also be tasked to examine instances of mis-selling by AMCs to boost Assets Under Management (AUM) and their valuation.

“To ensure that trustees devote time and attention to their core responsibilities, it is felt that for fulfilling other responsibilities, trustees may rely on professional firms such as audit, legal, merchant bankers. etc, for carrying out due diligence on behalf of the trustees,” SEBI said in the paper.

Apart from these suggestions, SEBI also plans to increase the minimum number of trustees from the currently prescribed four.

Indemnity provisions

According to SEBI, upon a review of the existing indemnity provisions concerning trustees in MF regulations, and on comparison with other regulations in the Trust Act and Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), etc., it was observed that while some of the provisions in these legislation make trustees liable for negligence, MF regulations state that trustees shall not be held liable for acts done in good faith if they have exercised adequate due diligence.

The regulator is now proposing that while trustees are responsible for the acts collectively undertaken as part of the board of the company in question, they should not be made liable for the acts committed individually by co-trustees that are beyond the powers delegated to them.

Whose job is it, anyway?

The capital market regulator is looking to clearly spell out the role, responsibility and accountability of the board of an AMC in the regulations, circular or guidelines for the mutual fund industry.

To this end, SEBI is proposing to streamline the responsibilities to ensure that trustees can devote attention to their fiducial obligations rather than being burdened with operational responsibilities.

For example, under various sections on obligations, SEBI has suggested that the word “mutual fund” should be replaced by “AMC”.

The current obligations of the ‘mutual fund’ such as computation of the valuation of investment or net asset value, declaring dividends, disclosure of AUM and many others are proposed to clearly become the responsibility of the ‘AMC’.

In investor interest

To have an independent review mechanism for the decisions of an AMC from the perspective of the unitholders’ interest, SEBI has proposed that a Unitholder Protection Committee (UPC) may be constituted by the board of AMC.

The UPC is expected to protect the interests of unitholders of mutual fund schemes, redressal of their grievances, investor education and awareness.

Further, this committee is proposed to comprise at least three directors as members, wherein at least two-thirds of the members should be independent directors of the AMC.

Additionally, to ensure ease of access, SEBI has mooted a common platform for the dissemination of public announcements by all mutual funds on the lines of regulatory disclosures by companies on Indian stock exchanges.

“Finance news and information is available on every platform possible currently. Right from your newspaper to social media. But a retail consumer is lost amidst all such news and facts because of which they are unaware of what is true and what is not,” said Manish Maryada, Chief Executive Officer, and Co-founder, Fello, a game-based savings app.

The common platform can host all public announcements such as notices and addenda issued across all mutual funds.

This significantly reduces the work of investors, who would have to take the trouble of navigating fund houses’ websites to search for such addenda.

Triggers for review

Over the past decade, there has been a fivefold increase in the size of the mutual fund industry. The industry’s AUM grew from Rs 7.93 trillion on November 30, 2012 to Rs 10 trillion in May 2014, and in the next span of about three years it crossed Rs 20 trillion in August 2017.

The size of the industry’s AUM crossed Rs 30 trillion in November 2020 and, recently in November 2022, it surged past the Rs 40 trillion mark.

Industry insiders believe that the heightened scrutiny may be a fallout of alleged misconduct at some of the industry’s top fund mutual fund houses.

“This is due to whatever has happened in the industry in the last two-three years. The SEBI has intervened to tell the trustees that this is their job. Mutual fund is a business of trust, and the business belongs to trustees. We have a fiduciary responsibility, as it is somebody else's money that we are managing,” said the head of a fund house, requesting anonymity.

In 2022, Axis mutual fund came under regulatory scanner after alleged instances of misconduct. After the fund house submitted an internal investigation report, SEBI is now said to be finalising an order on the matter.

In 2020, Franklin Templeton MF wound up six of its debt schemes after Covid-19-led debt market illiquidity came about. A forensic audit later pointed out that the firm invested heavily in unlisted debt securities, which were mainly illiquid. After SEBI penalised the fund house and its officials and trustees, Franklin Templeton MF appealed in the Securities and Appellate Tribunal where the matter is currently being heard.

SEBI has invited comments on the proposals put forward in the Consultation Paper on Review of Role and Obligations of Mutual Fund Trustees until February 24, 2023.",1300,-0.22023506297005546

The Adani group is in throes of the worst crisis in history after US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research alleged irregularities in its books on January 24, setting its shares into a tailspin.

Adani Group share prices fell sharply in the days followed and some foreign banks stopped taking its bonds as collateral for margin loans. India’s banking and stock market regulators issued statements to pacify stakeholders, saying there were no systemic risks.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in an interview to Network18, clarified that the exposure of Life Corporation of India (LIC) is well within the permissible limits. In a post-Budget press conference in Mumbai on February 4, she said that the regulators are working and monitoring the Adani Group situation closely.

Lenders to Adani group faced questions on the future of their loans and their repayment status. Five banks, which include some of the biggest public and private sector players, have so far disclosed their exposure to the Adani Group.

SBI

State Bank of India , India's largest lender, in a post-earnings press conference said that its total exposure to the Adani Group stands at Rs 27,000 crore, or 0.8 percent of the overall book. Chairman Dinesh Khara said that there are no challenges concerning the conglomerates' debt servicing abilities.

BoB

Bank of Baroda's exposure to the Adani Group does not rank among the bank's top 10 exposures, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Sanjiv Chadha said. Around 30 percent of the bank's exposure is backed by joint ventures with PSU companies, he mentioned.

PNB

Punjab National Bank MD and CEO Atul Kumar Goael said that the lender's total exposure to the group is around Rs 7,000 crore, of which Rs 6,300 crore is funded exposure. Goel said that PNB has an exposure of Rs 2,500 crore for the airport's business.

Axis Bank

One of the largest private sector lenders, Axis Bank, in a statement to the exchanges said that its total outstanding as percentage of net advances to Adani Group companies stood at only 0.94 percent as of December 2022.

The lender further said that it's fund-based outstanding as percentage of net advances was 0.29 percent, non-fund based outstanding as percentage of net advances was 0.58 percent, and investments as percentage of net advances was 0.07 percent.

IndusInd Bank

IndusInd Bank had on the day of the Union Budget said that its total loan outstanding towards the Adani Group is pegged at 0.49 percent of its loan book. The lender clarified that its total non-fund outstanding was 0.85 percent, whereas its loan outstanding against fixed deposits is 0.2 percent of the loan book.

Other than these banks, other companies which have major exposure to the Adani Group include REC, the financial arm of Power Finance Corporation.

Further, it said the bank has a resilient balance sheet with standard asset coverage of 1.53 percent as of December 31, 2022.

Stocks of Adani Group firms have taken a massive beating on the bourses after US-based short-seller Hindenburg Research made a litany of allegations in a report, including fraudulent transactions and share price manipulation at the Gautam Adani-led group. The group has rejected the allegations.

Hindenburg released the report on January 24 -- the day on which Adani Enterprises' Rs 20,000-crore follow-on share sale opened for anchor investors.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on AXIS Bank

Axis Bank continued to report strong core profitability (up 53% YoY), supported by robust margin expansion (+30bps QoQ/70bps YoY) and healthy core fees. This, coupled with reversal of MTM losses, led to a 9% beat on PAT at Rs58.5bn (up 62% YoY). Overall LLP was higher than expected, as the bank made prudent provision of Rs3.4bn on a specific account, showing early signs of weakness. Overall Credit growth was moderate at 15% YoY/4% QoQ vs peers’ (>20% YoY), mainly due to sluggish growth in the retail book at 17% YoY/1% QoQ, in turn dragged by mortgage and card book. However, NIM expanded 30bps QoQ to 4.3%, due to better portfolio mix, asset re-pricing and interest recognition in a restructured account. Bank expects NIM to remain structurally healthy, as the full benefit of portfolio mix and RIDF run-down is yet to reflect. As per Management, the Citi retail portfolio acquisition deal is well on track and should be consummated within the guided timeline. Bank’s internal RoE generation remains stronger than consumption (due to moderate growth), with CET 1 at 15.6%; thus, it may not need to raise capital in the near term.

Outlook

We revise our earnings estimate upward for FY23/FY24/FY25 by 7%/4%/2%, and expect the bank to deliver 1.7-1.8%/17% RoA/RoE by FY25E. Given the improving coreprofitability, RoE profile and Management stability, we revise our TP multiple to 2.1x Dec24E ABV (from 1.8x) and, thus, our TP to Rs1,300/share (vs Rs1,110 earlier); retain BUY.

Sharekhan's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank reported strong earnings growth of 62% y-o-y/10% q-o-q, with RoA at 1.9%. Core PPOP grew 53% y-o-y/ 13% q-o-q. NIM expanded by 30 bps q-o-q to 4.26% (highest ever). However, there was a positive impact of 5 bps on NIM due to interest recovery on restructured NPA account (one-off). Loan growth remained healthy, up 15% y-o-y and 4% q-o-q, led by Retail, SME, and mid-corporate segments. However, retail loan growth was muted sequentially at 1%. Total deposits grew by 10% y-o-y/5% q-o-q, driven by non-retail term deposits (31% y-o-y/22% q-o-q), while CASA deposits growth was tepid at 10% y-o-y/1% q-o-q. CASA ratio moderated to 44.5% vs. 46.2% q-o-q. Slippages were higher by 13% q-o-q (2.3% annualised vs. 2.2% q-o-q), as slippages amounting to Rs. 400 crore were attributed from an account that bank considered prudent to downgrade despite the account was not overdue past 90 days.. Thus, core credit cost was also higher at 74 bps of average advances (annualised) vs. 42 bps q-o-q. With healthy recoveries along with contained write-offs, asset quality saw improvement with both GNPA and NNPA ratios declining by 12 bps q-o-q and 4 bps q-o-q to 2.38% and 0.47%. PCR at ~81%.

Outlook

The stock currently trades at 2.0x/1.7x/1.4x its FY2023E/FY2024E/FY2025E core BV estimates. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,140. Pick-up in retail deposits mobilisation remains the key monitorable going forward.

It declined by 79 bps on-year and 12 bps on-quarter to 2.38 percent as on December 31, 2022.

Axis Bank’s margins rose as the lender was able to pass on policy rate hikes onto its loans through lending rate hikes as 68 percent of its loan book is priced at a floating rate. Within this, 22 percent is priced on marginal cost-based lending rate (MCLR) while the rest is linked to external lending benchmarks such as the repo rate.

The bank in its earnings presentation highlighted that its margin expansion is also driven by structural drivers such as improved loan mix towards small and medium enterprises (SME) loans and retail, improvement in the composition of low-cost current and savings account (CASA) deposits and reduction in the share of low-yielding RIDF bonds.

Banks are mandated to invest in these bonds to make up for their shortfall in priority sector lending. The bank’s CASA deposits grew by 10 percent and the share of CASA deposits in overall deposits rose marginally to 44 percent for the December quarter. Overall deposits grew by 10 percent for the bank.

Loan growth boost

The bank reported a healthy loan growth of 15 percent to Rs 7.62 lakh crore with the main drivers being loans to retail and small businesses. SME loans grew the fastest at 24 percent and retail expanded at 17 percent. Within retail, home loans grew the slowest at 9 percent but had the largest share in the total retail book at 35 percent.

Other segments such as business banking loans, rural loans, and credit card outstandings showed double-digit growth. Axis Bank’s credit card outstanding grew by 39 percent and formed 4.8 percent of the total retail loan book.

The lender has 1.04 million cards in force as of December. To be sure, the bank’s market share in credit card spends has slipped to 8.9 percent from 9.6 percent in the previous quarter. The bank is in the process of completing its acquisition of Citibank’s credit card business which would boost the share of credit card loans significantly.

Corporate loans grew by a modest 8 percent for the bank. The BBB and below-rated corporate loans now form only 11 percent of the bank’s corporate loan pool, a sign of reduced risk. Axis Bank has also witnessed a reduction in stress during the quarter.

Asset quality

A fall in gross bad loan ratios for the fourth straight quarter shows that the bank has a good grip on stress and a high provision coverage ratio ensured provisioning needs are reduced thereby boosting the bottom line. Gross non-performing assets fell to 2.38 percent of the loan book from 3.17 percent a year ago.

The gross bad loan pile stood at Rs 19,961 crore as of December, a year-on-year decline of 14 percent. Fresh slippages too declined year-on-year to Rs 3807 crore from Rs 4147 crore in the December quarter of the previous year.

However, fresh slippages showed a marginal increase sequentially. While stress may have reduced, the bank has not had enough luck with getting its money back from defaulters during the quarter. Recoveries and upgrades were lower at Rs 2,088 crore.

The bank’s provisions rose for the quarter to Rs 1,341 crore, almost double that of the previous quarter. Despite this, the net profit growth was a sharp 62 percent owing to operating profit growth of a healthy 51 percent.

The bank’s operating profit was Rs 9,277 crore, helped by a modest 8 percent growth in operating expenses against a 32 percent increase in NII and a 23 percent rise in fee income.",756,0.6505594849586487

Axis Bank Ltd is expected to report a 70 percent jump in net profit for the October-December quarter, largely aided by a fall in provisions and a strong core interest income growth.

The average of the estimates of seven brokerages polled by Moneycontrol forecasts the net profit for the December quarter at Rs 5,321.5 crore, up 70 percent from Rs 3,130 crore a year ago. Net interest income (NII), the core income a bank earns through lending, is expected to grow 25 percent to Rs 10,846 crore, the poll showed. In the December quarter last year, the private sector lender had reported an NII of Rs 8,650 crore.

Analysts expect the NII growth to come on the back of a robust loan book expansion, putting loan growth at 15-16 percent. Axis Bank’s loan growth has averaged 14-18 percent for the past four quarters, a trend that is likely to continue. “Market share gain in SME, Bharat banking, leadership growth in cards, strengthening of transaction banking and growth in identified focused retail segments, will be the key growth drivers,” wrote analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd in their note. The bank’s focus on rural and semi-urban centres also augurs well for balance sheet growth, according to analysts.

On deposits, the bank is expected to report a modest growth of 10-11 percent, in line with larger peer banks such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank that have reported earnings so far. The movement within term and low-cost current and savings account deposits would be keenly watched. Notwithstanding rate hikes, analysts see the lender reporting an expansion in its net interest margin (NIM). “We see NIM to expand further, given frontloaded benefits of rate transmission; we expect front-ended NIM expansion for the bank,” wrote those at Elara Capital in a note.

All these should help boost net interest income along with an expected reduction in credit costs owing to improved asset quality.

Asset quality signs

Axis Bank is expected to continue with its asset quality improvement and report a reduction in bad loan ratios. In the September quarter, the bank had reported a gross bad loan ratio of 2.50 percent. Therefore, provisions may reduce leading to a boost to the bottomline. That said, small loans and lending to agriculture may show some signs of pain, according to analysts. Kotak Institutional Equities estimates that fresh slippages may come in at Rs 3,500 crore for the quarter. In the September quarter, the bank had reported slippages worth Rs 3,383 crore.

Overall provisioning needs would be low given low fresh stress and high provisioning coverage ratio of 80 precent.

Investors would keenly watch for the progress of Citibank’s credit card business acquisition by Axis Bank. Further, commentary from the management on margins in the coming quarters amid rising deposit rates would also be watched for. “A protracted high interest-rate cycle is a greater risk to Axis Bank than to large private peers, in terms of potential market share loss in prime credit,” point out analysts at BNP Paribas in a note.",523,0.42066472172737124

As the economy recovers from the pandemic, banks are going aggressive with partnership models to expand their services and get new customers.

Both public and private banks have been on a partnership spree in recent months to bring more customers on board. Lenders have also introduced offers by way of new debit and credit cards, digital banking services, and lending rates.

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, has tied up with about 20 companies over the past five months to offer services ranging from digital banking and financial payment options to credit facilities. The lender recently partnered with Warehouse Development Regulatory Authority to provide low-interest rate loans to farmers. SBI also partnered with motorcycle company Jawa Yezdi to provide financial options to its customers.

Canara Bank, another public sector lender, has joined with National E-Governance Service Ltd. to expand its digital banking services. The lender will offer a digital workflow of bank guarantees that will eliminate physical insurance, stamping, verification, and paper-based record maintenance.

Among private sector lenders, Axis Bank has tied up with OPEN, a digital banking enterprise, to provide digital current account services for its various customer segments.

DBS Bank India recently partnered with Gofrugal Technologies, a platform offering ERP solutions to adopt Open Network for Digital Commerce for its enterprise customers.

Laura Spiekerman, president of Alloy, a fintech and banking facilitator, said in a report that such partnerships help banks adopt new technologies and infrastructure to provide their services.

“Partnerships with fintech companies help banks provide new features to eager customers without spending costly resources to build their own digital products, while still earning a share of the profits,” Spiekerman said.

International partnerships

Some private banks have partnered with international companies and airlines to expand their products and services.

HDFC Bank, the largest private sector lender, partnered with Microsoft for cloud services for its banking operations.

Yes Bank and Mastercard have got together to introduce a debit card for its ultra-high net worth individual customers.

IndusInd bank tied up with Qatar Airways and British Airways to introduce a multi-branded credit card.

Partnerships here to stay?

Banks have traditionally partnered with companies for reasons including reaching a wider customer network and availing advanced technological services.

As banks recover from the tumultuous times of the pandemic, experts said partnerships will be their focus for some time in the near future.

“Customers would prefer using different banking services. And not only that, but banks are looking for more tie-ups with companies. We feel that these partnerships will stay for some time,” said Vijay Singh Gour, a senior analyst at Care Ratings.

Any risks with partnerships?

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been strict on regulations concerning fintech firms and companies that are native to the digital ecosystem. Experts are of the opinion that barring partnerships with fintech and other digital lenders, on which RBI has kept a close watch, there is no risk involved in such partnerships.

Gour said there are some risks which the banks and the RBI are working on.

“The regulator has been working in a collaborative manner to mitigate the risks associated with fintechs and digital lenders,” Gour said.",528,0.12503653764724731

Significantly, the top three spots are retained by private sector lenders with the second position maintained by ICICI Bank with a market share of 17.67 per cent or Rs 85,486 crore and HDFC Bank third with 17.29 per cent or Rs 83,667 crore of the total share, according to the Bloomberg league table for 2022.

While Axis Bank's market share marginally declined in 2022 from 19.37 per cent in 2021, it increased from Rs 80,798 crore in 2021 in value terms. Those of ICICI Bank has jumped from 14.51 per cent in 2021 or arranging Rs 60,527 crore of debt issuances, HDFC Bank's too increased from 14.04 per cent or Rs 58,542 crore, as the overall issuances remained tepid.

As of September 2022, the outstanding corporate bonds stood at Rs 39,12,853 crore up from Rs 36,53,408 crore in September 2021, said Neeraj Gambhir, the group executive and head of treasuries at Axis Bank, quoting NSDL data.

""We've been the market leader for the 16th consecutive year in arranging domestic corporate bond issuances in 2022. We've acted as arranger for 127 bond issuances worth Rs 92,904.5 crore in the year, giving us a market share of 19.2 per cent,"" Gambhir told PTI on Monday.

He attributed this record success to ""the consistent efforts put in by the teams and exhibits our agility to adapt to the changing times and reflects the confidence of our clients in our capabilities. Our synergised efforts through the 'One Axis' approach have helped us establish the leadership position across the capital markets."" He said the challenging interest rate environment has seen bond issuance seeing lower activity till the third quarter when the volume picked up, eventually ending at a marginally higher volume than 2021.

Total issuances in the year rose to Rs 4,83,770 crore, from Rs 4,17,055 crore in 2021, he added.

Axis Bank, which is the third-largest private sector lender, offers the entire spectrum of bond issuance services to its customer segments covering large and mid-corporates, SME, agriculture and retail businesses.

According to an Icra Ratings report last week, banks continue to lead the bond market raising a record Rs 91,500 crore in the first nine months of FY23 as liquidity conditions continuing to remain tight and the year may close with around Rs 1.4 lakh crore of fresh supplies, up from up from Rs 0.7 lakh crore in whole of FY22.",430,0.9963551461696625

Axis Bank Managing Director and CEO, Amitabh Chaudhry on January 16 said Indian banks have learned lessons from the past bad loan cycles and are much better placed today to look at the right borrowers.

""All of us have learned a lesson from previous crises and have paid a price. We will not make the same mistakes again,"" said Amitabh Chaudhry while speaking exclusively to Moneycontrol on the sidelines of Davos 2023.

The Axis Bank CEO said corporate borrowers, too, have realised they cannot take the banks for a ride. The large-scale loan write-offs have helped banks to clean up their books, enabling fresh lending, said Chaudhry.

""All the write-offs that have been done have put the banking system on a sound footing. The balance sheets are well capitalised. They are clean. The Indian banking system is ready to lend to the right set of people,"" said Chaudhry.

""I think even the entrepreneurs have learned a lesson that they cannot take the banking system for a ride. And If you do, there are consequences to it. In that sense, the system is well-prepared,"" said the chief of India's third-largest private sector bank.

Chaudhry's comments are significant in the wake of around Rs 10 lakh crore of corporate loan write-offs by Indian banks in the last five years. This helped banks to lower their bad loans significantly.

As per the data disclosed in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) asset quality report, the gross non-performing assets (GPAs) of Indian lenders have declined to a seven-year low of 5 percent in September 2022.

The net non-performing assets (NNPA) dropped to a 10-year low of 1.3 percent in September. On the face of it, this is good news. A lower share of NPAs reflects positively on bank balance sheets.

Chaudhry highlighted that the bankers are now cautious about working towards maintaining their asset quality. ""We also have to be cognizant of the fact that we cannot go back to the old days. If you make mistakes today, you will pay 3-5 years down the line for that mistake,"" Chaudhry said.

""So as bankers, it is critical to ask this question are we creating risks today which could lead to NPLs tomorrow,"" Chaudhry said.

Rate hike cycle coming to an end

Chaudhry said that the RBI's interest rate hike cycle is likely coming to an end and the central bank's rate actions have helped to keep the inflation under control.

""We are expecting another rate hike may be 25 bps in February. We believe that should be the end of the interest rate hike cycle. But, these are ultimately speculations. The MPC (monetary policy committee) has done a great job,"" said Chaudhry.

Speaking on deposit rate hikes by banks, Chaudhry said that banks may work on hiking deposit rates as credit growth is ahead of deposit growth. ""That ultimately needs to be settled down. So because banks want to grow, deposit rates might continue to rise,"" Chaudhry said.

India a bright spot

The Axis Bank CEO said India is seen as a bright spot in the global economic landscape but the execution is key to getting more foreign investments.

""India is clearly a bright spot. The government and RBI have managed covid crisis extremely well. The government has created a lot of strategic partnerships. India is a place where the world should be investing more,"" said Chaudhry.

According to foreign brokerage firm Jefferies, the deal on fair value would imply a transaction value of Rs 1,100-2,100 crore and Axis Bank will have to pay an Rs 700-1,700 crore more. “Deal is positive for Max Life and Max Financial Services,” it noted.

“Axis Bank may recover the value with higher commission that may impact the margin a bit. Max Life has lagged peers on growth in 9MFY23 and a pick-up here will aid re-rating,” it said. Max Life Insurance had 269 offices with Rs 1.07 lakh crore of assets under management as of FY22.

The transaction also provided for a ‘Put option’ under which Axis Bank could sell all its shares to Max Financial Services at Rs 294 apiece if the value creation option was not consummated.

Axis Entities and Max Financial agreed that the valuation for the right to acquire the remaining 7 percent stake of Max Life would be through fair market value using discounted cash flow and not through Rule 11UA of the Income Tax rules,1962.

The lender said the revised agreement was done consequent to the guidance received by Max Life from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI).

Previously, Axis Entities acquired a 12.99 percent stake in Max Life at Rs 35 per share with the right to acquire an additional 7 percent stake in the company.",122,

Of course, the fortunes of the 10-year government bond will depend on the Union Budget for the next financial year.

Neeraj Gambhir, group executive of treasury and markets at Axis Bank, believes that an unchanged market borrowing target for FY24 would be good news for the bond market. “So as long as the budget’s glide path is maintained on fiscal consolidation and the government borrowing size is not very different from what they have done this year, I think the market will be kind of okay,” Gambhir said in an interview with Moneycontrol.

Gambhir believes there are enough levers for bank credit growth to remain robust but companies could relook at corporate bonds for fund-raising as bank loans begin to look expensive with rates hikes. That would result in widening of spreads in the coming months.

Edited excerpts.

Last year was not a great one in terms of corporate bond issuances. What was behind the modest issuance volume?

In May we had a surprise rate hike and subsequently we had a series of rate hikes. So obviously, a very sharp repricing happened in the market and when you have such a sharp repricing and such a sharp increase of interest rates, it takes issuers a bit of a time to get used to the new levels. And that's what we saw happen.

From the investor side, the appetite was also muted, because we saw the overall liquidity in the system come down. Mutual funds saw outflows from their schemes in the initial phase of the rate hiking cycle and that too impacted demand. What has helped is that in the second half of the calendar year, particularly after October, we have seen very strong demand from long-term investors, like pension funds, EPF, insurance etc. All these segments have actually come back very strongly at the longer end of the curve. This explains why, in the last 2-3 months, we saw a good amount of supply of long-term bonds and this supply got sort of very quickly absorbed as well.

We saw some instances of pricing where private sector AAA bonds were priced at par with G-secs or even a couple of times below G-secs, in the 10-year segment? Have these anomalies corrected and why did this happen in the first place?

It was a short phase of time when we saw these happen. Investors have mandates and as end of the year nears, they must fulfil their mandates. If the supply is limited at that point in time, you can see sometimes these kinds of phenomena happen. But in general, what we are seeing is that the credit spreads are extremely tight right now, particularly for PSU issuers. Even if I look at private sector issuers, the credit spreads are on the tighter side of the range, historically speaking. It is effectively telling you that there is demand from these long-term investments, and there is not enough supply and this is why the spreads continue to be quite tight.

Would we see companies come back to the bond market this year?

The dynamics of pricing corporate loans in India is that they are largely linked to MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds Based Landing Rate) which changes when the deposit rates in the system change. So while the corporate bond market, as we discussed earlier, has gone ahead and priced in the future rate hikes in the earlier part of the year, the pricing adjustment of corporate loans has been a slow affair. Therefore, till now, it made more sense for corporates to tap into their bank lines, rather than go for bonds as the bond market pricing was higher than loan pricing. I expect that going forward this pricing gap between the loan market and the bond market will narrow. Therefore, we may see that some of the corporates which had switched to the loans may start coming back the bond market.

Another factor that isn't getting talked about much is the fact that borrowing in dollars and swapping into INR has become very expensive. Therefore, it still makes sense for a company to say for example, do a rupee bond and not do a dollar bond. To that extent, I think the corporates are looking at the domestic market, whether it is the loan market or bond market, for financing. And that is one possible reason why you're seeing strong credit growth in this year. This trend is also likely to continue for some time.

What is your outlook on government bond yields?

I'm expecting G-sec yields to consolidate now. I don't think that we want to see a big move up in yields from here onwards. Obviously, a lot depends upon what the government does in the budget. So as long as the budget’s glide path is maintained on fiscal consolidation and the government borrowing size is not very different from what they have done this year, I think the market will be fine. Therefore, I don't expect the G-sec yields to actually go significantly either way. I think for now reaching 7.50% on the 10-year benchmark looks difficult.

What have the markets priced in terms of rate hikes? What is your expectation?

If you look at the OIS (Overnight Index Swap) curve, it is basically pricing in another 25 bps (basis points). A 25 bps rate hike is a given in February and there is some probability of another 25 bps also. This is what the curve is telling us now. The G-sec curve is obviously a little bit higher because it is impacted by the fact that liquidity in the system is coming down. So, while the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) rate hikes maybe 25 or 50 bps, the key question is whether the operational rate will be SDF (Standing Deposit Facility) or MSF (Marginal Standing Facility). This depends upon the liquidity in the system. This is what the bond market is looking at.

My expectation is that 25 or maybe 50 bps maximum in terms of rate hikes.

Do you see any possibility of consolidation at the short-end or you think this steep movement will be maintained?

I think the short end could see a little bit more pressure from now until March because we have seen a significant amount of issuance activity in the calendar year from the banking system. The outstanding CDs (Certificates of Deposit) by the banks have actually gone up quite sharply over the last 12 to 18 months. Effectively, as the credit demand has accelerated, the deposit growth has lagged. Banks have also relied more and more on CD market to fund the growth. And that is getting reflected in the spreads in the money market. The spread of one-year CD over one year T-bill is almost 100 basis points. The spreads are elevated at the shorter end of the money market and that is likely to continue very to this year as we go into financial year-end.

Foreign Institutional Investors have been largely absent or exits have happened from the bond market. Should we not expect flows at all now?

There is some uncertainty about when the US rate hiking cycle will stop. If we go by the rate probabilities in the market reflected in the yield curves, the market is expecting another 100 basis points of rate hike with a terminal Fed funds rate somewhere close to 5 percent and thereafter, a period of consolidation.

But the speeches coming out of Fed seem to suggest that there is at least one subsection of the Fed, which wants to keep the rates higher, for a much longer period. Much of that clarity will emerge in the next three to four months when we get to see the data on inflation. My expectation is that while we are looking at 100 basis point kind of rate hike by the Fed, I think it's very difficult for money to move into emerging market assets. Think about this, cash used to earn zero in the US, now it earns 4 percent and soon it could become 5 percent. Until that clarity on US rates emerges, I don't see a big flows coming into the emerging markets. Bond flows will only start when we see a resolution on when the Fed rate hiking cycle stops and when the market starts expecting rate cuts.

The government has announced sovereign green bond issuance. What kind of demand and pricing are you expecting?

The issue in India is currently we don't have any green funds. We're not very clear how much of these bonds will attract global interest because they are local currency and not foreign currency. I think there is a bit of a price discovery that should happen here. There is no stopping the domestic investors to otherwise buy these bonds. Demand will always be there. The question is whether the green label is going to give a pricing edge. But that remains to be seen, because we don't have dedicated green funds. For now the pool of investors is the same as G-sec.",1549,0.014431752264499664

HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Bharti Airtel are set to see inflows of up to $29 million, $26 million and $16 million, respectively, with the quarterly recapping by the National Stock Exchange.

Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, SBI and Bajaj Auto will see the highest outflows of $57 million, $34 million, $32 million and $19 million due to the rejig in weightage, according to Nuvama Alternative and Quantitative Research.

The capping factor for stocks in all the Nifty indices is realigned upon change in equity, investible weighted factor, replacement of scrips in the index, periodic rebalancing and on a quarterly basis on the last trading day of March, June, September and December.

Since these indices are tracked majorly by domestic passive funds and ETFs, the recapping leads to a change in funds flow. While the adjustment will take place today, the changes will become effective only on December 30.

In the Nifty 50, scrips of Adani Ports, HDFC Life and HDFC Bank/ICICI Bank are set to see inflows of $11 million, $9 million and $4 million, respectively. Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and Tech Mahindra might see outflows of $12 million, $9 million and $3 million, respectively.

HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank will also see incremental inflows due to weightage increase in the Nifty Bank index of $25 million and $22 million. IndusInd Bank and Federal Bank are next in line, anticipating $19 million and $10 million inflows.

Axis Bank's weightage will go up in the Nifty 50 index but come down in the Bank Nifty resulting in a cumulative outflow of $57 million. SBI's weightage in Bank Nifty will come down 10.2 percent from 11.1 percent, resulting in an outflow of $32 million.

Coming to the Nifty CPSE index, Powergrid and NTPC will see inflows of $13 million and $12 million. On the other hand, ONGC will see highest outflow of $21 million.",323,0.4290858954191208

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB has progressed well over past few years and has strengthened its balance sheet by making it granular, increasing the mix of retail loans and improving its PCR. As a result, its key metrics such as loan growth, margins and profitability have improved. Loan growth is witnessing a healthy recovery with 14-18% growth over the past four quarters (vs 13% CAGR over FY19-22), driven by retail loans (18% CAGR). Small business banking (SBB)/rural loans posted a robust CAGR of 49%/23%. The rural and semi-urban market remains a key focus area, which should enable sustainable loan growth over the medium term. We, thus, expect a 17% CAGR in loans over FY22-25. AXSB has multiple levers in place to offset the rise in the funding cost as 68% of loans are floating, which, coupled with the rising mix of high-yielding loans and a gradual reduction in low-yielding RIDF bonds (3% of assets), should help margins. AXSB remains focused on building a stronger, consistent, and sustainable franchise. Since asset quality issues are behind, slippages and credit cost will be under control. While the bank will continue to make investments, it expects to bring down the costto-assets ratio to ~2% by FY25-end.

Outlook

The bank achieved its target of a consolidated RoE of 18% in 2QFY23 and remains on track to deliver a sustainable RoE of 18% in the medium term. We estimate AXSB to deliver FY25 RoA/RoE of 1.8%/16.9%. AXSB is our top pick for CY23 with a TP of INR1,130 (2.0x Sep’24E ABV + INR94 for subs).

The brokerage house, in a research report, bet on the bank for making its balance sheet granular, all the while increasing the mix of retail loans and improving its provision coverage ratio. This, the research report states, has improved its key metrics such as loan growth, margins and profitability.

“Axis Bank remains focused on building a stronger, consistent, and sustainable franchise. Since asset quality issues are behind, slippages and credit cost will be under control. While the bank will continue to make investments, it expects to bring down the cost-to-assets ratio to 2 percent by FY25-end,” the report marked out.

At 11 am, the stock was trading at Rs 932 on the NSE, marginally lower than its previous day close of Rs 933. For the year, Axis Bank has gained 38 percent, outperforming Nifty Bank which has gained 22 percent.

The bank achieved its target of a consolidated RoE of 18 percent in 2QFY23, the report said, and remained on track to deliver a sustainable RoE of 18 percent in the medium term. The brokerage house estimates the bank to deliver FY25 RoA/RoE of 1.8 percent and 16.9 percent, respectively.

As per the report, Axis Bank is witnessing a healthy recovery as loan growth has improved to 14-18 percent in the past four quarters as against a 13 percent CAGR through FY19-22. The loan growth was driven by the retail book, which saw an 18 percent CAGR over FY19-22. Small business banking and rural loans have also registered a strong CAGR of 49 percent and 23 percent. Motilal Oswal has estimated a 17 percent CAGR loan growth over FY22-25.

Motilal Oswal has also made a positive projection about the bank’s asset quality, marking out that the credit cost of the bank is likely to undershoot its long-term average at 0.4-0.6 percent over FY22-25.

“Asset quality has improved significantly over the past few years, with slippages moderating to 3 percent in FY22 (2.1 percent in 1HFY23), which led to a decline in the GNPA ratio to 2.5 percent in 1HFY23 vs 5.1 percent in FY20. The net slippage ratio was also low at 0.8 percent/0.4 percent in FY22/1HFY23.”

The bank also has total provisions of Rs 11,630 crore, which amounts to 1.6 percent of the loan book and is the highest among its peers. Axis Bank’s PCR has also improved significantly to 80 percent in the second quarter of FY23, and the restructured book is negligible accounting for only 0.38 percent of loans, which, along with lower BB and below book, will keep the slippages in control.",472,0.9975492623117235

Sharekhan's research report on Axis Bank

We believe Axis Bank has strengthened its franchise (both on assets as well as liability side) over the past few years to deliver sustained improved performance over the medium term. On the back of this, the current valuation gap (Axis Bank trading at 1.4x its FY2025E Core BV) vs. its core peer (ICICI Bank at 1.9x its FY2025E Core BV) is expected to narrow down over the next 6-12 months. Concerns on growth in granular retail liabilities vs. peers are expected to fade away as the bank has started gaining market share on CASA front (10% system growth vs. 14% for Axis in the past one year) aided by leveraging digital ecosystem, focusing on corporate salary account acquisition, and cross-sell liability products to existing clients. Further, Citi Bank’s acquisition is expected to improve CASA ratio by 200bps. Branch expansion is likely to further accelerate growth. NIM gap vs. core peer (ICICI Bank) is also narrowing (at 36bps in H1FY2023 vs. 64 bps in H1FY2022). Return on RWA is now closer to its peers; improved underwriting practices by taking learnings from past cycles are key positives. It has already converged on loan growth, credit cost, and ROE with the frontline banks. Due to all these factors, we see the bank emerging as stronger in this leg of upcycle and valuation multiple inching higher closer to its peers. At the CMP, the bank trades at 2.0x/1.7x/1.4x its FY2023E/FY2024E/FY2025E Core BV, offering attractive risk reward.



Outlook

We maintain Buy with a revised PT of Rs. 1,140. We believe valuations are reasonable, given structural improvement in the franchise.

After moving closer to 18,900 level in the beginning of December, traders seem to have preferred profit taking and hence the Nifty50 is caught in a bear trap. The index lost more than 1 percent in the week ended December 9, after run-up in previous two consecutive weeks. Slightly hawkish tone by the Reserve Bank of India and caution ahead of FOMC meet weighed on market sentiment despite correction in oil prices amid global recession fears.

The index closed a tad below 18,500, the support which was being held on to for several sessions in the recent past. Overall if the same gets decisively broken then Nifty can take support at crucial 18,400-18,300 area, whereas on the other side, 18,600-18,700 zone is going to be near term resistance followed by new high, experts said.

""The Nifty is now placed slightly above the key support of '20-day EMA' (exponential moving average - 18,465) which coincides with previous swing high of 18,450. Hence, we continue to remain upbeat as long as 18,400 – 18,300 is not violated on a closing basis,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

Until then, he feels any intermediate decline should only be construed as profit booking before resuming the upward trend.

On the flipside, 18,650 – 18,700 are the levels to watch out for. The moment Nifty surpasses this, one should gear up for yet another milestone of 19,000 in the near future, the expert said.

Traders are advised not to get carried away by such small declines. Rather it’s better to focus more on thematic moves, especially from the broader end of the spectrum, Sameet advised.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the December 9 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Thermax: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,057 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,875 | Target: Rs 2,350 | Return: 14 percent

The stock is in the last leg of a corrective pattern. It could drop to Rs 1,950 or Rs 1,960 levels, where it has seen key support since March 2022.

Technically, it will mark the second low in the last two months. Our advice is to buy the stock 50 percent at current levels and the balance at Rs 1,950 with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,875 and we can keep a target of Rs 2,350 or Rs 2,450 in the medium term, which is the pullback level for the stock.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,631 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,590 | Target: Rs 1,722 | Return: 5.6 percent

It is forming a triangle consolidation formation between Rs 1,640 and Rs 1,590 range. It has shown a trending move from Rs 1,365 levels.

The overall formation is suggesting that the current formation is a continuation formation and on the dismissal of Rs 1,642, it will jump to the level, which lies between Rs 1,675 and Rs 1,722.

Buying around Rs 1,630 and Rs 1,620 is appropriate with a stop-loss at Rs 1,590.

Divis Laboratories: Sell | LTP: Rs 3,274 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,350 | Target: Rs 2,978 | Return: 9 percent

The stock is forming a series of lower top and lower bottom. On weekly basis, the stock closed below Rs 3,330 level, which was last week's low.

It is negative for the stock and it may witness further weakness till the next level, which is at Rs 2,978. The stock closed on a weekly basis at Rs 3,274 and based on technical analysis, the downside is favourable for short sellers with a stop-loss at Rs 3,350.

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC: Buy | LTP: Rs 449.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 430 | Target: Rs 490 | Return: 9 percent

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC has corrected from a high of Rs 503 touched in September 2022. The stock recently found support around the Rs 400 levels in October 2022. This is close to the previous intermediate lows, indicating a double bottom formation. The stock has subsequently bounced back and made higher bottoms in the last few weeks.

Last week, the stock broke out of a trading range on the back of healthy volumes, which is encouraging. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI (relative strength index) too have bounced back and are in rising mode now.

With the intermediate technical setup too looking positive, we believe the stock has the potential to move higher in the coming weeks. We recommend a buy between Rs 440-460 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 430 and target at Rs 490.

Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 350.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 332 | Target: Rs 382 | Return: 9 percent

After correcting from a high of Rs 470 in January 2022, Suprajit Engineering found support around Rs 272 levels in March 2022. These are strong supports as they are just above the 200-day EMA.

The stock has since then been climbing higher and making higher bottoms in the process. This week, the stock also broke out of its recent trading range on the back of huge volumes, indicating it is set to move higher in the coming weeks.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-week RSI too are in rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential for further upsides.

With the intermediate setup too looking attractive, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. One can buy between Rs 348-355 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 332 and target at Rs 382.

Bata India: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,679 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,739 | Target: Rs 1,580 | Return: 6 percent

Bata is in a short term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks. Recently, the stock broke down below its recent supports and also reacted from the 20-day SMA last week. This indicates that the downtrend looks set to continue.

Technical indicators are giving negative signals as the stock is now trading below the 20-day and 50-day SMA. Momentum readings like the 14-day RSI are in decline mode and not oversold, which implies potential for more downsides.

We therefore expect the stock to correct further in the coming sessions. One can sell between Rs 1,670-1,684 levels, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,739 and downside target at Rs 1,580.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance Securities

Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,227 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,030 | Target: Rs 3,580 | Return: 11 percent

The stock consolidated after retracing 50 percent of prior up-move (Rs 2,560-Rs 3,546) and witnessed a range breakout. The stock also closed above its 20-week EMA and rose to 9-week closing high.

Its weekly Stochastic is positively poised; its RSI gave buy signal, while its MACD (moving average convergence divergence) is on the verge of a bullish cross-over.

The stock has potential to move towards Rs 3,490 initially and Rs 3,680 subsequently.

In case of any decline, the stock will continue to find support at around its 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior up-move.

Colgate Palmolive: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,657 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,570 | Target: Rs 1,820 | Return: 10 percent

Since couple of weeks, the stock oscillated above its cluster of moving averages (20-week EMA, 50-week EMA and 100-week SMA) and poised for a breakout.

In the last two weeks, the stock witnessed a steady rise with above average volume, which signals that major market participants were in favour of the bulls.

The key technical indicators are positively poised on medium-term as well as short-term timeframe charts. We believe the stock will rebound utilising prior consolidation and move towards its life-time-high.

On the lower side, the stock will find support around its cluster of moving averages.

Dr Reddy's Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,407 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,210 | Target: Rs 4,900 | Return: 11 percent

Post a trendline breakout, the stock again tested that extended line and formed a bullish reversal pattern. The stock also found support around its 100-day SMA and reversed.

This could take the stock towards Rs 4,600 initially and Rs 4,900 subsequently.

Major technical indicators are in favour of the bulls on the near-term timeframe chart.

In case of any volatility, the stock will find support around its long-term moving averages (100-day and 200-day SMAs).

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 934 | Stop-Loss: Rs 908 | Target: Rs 985 | Return: 5.5 percent

The banking index has been showing an outperformance and it is continuing its uptrend after some consolidation phase. Within the private sector banks, Axis Bank is showing strength and has given a breakout above its previous swing high resistance.

The prices above its 20 EMA support, the volumes along the price upmove are good and the RSI oscillator is indicating a positive momentum.

Hence, we expect the uptrend to continue in Axis Bank, so short term traders can look to buy this stock around Rs 934 for potential targets of Rs 969 and Rs 985. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 908.

Suprajit Engineering: Buy | LTP: Rs 351 | Stop-Loss: Rs 337 | Target: Rs 376 | Return: 7 percent

The stock has been consolidating within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern since last few months and prices have given a breakout from the pattern on Friday. This entire consolidation is above its weekly 200 EMA which indicates that long term uptrend is still intact.

The volumes have improved in last couple of sessions and if the stock gives a follow up move, then it could lead to a decent trended upmove going ahead.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock around current market price of Rs 351 for potential targets around Rs 365 and Rs 376. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 337.

Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Bharat Forge

After a short term correction, the stock has formed higher bottom formation and bounced back sharply. On last Thursday, the stock rallied over 4 percent and formed long bullish candle on daily charts which is largely positive.

For the positional traders now, 20-day SMA (simple moving average) or Rs 850 would be the key level to watch. If stock manages to trade above the same then the stock could retest the level of Rs 890-895. On the flip side, below Rs 850 uptrends would be vulnerable.

Axis Bank

On December 8, the stock made a fresh all-time high of Rs 943.95. In this quarter so far, it rallied nearly 30 percent.

On daily and weekly charts the stock is consistently holding higher high and higher low formation which is largely positive. However, due to temporary overbought conditions we could see some profit booking at higher level.

Hence buying on correction and sell on rallies would be the ideal strategy for the short term traders.

For the traders, Rs 920 and Rs 900 would act as a strong support zone while Rs 980-1000 could be the immediate resistance zone for the bulls. Below Rs 900, traders may prefer to exit from the trading long positions.

Godfrey Phillips India

On last Thursday, the stock rallied nearly 7 percent and registered a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,949.95. A promising price volume rally, range breakout formation and long bullish candle on daily charts supported further uptrend from the current levels.

For the breakout traders now, Rs 1,830 would act as a sacrosanct level. Above the same, the stock could move up to Rs 2,000. Further upside may also continue which could lift the stock till Rs 2,055.

The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee on December 7 raised the repo rate to the highest level since August 2018, which was largely on the expected lines. The panel also decided to remain focused on the withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.

The repo rate, the rate at which the central bank (RBI) lends money to commercial banks, has been raised by 35 basis points to 6.25 percent, from 5.9 percent earlier. Jayanth R Varma voted against the repo rate hike, while the rest MPC members were in favour of rate hike.

The moderation in rate hike (from 50 bps hike in earlier meetings) was largely on the expected lines, given the inflation above its targeted zone and following the Fed path (which already indicated balanced approach between containing inflation and fostering growth). The policy stance may indicate another rate hike on the cards in the February 2023 meeting, whereas the central bank lowering its growth forecast for the current financial year, given the global headwinds was also on expected lines, experts said.

""Markets were expecting a slight moderation in the stance but it continues to be the withdrawal of accommodative stance while supporting growth. This may be interpreted that further action on the rate front can still happen before arriving at the terminal rate,"" Ajit Banerjee, Chief Investment Officer at Shriram Life Insurance, said.

Pankaj Pathak, Fund Manager - Fixed Income at Quantum AMC also believes a continuation of the stance as “withdrawal of accommodation” indicates that the rate hiking cycle in India is by no means over. ""We would expect at least another 25 basis points of a rate hike in February next year before we get any closer to the terminal rate,"" he said.

The Reserve Bank of India has reduced its FY23 GDP forecast to 6.8 percent from 7 percent, but retained the CPI inflation forecast unchanged at 6.7 percent. CPI inflation for October eased to a three-month low of 6.77 percent, down from 7.41 percent in September.

The lowering full-year GDP growth forecast is predominantly factoring in the prevailing global headwinds and would likely to impact India's GDP growth, Banerjee said, adding the inflation forecasts for the residual period of FY23 have been marginally increased from the previous forecast in view of the higher inflation level still prevailing.

The market reacted negatively to the policy, maybe due to increasing possibility for further rate hikes in next policy meeting and lowering growth forecast. The Nifty50 fell 50 points to 18,593, while the BSE Sensex was down more than 100 points at 62,512.

Prasanth Mamidala, an entrepreneur based in Hyderabad, holds a Citibank savings account. He also has a savings account with Axis Bank. After Citibank announced that it will transfer all its banking services in India to Axis, he does not know the fate of his accounts.

“Will I have two savings accounts with Axis Bank? Will they shut down one of my accounts? I have tried contacting both banks but to no avail. From their end, there has not been any communication concerning this,” Mamidala said.

Confusion with transfers

Like Mamidala, many customers are confused and worried as to what will happen to their accounts and services with Citibank after the transfer to Axis Bank.

“Without knowing what product we get, how do we transfer the relationship?” tweeted Vinod Kumar, a Citibank customer.

Satvik Sehgal, another customer, said that he is planning to close his account with Citibank.

Experts have said that some Citibank users have resorted to closing their accounts and services due to the absence of communication from banks concerning their issues.

A response to a frequently asked questions on Citibank’s website read, “The transition will be completed over time, and in an orderly fashion, with due notice. We will keep all stakeholders informed of updates as they materialize.”

Kashif Ansari, an assistant professor of taxation and personal finance at Jindal University and credit card expert, opined that Axis Bank may allow additional credit card customers from Citibank than its credit card holding limits.

""Axis Bank has a limit of three credit cards per customer. If customers with accounts in both banks have credit cards amounting to more than three, initially Axis Bank will allow this,” he said.

Consent communication

In a November 18 email to customers, Citibank mentioned several transactions that if undertaken on or after November 21 would be taken as consent to move to Axis Bank. For the last few months, the bank has been seeking customer consent for the transfer, and the latest communication is for customers who are yet to agree to move their services to Axis Bank.

“While Citibank has reached out over email, I have specifically decided to not give them consent since I do not wish to deal with Axis Bank,” said Sehgal, the Citibank customer quoted earlier.

Subhankar, another customer with Citibank, tweeted “Citibank has started sending the confirmation of the transfer of relationship to Axis Bank. If you have made any debit transactions of any kind, you’ll receive this message now.”

""The overall consent exercise began in July 2022 and we have been seeing an excellent response from our customers with nearly 70% of balances already consented to shift. Customers who transfer will continue to receive the same services with the same products post the transition. The recent communication is an essential step to ensure there isn’t any service disruption and for our customers’ convenience,"" Citibank said in a statement to Moneycontrol.

Ansari said that generally during mergers and acquisition (m&a) deals, the acquiring party initially tweaks some of its rules to allow the inflow of customers.

“Increasing the number of cards a person can hold is one of the things that Axis Bank can do so that customers do not worry,” he opined.

""We have not received any significant adverse feedback on this specific communication, and we are in close touch with all customers. On the contrary, consent by conduct very much allows customers to say that they don’t wish to transfer. A customer who has already consented can also exit any time after the transfer in the same manner as the normal closure of a bank account,"" said the Citibank statement.

Three hundred companies saw their value increase in the last year, of which 18 doubled in value, and six — led by four Adani group firms — saw a rise of Rs 1 lakh crore.

“The report could not have come at a better time. A rare bright spot when most economies are staring at a slowdown, India is poised for sustained growth. Indian companies and their leadership deserve kudos for their contribution in taking the country where it is today. They will play an even bigger role in making India the world’s third-largest economy over the next decade,” said Amitabh Chaudhry, MD and CEO, Axis Bank.

“With a total market value of $2.7 trillion, which is equal to India’s current GDP, these firms make up the backbone of India’s economy. These 500 companies had combined sales of $820 billion (Rs 666.2 lakh crore) and employed 7.3 million people, which is more than the working age population of the UAE (United Arab Emirates),” said Anas Rahman Junaid, MD and Chief Researcher, Hurun India.

Speaking to MoneyControl, Krishnamurthy said banks will grow at least 1.5X the economy.

“If you study the history of banks in India over decades, banks typically grow faster than the economy. The entire supply of growth, which is the advances side of the balance sheet, banks have to help,” he said.

""All banks are fighting for a larger share of deposits and for this, the lending interest rates are going up, which will bring in more money, and banks can then funnel the same to productive outcomes,” he added.

Talking about a megatrend, Krishnamurthy said formalisation of the economy will push the wealth-creation power of the financial sector.

“More of the economy is getting formalised, cash trades and other financial transactions, which were not visible earlier are getting into the banking system. This will benefit the banks. This will also result in the boom of payments and wealth management businesses as well as create more jobs.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Our experience of attending the Axis Bank analyst day was positive as there seems to be a clear priority on profitability and consistency. Management sounded confident of maintaining operational performance as cushion on NIM would continue while medium term guidance is to reduce opex/assets by end FY25 to ~2% (FY22 was 2.18%) by focusing on segments that are opex lighter (CBG, BuB, SBB etc.). Loan growth would largely hinge on deposit accretion and as per AXSB system deposit growth could remain weak for 2-3 quarters, however, profitability would not be compromised. CITI acquisition may be a bit delayed and could see fruition post Q4FY23. Near term growth would be funded through internal accruals and capital raise would be evaluated only after CITI acquisition. Over medium term, bank would like to deliver on aspirational ROE of 18%. For FY24E/25E, we lower opex by 4.5%/6.5% and raise PAT by 5.5%/8.0%. With FY25E RoA/RoE at 1.6%/16% for AXSB, if earnings quality sustains each quarter, discount to ICICIB should narrow from 29% to 20%.



Outlook

AXSB remains one of our top picks with compelling valuation at 1.8x and we maintain multiple at 2.3x on Sep’24 ABV. Reiterate BUY and slightly raise TP from Rs1080 to Rs1100.

With the stock indices touching a new high, the earnings growth for Nifty 50 index constituents will taper to 21.2 percent in FY24 from 22.9 percent expected for FY23, according to Bloomberg consensus expectations.

The decline is mainly due to an expanded base and slowing of export revenue amid fears of a recession that could affect demand.

However, the performance of the energy sector, which is closely linked to crude oil prices, will hold the key, said Mayuresh Joshi, head of equity research at William O’Neil & Co.

Controlled inflation, a peaked out bad-loan cycle and good agricultural output will lend some support to the Nifty 50, said G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics Research.

Bajaj Finserv, Bharti Airtel, Axis Bank, Adani Enterprises and Tata Motors are likely to be the biggest contributors to EPS growth in the Nifty 50 index in FY24, according to a Moneycontrol analysis.

A real turnaround in EPS growth is expected in Axis Bank and Tata Motors, according to Bloomberg data. On the other hand, EPS growth is narrowing for Bharti Airtel and Adani Enterprises.

How the valuations stack up:

According to Bloomberg, the Nifty Index’s PE is expected to contract to 19.2 times in FY24 from 22.9 times in FY23 mainly on account of higher earnings for the next financial year.



According to Gautam Duggad, head of research – institutional equities at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, the Nifty price to earnings for the next 12 months at 20x is well within the 10-year average of 19.6 times because earnings have caught up while the markets were little changed for the past 12 months.

With earnings growth of 16-17 percent for FY24, the markets should, by and large, reflect underlying earnings without much de-rating/re-rating.

On a granular basis, Axis Bank and Adani Enterprises are trading at higher valuations than their 10-year average, while Bharti Airtel, ONGC and Tata Motors are trading at steeper discounts.",320,0.6298490464687347

Various digital capabilities along with partnerships in the ecosystem are driving strong growth and helping the bank emerge as a robust customer acquisition engine. AXSB has been reporting strong growth in Retail and Mid-corporate segment, which along with MSME, would remain the key growth drivers. While estimating margins to remain healthy, AXSB expects cost-to-assets ratio to moderate at ~2% by the end of FY25. This coupled with a benign credit cost would aid RoE expansion.



Outlook

We estimate AXSB to deliver FY24E RoA/RoE of 1.8%/18.1%. We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock with a TP of INR1,050 (2.0x FY24E ABV + INR95 for subs).

S&P Global Ratings on November 21 upgraded private lender Axis Bank's long-term issue rating on their senior unsecured notes to 'BBB-' from 'BB+' on improving asset quality.

It also raised its long-term and short-term issuer credit rating on the lender to 'BBB-/A-3' from 'BB+/B'. They kept outlook 'Stable' for the bank.

""Our upgrade reflects Axis Bank's good asset quality and our expectation that the bank will maintain that over the next one to two years. India's robust economic growth should support borrowers' creditworthiness,"" the ratings agency said in a press release.

On the stable outlook front, S&P Global said Axis Bank will maintain its strong market position in India's banking sector over the next two years. The bank's capitalization should stay comfortable, notwithstanding an expected decline from the acquisition of Citigroup Inc.'s retail portfolio in India.

The ratings agency predicts Axis Bank's weak loans, defined as nonperforming loans and standard restructured loans (including loans restructured due to COVID), could decline to 2.5 percent-3.0 percent of total customer loans by end-March 2023, from 3.7 percent as of March 31, 2022.

COVID restructured loans have also fallen to 0.4 percent of total loans as of end-September 2022, from 0.6 percent as of Dec. 31, 2021. Credit costs could likely stay below 1 percent, while asset quality risks remain contained.

The higher interest rates and high inflation usually painful for small and midsize enterprise sector and low-income households. However, in their base case of moderate interest-rate hikes, these risks are manageable for Axis Bank, the agency added.

""The bank's ample provisioning and capital buffers can help absorb a moderate rise in credit stress. The bank's tighter risk management should also support credit quality. Axis Bank's asset quality is likely to stay better than the Indian sector average and comparable to that of similar rated international peers over the next two years,"" they said.

The agency had warned that they may lower the ratings on Axis Bank if the bank's asset quality deteriorates sharply. This could happen if economic conditions in India deteriorate, resulting in asset quality stress for the bank.

An upgrade of Axis Bank is unlikely over the next one to two years. This is because an upgrade will require an improvement in the bank's financial profile as well as the sovereign credit rating on India, S&P said.

Earlier this year, the ratings agency had revised private lender's outlook from ""stable"" to ""positive"", citing improved asset quality.

While, it affirmed 'BB+' long-term and 'B' short-term issuer credit ratings on the bank under revised criteria.",434,0.2822844386100769

Companies providing software and other technology support like cloud services to the financial system are trickling down to a few, which can create major systemic risks later, according to a top banker.

""Companies which are providing software, platforms and cloud systems to the banking and financial system are trickling down to a few,"" Axis Bank managing director and chief executive Amitabh Chaudhry said addressing an event on corporate governance.

It was organised by ex-Sebi chairman M Damodaran's advocacy Excellence Enablers on Thursday.

Going a step further, he warned that ""the country's banking system now relies on two three big companies for their software service requirements, and this can lead to emerging risks in case these companies stop investing and ensuring that those platforms are adaptable to this new world"".

Chaudhry said such concentration is leading to pressure on the banking system to invest in technology in order to take care of the macro requirements.

""We have to bear all the cost. Again, it comes down to someone doing something and we've to ensure that there is sustainability and resilience. So, the inter-connectedness is causing problems now,"" he added.

Noting the dominant role of large non-banking technology companies, or bigtech, and financial technology firms in the financial system, the Reserve Bank had in June issued draft guidelines on outsourcing of IT and IT-enabled services by the regulated entities.

The regulator's aim is to ensure effective management of risks in outsourcing IT activities, such as network security, cloud computing, application service providers etc.

In the past, the Reserve Bank had warned that bigtech can scale up rapidly and pose risks to financial stability, which can arise from increased disintermediation of incumbent institutions.

The RBI paper had also issued a draft paper specifying norms pertaining to the use of cloud computing services and outsourcing of the security operations centre. It had then proposed that entities be required to set up a risk management framework for the outsourcing of IT and IT-enabled services, and the risks associated with it.

Such complex intertwined operational linkages between bigtech firms and financial institutions can lead to concentration and contagion risks and issues relating to potential anti-competitive behaviour, the central bank had said in the June 2022 edition of the financial stability report.

The RBI paper has said owing to their large size and clientele, big tech poses serious barriers in creating a level-playing field to promote innovation in financial technology and have the financial muscle to withstand competition. Also, due to their adoption as third-party service providers, they have become the underlying platform on which a host of services are offered.

""This uniquely positions bigtech to easily acquire cross-functional databases that can be exploited for generating innovative product offerings, making them dominant players in the market,"" the RBI paper had warned and pointed out that going forward, regulations will need to be mindful of the new inter-linkages that bigtech might create with the existing financial institutions.

Given that fintechs are here to stay, innovation will invariably be ahead of regulations, Chaudhry said, adding due to this, regulations will continue to increase hereon to push more oversight over newer types of businesses.

With regulations and supervision expected to rise many-fold from a technology perspective, the onus on entities will also increase and they will need to invest more in technology to protect against issues, such as cyber security, which is already being seen, he said.",574,-0.5022767707705498

Banks have been aggressively accumulating deposits by offering higher, lucrative interest rates to depositors following four consecutive repo rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The central bank is fighting a tough battle to contain persistently high retail inflation, which is hitting common households hard.

The impact of aggressive deposit mobilisation is likely to weigh on banks’ net interest margins (NIM) in the coming quarters, banking experts and analysts told Moneycontrol on October 31. In banking parlance, NIM refers to the amount of money that a bank earns in interest on loans compared to the amount it pays in interest on deposits. It is an indicator of a bank's profitability and growth.

“There are expectations of a rate hike in the next monetary policy, which will still allow banks to pass on the incremental cost to advances linked to the benchmark, and deposit rates will continue to rise with a lag, protecting the NIM for FY23,” said Aditya Acharekar, associate director at CareEdge.

“However, some impact on margins may be seen in the first half of FY24,” he added.

Rate transmission and NIM

Rate cues from the RBI are transmitted to the economy when lenders adjust their lending and deposit rates based on the RBI's rate actions. For instance, if the RBI hikes the repo rate, then banks will have to borrow short-term funds at a higher cost from the central bank. Banks are also expected to pass on the benefit to borrowers by offering high-interest rates.

Often, monetary transmission happens based on the prevailing liquidity situation. Typically, banks are quick to pass on rate hikes to consumers through loans, but a pass-through to deposits comes with a lag. For much of FY23, banks took advantage of this scenario, which helped them sustain or improve their NIM.

“We are prepared to take a hit on NIMs next fiscal year, but that is an obvious situation given that we have to fund the credit growth through deposits,” said a banker with a private bank on the condition of anonymity. “Mobilising deposits looks like the way forward.”

According to Arun Malhotra, founding partner and portfolio manager of CapGrow Capital Advisors, banks will have to forego NIMs as they could be compressed in the range of 20-25 bps in the short to medium term. Banks, according to Malhotra, may need to increase spreads on fresh repo-linked loans in the next two to four quarters.

In the July-September quarter, HDFC Bank’s core NIM was at 4.1 percent on total assets, and 4.3 percent based on interest-earning assets. Axis Bank’s NIM was at 3.96 percent, while Kotak Mahindra Bank’s NIM stood at 5.17 percent in the reporting quarter. Relatively smaller peers IndusInd Bank and IDBI Bank reported NIMs of 4.24 percent and 4.37 percent, respectively.

The rate picture

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, recently made an upward revision in retail term deposit interest rates on amounts below Rs 2 crore, by up to 80 basis points. One bps equals one-hundredth of a percentage point. Indeed, most banks have increased their FD rates following the RBI’s 190 bps repo rate hike in the current cycle to rein in inflation.

According to bankers and experts, the ‘war’ for deposits is likely to continue as the RBI hikes rates further and as credit growth continues to expand. This could happen via aggressive deposit mobilisation in the coming months, said bankers. Analysts and economists expect the RBI to increase the repo rate to 6.50 percent by March from 5.90 percent currently.

Sumant Kathpalia, managing director and chief executive officer of IndusInd Bank, said that the lender would continue with its strategy to granularise deposits. The bank’s liabilities will be priced 50-to-75 bps higher than the market, he said at a conference call after the July-September earnings.

On average, banks have raised interest rates in the range of 25-80 bps across tenors. Fixed deposit rates of top banks in the three-year to five-year tenor for amounts below Rs 1 crore currently stand between 5.65 percent and 6.75 percent.

“It is natural for banks to be aggressive as liquidity remains constrained and credit growth is way ahead of deposit growth,” said Hemali Dhame, associate vice-president, of research, at Kotak Securities. “Many banks have been aggressive already, and some have reached a point where a further increase in rates will cause a passthrough in borrower rates.”

Rush for deposits

The primary reason for the rush for deposits is the tightening liquidity in the banking system due to heavy currency leakage and heightened spending on account of the festive season. The RBI’s dollar sales in the foreign exchange market to prevent the rupee’s depreciation have also tightened liquidity.

The mismatch between credit growth and deposit growth has forced most banks to offer high rates on deposits and increase promotional activities for the same.

“If we look at the July-September banking results for FY23, one consistent finding is that advances are growing faster than deposits,” said Punit Patni, a research analyst at Swastika Investment.

“As a result, we anticipate banks raising their deposit rates in order to maintain CASA (current account savings account) deposits or raise money through term deposits. Additionally, due to the dearth of liquidity and good credit growth demand, all the banks are expected to be aggressive in mobilising deposits.”

This trend is likely to continue as credit growth continues to expand, interest rate hikes become more entrenched and liquidity in the system dries up further.

“We are expecting inflationary pressures to persist, and so rates may keep climbing till the end of this financial year,” said Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer at BankBazaar.com. “We may see small banks offer 8 percent or more (FD rates) during this period. If inflation persists, large banks will follow the trend.”

Analysts and industry experts said that the impact of the deposit rate hikes will also depend on the bank's liability and asset profile. Banks having granular, retail-based liability and floating advances are better placed and will witness a minimal impact on their NIMs, they said.

Jindal Haria, a director at India Ratings and Research, said that most banks would have to continue to increase deposit rates till they are confident deposit growth will mirror loan growth. NIMs, however, could expand some more before deposit pricing catches up fully, he said.

Fund-raising to continue

Apart from mobilising deposits, experts also expect banks to tap the market for funds to meet credit demand.

“Banks will have to raise funds from the capital markets through infra bonds, sub-debt and perpetual bonds quickly for long-term funding requirements to augment credit growth as CDs (certificates of deposit) and FDs may not match their long-term funding requirements,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.

Further, banks that are not able to get sufficient funds through FDs and CDs due to tight liquidity conditions will have to continuously increase rates to compete with their peers, added Srinivasan.",1196,0.11236542065938314

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB reported a PAT of INR53.3b, up 70% YoY (26% beat), largely driven by 6% beat in NII and lower provisions, which declined 51% YoY. The business registered robust growth of 18% YoY and 4.2% QoQ growth in advances. The SME segment grew 28% YoY/8.7% QoQ. The large and midcorporate segment also came back with a 6% QoQ growth, after witnessing a decline in 1QFY23. Fresh slippages moderated to INR33.8b, which coupled with healthy recoveries and upgrades enabled an improvement in asset quality ratios. Restructured book remains controlled at 0.38% of customer assets. Buoyed by a stellar performance in 2QFY23, we revise PAT for FY23E/24E by 17%/11%, respectively. This is driven by healthy NII trends, moderating opex (on the back of improved efficiency) and reduction in credit cost.



Outlook

We expect AXSB to deliver FY24E RoA/RoE of 1.8%/18.1% in FY24E. We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock.

Sharekhan's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank reported all-round beat in terms of NII, PPoP & earnings. The bank reported a PAT of Rs. 5,330 crore (up by 70% y-o-y and 29% q-o-q) significantly above the consensus and our expectation driven by strong PPoP growth (30% y-o-y/ 31% q-o-q) and lower credit cost. NII growth was robust at 31% y-o-y / 10% q-o-q aided by strong loan growth (18% y-o-y/ 4% q-o-q) and sharp improvement in margins by 36 bps q-o-q and 57 bps y-o-y at 3.96%. Operating profits (PPoP) grew at a healthy pace by 30% y-o-y / 31% q-o-q led by strong NII growth and higher core fee income (20% y-o-y /8% q-o-q) despite higher opex growth. Opex to Avg. assets stood at 2.3% vs 2.2% q-o-q and y-o-y. Slippages were lower by 8% q-o-q (2.2% annualised vs 2.4% q-o-q) coupled with healthy recoveries along with higher write offs (12% q-o-q), asset quality saw sharp improvement with both GNPA and NNPA ratios declining by 26 bps q-o-q and 13 bps q-o-q to 2.50% and 0.51% during the quarter. Restructured book stood at 0.41% of advances vs 0.49% q-o-q. The ‘BB and below’ rated book reduced sequentially to Rs. 7,987 crore vs Rs. 8,173 crore q-o-q.

Outlook

The stock currently trades at 1.7x/1.5x its FY2023E and FY2024E core BV. We maintain our buy rating on the stock with revised SOTP-based price target of Rs. 1,040. We believe its valuations are reasonable and risk-reward is attractive considering improving earnings outlook going forward.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB saw its strongest quarter with core earnings beating estimates by ~14% led by beat on NIM, fees and asset quality. NIM boost was driven by better loan yields that was a function of higher repo linked pool, increased retail share, focus on rupee loans and shedding of RIDF bonds. Loan growth too was better at 4.2% QoQ mainly led by corporate/SME although deposit growth was slower. Asset quality improved again with lower slippages driving GNPA decline of 26bps QoQ while OTR reduced by 11bps to 0.65%. As per the bank, Citi acquisition may materialize in Q4FY23. We upgrade FY23/24E earnings by ~30%/10% due to higher NII and lower provisions. However, our multiple is maintained at 2.3x as RoE in FY24/25E does not surpass 15%. Levers for RoE expansion are fall in opex/assets and higher loan/deposit accretion.

Outlook

Re-rating beyond 2.3x would hinge on RoA/RoE gap to ICICIB reducing. Rolling forward to Sep’24 ABV we raise TP from Rs940 to Rs1080. Reiterate BUY.

Emkay Global Financial' research report on AXIS Bank

Despite the relatively-moderate credit growth, Axis Bank reported strong core profit growth at 43% YoY/19% QoQ, on the back of robust margin expansion and contained opex, albeit partly offset by a subdued treasury performance. This, coupled with continued lower LLP, led to the 24% beat on PAT, which came in at Rs53.3bn. Credit growth was comparatively modest at 18% YoY/4% QoQ vs peers’ (23% YoY/6% QoQ), due to sluggish growth in the retail book at 23% YoY/3% QoQ despite a lower base. However, NIM expanded 57bps YoY/36bps QoQ to 3.96%, mainly on higher growth in the SME/mid-corporate book, higher LDR & re-pricing benefit. Mgmt aims to sustain margins at current levels, but reckons that cost pressure will increase as deposit growth accelerates. Factoring-in the better & faster than expected delivery on margins, coupled with contained opex, we expect the bank to clock healthy core-profitability CAGR at 25% over FY23-25E. This along with continued lower LLP, given higher specific + contingent provision buffer, should drive-up earnings. Thus, we revise our earnings by 15%/11%/6% for FY23E/24E/25E.

Outlook

We retain our long-term BUY rating on the stock. We revise our TP to Rs1,110/share (vs Rs1,020 earlier) valuing the standalone bank at 1.8x Sep-24E ABV and subsidiaries at Rs82/share, given the potential steady improvement in FY23-25E RoA/RoE to 1.6- 1.7%/16% (without factoring-in any capital-raise), respectively. That said, the bank will need to consistently deliver on growth/core profitability and maintain management stability for a re-rating.

Axis Bank, on October 20, posted a 70 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in its net profit to Rs 5,329.77 crore in the July-September quarter, up from Rs 3,133 crore in the same quarter of the previous financial year.

The profit growth came higher than a 45 percent increase in net profit for the fiscal second quarter that analysts estimated.

The bank’s net interest income (NII) went up by 31 percent on YoY basis to Rs 10,360.3 crore, from Rs 7,900 crore in Q2FY22. It was Rs 9,384 crore in Q1FY23. The net interest margin (NIM) was at 3.96 percent, which is a rise of 57 basis points (bps) YoY and 36 bps rise QoQ.

Here are the top five key points analysts have highlighted from the private lender's Q2FY23 earnings:

Profit after tax (PAT)

After the robust growth in PAT of the private lender in the reporting quarter, most analysts have revised their estimates for the current financial year and next financial year slightly upward. The net profit of the private lender grew 70 percent in the quarter under review.

Some analysts pegged PAT in the current financial year to rise in the range of 9 percent and 17 percent, and in the net financial year, it is seen in the 2-11 percent range.

""Buoyed by a stellar performance in 2QFY23, we revise PAT for FY23E/24E by 17 percent/11 percent, respectively. This is driven by healthy NII trends, moderating open (on the back of improved efficiency) and reduction in credit cost,"" Motilal Oswal Investment Services said in a report.

B&K Securities said the performance of the private lender could also be influenced by the potential capital raise, though the bank sounded confident of a capital raise only in the next financial year.

Treasury Income

The private lender, in the reporting quarter, reported a sharp fall in treasury losses and it stood at Rs 86 crore compared to a loss of Rs 667 crore in the previous quarter and a profit of Rs 473 crore for the same quarter last year.

The bank officials, during the earnings conference call, said that the mark-to-market (MTM) is largely in their corporate bond book. The rise in yields on corporate bonds have impacted their MTM.

Eighty percent of the bank’s corporate bonds are rated AA+ and above, and 96 percent is rated A- and above. ""We do not expect an economic loss on this book. All else being equal, the pull to par period on this book is about four to five years,"" officials added.

On this front, analysts believe that treasury losses of Axis Bank will likely remain moderate in the upcoming quarters on stable long-term yields on government securities and corporate bonds.

""Treasury losses are momentary as the bank has to make MTM adjustments. We may see some or minor gains in the treasury, going forward,"" said Ajit Kabi, Equity Research Analyst (Institutional, Banks & NBFCs), at LKP Securities Limited.

Deposit growth

Analysts were disappointed with the deposit growth of the bank, but expect it to rise in the next two quarters. ""The deposit growth of the bank in the current quarter is below par. The bank needs to mobilise deposits further to maintain CDR below 90 percent. We expect the deposit growth to revamp from next quarter,"" Kabi of LKP Securities added.

In the reporting quarter, the private lender's deposit stood at Rs 8.2 lakh crore, and growth remained below par of 10.1 percent YoY and 0.9 percent on-quarter.

The CASA (QAB) stood at 43 percent and CRAR stood at 16.42 percent with CET 1 of 14.55 percent. Additionally, LCR of 121 percent with an excess SLR of Rs 55,500 crore.

""The bank needs to grow the deposits to maintain a CDR of below 90 percent,"" said LKP Securities in a report.

Net interest margins (NIM)

The bank’s net interest income stood at Rs 10,400 crore; up 17 percent on-year and 6 percent on-quarter. The bank’s NIMs expanded by 36 bps to 3.96 percent on the back of slightly higher cost of funds (4.09 percent) and cost of deposits (3.8 percent). Non-interest income grew by 31 percent on-quarter.

The management hopes to achieve structural improvement in NIM going forward, owing to improvement in mix of loans versus investments on the assets side, higher share of low-cost deposits and reduction in RIDF bonds (which have negative spread) as incremental allocations have stopped since the bank is PSL-compliant.

""Our operating margins and NIM are in the zone of the best-performing franchises. We see acceleration in our focus segments and there is all-round improvement in all key performance metrics on deposits and assets,"" officials said in a conference call.

Asset quality

Most analysts were happy with the improvement in the asset quality in the reporting quarter. This is because gross slippages declined 8 percent on-quarter to Rs 33,800 crore.

Consequently, net NPAs declined 13 bps QoQ to 51 basis points.

The restructured pool reported lower meaningfully at Rs 30,000 crore (38 bps of GCA) v/s Rs 3.400 crore in the previous quarter. The bank carries a provision of 23 percent on restructured loans, which is in excess of regulatory limits. The corporate segment has 26 bps of loan book under restructuring, while Retail and SME segments carry restructuring of 55 bps and 2 bps, respectively.",884,0.3861827684773339

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after June quarter earnings:

Motilal Oswal

Axis Bank delivered stellar performance in the September quarter, driven by sharp margin expansion and a significant decline in provisions along with improving trends in cost metrics.

Business growth recovered in the quarter under review after a sequential decline in the previous quarter. Asset quality continues to improve, aided by moderation in slippages and healthy recoveries, and upgrades. Restructured book moderated further while higher provisioning buffer provides comfort.

Buoyed by an exemplary performance, we revise profit after tax for FY23/24 by 17/11 percent respectively. We estimate Axis Bank to deliver FY24 return on assets/equity (RoA/RoE) of 1.8/18.1 percent respectively. We reiterate our buy rating with a target price of Rs 975 (2.0x FY24 adjusted book value)

Sharekhan

The bank is looking for a sustainable growth path in terms of loan growth, led by retail, SME, and mid-corporate segments in a granular manner along with a focus on mobilisation of low-cost granular liability and higher spending on tech. New digital product initiatives, both in asset and liability segments, are growing well, as reflected in strong acquisition growth.

With high provision coverage ratio and a strong balance sheet, the bank can absorb shocks from any unanticipated future risk. We believe its valuations are reasonable, given structural improvement visible in the franchise, and the bank provides an attractive risk-reward ratio.

LKP Research

We value the standalone bank at a price to book value of 2.1x FY24 adjusted book value per share of Rs 478 and arrive at a price target of Rs 1,005. We recommend buy with a potential upside of 22 percent from current levels.

Morgan Stanley

We have maintained ‘overweight’ call on the stock and raised the target to Rs 1,150.

Deposit growth is muted, but expect acceleration by the second half of the fiscal.

We expect the stock to re-rate amid higher margin/better operating leverage.

JPMorgan

We have upgraded the rating of Axis Bank to overweight and raised the target price to Rs 990 from Rs 780 per share.

A 36 basis point sequential improvement in net interest margin is a key positive surprise and margin improvement drives 16 percent increase in FY23/24 earnings per share.

Valuations are attractive, and currently 25 percent below peer group.

Goldman Sachs

We keep a buy rating on Axis Bank with a target of Rs 1,053 per share. Gains are likely to sustain and push up pre-provision operating profit-return on asset.

The September quarter should drive earnings upgrade and re-rate valuation multiple.

At 09:17 hrs Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 856.35, up Rs 30.15, or 3.65 percent on the BSE.

Axis Bank chief Amitabh Chaudhry on Thursday asserted the lender has followed all rules and regulations in the deal to acquire a 20 per cent stake in Max Life Insurance.

The statement comes against the backdrop of two orders by the insurance sector watchdog Irdai in the last few days, wherein Max has been fined Rs 3 crore while a penalty of Rs 2 crore has been imposed on the bank regarding the deal on concerns over valuations.

''We believe all the rules and regulations have been followed through the entire deal process,'' Chaudhry, the bank's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, told reporters on a call.

He also said the bank is engaged with Irdai, and is very committed to the partnership both as a promoter and as a bancassurance partner.

The bank, which has completed acquiring 13 per cent of the overall 20 per cent stake it has been allowed to purchase, is committed to increase the stake, he added.

''We believe we have done everything the right way. Irdai has a different view. We are in conversation with them,'' he said.

When asked if it has received any communication from the markets regulator Sebi as well regarding the deal, Chaudhry replied in the negative.

He said the bank's internal probe in the insider trading matter involving executives from its asset management business has revealed that one of the persons has violated the securities law but the amount involved is not substantial.

The bank has shared the report with the capital markets regulator, and is in touch with Sebi for further actions, he said.

Meanwhile, on the over Rs 12,000 crore deal to acquire the domestic retail business of American lender Citi, Chaudhry exuded confidence of finishing the deal by end of March 2023 but also said that it may slip into the June quarter.

He said the business is performing as per the assumptions made during valuing the business, and at present, there is no question of invoking the clause where a provision has been made to decrease the valuations if there is a certain level of attrition in the metrices.",356,-0.9968802134195963

Strong net profit

The bank’s profit after tax grew 70 percent year-on-year to Rs 5,330 crore in the July-September quarter, up from Rs 3,133 crore in the same quarter of the previous financial year.

The profit growth was higher than estimates. Analysts were expecting a 45 percent increase in net profit for the fiscal second quarter.

Analysts were expecting the bank’s net profit for Q2FY23 at Rs 4,561 crore on the back of a 25 percent increase in net interest income.

Net interest income (NII), or the difference between interest earned and interest expended, rose nearly 31 percent year-on-year to Rs 10,360 crore in the reporting quarter from Rs 7,901 crore last year.

2. Improved asset quality

The asset quality of the lender improved during the second quarter of the financial year 2022-23. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) were at 2.50 percent of gross advances as on September 30, 2022, which declined by 103 basis points on-year and 26 bps on-quarter. Net non-performing assets were at 0.51 percent of net advances as on September 30, 2022, a drop of 57 bps on-year and 13 bps on-quarter.

Axis Bank on October 20 posted a 70 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in its net profit, for the quarter ending September (Q2FY23).

Net profit grew 29% QoQ.

It reported a net profit of Rs 5,329.77 crore for the quarter under review. It had logged a profit of Rs 3,133 for Q2FY22 and Rs 4,125 crore for Q1FY23.

The YoY increase in net profit beat street estimates as analysts had expected the bank to report a 45 percent YoY surge for the quarter, supported by healthy core income growth and strengthening asset quality.

Its net interest income (NII) went up by 31 percent YoY to Rs 10,360.3 crore, from Rs 7,900 crore in Q2FY22. It was Rs 9,384 crore in Q1FY23. Its net interest margin (NIM) was at 3.96%, which is a rise of 57 bps YoY and 36 bps rise QoQ.

Its provisions stood at Rs 549.78 crore in Q2FY23, which is a fall of 68 percent from Rs 1,735 crore in Q2FY22.

Analysts had expected provisions to halve from the year-ago period, which would lead to a boost in profit for the quarter ended September. Bad loan ratios were expected to tick down.

However, provisions had gone up 52% QoQ from Rs 359.36 crore in Q1FY23.

The bank's gross NPA was 2.5% in Q2FY23 against 3.53% in Q2FY22, and 2.76% in Q1FY23. It was a 103bps fall YoY and a 26 bps fall QoQ. Its net NPA stood at 0.51% in Q2FY23, against 1.08% in Q2FY22 and 0.64% in Q1FY23.

Its gross slippage ratio declined by 156 bps YoY and 17 bps QoQ, and net slippage ratio was at 0.32%, which was a fall of 14 bps YoY.

Axis Bank issued 1.04 million credit cards in the September quarter, while spends going up 70% YoY. Its retail loans grew 22% YoY and 3% QoQ. Small business banking (SBB) and rural loans grew at 69% and 46% year on year (YoY) respectively.

In a press statement, Amitabh Chaudhry, MD and CEO of the bank, was quoted on the bank's expansion plans. ""We are building a high-quality, granular franchise with the customer at the centre, while extending our network and services to semi-urban and rural geographies to tap into the Bharat opportunity,"" the statement read.",386,0.46331900358200073

Axis Bank Ltd is expected to report a 45 percent year-on-year surge in its net profit for the July-September quarter, supported by healthy core income growth and strengthening asset quality, when the private lender reports its Q2 performance on October 20.

The bank’s net profit for Q2FY23 is expected to be around Rs 4,561 crore on the back of a 25 percent increase in net interest income to Rs 9,921 crore, as per the average of estimates of eight brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.

Analysts expect the private bank to show loan growth of around 17 percent but still lower than its larger peers such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. “However, this will partially be compensated by better NIMs–given rate transmission, we expect front-ended NIM expansion for the bank,” analysts at Elara Securities Ltd wrote in a note.

Axis Bank’s net interest margin could show a larger improvement as the lender has passed on policy rate hikes onto its loan rates. In short, the lender has not only disbursed more loans but also earned more from them during the quarter.

Mixed operating metrics

While core interest income could show strong growth, non-interest income could be tepid owing to pressure on treasury income. But, unlike in the previous quarter, the bank may not witness a large mark-to-market hit on its bond portfolio as yields slipped during the quarter. When bond yields fall, prices rise and vice-versa.

Analysts at Nuvama Research, formerly Edelweiss Securities, expect non-interest income to slip by a percent for the July-September quarter. This, along with elevated operating expenses, could limit the growth in operating profit to roughly 19 percent.

“Operating expense growth to continue at 4 percent QoQ resulting in 17 percent YoY growth,” ICICI Securities’ analysts wrote in a note.

Amid stellar loan growth, deposits may expand at a slower pace, analysts said. While Axis Bank won’t be an outlier in slower deposit growth, the share of low-cost current and savings acccount (CASA) in total deposits would be the key. As of April-June, the bank’s CASA deposits formed 43.7 percent of total.

Asset quality boost

The strong point in Axis Bank’s earnings would be the persistent improvement in its asset quality.

Analysts see provisions getting almost halved from the year-ago period, which would boost profits for the September quarter. Bad loan ratios are expected to tick down, partly due to upgrades and also due to strong loan growth.

Fresh slippages, too, are expected to fall by at least 5 percent sequentially. In Q1FY23, Axis Bank’s slippage ratio was 2.19 percent and this is likely to slide to 2 percent in July-September.

“Also, there could be higher recoveries and upgrades QoQ, which should result in lower GNPA QoQ,” according to ICICI Securities.

In-line earnings performance would give credence to the 16 percent gain in the bank’s shares in the past three months. That said, investors would focus on the management’s commentary on the progress of the acquisition of Citibank’s credit card business. Outlook on operating expenses and capital raising plans would also be watched by investors.

The country's third largest private sector lender in a communication on its website stated that the benchmark one-year MCLR is up by 25 basis points to 8.35 per cent with effect from October 18, 2022.

The hike in MCLR rates by Axis Bank follows peer lenders increasing lending rates in response to a 50 basis increase in the repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on September 30. Earlier, Axis Bank charged 8.10 per cent on one-year tenor MCLR--which is the benchmark for the lenders to price most of the consumer loans such as auto, personal and home.

Among other tenors from overnight to one-three and-six months, the new rates are in the range of 8.15 -8.30 per cent, up by 0.25 per cent each. The two year MCLR comes at 8.45 per cent and three year tenor will be 8.50 per cent. These rates will be valid till the next review, Axis Bank said. A day earlier, SBI, Federal Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank had raised the MCLR rates.

Apart from MCLR rates, banks raised their external benchmark repo linked lending rates by 50 basis points in an immediate response to RBI's repo rate action last month. The repo rate now stands at 5.90 per cent. Since May this year, RBI has hiked the repo rate by a total 190 basis points. The increase in the repo-linked lending rates and the MCLRs has made loans costlier for the consumers. The repo rate now stands at 5.90 per cent. Since May this year, RBI has hiked the repo rate by a total 190 basis points.

From October 1, 2019, all banks migrated to an interest rate linked to an external benchmark such as RBI's repo rate or Treasury Bill yield for a better transmission of rate revisions. The old rates are based on the MCLRs which are determined by factors such as deposit rates, repo rates, operating costs and the cost of maintaining the cash reserve ratio (CRR).",357,0.6778638362884521

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) has increased penalty imposed on Max Life Insurance for violation of norms with respect to transfer of shares in Axis Bank-Max Life Insurance deal. The revised penalty of Rs 3 crore is imposed on Max Life, while a penalty of Rs 2 crore has been levied on Axis Bank.

The total penalty of Rs 5 crore has to be remitted within 21 days, IRDAI said.

With this new order, the earlier one on IRDAI website remain replaced.

Responding to the same, Max Financial Services in an exchange filing said that the company had taken appropriate approvals from its shareholders for cementing the long-term strategic partnership with Axis Bank.

""Max Life is examining IRDAI order and will take all appropriate actions in this regard,"" it said.

Earlier, IRDAI asked Axis Bank to pay Rs 2 crore penalty in 21 days, which included Rs 1 crore penalty on Max Life Insurance. Now, this amount has been increased.

Last year, Max Group sold a 13 percent stake in Max Life Insurance Company to the country's third largest private sector lender Axis Bank, which would then become a co-promoter of the insurer.

In 2020, Axis Bank and Max Financial Services had first announced the deal under which Axis Bank proposed to acquire 29 percent stake in Max Life Insurance. Also, the transaction provided for a ‘Put option’ under which Axis Bank could sell all its shares to Max Financial Services at Rs 294 per share if value creation option was not consummated.

On June 26, 2020 CNBC-TV18 had reported on the Insurance Regulator seeking clarification from Max Life Insurance on some deal contours. Queries sent by IRDAI were regarding the valuation and ‘Put option’ involved in the deal structure.",304,-0.17192569375038147

Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) on October 14 said it has imposed a total of Rs 3 crore penalty on Max Life Insurance Company due to violation of rules in the Axis Bank-Max Life deal.

The insurance regulatory stated that historical transactions between Axis Bank and Max Financial are in violation of IRDAI code.

Due to rules violation, it has directed Axis Bank to pay Rs 2 crore within a period of 21 days.

""By undertaking the transactions of transfer of shares with the promoters/ shareholders of the insurer (Max Life Insurance Co Ltd) in violation of the directions of the Authority, the Corporate Agent, Axis Bank Ltd has circumvented the maximum limits of commission or remuneration or reward as stipulated in IRDAI (Payment of Commission or Remuneration or Reward to insurance Agents and Insurance Intermediaries) Regulations, 2016 read with Reg 18(1) of IRDAI (Registration of Corporate Agents) Regulations,2015... The total penalty amount of Rs 2 crore (Rupees Two Crore only) shall be remitted by Axis Bank Limited within a period of 21 days... ,"" the insurance regulatory body noted.

The penalty is imposed on Axis Bank for violation of norms with respect to transfer of shares, IRDAI stated.

IRDAI, in its order, noted that from the submissions made by the insurer and the documents available on record of the authority, ""it is evident that the Axis Bank has sold its stake of 0.998 percent shares of Max Life in March 2021 to MFSL & MSI at Rs 166/- per share.""

Subsequently, in March-April 2021, Axis Bank and its group entities acquired 12.002 percemt shares from MFSL at price range of Rs 31.51 — Rs 32.12 per share. This, IRDAI added, was not in compliance with the directions issued by it, wherein it was clearly directed that the ""The basis for determining or calculating the Fair Market Value(FMV) for allotment of shares, transfer of shares among the shareholders needs to be clear and needs to be uniformly followed. A suitable provision to this effect be incorporated in the RSHA and any other related agreement"" (emphasis added)"".

Furthermore, IRDAI highlighted that Max Life (insurer) has not complied with the directions. ""The said act of the insurer establishes that the Insurer has allowed the Shareholder Axis Bank Ltd and its group companies to make undue profits /gains from purchase and sale of equity shares of Max Life Insurance Company Ltd., thereby misusing the dual relationship of the bank as a shareholder and corporate agent,"" it stated.

Meanwhile, shares of Axis Bank on Friday traded 0.19 percent lower at Rs 800.70 apiece on BSE during late trading hours, while the scrip of Max Financial Services traded 2.46 percent lower at Rs 720.65 apiece.

Last year, after a long wait, diversified Max Group sold a 13 percent stake in Max Life Insurance Company to the country's third largest private sector lender Axis Bank, which would then become a co-promoter of the insurer.

Max Financial Services -- the holding company of Max Life -- offloaded 12.99 percent stake in the insurer to Axis Bank and its subsidiaries -- Axis Capital and Axis Securities Ltd, according to a regulatory filing.

According to the company, the transaction was completed IRDAI gave its formal approval in February last year.

Under the deal, the Axis entities also have the right to acquire an additional stake of up to 7 percent in Max Life, in one or more tranches, subject to regulatory approvals. Three nominee directors of the Axis entities were to be part of Max Life's board of directors.",593,-0.9121915896733602

The date was October 6, 2022. The stage was set, and the room was abuzz, flickering with multiple disco lights. HDFC Bank was all set to launch its newest digital initiative in one of Mumbai’s fancy five-star hotels. Bankers, fintech players and journalists were all there, revelling in one of the most glittering events in the banking landscape.

The event was the launch of the SmartHub Vyapar Merchant app, which would facilitate instant, digital and paperless merchant on-boarding for the bank’s customers. The app was developed by HDFC Bank in partnership with Mintoak Innovations, a merchant SaaS (software as a service) platform.

Such events, to launch their digital initiatives, have become the new normal in the banking space. Banks today are no longer confined to their traditional brick-and-mortar setup or the exhausting paperwork of old. They are getting with it.

Fintechs fuelling change

A major reason for banks constantly revolutionising and upgrading their digital services is the rise of fintechs. Relying on smartphones for almost everything is the new normal, particularly when it comes to financial services. Fintech companies have become an integral part of the country’s economy, keeping it on the move.

Today, India has more than 7,000 fintech startups, operating in various segments. Such is the breadth of their presence that they have a finger in every pie, from payments and online credit facilities to subscription management and peer-to-peer lending.

With the growing presence of fintechs, banks have realised that they need to gear up on the technology front. Banks are using artificial intelligence to ensure smooth customer identification and authentication, while also mimicking live employees through chatbots and voice assistants.

The use of Aadhaar and video know-your-customer (KYC) along with card-less cash withdrawals and paperless customer on-boarding are some of the tools that reflect acceleration in the digitisation of banking in India.

Gone are the days when consumers had to wait for hours to reach the front of the queue, complete formalities, fill forms and access customer care for assistance at banks. With fintech banking solutions, self-service capabilities provide customers with operational processes that were previously only available via a physical branch. Not just that, bank-to-bank payments have become the new normal.

The opportunity to tap this trend is huge. According to an E&Y report, only about 12 percent of Indian adults—fewer than 20 percent of account owners —had made a digital merchant payment in 2021. However, two-thirds of those who made a digital merchant payment did so for the first time after the onset of COVID-19. Also, the share of account owners with an inactive account in India is 35 percent, which was the highest globally in 2021.

Fintechs have been driving this change.

“The primary evolution that the fintech players in the country have brought in is that they have digitalised financial processes. One of the major trends in the fintech sector is digital lending, through which borrowers can avail of a loan through applications on their mobile,” said Mahesh Shukla, founder of PayMe, a fintech.

According to Shukla, fintechs have also significantly reduced and also simplified the documentation process. One of the major challenges in conventional banking is that it was earlier difficult for people in rural areas to access loans. Fintech has made it easy for people from all parts of the country to do so online, added Shukla.

Globally, too, cross-border remittance is a growing opportunity, with payment volumes expected to cross the $156 trillion mark in 2022, according to the E&Y report. Banks would require technology to cater to this growth, something that fintech companies are already providing.

Rise in fintechs

As of July 2022, India had over 7,300 fintech startups, according to ""The Winds of Change"" report presented by EY during the 2022 Global Fintech Festival in Mumbai. The EY report said Indian fintechs received $7.8 billion in funding in 2021, way more than the $2.9 billion they received in 2020.

According to the Chiratae and EY report, lending AUMs in Indian fintech have the potential to grow from $38 billion currently to $515 billion by 2030.

Fintechs are increasingly looking to capture underserved markets with their presence, convenience and technology. With the growing number of fintechs in India, banks are beginning to feel the heat and are gearing up on the technology front.

Kotak Mahindra Bank, for example, hired a chief technology officer recently, while other big lenders such as HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank are ramping up tech teams through lateral hiring.

Fino Payments Bank has also appointed a Chief Digital Officer and plans to recruit many people for this division to drive digital banking among the youth.

“Several years back, most banks and large institutions began hiring Chief Digital Officers or Chief Data Officers. These trends are normal every time an industry goes through a massive change,” said Amit Das, chief executive officer and co-founder of Think360.ai, a Mumbai-based data science company.

“In a way, with the growth of fintechs, banks are aspiring to become savvier, and the advent of transformative technologies like AI (artificial intelligence) will force these realignments.”

Das’ views were corroborated by Kotak Mahindra Bank’s first chief technology officer, Milind Nagnur. In an exclusive interview to Moneycontrol on September 14, Nagnur spoke of an important shift — that of viewing the bank as a software engineering-focused organisation. In his view, the new definition of trust in banking for customers is not about the safety of assets, but about how dependable a bank’s digital offerings are.

Are banks worried?

According to bankers, the rise of fintechs has indeed revolutionised the lending industry, with most traditional banks trying to catch up with fintechs. If anything, fintech lending has only threatened the ‘traditional’ way of banking and lending, which is good for customers and the market. However, it is too nascent to say that they could replace banks altogether, they added.

Banks have superior funding franchises, arguably more underwriting expertise, and a widespread distribution or collection network that is also becoming a lot more digital. Fintech companies have better technology capabilities, user interfaces, and innovative solutions.

According to industry players, both banks and fintech companies have realised the advantages the other offers and have come together to offer comprehensive solutions.

“Over the decade, especially after the start of the pandemic, it has been clearly proven that fintechs and banks have a collaborative relationship rather than a competitive one,” said Murali Ramakrishnan, managing director and chief executive officer at South Indian Bank.

“I feel that fintechs will continue to have the role of an enabler rather than a competitor. Even with banks’ legacy infrastructural gaps, they do have a firmly established long-term client base that is unlikely for fintechs to replace,” Ramakrishnan added.

According to Akhil Handa, chief digital officer at Bank of Baroda, while technological advances are not new to finance, digital innovation has brought major improvements in the connectivity of systems, in computing power and cost, and in newly created and usable data. These improvements have alleviated transaction costs and given rise to new business models and new entrants like fintechs.

“Fintechs have demonstrated that they can transform the financial-landscape, where consumers get to choose from a larger set of options at competitive prices and build efficiency through lower operational costs,” said Handa. “Banks may have lost some customers to mobile fintech applications, but this has also created an opportunity like never before for banking institutions and inspired them to embrace change.”

Large unbanked population

Another reason why there is a tremendous opportunity for both players to survive in this landscape is the large number of unbanked Indians. Around 200 million Indians are unbanked, according to the Global Findex Database –2021. That’s quite a large number for both fintechs and banks to tap into.

“In India, we have enormous unmet demand for credit and enough space for many players. So, thinking that fintechs are eating into banks’ business is rather odd,” said Sugandh Saxena, chief executive officer at the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE).

Saxena added that most traditional banks are trying to catch up with fintechs, which only pose a threat to the ‘traditional’ way of banking. Banks in India have capital, scale, credibility and a much larger mandate, he added.

Bank of Baroda’s Handa said that while there has been increased competition from fintechs in the last few years in segments like payments and lending, banks have taken on this challenge as an opportunity.

Fintechs, according to Handa, have to an extent inspired banks to make product delivery seamless and on the go. Banks are delivering products with enhanced user experience and have made customers transition back to using the products and services of incumbents, he said. Rather than fear, he feels it is “healthy competition” between two entities striving to constantly push each other to serve their clientele better every day.

Can fintechs replace banks?

For a while back in 2021, the question often asked was: will fintechs be a threat to banks? Today, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has left no one in doubt about the answer, going by the slew of circulars that it has issued to rein in fintechs.

“The RBI seems hell-bent on regulating fintechs through banks or NBFCs (non-banking finance companies), and hence our models will have to evolve around that,” said a fintech founder, on condition of anonymity. “Our wings are clipped, so we have to depend on banks and NBFCs for survival. With the kind of regulations that the RBI has brought in, it is impossible for fintechs to replace banks altogether.”

According to Rajat Deshpande, chief executive officer and co-founder of FinBox, the plan for legacy players—banks and NBFCs—looks like this: improve your technology stack, partner with fintechs where you can’t build it yourself, and convert the entire suite of offerings into a digital-first business where the cost of delivery is lower.

This way, there’s much more potential to increase revenue per customer, said Deshpande. Direct acquisition of customers, added Deshpande, is becoming increasingly expensive and hence eats into margins quickly.

However, some bankers said that while banks’ cost of spending on digital transformation has increased, the costs may be plateauing.

“I think we are plateauing; 50 percent is at an aggregate level. At an aggregate level we are clearly seeing a plateauing of costs already,” said Parag Rao, group head – payments, consumer finance, technology and digital marketing at HDFC Bank at the launch of the SmartHub Vyapar app.

The way forward: collaboration or confrontation?

At least seven bankers and fintechs Moneycontrol spoke to said that collaboration, and not competition, is the way forward. Rather than competing with each other, it would be best for fintechs and banks to identify each other’s strengths and play the market together, added industry players.

“It's no longer going to be an 'us versus them'. Banks and fintechs have both realised that they accomplish more when they are collaborating, instead of competing,” said Srikanth Mopidevi, managing director and head of technology at DBS Bank India. “By working in tandem, banks are able to provide customer-friendly technology, while fintechs benefit from the large-scale network and customer data available with the banks.”

The next few years, Mopidevi said, will see a host of new collaborations expected to further improve the banking experience. Bank-fintech partnerships have especially enabled smaller banks to innovate and become competitive. However, fintechs will complement and enhance the existing banking landscape and not replace it, he added.

HDFC Bank’s Rao concurred with Mopidevi’s view. Rao said that he believes “very strongly” in the partnership philosophy and that the bank is open to more partnerships with fintech players.

Fintech players, too, believe that the partnership model will work well for both sides. “We believe that neo-banks and traditional Banks can work together to increase the size of the pie and play off each other’s strengths,” said Kunal Varma, co-founder and CEO of Freo, a consumer neobank. “This would lead to a win for the consumer, reduction in costs, and rapid market expansion with sustainable profit pools for the industry.”

This trend is currently visible. In September, Axis Bank partnered with fintech firm PayNearby to launch savings and current accounts for last-mile merchants. IDBI Bank has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Vay Network Services as its first fintech partner for digital supply chain finance solutions (e-SCF). There are many such examples.

According to the EY report cited earlier, collaborations between traditional financial services players such as banks with fintech startups is “business as usual” now and enabled by the proliferation of APIs (application programming interfaces, which allow myriad software types to communicate with each other) and data sharing norms.

With limited new licences, fintech startups only have the partnership route to go to market, and that is being welcomed by banks, the report said.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on September 30 delivered an interest rate hike of 50 basis points on expected lines, retaining its inflation forecast at 6.7 percent for FY23.

However, the central bank decided to lower its FY23 real GDP growth estimate to seven percent from 7.2 percent earlier, which was lower than the S&P Global Ratings' 7.3 percent projection but same as that of Fitch Ratings.

""The MPC delivered rate hike in line with expectations. At this point, we still think that the RBI would not go too restrictive and terminal rate could hover near estimated real rates, implying not more than 100 bp hikes ahead, including today's decision. However, the extent of global disruption will remain key to the RBI’s reaction function ahead,"" Madhavi Arora, lead economist, Emkay Global Financial Services, said.

Given the RBI acted in line with other central banks, the equity markets rebounded with the Nifty50 moving closer to 17,000, up 146 points at 16,964 while the BSE Sensex rallied more than 500 points to 56,936 at the time of writing this article, after losing seven percent in previous seven consecutive sessions.

The volatility also cooled down further with the passing of two key events (RBI policy and Fed meet). India VIX declined by 3.87 percent to 20.48 levels.

Banking & financial services, realty, and auto stocks participated in the run-up, but defensives IT and pharma were under pressure.

Samsung India Senior Vice President for Mobile Business Raju Pullan said the company has focussed on making purchases affordable and it has seen about three times growth in transactions happening through Samsung Finance plus for buying its product.

”We believe that consumer expectations in India are getting upscaled. It was visible in our latest Galaxy series Z Fold 4 and Flip 4. We will end up seeing this year almost 2X growth over last year on the new launches. It’s really important to actually create various new platforms so that consumers are able to acquire the Samsung products across price points and upgrade themselves to newer technologies,” Pullan said.

He said that the company has 30 million registered users of Samsung Pay, which was launched in 2017. Samsung Finance plus provides finance options to consumers who are availing credit for the first time.

”We are seeing a tremendous response not only in tier 2 and 3 markets but the rural market as well. Last year, we used to do business of about Rs 250 crore per month on the Samsung Finance plus. Almost 50 per cent of users were new to credit consumers.""

”This year as we speak, we are averaging at Rs 700 crore on transactions per month. This means that if we provide the right platforms to customers to upgrade, they will get on to it. That’s the genesis of our partnership with Axis Bank along with Visa,” Pullan said.

The company claims to have sold over 12 lakh Galaxy smartphones worth more than Rs 1,000 crore on the first day of online festive sales at Amazon and Flipkart.

Pullan said that the co-branded credit, for which registration has started, will offer cashback of up to Rs 10,000 to customers throughout the year across all Samsung products and it will be over and above the offers available at that time.

According to the details shared by the company, consumers will have the option to choose between – Visa Signature and Visa Infinite. On the Signature variant, cardholders will get up to Rs 10,000 cashback annually, with a monthly cashback limit of Rs 2,500. For the Infinite variant, cardholders will get up to Rs 20,000 cashback annually, with a monthly cashback limit of Rs 5,000.

”Through this co-branded credit card, in partnership with Samsung India and Visa, we are reiterating our commitment to drive access to formal credit in India, tapping the wide reach of Samsung India that extends beyond the top 10 cities and aids our objective of card penetration into tier 2 and 3 cities,"" Axis Bank MD and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said.",473,0.9794061034917831

“That tendency has to change. Fintechs have to think of compliance much earlier than they are currently,” Chaudhry said on Wednesday, September 21, speaking at the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai.

Chaudhry added that while fintechs agree they understand the meaning of the word “compliance”, it is time they consciously start making it a part of their business model.

“If you read the tea leaves, the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) gives enough hints. Businesses will suffer if they don’t pay heed,” he said.

The Axis Bank chief was in conversation with Razorpay co-founder and CEO Harshil Mathur talking about fintechs and regulations.

Chaudhry pointed out that he has seen a lot of activity in the regulation in the fintech space recently.

“It has meant that people have had to go back to the drawing board and relook at models. More clarity will emerge in 18-24 months,” he said, referring to fintechs like Slice, Uni, LazyPay and BharatPe, whose models of enabling lending through prepaid cards and wallets will not be allowed as per RBI norms.

On August 10, the RBI approved 12 guidelines on digital lending to be implemented immediately, largely focusing on customer safety and emphasising on transparent reporting of lending activities to credit rating agencies.

The RBI’s norms on digital lending stated that “registered entities shall ensure that in no case, disbursal is made to a third-party account, including the accounts of loan service providers (LSPs) and their digital lending apps (DLAs), except as provided for in these guidelines”.

The norm meant that loans cannot pass through prepaid payment instruments (PPIs). This was a second blow to fintechs with PPI-led lending models after the RBI said on June 20 that loading of credit lines into PPIs is prohibited.

The central bank formally notified the norms on September 2, adding that fintechs have time until November 20 to adhere to the new guidelines.

At the event, Chaudhry added that the fintech and banking space should be prepared for regulation evolution and new norms to be rolled out. “For companies in this business, it is not a question about waiting for the next evolution to come but to anticipate what is coming and change their business models in advance,” Chaudhary added.

Moneycontrol had reported on August 18 that the government of Mauritius-promoted SBM Bank India had sent a communication to its fintech partners Slice, Uni and PayU’s LazyPay saying it is pausing the on-boarding of new customers after the RBI approved the first set of guidelines on digital lending on August 10.

Axis Bank is an investor in Slice, which was disbursing around 300,000 new prepaid cards per month in partnership with SBM Bank India before the norms kicked in. The Tiger Global-backed startup achieved $1 billion in valuation in November 2021 on the back of this growth.

Due to the change in norms, some of the options these companies are now considering include moving from prepaid cards to co-branded credit cards or introducing a bank account from which loans can be loaded onto prepaid cards, which will align with regulations. For this, these fintechs are said to be in talks with multiple large banks, according to sources.

On the side-lines, Chaudhry told Moneycontrol that Axis Bank is open to partnering with these fintechs, but did not divulge any further details.",582,3.510713577270508e-05

We had a pleasant start on September 12 taking the US market's previous Friday's rally into consideration. We challenged 18,000 but failed to sustain on the same day itself. But since it was merely a formality, the index opened beyond this psychological level on the following day. In this process, the Nifty registered a highest close in the last eight months. Everything looked hunky dory as we were poised to make a move towards previous highs.

But the US markets tumbled suddenly on Tuesday on the back of rising inflation print. This resulted in a massive gap-down. Our markets, however, managed to weather the storm. We defended key levels and traded with a positive bias for couple of trading sessions. However, the Friday's session turned out to be a nightmare as we witnessed a sustained selling throughout the session to conclude the week with 1.70 percent cut, marginally above 17,500.

Generally, we say ‘All’s well that ends well’ but this time it’s the exact opposite. We had a perfect start of the week, but the end was certainly not everyone would have wished for. The broader structure remains bullish but with Nifty closing convincingly below 17,600 has dented the intermediate structure for sure.

Pricewise, it resembles a ‘Head and Shoulder’ pattern on daily time frame chart, which does not augur well for the bulls. If this pattern proves its significance, we may see further correction towards 17,200 – 17,000 in the coming week. But as of now, we do not want to fall into this camp. We would rather reassess the situation in the first half of the coming week.

As far as support is concerned, 17,400 we are seeing as a key support. The moment we see Nifty sliding below it, we may see correction getting extended in the market. On the flipside, if Nifty has to find its mojo back, it needs to go beyond Friday's high of 17,820 on a closing basis. So meanwhile, any minor bounce back towards 17,650 – 17,750 should ideally be used to exit longs.

After Friday's close, we would like to adopt a wait and watch approach and let's see how global market performs over the weekend.

Traders are advised not to get intimidated by Friday's correction, rather keep a close tab on above mentioned scenarios. Also, one should avoid trading aggressively till the time market stabilizes from this turbulence.

Sectorally, the recent leader, Bank Nifty is placed at an interesting juncture. Hopefully, it manages to lift the overall sentiments in the coming week.

Here are two buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

United Spirits: Buy | LTP: Rs 838.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 807 | Target: Rs 890 | Return: 6 percent

This has been our preferred bet of late from the liquor space. If we take a glance at the daily time frame chart, we can see nice base formation around Rs 760 odd levels. This was followed by small but steady up moves in regular intervals.

In the week gone by, stock prices managed to confirm yet another breakout from the long multi-month trend line. This coincided with traversing of ‘200-day SMA' (simple moving average) as well around Rs 838.

Hence, although stock prices retraced a bit on Friday in tandem with broader market sell off, we recommend buying for a near term target of Rs 890. Traders can participate by following strict stop-loss at Rs 807.

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 789.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 767 | Target: Rs 825 | Return: 4.5 percent

The entire banking space has been on a buying spree since last couple of months. In fact, the banking index managed to clock fresh highs this week and ‘Axis Bank’ is one of the major contributors in the rally.

In last couple of sessions, we witnessed mild profit booking in this stock after surpassing Rs 800 mark. However, the broader structure looks quite strong and on Friday, stock prices recovered after retesting the previous breakout points.

Considering the higher high higher bottom cycle, traders are advised to buy for a near term target of Rs 825. The strict stop-loss needs to be placed at Rs 767.

On the monthly chart, the Nifty is trading in its prior month range which points to a mixed undertone in the index.

On the weekly chart, the prices have taken resistance from the downward slopping trend line for the fourth time since October 2021 and is maintaining a higher-high, higher-low formation.

Prices on the daily time frame have sustained above the 20-day SMA (simple moving average), which was acting as a variable support to the prices.

RSI plotted on the daily and the weekly timeframe is above 50, which reflects strong momentum in the index.

The index has its immediate support placed at the level of 17,650 (20 days SMA). On the other hand, the resistance is placed at the level of 17,992 (swing high) followed by 18,250 (key resistance).

Looking at the overall chart pattern, we feel that the overall trend is positive and the index may attempt to go higher till the level of 17,992 and 18,250 level. Our bullish view would be negated if we see prices sustaining below the level of 17,350.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Tata Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 244.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 230 | Target: Rs 280 | Return: 14 percent

Tata Power has shown a bounce from the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of prior advance from level Rs 27 (May 2020) till Rs 298 (April, 2022).

On the daily timeframe, prices have given a breakout from Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern, which indicates a beginning of the trend on the upside.

The Bollinger Band on the daily timeframe have started to expand with volume participation indicates that the volatility in the underlying is increasing for upside move.

RSI (relative strength index) plotted on weekly and daily timeframe have sustained above 50 mark which tells that the prices are in strong momentum.

We recommend to buy this stock for the target of Rs 280 with stop-loss at the level of Rs 230 on the Closing basis.

Central Depository Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,420.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,250 | Target: Rs 1,737 | Return: 22 percent

CDSL is currently trading within 20 percent of its all-time high level, which tells that the stock is in a strong momentum already.

On the daily timeframe, prices have given a breakout from the Rounding Bottom pattern, indicated beginning of trend on the upside.

The breakout was confirmed by high volumes.

RSI plotted on the weekly time frame is rising higher with the prices which again confirms the rising momentum in the counter.

Going ahead we expect the prices to go higher till its record high level which is Rs 1,737 where the stop-loss must be Rs 1,250 on the closing basis.

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 779.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 712 | Target: Rs 870 | Return: 11 percent

On the weekly timeframe we can spot that prices have shown a bounce from crucial support of Rs 630 level.

On the daily timeframe prices after a breakout from double bottom pattern on July 18, 2022 which indicated a beginning of trend on the upside.

Bollinger band plotted on the daily timeframe have started to expand which points towards the rising volatility of the prices for an up move.

RSI plotted on the Weekly timeframe have shown a breakout reflecting the rising momentum in the prices.

We recommend to buy this stock for the target of Rs 870 with stop-loss at the level of Rs 712 on the closing basis.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Axis Bank

Despite subdued credit growth, Axis Bank reported healthy growth in NII/fees, and core profitability grew by 17% yoy after a long gap. This, coupled with lower LLP, led to a 14% beat on PAT at Rs41.2bn (up 91% yoy) despite elevated opex (CI ratio: 52%; cost-asset: 2.4%). The bank had withdrawn near-term cost guidance in Q4 citing volatility, but has now guided for a medium-term cost-to-asset ratio of 2%, driven by better productivity. Credit growth was slow at 14% yoy/down 1% qoq vs. much higher growth for peers (ICICI/HDFCB: 22%), mainly due to declines in corporate/overseas/SME books. However, retail growth remained healthy at 25% yoy/3% qoq, with strong growth in unsecured loans, but mortgage growth was surprisingly slower than peers. Better portfolio mix/asset repricing led to a 11bps qoq improvement in NIMs to 3.6%. Axis has retained NIM guidance at 3.7-3.8% for the next 8-10 quarters on better portfolio mix and run-down in RIDF bonds. Despite lower slippages at Rs37bn/2.4% of loans, the GNPA ratio was largely flat at 2.8% due to slow growth. The bank carries a healthy specific PCR of 77%/Covid provisions at 0.7% of loans, which should keep LLP under check. We expect the bank’s RoA/RoE to improve to 1.6%/16% by FY25E - up from 1.2%/12% in FY22. That said, Citi portfolio acquisition calls for shoring up capital levels and could lead to a dilution in RoEs.

Outlook

We maintain our long-term Buy rating on the stock with a TP of Rs1,020 (value standalone bank at 1.8x Jun’24E ABV and subs valuation at Rs80), given steady improvement in RoEs and reasonable valuations. That said, the bank will have to consistently deliver on growth/core profitability and maintain management stability for a re-rating.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis bank core earnings were better driven by NIM beat and lower provisions led by steady asset quality. Loan growth at -0.9% QoQ was lower as corporate declined since AXSB evaded pricing pressure while higher yielding retail (SBB, agri, CC, and PL) saw strong traction, which might continue. Bank suggested that even if corporate growth is boosted, spread would not be diluted. Preference for profitability over growth could bode well, as systemic asset quality risks are benign. Cost to assets would remain elevated although target is to reduce it from 2.2% to 2.0% over FY22-25E. Asset quality improved QoQ with controlled net slippages and reduction in stressed pool. Valuation at 1.7x on FY24 ABV is comforting and discount to ICICIBC should narrow as RoE may enhance from 12.0% to 14.5% over FY22-24E.

Outlook

Maintain multiple at 2.3x FY24 ABV and TP at Rs940. Retain BUY.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB reported a PAT of INR41.2b (up 91% YoY, 20% beat), driven largely by lower provisions, which fell 89% YoY, while NII/PPOP stood in line. OPEX remains elevated as the bank is investing in the business and technology. Business growth was muted, with loans and deposits down sequentially. The Corporate and SME book saw a QoQ decline, while the Retail segment saw a growth of 3% QoQ. Fresh slippages fell to INR36.8b, which, coupled with healthy recoveries and upgrades, enabled an improvement in asset quality ratios.

2022-07-26 19:48:00+05:30,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks/more-private-banks-are-offering-unsecured-loans-heres-why-8893621.html,"According to analysts, since lending rates are high, it is the most profitable business for banks.

Many private banks like Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, and ICICI Bank have shown a significant rise in disbursement of unsecured loans last quarter, as per their latest quarterly results. During the outbreak of COVID-19, banks had excessively tightened their disbursement policy. But now, with the economy looking up, banks are gradually easing up, and disbursing more unsecured loans. For banks, unsecured loans are a source of better profit margins in, say analysts.

Going forward, analysts expect a significant rise in the retail unsecured loan portfolios of more banks this fiscal.

Although the data for year-on-year (YoY) growth for IndusInd Bank was not disclosed, the bank said during the announcement of their results that retail loans grew by 3 per cent on quarter-on-quarter(QoQ) basis, with significant pick-up in retail unsecured loans. Credit card lending grew 17.4 per cent QoQ, while personal loans climbed 9.5 per cent QoQ.

Here are the major reasons for private banks to be lending more unsecured loans compared to the previous years:





Loosening of disbursement policy:According to analysts, all banks tightened their disbursement policies during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a fall in the number of unsecured loans issued in the next year. But with the situation gradually getting back to normal, banks are modifying their disbursement policies to make loans accessible to more and more people. “The delinquency number might have moved up a bit but it is still much below the threshold level of banks. Given that these loans have somewhat higher margins, slightly higher delinquency is good enough for banks, as that is priced in the loan,” said Prakash Agarwal, President, Financial Services, India Ratings and Research.





Higher loan rates than FD rates:With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raising rates, banks have increased their lending rates more than the deposit rates. “Banks haven’t increased fixed deposit (FD) rates as much as they have increased their lending rates. So, net interest margin (NIM) is increasing. Thus, they are giving out more loans to cover up the losses of the last two years, as disbursement was quite low (during that period),” said Siddharth Pandey, analyst at Bank of America.





Better profit margins:According to analysts, since lending rates are high, it is the most profitable business for banks. To adjust for the higher credit risks in the business, banks use higher lending rates drawing from the classic risk adjusted return paradigm.





Gradual fall in NPAs: As of March 2022, gross NPA stood at 5.9 per cent, which had previously touched 11.2 per cent in 2018. So, the gross NPA is coming down. It is likely to fall further this fiscal as corporate sector asset quality is likely to improve, according to analysts. Moreover, banks are trying to balance their portfolios, as secured loans form the bulk of their portfolios. “While NPAs in MSME loans could inch up, retail NPAs should be steady and many banks have a demonstrated track record of low NPAs in the retail segment, including in unsecured segments.” added Sitaraman.





Catering to the salaried customers: According to analysts it is primarily customers from the lower socio economic strata who struggle to repay these loans. But most private banks cater to customers with good credit history, are mostly salaried, and belonging to the upper and middle income group. Thus, the chances of defaults are minimal for them.



“They will budget for a specific level of NPA and then charge the lending rate in such a way, so that even if non performing (NPAs) are somewhat higher than in other secured businesses, the higher lending rate will compensate for that. Secured loans like home loans have very fine lending rates, so banks’ profit margin is relatively lower for such loans despite lower NPAs,” added Krishnan Sitaraman, Senior Director & Deputy Chief Ratings Officer, CRISIL Ratings Limited.

Although, most of the banks have performed well in terms of dealing with NPAs, analysts have cautioned banks against being too confident in terms of disbursing unsecured loans, considering the economic turmoil India is going through. “Banks should not be too confident as there may come some challenges in the job sector that may affect repayment,” said Aggarwal.

Banks need to have proper credit appraisal and risk management systems in place to be able to deal with any possible defaults. That will help them keep NPAs under control, else in a fast growing book NPAs could rise. “Even if a bank is disbursing loans to salaried individuals or someone having regular earnings, it is important for the banks to evaluate their financial standing and repayment capabilities through adequate credit appraisal mechanisms,” added Sitaraman.

According to analysts, apart from the salaried or self-employed categorisation and credit bureau scores, banks have multiple attributes that go into their scorecards for arriving at lending decisions. Such scoring parameters include socio-economic factors which could now be populated based on the digital information about the borrower, such as physical location, educational qualifications, and details of friends and family members, which help in the socio-economic profiling of the borrowers and predictability of future defaults.

“Tighter underwriting, including granular and diversified credit portfolio, and smaller exposures to new-to-credit customers are some of the other precautionary measures that can be taken by banks to minimise the risk of NPAs,” added Aashay Choksey, Assistant Vice President, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA.",898,0.5816341400146484

Axis Bank share price fell in early trade on July 26 a day after company announced its June quarter earnings.

Axis Bank on July 25 reported a 91 percent year-on-year rise in net profit to Rs 4,125 crore for the quarter ended June, topping analysts' expectations of Rs 3,597.7 crore.

Despite robust net profit growth, the operating profit fell five percent from a year ago owing to operating expenses rising 34 percent and treasury losses. Core operating profit excluding trading income grew 17 percent year-on-year and five percent sequentially, driven by resilient fee income growth.

The bank suffered a mark-to-market hit of Rs 1,200 crore that resulted in a trading loss of Rs 667 crore. ""This is mainly from our corporate bond book. Here, the securities are rated A (-) and above. We do not expect any economic loss on this book,"" said Rajiv Anand, deputy managing director.

The private sector lender reported a 21 percent rise in net interest income to Rs 9,384 crore, exceeding Street's estimate of Rs 9,186.6 crore, aided by robust loan growth of 14 percent and an improvement in net interest margin to 3.60 percent.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after earnings:

Sharekhan

Axis Bank is looking for a sustainable growth path in terms of advances growth led by retail, SME, and mid-corporate segments in a granular manner along with focus on mobilisation of low-cost granular liability and higher spending on tech.

New digital product initiatives, both in assets and liability segments, are growing well as reflected in strong acquisition growth.

With high PCR and strong balance sheet, the bank can absorb shocks from any unanticipated future risk. We believe its valuations are reasonable, given structural improvement visible in the franchise.

Motilal Oswal

Axis Bank delivered strong earnings, driven by a significant decline in provisions and margin expansion, even as opex continues to remain elevated. Business growth was muted clocking a sequential decline.

Asset quality continues to improve aided by a moderation in slippages and healthy recoveries and upgrades. Restructured book moderated further, while a higher provisioning buffer provides comfort.

We expect slippages to remain in control, enabling a sustained improvement in credit costs, though improvement in margin and cost ratios will be key factors to watch out for.

We expect Axis Bank to deliver a FY24 RoA/RoE (return on asset/equity) of 1.6/16.7 percent. We maintain our buy rating with a target price of Rs 875 per share.

CLSA

We maintain a buy rating on the stock and raise the target to Rs 975.

It was a strong quarter with its net interest income beat offsetting higher opex. Low credit costs offset Rs 600 crore in bond losses.

The bank looks likely to deliver well on its margin guidance.

Morgan Stanley

We keep an overweight rating on the Axis Bank with a target of Rs 910 per share as the profit was 13% above estimate, helped by higher than expected revenue.

The core PPoP (pre-provision operating profit) was four percent above our estimates.

The RoE of 16 percent by FY25 stays on track.

JPMorgan

We keep a neutral rating on the stock and cut the target price to Rs 780 from Rs 880.

Loan growth disappoints with one percent sequential fall while retail does better with corporate being slower.

Net interest margin improvement guidance has been maintained. The RoA was 1.4 percent, remaining 60 basis points lower than larger peers.

Jefferies

We maintain a buy rating on the stock and cut the target price to Rs 1,010 from Rs 1,050.

The company reported better operating results and can bridge valuation gap.

The profit was ahead of estimate aided by lower credit cost and better topline, while slippages stayed low and helped keep credit cost at marginal level.

The valuation gap with ICICI Bank can narrow a bit from 35-40 percent now.

Macquarie

We maintain a neutral rating on the stock with a target of Rs 790.

The net interest margin has improved while loan growth and cost ratios lag behind peers.

We remain concerned on weak retail term deposit growth. The funding franchise continues to be weaker than larger peers.

The focus on margin in a tough quarter was a good move, but loan growth is important too. The valuations are looking reasonable at current levels.

At 09:17 hours, Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 717.50, down Rs 10.70 or 1.47 percent on the BSE.

Axis Bank’s deal to acquire the consumer business of Citibank India will be completed by the fourth quarter of this financial year, managing director and chief executive officer Amitabh Chaudhry said on July 25.

“On the Citibank consumer business integration, we are awaiting CCI (Competition Commission of India) approval, and we expect to close the transaction by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023,” Amitabh Chaudhry said at a conference call after the private lender’s April-June quarterly results.

Chaudhry said that Axis Bank cannot engage with Citi “extensively” till it gets the CCI approval, which was expected within six to eight weeks. However, the bank was working on integrating people, technology and business operations, he added.

In March, Axis Bank acquired Citibank's India consumer business for $1.6 billion in an all-cash deal. The transaction comprised the sale of consumer banking businesses of Citibank India, which include credit cards, retail banking, wealth management and consumer loans.

Axis Bank had said the deal would increase its credit-card customer base by around 31 percent with an additional 2.5 million cards.

The merger date would be when Axis Bank will take over the deposits and the assets of Citibank. Axis Bank does have the right to use the ‘Citi’ name for a certain period of time, Chaudhry said on July 25. Eventually, the bank’s plan is to provide the same experience to Citi consumers in the “same shape and form as before”, he added.

Axis Bank on July 25 reported a 91 percent year-on-year rise in net profit at Rs 4,125 crore for the quarter ended June, topping analysts' expectations of Rs 3,597.7 crore.

The private sector lender reported a 21 percent rise in net interest income to Rs 9,384 crore, exceeding Street's estimate of Rs 9,186.6 crore.

Loan growth was broad based, with retail loans growing 25 percent year-on-year and the corporate loan book growing faster by 27 percent.

The surge in net profit was also driven by a sharp drop in provisions to Rs 359 crore for the reported quarter from Rs 3,302 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Specific loan loss provisioning was down to Rs 777 crore from Rs 2,865 crore a year ago. This was because the pile of gross non-performing assets fell by 39 percent year on year.

Gross bad loans were just 2.76 percent of the bank's loan book, down from 3.85 percent a year ago and 2.82 percent the quarter before. On a net basis, non-performing loans slipped below 1 percent of the loan book to 0.64 percent.

Axis Bank’s chief financial officer Puneet Sharma did not give any guidance on credit growth but said the lender aims to grow faster than the industry.

In terms of margins, Sharma did not guide whether the bank was targeting 4 percent levels like its peers. The lender's net interest margin (NIM) expanded 14 bps YoY to 3.60 percent in the June quarter and was up 11 bps sequentially.

Net non-performing asset ratio declined to 0.64 percent on June 30, from 0.73 percent in March 31. Gross NPA ratio fell to 2.76 percent in June, down from 2.82 percent in March and 3.85 percent in the same quarter of the previous financial year.

HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and Canara Bank on July 22 issued near-three-month CDs at a coupon of 5.60 percent, 5.62 percent and 5.52 percent, respectively, according to National Stock Exchange (NSE) data.

Almost a month back, rates for similar tenure CDs of HDFC Bank and Axis Bank stood at 5.28 percent each. Canara Bank, on June 15, too had issued over three-month CDs at 5.41 percent, according to the data.

The RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) hiked rates by a total of 90 basis points in May and June to arrest rising price pressures in the economy. One basis point equals one hundredth of a percentage point.

What are CDs?

CDs are a money market instrument and are typically issued by scheduled commercial banks and select financial institutions permitted by the RBI. For banks, the maturity period of a CD should be between 7 days and one year. CD rates are sensitive to interest-rate movements.

Why are CD rates rising?

According to money market participants, the primary reason for the rise in CD rates is the credit off-take in the economy and the fact that RBI is slowly withdrawing a liquidity surplus from the banking system.

Demand for credit is rising which, coupled with the dwindling liquidity surplus in the banking system, has increased the need for banks to issue these money market instruments.

Typically, while investing in CDs, investors demand a spread or a premium over government-issued Treasury Bill or T-Bill rates. On July 20, the government’s three-month T-Bill was sold at a cut-off yield of 5.40 percent, up from 5.09 percent a month ago.

“Investors preferred treasury bills over bank CDs as the three-month treasury bills are trading around 5.40 percent and one-year treasury bills are trading around 6.20 percent,” said Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner at Rockfort Fincap, a Mumbai-based debt advisory firm.

“Hence, being a capital market instrument, banks have to price their CDs over Treasury Bills to get enough investor demand.”

Srinivasan expects top state-run bank CDs to continue to trade with a spread of at least 20 to 50 basis points over T-Bill rates.

Will the trend continue?

Yes. Money market experts said CD rates are likely to edge higher as the rate hike cycle becomes more entrenched and as the RBI steps up liquidity absorption to combat inflationary pressures in the economy. The pace could accelerate if the RBI tightens monetary policy at a faster-than-expected pace.

The RBI’s actions directly influence the direction of short-term consumer debt and deposit rates. So with multiple rate hikes seen in what remains of 2022, experts see CD rates rising further. Already, the net liquidity absorbed by the RBI as of July 24 was Rs 1.24 lakh crore, down from Rs 3.29 lakh crore on June 8, according to central bank data. This indicates that surplus liquidity has fallen sharply since the last monetary policy decision.

“Looking at the global situation, RBI is concerned with the rising inflation and depreciating rupee,” said Umesh Tulsyan, managing director at Sovereign Global Markets. “There is no other option with RBI than increasing the repo rate to suck the liquidity from the market. Conclusively, we may see this trend to further continue in the coming next year till the time inflation is not combated.”

How many rate hikes are factored in?

Money market experts said the repo rate is expected to be at 5.75 percent by December, up from 4.90 percent currently. Accordingly, CD rates could move higher. Experts said the pace of the increase in CD rates could reduce now that most of the negatives are already factored into prices.

“Yields in money market segments have corrected after sharp rate hikes and withdrawal of liquidity from the system,” said Sanjay Pawar, fund manager – fixed income, LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management. “Repo rate hikes are likely in the immediate future; however the market has discounted the rate hikes in advance.”

Sovereign Global Markets’ Tulsyan added that T-Bill rates are also expected to go up assuming market borrowings increase. The extent of rate hikes priced in for the next one year is almost 100 basis points, he said.

Will CD issuances increase?

As the economic recovery gains momentum and rate hikes increase, bankers and money market experts expect CD issuances to rise. That should increase supply of debt paper and lead to an uptick in rates.

“As credit off-take continues in double digits and deposit rate doesn't increase in tandem, CD issuance will increase and so (will) the spreads,” LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management’s Pawar said.

Pawar pointed out that total outstanding CDs have increased to Rs 2.35 lakh crores versus an outstanding of Rs 1.81 lakh crores as of March-end.",811,-0.043948610623677574

Axis Bank is expected to report strong growth in its net profit as well as topline aided by improvement in asset quality and a conducive environment for credit offtake in the economy.

The private sector bank is likely to report a 66.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in net profit to Rs 3,597.7 crore for the quarter ended June, according to an average of estimates from eight brokerages polled by Moneycontrol.

The lender will report its June quarter earnings on July 25.

The sharp rise in profit will be aided by a near-70-percent on-year decline in provisions in the quarter to Rs 997 crore as the lender continues to see improvement in its asset quality. Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects the lender’s gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio to come in at 2.7 percent compared to 2.8 percent in the previous quarter.

Kotak Institutional Equities believes slippages in the quarter will come in at around 2 percent of the lender’s advances book or Rs 3,500 crore for the reported quarter. “Expect strong commentary on asset quality performance and we see an improvement in NPL ratios aided by stronger recovery,” Kotak Equities said in a preview note.

That said, on a sequential basis, Axis Bank’s net profit is expected to decline 12.6 percent because of heavy losses in the treasury department of the bank. The private sector lender will report treasury losses worth Rs 2,070 crore for the reporting quarter due to sharp rise domestic government bond yields.

Government bond yields jumped more than 60 basis points (bps) in the June quarter on the back of a 90-bps hike in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to tame multi-year retail inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index. Bond prices move in opposite direction to their yield.

The high treasury losses will also weigh on the operating performance of the lender as analysts expect pre-provision operating profit to slide 1 percent on-year, and 5.3 percent on-quarter, to Rs 6,123.3 crore in the reporting quarter.

The topline performance of Axis Bank will be strong, as net interest income is expected to grow 18.4 percent on YoY basis to Rs 9,186.6 crore, aided by healthy growth in advances. Loans are likely to grow north of 18 percent on-year in the reported quarter, led by the retail loan portfolio.

“Advances are expected to grow by 19 percent YoY with a revival of the economy and improvement in asset quality,” brokerage firm Ashika Institutional Equities said in a note.

Besides the lender’s June quarter results, analysts and investors will await the company’s commentary on loan growth and asset quality. “Progress of the Citibank portfolio and direction of operating profit growth will be a key discussion area for the quarter,” Kotak Equities said.

The $1.6-billion deal made by Axis Bank to acquire the consumer business portfolio of Citibank India on March 30 is on track and awaiting regulatory approvals, Axis Bank president and head of cards and payments Sanjeev Moghe told Moneycontrol in an interaction Thursday, July 7.

“The deal is on the right track, we are waiting for regulatory approvals, and the work will pick pace further post that but right now it is all on track,” Moghe said.

Citibank India and Axis Bank’s credit card portfolio is stable with low single-digit bad loans, Moghe said, adding that Citibank India is not witnessing any extraordinary attrition among employees and is being able to hold on to and attract more high net-worth individuals (HNI) as customers.

Edited excerpts:

Q: Your credit card portfolio grew at the fastest pace during January-March. What will be the growth strategy in the current fiscal?

A: We have our partnerships which have started giving us results. For example, we launched (a card in a tie-up with) Flipkart three years back and are witnessing very interesting results. The partnership with Google has taken on some momentum, we launched with Airtel Payments Bank in February, and all of these are scaling up now. Flipkart is very substantial where we have crossed 2.5 million cards.

The second part is, the organic business also has solid momentum because we have our learnings from the Covid-19 pandemic and as we scale up post that, my sense is this growth is going to continue. There will be some upset but in the next two quarters, Q1 (April-June) and Q2 (July-September) we should be around a million (issuance of 1 million credit cards), and scale up further from Q3 (October-December) onwards.

We started the year at total CIF (cards in force) of 9 million. The RBI (Reserve Bank of India) has recently issued guidelines on card closure but if we keep that aside for a minute, I will envisage overall CIF at the end of year (March 31, 2023) at close to 12 million cards... I think these numbers are very strong. Obviously, at some point, by December or March, when the Citi portfolio gets added, it will be another 2.5 million cards.

Q: How is the Citi deal shaping up?

A: The deal is on the right track, we are waiting for regulatory approvals, and the work will pick pace further post that but right now it is all on track. We have started work with them (Citibank India) but this is going to take some time but we are on track, as per our schedule.

Q: Is the bank being able to hold on to HNI customers of Citibank India and attract similar clients?

A: Citibank India customers’ international spends are higher than the market and Axis Bank, that is likely to continue purely because of the profile that Citibank has. We believed that if we have to make our portfolio more affluent, if we buy them, it adds a lot of value to Axis Bank, and that point holds.

Is Citibank witnessing any undue or very extraordinary attrition rates in terms of customers? No. We have not seen anything out of the ordinary in the Citibank portfolio. That is why the business momentum on their side is good and on our side as well. When you combine the entities, they are formidable and will become very formidable in the market…

Q: Are you witnessing higher attrition in the Citibank India team?

A: From what we are seeing on the cards portfolio, we are pretty confident of delivering value on the deal that we have made. I do not see a challenge on that.

Employee attrition and those things are fine, overall in the market, too, attrition is happening. Those things will be taken care of as part of overall merger exercise...

Q: Canara Bank is planning to launch a credit card subsidiary and other lenders like HDFC Bank are chasing growth aggressively in the space. How will you beat the competition?

A: The balance sheet of banks is clean. It got cleaned up a couple of years back and during the Covid-19 pandemic phase. That means that risk is pretty low right now. When risk is low you can obviously grow your business that much more…

We are confident about the growth because we have two engines running right now. One is organic bank channels and second we have built through partnerships. We have multiple large partnerships including Flipkart, LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India), Google, Airtel, Vistara—these are big names. These are big partnerships, and we anticipate some more partnerships to fructify through the year itself. With that the growth momentum will be solid. It is also possible that other lenders will also look at growth. That is fine, we have our strategy in place. Our strategies are dependent not just on top six-eight markets, we have very deep acquisition capabilities…

Q: Are there any acquisitions planned for this fiscal?

A: Nothing in the pipeline. Citi is what we have, we will absorb and deliver on that and if anything is there, it is in the future.

Our rank in credit card space is presently number 4. I do not see our rank improving to number 2 or 3 in the next 12-18 months because that gap if fairly wide.

What I do anticipate is that the gap between us and the others will close, the gap between number 4 and 3 and 2. Partly because of the way Axis Bank will grow, and because Citibank India (credit cards) will come close to reporting by the end of year…

Q: How many partners are you looking to get on board your bank for co-branded cards?

A: Credit card launches will continue. We will not do 8-10 launches, but you will expect some news throughout the year—I cannot talk too much because these are currently being worked on. These launches will happen in Q3, Q4.

Q: How is the asset quality of Axis Bank and Citibank India’s credit card portfolio?

A: It is very clean, NPAs (non-performing assets) are in lower single digits.

Q: Will it continue to be stable?

A: It will be in the lower single digit territory.

Q: Is the RBI diktat to fintechs that they cannot load credit lines into wallets a good move for regulated banks?

A: Lot of people are asking whether it is bad for PPIs (prepaid payment instruments) or bad for NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) and good for banks, etc. I do not view regulations from that lens. The way to look at the regulation is obviously there is some ambiguity which was being used and the RBI has clarified that certain things are not allowed.

Does it impact people who were using ambiguities? Yes it does.

Some of these players will now have to look at alternative solutions. What are the solutions? Whether they talk to banks for partnerships, we will wait and see what happens from here onwards.

Q: Will you continue partnering with fintechs?

A: Yes, we will talk to them. Whatever works out and since we have clear principles that we follow, if it meets those principles, we will partner with some of them…

Q: Will your partnership with Freecharge and the buy now, pay later (BNPL) product continue?

A: BNPL will continue, there is no problem with BNPL.

Unfortunately, people are conflating these guidelines which really say that you cannot load a credit line through PPIs … Freecharge has a product, their product will continue and it is actually doing quite well... The partnership is going well, it will continue to do well and there is no impact of the regulatory guidelines on Freecharge’s BNPL product. People are mixing two issues there.

Q: Should fintechs be regulated more?

A: Whenever the regulatory landscape is clarified, there will be an impact on people who would have interpreted it differently. If they were doing something that was not allowed, it would have to be stopped. If some other aspect is clarified, for example on interest rates, there will be an impact.

As there will be an impact, there will be a reaction… These things will happen at all points of time. We are very focused on the ground on partnerships and organic strategy. These partnerships may come out of our normal discussions, and may also arise as an impact of some of these regulatory changes.",1421,0.9137515351176262

Sharekhan's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank’s focus on growing its asset franchise in a granular manner has started to reflect in the business performance. Share of retail loans has increased from 45% in FY2017 to 57% in FY2022. Retail, SME, and mid-corporate loans remain key focused segments and these segments are growing at a healthy pace in a granular manner. Gross impaired loans have improved sharply from 7.3% in FY2019 to 3.9% in FY2022. Risk weighted assets as a percentage to advances stands at 101% in FY2022 versus 117 % in FY2019. Improvement in RWA to advances is reflecting higher-rated and less risky loans are underwritten. Overall underwriting practices, particularly in wholesale banking, have also improved significantly. With structural improvement in business franchise and higher provision buffers in place, we expect asset-quality challenges to be largely behind for the bank and expect credit cost to normalise going forward.



Outlook

At the CMP, the bank trades at 1.3x and 1.1x its FY2023E/FY2024E core ABV, offering attractive risk reward. We maintain Buy with a PT of Rs. 940. We believe valuations are reasonable, given structural improvement in the franchise.

Moody’s Investors Service has upgraded the baseline credit assessments of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, reflecting improvements in credit fundamentals, particularly asset quality.

The global rating agency has upgraded the baseline credit assessments (BCAs) to baa3 from ba1.

The upgrade of the BCAs does not result in any change in the deposit ratings because these are already at the same level as the India sovereign rating (Baa3 stable), Moody’s said in a statement on Friday.

The upgrade of the two banks’ BCAs is driven by improvements in asset quality, capital, and profitability. Their asset quality has seen a significant improvement, with both the gross and net non-performing loans (NPL) ratios declining.

”Credit costs have also reduced at the same time as provision coverage has increased. Lower credit costs have resulted in higher profitability,” it said. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank’s return on assets for the year ending March 2022 was 1.8 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively, compared to an average of 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent over the four years ending March 2020, it said.

ICICI Bank’s profitability has also benefited from rising net interest margins as the share of the low margin international business has come down in the last four years, it added.

Both lenders have raised equity capital, resulting in significantly higher capital ratios, it said, adding the core equity tier 1 ratios of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at end March 2022 were 17.6 per cent and 15.2 per cent respectively, compared to 13.6 per cent and 11.3 per cent at end March 2019.

However, it said, Axis Bank’s proposed acquisition of Citigroup Inc’s India consumer assets will result in an approximately 230 bps decline in capital at the bank. As Axis Bank has good access to capital markets, the ratings agency expects the bank to raise capital to maintain its current capital ratios. Axis Bank is targeting to close the acquisition by March 2023.",344,0.9123709698518118

Since these changes in June are going to affect several citizens in India from Wednesday, it is important to know about them in detail.

Here are the Key Money and Operational Changes that will Come into Effect from June 01, 2022:SBI Home Loan Interest Rate Hike

The State Bank of India will increase its home loan rates from June 1, which is today, as it has hiked its external benchmark linked interest rates from the day. SBI has hiked its EBLR rates by 40 basis points by 40 basis points to 7.05 per cent and the Repo-Linked Lending Rate (RLLR) would in turn be revised to 6.65 per cent plus CRP.

Hike in Axis Bank Service Charges

June financial changes will also affect the pockets of leading private lender Axis Bank customers, as it has announced a host of increased rates on its service charges. Axis Bank has revised its banking and non-banking service charges for customers with savings and salary accounts, including an increase in the service fee per month over non maintenance of minimum account balance and an increase in the monthly average balance requirement.

Cost of Cars and Bikes to Increase

The government has revised new base premium rates for third party insurance on cars and bikes, which in turn will result in an increase in their rates from Wednesday. This is applicable to private and commercial cars and bikes run on either fuel or electricity, as per a statement by the ministry of road transport and highways.

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One

We started the proceedings last Monday on a positive note despite sluggish global cues. In an initial hour, the gains extended to move towards 16,000 mark. Similar to recent trends, the profit-booking took place at higher levels to erase all gains around the midsession. Although the market recovered slightly thereafter, the overall movement was quite choppy to conclude the day around 15,850, with nearly four-tenths of a percent gains.

This was followed by a massive relief move last Tuesday, which extended towards 16,400 on the subsequent day. However, the global weakness struck back once again on the weekly expiry session with a huge gap-down to retest 15,800. The market was not done with its twists as Friday's session opened with yet another gap; but this time it was fortunately on the higher side. This pleasant surprise picked up its momentum as the day progressed, to conclude the week convincingly above 16,200 mark.

The second half of the week gone by was full of dramatic twists and turns. Both the counterparties were caught napping in all this but, as we mostly say ‘all's well that ends well’, eventually the bulls turned out to be victorious as they managed to pull the Nifty back inside the safe terrain by gaining over 3 percent from previous week's close.

With reference to previous week's commentary, 15,700 – 15,600 stands to be a very solid support; because it coincides with the '89-EMA' (exponential moving average - 15,658) on weekly chart who has proved its mettle many times over the past many years. Yes we are not completely out of the woods but at least we are well above the crucial support zone.

On the flipside, the cluster of resistance is placed around 16,400 – 16,500 – 16,600 and till the time we do not surpass it convincingly, one should avoid being complacent. At this juncture, we are clearly mirroring US markets' sentiments and hence, if market has to move higher, the global relief is the key.

Let's see how things pan out this week. It would be important to keep a regular tab on global developments and one should certainly be prepared for surprising moves on either side. As far as sectoral participation is concerned, we witnessed some decent relief moves in most of the beaten heavyweight spaces this week.

Also, the broader market has started to show some encouraging signs which, we believe, should do extremely well if the market remains above the psychological support of 16,000.

Here are two buy calls for short term:

Petronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 227.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 217.80 | Target: Rs 245 | Return: 7.5 percent

If we take a glance at the price action for last ten odd months, we can clearly see rangebound movement with slightly negative bias. Stock prices continued with its lower lows lower highs configuration all this while and has faced tremendous resistance around the sturdy wall of '200-day SMA'.

Of late, we witnessed lot of changes structurally as prices managed to turn the tide upwards by confirming 'Higher Highs Higher Lows' and importantly, has managed to finally traverse the '200-SMA' with some authority.

There are no exceptional volumes as such, but are certainly much higher than its previous average daily volumes, which provides credence to the move. Hence, we recommend buying this stock for a trading target of Rs 245. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 217.80.

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 673.10 | Stop-Loss: Rs 657 | Target: Rs 700 | Return: 4 percent

Overall financial space has been one of the worst performing spaces in last couple of months and 'Axis Bank' has certainly contributed in it to the fullest. After witnessing a 20 percent price correction from recent highs, the stock prices finally saw some respite around the multi-month supports of Rs 640 – 630.

On last Friday, we could see first sign of strength after sustaining beyond the '5-day EMA' along with positive crossover in 'RSI-Smoothened' oscillator from its deeply oversold territory.

Hence, if global market remains stable, this stock is likely to give decent relief rally in the coming week. We recommend buying for a near term target of Rs 700. The strict stop-loss needs to be placed at Rs 657.

SpiceJet and Axis Bank on Thursday launched a co-branded credit card that will come in two variants, the airline said in a statement.

The card is designed to enable customers use the rewards earned on their daily spends for booking flights and add-ons, thus encouraging both travel and digital payments embedded with benefits of the SpiceJet frequent flyer programme, SpiceClub, it said.

SpiceJet CMD Ajay Singh and Axis Bank CEO and MD Amitabh Chaudhry unveiled a special livery based on this credit card on the airline’s Boeing 737 Max aircraft, the statement said.

The two variants of the card have been named SpiceJet Axis Bank Voyage and SpiceJet Axis Bank Voyage Black, it added.

Singh said SpiceJet is the pioneer of the frequent flyer programme for budget airlines in the country, and the partnership with Axis Bank significantly strengthens the value offering of SpiceClub.

""The two teams (SpiceJet and Axis Bank) will work together to bring in the synergies, with best of offers and services, thereby truly making a difference to the customers and their travel experience,” Chaudhry said.",182,0.9925165375073751

Going ahead, the bank plans to expand the portfolio, the official said, adding that the impending entry of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in the space is not a cause for worry.

“What we have seen is the impact of Covid waves one and two. But since then, whether you track it by entry rates (customers going delinquent for the first time) or by early delinquency of new bookings, both of these look very much under control,” said Sanjeev Moghe, president and head, cards and payments at Axis Bank.

“We are confident that we can keep expanding scale without necessarily adding to incremental risk from here on. The book is very clean right now,” he added.

Indian banks have been aggressively chasing growth in the high-return but exposure-wise unsecured credit card business. Most banks have been upbeat about their credit card portfolios and are engaging in partnerships and tie-ups to add more customers. Axis Bank on March 30 had announced the acquisition of Citibank’s India consumer business for $1.6 billion in an all-cash deal.

On its part, HDFC Bank, after a good chunk of major market share in the credit card space due to a temporary ban on new digital offerings last year, has ramped up its business to gain market share.

Axis Bank is also confident its outstanding credit cards will be higher than what they were in the previous financial year, Moghe said.

The private lender had issued around 1.1 million credit cards in January-March, taking total card issuances in financial year 2022 to 2.7 million.

Axis Bank will continue to gain share in the merchant acquiring space and is also looking to launch some cards in partnership with other companies, Moghe said.

“We are looking at some co-branded credit cards. We launched one with Airtel in March, we have (another) one coming up this week,” Moghe said.

“Beyond that, there are discussions happening in the co-branded space. We will see those fructifying, but those will take six to 12 months,” he added. “Similarly, in the acquiring space, we are looking at a few things and will come by as we go through the year

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 21 announced new norms on credit and debit card issuance for 2022. The central bank said NBFCs with minimum net owned funds of Rs 100 crore can also issue credit cards provided they have a certificate of registration, apart from specific permission from the RBI to enter this business. The RBI also said that charges and interest rates on credit cards shall not be exorbitant and shall be connected with the cost incurred and reasonable expected returns.

The likelihood of NBFCs entering the credit card market will not lead to an incremental business disruption at Axis Bank, Moghe said.

“We are ready to face whatever competition we see in the market, whether it is from banks or NBFCs or fintechs,” he said. “I don’t see any incremental business disruption for Axis Bank.”

Although the impact of this circular on banks’ margins will be “marginal” going forward, it is unlikely to impact the long-term profitability of the banking sector, Moghe said.

In December 2020, the RBI had imposed restrictions on HDFC Bank after repeated outages at the lender's data centre. The restrictions barred HDFC Bank from launching any of the activities planned under its Digital 2.0 programme as well as the sourcing of new credit cards. The regulator revoked the ban completely in March.

When asked about the learnings for the bank from this debacle, Moghe said that Axis Bank continues to watch this space closely and is mindful that one cannot grow only when the competition takes a hit.

“We have put in investments in technology, we upgraded our cards platform some time back,” Moghe said.

“Whether it is the UPI (Unified Payments Interface) space or the cards space, we continue to invest in technology infrastructure. Having said that, we need to be very watchful about downtime incidents,” he added.",697,0.4526877318109785

Axis Bank will wait for the findings of an investigation into frontrunning allegations at Axis Mutual Fund before taking a final decision on penalising erring officials, according to people aware of the lender’s plans. Axis Bank is the sponsor of Axis MF, India’s seventh-largest fund house.

The allegations of frontrunning at Axis MF are being probed by two external agencies appointed by the fund house. Front-running, in this case, refers to a mutual fund dealer trying to profit from his/her knowledge of orders that a fund house has lined up.

While Axis MF says the probe started in February, no action was initiated against any officials for months and there was nothing in the public domain to indicate that the bank was conducting an investigation.

That changed only in the first week of May, when MC Insider published a small item on May 2 about a dealer at a fund house driving around in a Lamborghini, alluding to his disproportionate assets.

Subsequently, it emerged that the mutual fund was finally taking some preliminary action.

On May 6, Moneycontrol broke the news that Axis fund managers Viresh Joshi and Deepak Agarwal had been replaced (suspended) as fund managers on May 4.

No final action for now

No final action will be taken against any official, including Chandresh Nigam, managing director and chief executive officer of Axis Mutual Fund, until the investigation is completed, the people said.

The fund house had launched the probe into allegations of frontrunning in February 2022, Nigam said in a communication to distributors and investors late on May 8.

In the note, Axis MF asserted that it had started the probe on its own and that it was being carried out by external investigators. Preliminary action (suspension) had been taken against two fund managers (one of whom, Viresh Joshi, was the fund house’s chief dealer). Nigam assured investors of the “highest governance standards, stringent protocols and best-in-class processes for fund management.”

Nigam’s Bloomberg ID suspended

On May 6, when Moneycontrol broke the story of Axis fund managers Viresh Joshi and Deepak Agarwal being suspended, it had also come to light that Nigam’s Bloomberg ID had been taken down.

Bloomberg is a database and market information system (aside from being a digital news media company) that portfolio managers and analysts globally use to monitor stocks, markets and portfolios. It is an important tool for portfolio managers, each of whom is assigned an email ID and a login ID. All Bloomberg chats are recorded. Additionally, many fund houses, including a few in India, use Bloomberg as their order management system to instruct brokers which stocks to buy and which ones to sell.

Moneycontrol sources confirmed that the Bloomberg IDs of Joshi and Nigam had been deactivated since the evening of May 4. This means that these officials won’t have access to the Bloomberg system. As of May 10 morning, Nigam’s Bloomberg ID remained suspended.

Asked to explain the implications of the suspension, a fund manager at another fund house said that it was an indication that a major violation is suspected. If found to be true, the implications for the violators would be very severe, he added.

Moneycontrol reached out to Nigam, the fund house’s chief business officer Raghav Iyengar, its corporate communications officials as well as Axis Bank but was not able to elicit any response from them till publishing time.

Axis MF, with assets worth over Rs 2.55 lakh crore, has 23 equity schemes, 19 debt schemes and 9 hybrid schemes. It also manages three funds that invest abroad and two gold exchange-traded funds.

Does the buck stop at the CEO’s desk?

Nigam’s continuance at the helm of the fund house might run afoul of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the capital markets regulator. In October 2020, SEBI had issued a code of conduct for dealers and fund managers at mutual fund houses.

Among other things, the code of conduct stated that dealers and fund managers “shall not indulge in any unethical business activities, or professional misconduct involving dishonesty, fraud or deceit, or commit any act that could damage the reputation of the organisation.”

It also instructed them to avoid “potential conflicts of interest.”

More importantly, SEBI laid down that dealers and fund managers must conduct all communication during market hours only through recorded modes of communication (telephone lines, for instance — all conversations over the phone in dealing rooms are recorded).

“All investment personnel desk phone calls are recorded during market hours. Cell phones are supposed to be kept aside or recorded if used for interaction with market intermediaries. Compliance officers have the authority to record calls and they keep the records,” said a manager at another fund house who did not want to be identified.

SEBI had also made it the responsibility of the heads of fund houses (chief executive officer — whatever be the designation) to ensure that the code of conduct is followed in “letter and spirit.” Any breach of the code of conduct has to be brought to the attention of the board of directors of the asset management company and the trustees, SEBI had added. The regulator had stressed in the code that dealers and fund managers have to provide a self-certification once every three months that they have abided by the code of conduct.

It was the responsibility of Nigam as head of Axis MF to ensure that his fund managers and dealers adhered to the code of conduct. Seen in this light, if his subordinates are found to have violated the SEBI code, he could face some heat from the regulator.

“The chief executive officer has the responsibility to ensure that the code of conduct is followed by all such officers (fund managers, chief investment officers, dealers etc) because in the regulatory experience of some cases, perhaps some of them (CEOs) either turned a blind eye or were complicit. The regulatory expectation from them is very high,” said Sumit Agrawal, founding partner of Regstreet Law Advisor and a former SEBI officer.

The timeline

People familiar with Axis Bank’s thinking told Moneycontrol that the bank’s board has not given any timeline by which the investigation will be completed. It has asked the two probe agencies to submit their findings at the earliest.

Axis MF maintains that the probe started in February 2022, suggesting that it is at least into its third month. A person with knowledge of the matter said a chartered accountancy firm (one of the Big Four) and a law firm have been appointed to jointly investigate the matter. Moneycontrol has not been able to confirm this.

SEBI is said to be monitoring the developments and the probe report is expected in a few weeks.",1121,-0.9840927720069885

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB delivered a mixed quarter, with net profit up 54% YoY (in line), supported by lower provisions, even as margin declined and OPEX stood elevated. Loan growth stood healthy, led by continued momentum in SME and Retail segments. Growth in OPEX stood elevated at 23% YoY and 4% QoQ, resulting in a modest 9% YoY growth in core PPOP. Fresh slippages fell to INR39.8b (v/s INR41.5b in 3QFY22), while higher recoveries and upgrades at IN37.6b and write-offs of INR16.9b enabled a 35bp/18bp QoQ decline in the GNPA/NNPA ratio. We expect AXSB to deliver an FY24 RoA/RoE of 1.6%/15.7%. We maintain our Buy rating.

Union Bank of India became the first public sector bank to go live on the Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem, the bank said on April 29.

Touted as the UPI moment for lending, the AA framework ensures swift data sharing with the consent of the user and eliminates the need for physical documents.

Since it went live in September 2021, 332,000 customer accounts have been linked and over 310,000 consent requests have been fulfilled.

The framework facilitates sharing of financial information on a real-time basis between regulated entities. AAs are licensed by the Reserve Bank of India to enable the flow of data between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FIUs).

FIPs are institutions that hold customer data and FIUs are entities that consume data to offer better service, underwrite loans, and so on. Banks and other financial institutions must become FIPs to be able to also become users of data from other financial institutions.

An AA is data blind and only receives encrypted data which is decrypted only by the FIU.

Union Bank of India has said that it will work both as an FIU and FIP to allow its customers to share data digitally on a real-time basis.

Major private sector banks like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank are already live as FIPs and FIUs. There are 34 banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and other institutions so far live on AA, including Federal Bank, IDFC First Bank and IndusInd Bank.

Moneycontrol had reported on January 17 that the next step for the ecosystem is to grow the number of FIPs and get more banks to go live, mainly the State Bank of India (SBI) which has the largest share of accounts in India.

As per information on the website of Sahamati, a not-for-profit self-organised collective for the AA ecosystem, SBI is in the testing mode.

The ecosystem is also working on linking accounts of Small and Medium Enterprises as only individual current and savings accounts are linked currently. Insurers are working on integrating too and the next step will be to get mutual funds on board.

CAMS, FinVu, NADL and OneMoney have launched AA app and website interfaces for customers to use.",387,0.904554545879364

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis bank earnings were mixed as operating income missed estimates by 4% due to weaker margins although PAT was a beat at Rs41.2bn (PLe: Rs39.8bn) driven by lower provisions (due to stronger recoveries). Loan growth was a tad higher led by retail, however the management was a bit cautious on credit growth in FY23E owing to a tougher global environment. The likelihood of reaching the guided RoE of ~16% seems lower in the medium term as margin recovery could be protracted and opex may remain elevated. However, balance sheet strength and improving asset quality provide some cushion.

Outlook

Valuation discount to ICICIBC might widen to 20-25% (currently 16%) unless NIM improves. With RoE of 14.2% in FY24E, we maintain multiple for AXSB at 2.3x FY24E ABV though cut TP from Rs975 to Rs940. Maintain BUY.

LKP Research's research report on Axis Bank

4QFY22 marks the manifestation of sequentially lower provisioning expenses (₹9.9bn v/s ₹13bn in the previous quarter) and 14% sequential increase in net profit at ₹41bn. The bank’s reported slippages number were lower (₹39.8bn v/s 41.5bn in 3QFY22) with GNPA and NNPA ratio narrowing down to 2.82% and 0.73% respectively against the GNPA and NNPA ratio of 3.17% and 0.91% in the previous quarter. The bank’s PCR (including TWO) stood sequentially higher at 91%. Credit off-take (13.5% YoY) maintained, led by growth across segments. Furthermore, the BB & below book came down sequentially by 13bps to 0.75% of customer assets and reported lower restructured advances of ₹40bn (~52bps of gross loan book). On business front, credit growth (13.5% YoY & 6.4% QoQ) and healthy deposit growth (16.2% YoY & 6.5% QoQ) were superior against previous quarter. The future outlook of asset quality is at manageable level as the strong standard asset coverage (1.8% of gross loans) is likely to absorb delinquencies from restructuring. In view of adequate covid buffer, glimpse of growth rejuvenation and manageable restructuring pool, we recommend BUY.

Outlook

We value the standalone bank at PBV of 2.3xFY23E Adj. BVPS of ₹417 to arrive at a price target of ₹960. We recommend BUY on Axis Bank.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Axis Bank

Despite retail-driven healthy credit growth at 15% yoy, Axis Bank continued to report subdued core earnings growth at 9% yoy, mainly led by subdued margins and higher opex, including a one-time expense related to the Citi portfolio acquisition and business/collection-related spends. However, lower LLP led to a slight beat on PAT at Rs41bn (est: Rs40bn). Axis has taken back earlier exit cost/asset guidance of 2% in Q4FY23 (~2% in FY22), as it may look at accelerated investments in the near-to-medium term, and thus may hurt core earnings. However, Axis retains medium-term RoE guidance of 16-16.5% and long-term RoE aspiration of 18%. We have slightly trimmed our earnings estimates, factoring in higher costs but expect RoE to gradually improve to ~14-16% over FY23-25E from ~7%/12% in FY21/22E. Axis has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Citi Bank’s retail portfolio, including cards, CASA rich deposit pool and nearly 3,600 employees, at a higher price of USD1.6bn/Rs123bn (ex-integration cost of Rs15bn). We believe the acquisition will boost the bank’s retail/card portfolios, but the payback period could be longer and would also dilute the CET 1 ratio by 230bps to ~13%, calling for equity/RoE dilution post the acquisition (Q4FY23).

Outlook

We retain our long-term Buy rating on the stock with a TP of Rs1,020 (value standalone bank at 1.9x FY24E ABV vs. 2x Dec’23 ABV due to higher CoE and subs valuation at Rs73) given steady improvement in RoEs and reasonable valuations. However, the bank’s recent opex conundrum (risk of upward revision in cost/asset guidance for FY23) and the potential impact on core profitability in the near term will impact the stock’s performance.

Axis Bank share price shed more than three percent in early trade on April 29 a day after the company posted quarterly earnings.

Axis Bank, one of the largest private sector lenders in India, reported on April 28 a massive 54 percent year-on-year growth in standalone profit for the quarter ended March, largely driven by significant fall in provisions and improved asset quality.

Profit increased to Rs 4,117.8 crore from Rs 2,677 crore a year ago. Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew 16.7 percent to Rs 8,819 crore with credit growth of 15 percent and deposits growth of 19 percent.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after March quarter earnings:

Goldman Sachs

The brokerage has maintained a buy rating with a price target of Rs 883 per share.

The company may grow earnings at 29 percent compound annual rate over FY22-25, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Morgan Stanley

The research firm has kept an overweight call with a target of Rs 910 per share as profit came above estimate, helped by lower provisions.

The research firm believes the bank will take advantage of lower credit costs for investments, CNBC-TV18 reported.

BofAML

The broking house has maintained a buy rating with a target of Rs 900 per share as earnings were operationally in line while provisions undershot estimates.

Growth was strong in retail and SME and disciplined in wholesale.

The broking house sees headroom for further re-rating on earnings consistency, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Prabhudas Lilladher

Axis Bank earnings were mixed. Loan growth was a tad higher led by retail, but the management was a bit cautious on credit growth in FY23 owing to a tougher global environment. The likelihood of realising the RoE (return on equity) forecast of 16% seems slim in the medium term as margin recovery could be protracted and operating expenditure may remain elevated.

However, balance sheet strength and improving asset quality provide some cushion. Valuation discount to ICICI Bank might widen to 20-25 percent (currently 16 percent) unless net interest margin improves. ""With RoE of 14.2 percent in FY24, we maintain Axis's multiple at 2.3x FY24 ABV and cut target price from Rs 975 to Rs 940. Maintain buy,"" the research house said.

Sharekhan

Axis Bank trades at 1.8x/1.6xits FY2023E/2024E core ABV. We believe its valuations are reasonable. The bank is on an accelerated growth path with high double digit advances growth led by retail, SME and mid corporate segment.

New digital products both in assets & liability segments are growing well, as is reflected in the strong retail franchise growth.

Focus is on sustainable, granular growth leaving behind the legacy burden and higher spending on technology. The bank’s continuous building up of its digital initiatives, franchise with improving asset quality is likely to bode well for growth going ahead.

With a high PCR, strong balance sheet, the bank can absorb shocks from any unanticipated future risk. We maintain our Buy rating with an unchanged price target of Rs 940.

Motilal Oswal

Axis Bank delivered a mixed performance with net earnings picking up sharply, supported by lower provisions, even as margin declined and OPEX stood elevated.

Asset quality continues to improve, aided by a decline in slippages and higher recoveries and upgrades. Restructured book moderated further, while a higher provisioning buffer provides comfort.

We expect slippages to remain in control, enabling a sustained improvement in credit costs, though improvement in margin and cost ratios would be key to watch for. We expect Axis Bank to deliver a FY24 RoA/RoE of 1.6%/15.7%. We maintain our buy rating with a target price of Rs 930/share (1.7x FY24E ABV+ INR111 from its subsidiaries).

At 09:18 hrs Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 756.10, down Rs 23.85, or 3.06 percent on the BSE.

“It (the RBI circular) will have some impact on two aspects. One is just in terms of the number of cards, second, it will impact the margins,” Sanjeev Moghe, EVP & Head, cards & Payments at Axis Bank, told reporters in a conference call on quarterly results. “However, we have seen that when we have cycles of regulatory changes and credit cycles, the business inherently bounces back.”

Moghe added that the circular may not impact the bank’s co-branded card segment. The bank’s strong momentum in issuing credit cards is likely to continue going forward, Moghe added.

Axis Bank issued around 1.1 million credit cards in January-March, taking total card issuances in the financial year 2022 to 2.7 million.

The RBI on April 21 came out with a fresh set of guidelines for credit and debit card issuance for 2022. These guidelines will come into effect from July 1 and are applicable to all banks excluding payments banks, state cooperative banks, and district central cooperative banks. These norms are aimed at protecting the interests of retail consumers.

Meanwhile, Axis Bank will explore capital raising for the Citi Bank deal only when it approaches the timeline, its managing director and chief executive Amitabh Chaudhry said.

“As a prudent management team, we will explore capital raising. Let's come closer to some timeline when the transaction actually happens. There is no point in raising capital if the transaction keeps getting postponed.”

Chief financial officer Puneet Sharma said that the bank will continue to see improvement in net interest margins (NIM) in a rising interest scenario only over the coming quarters.

“NIM is a journey for us, it’s an eight to twelve-quarter journey,” Sharma added.

Axis Bank on Thursday reported a massive 54 percent year-on-year growth in standalone profit largely driven by a significant fall in provisions and improved asset quality performance for the quarter ended March 2022. Profit increased to Rs 4,117.8 crore during the quarter, compared to Rs 2,677 crore in the same period last year, the bank said in its BSE filing.

Provisions and contingencies in Q4FY22 declined sharply by 54.4 percent to Rs 987.2 crore compared to the corresponding period last fiscal, while the sequential decline was 26 percent.

The bank said it has not utilised COVID provisions during the quarter. It holds cumulative provisions (standard + additional other than NPA) of Rs 12,428 crore at the end of Q4FY22.)

A viral video shows the moment thieves used a crane to dig out an ATM in Maharashtra. The bizarre robbery took place in the Miraj area of Maharashtra’s Sangli district. As per local reports, in the early hours of April 23, unidentified persons used a JCB machine to knock down the door of an ATM booth and steal the machine.

CCTV footage of the crime has since gone viral online, racking up thousands of views on Facebook. In the video, a person wearing red trousers first enters the Axis Bank ATM booth. Seconds after he steps out, a crane smashes the glass door of the booth open. It then proceeds to dig out the ATM and drags it out. Take a look:

The account aggregator (AA) ecosystem, introduced in September 2021, can ensure better security and stronger protection of banking data while enhancing customers’ experience, say experts. Nine private banks including, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and IndusInd Bank went live on the AA system last year and five public sector banks will join this year.

The AA network is a financial data-sharing system regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). One of its main features is that data cannot be shared without the consent of the individual concerned.

The finance ministry in the first week of September 2021 said eight of India’s largest banks had introduced the system, even though its concept was approved by the RBI in 2016 itself.

Better user experience

The government when introducing it said the AA system was aimed at helping individuals securely and digitally access the information they have with a financial institution as well as share this information with any other regulated financial institution within the AA network. Banks that have implemented the system say the network has been built with the customer at the center. It empowers customers to effectively manage their data.

“They have the power to decide with whom their data can be shared, for what purpose it can be used, and for what duration it can be retained,” said Deepak Sharma, president and chief digital officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank.

At its launch, the government said the AA system replaces the complex ‘terms and conditions’ form of ‘blank cheque’ acceptance with granular, step-by-step permissions and control each time the customer’s data is used.

“In a regular scenario, there is significant effort involved, wherein the customer has to share their banking data with another bank/financial institution using hard copies or PDF documents. However, with the AA framework, it is very easy for customers to share information either one time or on an ongoing basis for a defined period of time,” said Sameer Shetty, president, and head, of digital business and transformation, Axis Bank.

Moreover, as pointed out by various lenders, the system makes things easier for customers, eliminating duplication and paperwork to offer seamless information to banks.

“The ease of on-boarding and managing consent by customers will ensure large-scale adoption in every nook and corner of the country,” said Murali Ramakrishnan, MD and CEO, South Indian Bank.

Enhanced encryption of users’ data

The system aims to create a third-party trusted source of information that allows seamless data flow between all players, say experts. “In various cases, once customers’ data is shared with a bank for one purpose, it gets circulated among other departments too. For example, if a customer shares her/his data for a housing loan, it might happen that the vehicle loan department may get access to it. But the AA system prohibits that,” said Nageen Kommu, founder and CEO, Digitap, a tech company providing AI-driven solutions for the banking industry.

Customers can choose which department their data will be shared with and the system minimises the chance of data sharing even within various departments of the same bank. “The system enables customers to offer authentic information in a controlled and managed environment to all the players in the ecosystem, including banks,” said Kunal Jhunjhunwala, founder and MD, Airpay, a payment gateway for banks.

It helps customers take real-time lending decisions in multi-bank personal finance management (PFM) and maintain a consolidated financial dashboard while also enabling wealth assessment and planning, all the while ensuring encryption.

“AA handles the consent management part on behalf of the customer and the data is exchanged only between financial information users (FIU) and financial information providers ensuring that only the right FIU receives the data,” said Sharma.

The privacy aspect is well taken care of by the regulator requiring customer consent. This can pave the road to full-fledged open banking in India going forward, according to Ramakrishnan.

What next?

Although widely accepted in the banking sector, several experts asserted that there is still room for improvement for the system. Banks already part of the AA system said more banks joining it will strengthen it further. “In future, the addition of GST (goods and services tax), PF (provident fund) and utility bills information in the AA framework will make it truly transformational,” added Shetty.",773,0.9417463958263397

State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, increased its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points across tenors, effective April 15.

The overnight, one-month and three-month MCLRs have been hiked to 6.75 percent each from 6.65 percent earlier, according to SBI’s website.

The one-year MCLR currently stands at 7.10 percent from 7 percent earlier. The six-month MCLR is now 7.05 percent from 6.95 percent previously.

The two-year and three-year MCLRs have been hiked 10 bps each to 7.30 percent and 7.40 percent, respectively.

Also, private sector lender Axis Bank has hiked MCLR by 5 bps across tenures effective today, April 18.

MCLR is an internal reference rate for banks set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to help define the minimum interest rate on various types of loans, including home loans.

The RBI’s repo rate has been kept unchanged at 4 percent since May 2020. That’s the rate at which the central bank lends short-term funds to banks.

Retail inflation in India jumped to a 17-month high of 6.95 percent in March from 6.07 percent in February, driven by high food prices. If inflation concerns persist and there are no shocks to growth, interest rates will likely be hiked later this year, analysts said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 8, imposed monetary penalty of Rs 93 lakh and Rs 90 lakh on Axis Bank and IDBI Bank, respectively, for deficiencies in regulatory compliance.

While Axis Bank faced the action for violating certain directions issued by the RBI regarding banking services such as loans, levy of penal charges on non-maintenance of minimum balances in savings bank accounts, Know your customer (KYC) services etc, IDBI Bank violated regulations related to frauds and cyber security, the central bank said in separate statements.

RBI clarified in the statements that the penalties are not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the banks with its customers.

RBI conducted the Statutory Inspections for Supervisory Evaluation recently on both the banks regarding their financial positions as on March 31, 2017, March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019, and examined the respective Risk Assessment Report, Inspection Report and all related correspondences pertaining to the same.

After examination and evaluation, it was revealed that Axis bank failed to maintain the prescribed margin in case of intraday facilities sanctioned to stockbrokers and also did not follow restrictive practices in the sale of insurance products to customers. Further, the bank even failed to verify the copy of officially valid documents so produced by the clients, with the originals, while establishing account-based relationships. RBI even found some customer IDs having multiple CIFs instead of a Unique Customer Identification Code (UCIC), and there has been instances of penal charges being levied for non-maintenance of minimum balance in savings bank accounts, not directly proportionate to the extent of the shortfall observed.

On the other hand, for IDBI Bank, the RBI reported incidents of multiple fraudulent transactions over two days on June 08 and 09, 2019 in the accounts of two corporate net banking customers (Co-operative banks). The bank delayed in reporting frauds to RBI and also there was a delay in submission of Flash Reports in respect of frauds involving an amount of Rs 5 crore and above to RBI. IDBI also failed to implement time restrictions on holidays and data access control for corporate net banking to put through fund transfer resulting in unauthorized debit transactions in the account of two co-operative banks.

The monetary policy announced by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 8 was largely on expected lines with the repo and reverse repo rate left unchanged at 4 percent and 3.35 percent, respectively, with an upward revision in inflation and cut in growth forecast, citing the spike in commodity prices due to supply disruptions caused by the Ukraine-Russia war.

The central bank has maintained its ‘accommodative stance’ while focusing on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward, while supporting growth.

Analysts say the RBI has chosen to support growth over inflation by keeping the rates at the same level. “We believe it is a sensible choice because for India to attract foreign capital it will have to focus on generating growth. It has tried its best to balance the sharp increase in inflation forecast and a lower GDP growth forecast,” said Abhay Agarwal, founder and fund manager at Piper Serica.

He believes that the RBI does not want to signal a series of rate hikes that will increase the cost of borrowing and negatively impact the nascent recovery in consumer sentiment, manufacturing and rural income. “The hope is that with supply bottlenecks easing inflation will trend down.”

Rate-sensitive stocks including banks, financial services, auto and realty largely remained flat as the policy was on expected lines.

After the sharp increase in oil prices, the key element in the import bill, the RBI has lowered its GDP forecast to 7.2 percent for FY23 from 7.8 percent earlier, while significantly raising the full-year CPI inflation forecast to 5.7 percent from 4.5 percent earlier.

The central bank assumed oil price at $100 a barrel for forecasting economic growth and CPI inflation. “This implies that growth and inflation can be better if crude declines sharply if the war hopefully ends early,” said VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services.

The MPC is of the view that since the February meeting, the ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions, generalised hardening of global commodity prices, the likelihood of prolonged supply chain disruptions, dislocations in trade and capital flows, divergent monetary policy responses and volatility in global financial markets are imparting sizeable upside risks to the inflation trajectory and downside risks to domestic growth.

Given the cross-current of multiple headwinds, “our approach needs to be cautious but proactive in mitigating the adverse impact on India’s growth, inflation and financial conditions”, said RBI governor Shaktikanta Das while addressing a press conference.

He added that the RBI is, however, reassured by the strong buffers that India has built over the past few years, including large foreign exchange reserves, significant improvement in external sector indicators and substantial strengthening of the financial sector, all of which would help weather this storm. “Once again, we in the RBI stand resolute and in readiness to defend the economy and navigate out of the current storm.”

Das rightly emphasised India’s macro strengths, pointing to the improvement in the external situation helped by record exports, ample forex reserves of $606.5 billion and strengthening of the financial sector, said Vijayakumar.

The RBI has introduced the standing deposit facility (SDF) as a new tool to absorb liquidity. The SDF rate, which will now be the floor of the liquidity adjustment facility corridor, will be at 3.75 percent.

The prices have given a falling trend line breakout on the daily chart which indicates a positive momentum is likely to continue.

Prior breakout prices consolidated for almost seven trading sessions and we witnessed above-average volume activity during that period, indicating accumulation stage for the counter.

While looking at the overall price formation and fresh breakout, we expect prices to trade higher towards Rs 184 levels.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,517 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,450 | Target: Rs 1,625 | Return: 7 percent

After the recent correction, HDFC Bank is hovering near the 61.8 percent retracement level of the entire rally which started from Rs 1,400 to Rs 1,700. This support coincides with the gap area formed due to the merger news.

The support zone is also the placement of the Kijun of Ichimoku indicator. Hence there is a high probability that the stock might resume its uptrend.

Thus, short-term traders are advised to buy the stock in the range of Rs 1,515-1,505 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,450 for the upside potential target of Rs 1,625 in the next two to three weeks.

Sunteck Realty: Buy | LTP: Rs 480 | Stop-Loss: Rs 450 | Target: Rs 530 | Return: 10 percent

The stock is on the verge of a massive breakout which might get confirmed above the Rs 500 mark. At this juncture, the trend is very strong and the price action indicates that the possibility of the breakout is very high.

India's antitrust body is investigating the trustee units of State Bank of India, Axis Bank and IDBI Bank for suspected collusion on fees, triggering a lawsuit by a group representing them, documents seen by Reuters showed.

Indian regulations mandate that companies raising debt appoint a so-called ""debenture trustee"" to protect the interests of investors. The trustees charge a fee from the companies issuing the debt and make independent due-diligence checks on them.

The three under investigation - SBICAP Trustee Company, Axis Trustee and IDBI Trusteeship - are among the leaders in the business in India overseeing hundreds of billions of dollars by rendering trustee services for not just debt securities, but also real estate and other investment funds.

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in a confidential December order stated the Trustees Association of India - a body where the trio are founding members - last year ""substantially"" increased the fee for assisting companies raising debt and prevented members from going below a floor price, thereby hurting competition.

The association has launched a court challenge in Mumbai that seeks to quash the antitrust investigation directive it has termed ""illegal"" and ""capricious"", according to court filings. The lawsuit will be heard on Thursday.

The antitrust probe and the impending court hearing, details of which have not been previously reported, could have ramifications on India's nearly $500 billion corporate debt market by altering costs and affecting the way trustees operate.

A finding of cartelisation could lead to a fine of up to three times the profit in each year the fee was fixed by the trustees, or 10 percent of annual revenue for the period of violation, whichever is more.

SBICAP Trustee and IDBI Trusteeship didn't respond to requests for comment. Axis Trustee, which is listed as President of the Trustee Association in documents, also didn't respond.

The CCI, which does not publicly disclose its cartel probes that are underway, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

COMPLAINT BY BORROWER

The antitrust case was triggered by a complaint from Indian gold financing company Muthoot Finance. When it wanted to raise debt in August last year, Muthoot received a costing proposal which was 300 percent higher than previous rates.

The documents showed that when Muthoot protested, IDBI said in an August email ""the new pricing structure is decided by the Trustee Association"", adding that ""any deviation by us in quoting the price would lead to adverse repercussion on us"".

The CCI, while ordering its investigation, noted: ""Such collective decision making by the association ... affects competition in the markets.""

In February it asked the trustee association to submit their meeting records and explain its role in fixing a minimum fee structure, one document showed.

The trustee association has defended itself in the court filings by saying the higher fee was justified as their cost burden had gone up over the years due to enhanced regulatory compliance requirements.

It said it had informed the market regulator SEBI last year that the pricing structure will be decided by trustees, but it ""will not be below the benchmark floor price"".

The group said that the matter, by law, can only be investigated by a ""specialised sectoral regulator"", in this case SEBI.

SEBI, already ""provides enough checks and balances to deal with any price rigging (cartelisation),"" it argued.

Before approaching the antitrust body, Muthoot also lodged a complaint against the trustees with SEBI, which is still being reviewed, the documents stated.

Piramal Enterprises on April 1 informed the stock exchanges that its board has approved the appointment of Shikha Sharma, the former chief executive officer of Axis Bank, as a non-executive director.

The appointment came into effect on March 31, 2022, the regulatory filing stated.

""Board of directors of the company at its meeting held on 31st March, 2022, based on the recommendations of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, appointed Ms Shikha Sharma as a Non-Executive Non-Independent Director of the Company with effect from 31st March, 2022, liable to retire by rotation, subject to the approval of the shareholders of the company,"" it said.

Piramal also confirmed that Sharma is not related to any of the incumbent directors of the company, and ""is not debarred from holding the office of director by virtue of any SEBI order"".

Notably, Sharma is a veteran banker with close to 40 years of experience. An alumni of IIM-Ahmedabad, she began her career with ICICI Bank in 1980. She was the MD and CEO of ICICI Personal Financial Services from May 1998 to December 2000.

HDFC Securities' research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank announced the acquisition of Citibank’s cards, consumer lending, and wealth businesses in a transaction that is likely to be closed over the next 9-12 months. At an acquisition cost of US$1.6bn, while the deal appears to be a bargain for Axis Bank, the value accretion from Citi’s portfolio over the medium term is contingent on a host of factors including retention of existing customers, Axis Bank’s ability to continually add customers of such profile and its ability to up-sell and cross-sell. Although the Citibank transaction adds significant heft to Axis Bank’s competitive positioning across cards and wealth management businesses, we believe that Axis Bank will need to up its game in order to create sustainable value from the Citibank portfolio.

Outlook

Especially given the distinct and superior customer profile that gets added through this transaction, we believe that synergies are likely to be back-ended and are conditional on significant frontloading of investments. At CMP, Axis Bank provides good margin of safety; we maintain BUY with TP of INR950.

Axis Bank on Wednesday said it will acquire US-based Citi's consumer business in India for Rs 12,325 crore in one of the largest deals in the Indian financial services space which will help it close the gap with larger peers like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.

“Axis Bank and Citibank today announced that their respective Board of Directors have approved the acquisition of Citibank’s consumer business in India by Axis Bank,” Axis Bank said in a tweet. The post was accompanied by a graphic card with the text: The city always stays open”.

The day after the deal, Axis Bank put out a frontpage newspaper advertisement with a clever wordplay on Citibank's iconic “Citi never sleeps” slogan.

“The city never closes. It stays open,” the Axis Bank ad reads.

HSBC too joined the Axis Bank-Citibank buzz to put out a sharply-worded half-page ad on the same day. “What’s beyond the city? Only the entire world,” the ad text reads.

The employees who are part of Citibank's India consumer business, who number up to 3,600, will be transferred to Axis ""upon completion of the proposed transaction"", the Citigroup said.

Citi India CEO Ashu Khullar said the deal with Axis is a ""positive outcome for our staff"", adding that the company's priority has been on securing their future.

The deal comes almost a year after Citibank had announced that it will exit its consumer franchises in 13 markets, including India, and refocus on its more lucrative institutional and wealth management businesses. Its Indian consumer banking business comprises credit cards, home loans and retail banking.

Axis Bank emerged as the lead buyer after beating rivals like Kotak, another private lender which was reportedly ""more aggressive"" and had submitted a bid lower than that of Axis, CNBC TV18 reported earlier today.

ICICI Securities research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank shells out a purchase consideration of Rs123bn for Citibank’s India consumer business to acquire: 1) loan portfolio of Rs274bn (accretion of 4% to its advance base) across credit cards, mortgage, personal & ready credit loans, assetbacked finance and small business banking; 2) 2.5mn credit card customer base (addition of 31% to its base); 3) granular deposit base of Rs502bn, of which 81% is CASA (increase of 7% in its deposit base and 12% to its CASA); 4) AUM of Rs1.1trn across Citi’s Wealth & Private Banking products to augment Axis’ Burgundy brand. The implied equity value of Rs158bn (including notional capital allocation of Rs34.5bn) suggests the deal is to be consummated at 18.7x normalised CY20 earnings and 4x book value. Even adjusting for the estimated integration cost of Rs15bn (of which Rs12bn will be paid to Citibank), the deal appears favourable as it gives Axis Bank access to Citibank’s huge retail deposit base, affluent and profitable consumer franchise and strategic synergy benefits over the medium term.



Outlook

Maintain BUY with an unchanged target price of Rs1,050. Key risks: in the immediate term, it will not be financially accretive and, also, hit on networth (due to goodwill amortisation) and CET1 (due to capital allocation) will make equity raise imminent. Also, retention of an acquired credit card and deposit customer base will be key.

Emkay Global Financial's report on AXIS Bank

Axis Bank has announced the acquisition of Citi Bank’s (incl subsidiaries) top-notch retail banking portfolio. The purchase should provide a strategic thrust to the bank’s retail banking aspirations and otherwise lagging RoAs in the long run as synergy benefits kick in. Following are the key takeaways from the call and our view: Axis would acquire consumer banking assets to the tune of Rs502bn, including loans worth Rs274bn (Mortgages: Rs100bn, Cards: Rs89bn, other retail/small banking loans: Rs85bn) and liquid assets of Rs228bn, against the liabilities/deposits of Rs502bn (including 81% CASA), making the transaction NAV neutral. Moreover, Axis will get wealth management, private banking and Insurance distribution businesses. The bank will make an offer to 3,600 Citi Consumer employees to join Axis, which will be essential for a smooth transition and scaling up of the business. After the deal, Axis Bank's loan/deposit base will increase by just 4%/7%. However, its CASA ratio will improve by 200bps to 47%, leading to some benefit on CoF, partly offset by a higher savings rate of 3% vs. 2.5% offered by Citi (will help with customer retention). The bank will also get access to a strong and affluent retail customer base for cross-selling, and thus driving in revenue gains (including fees) in the long run.



Outlook

That said, Axis will have to deliver on business retention/upscaling and drive cost/revenue synergies after the acquisition, leading to better RoAs and thus justifying high valuations paid for the acquisition. Currently, we have a Buy rating on Axis with a TP of Rs1,020 (based on 2x Dec’23E ABV + subs value of Rs73).

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB announced the acquisition of Citibank India's Consumer Banking business for a cash consideration of ~INR123b. The deal includes the Credit Card, Wealth, and Retail Banking operations of both Citibank India and Citicorp Finance. It will acquire loans/deposits worth INR274b/INR509b, including the Credit Card book of INR89b. This will increase its Credit Card book by 57% to INR244b and propel it to among the top three players. Wealth Management AUM will rise ~42% to INR3.8t, making it the third largest player on combined AUM. AXSB will acquire ~3m unique customers, complemented by Citibank's Affluent Customer segment. Post-acquisition, it will have ~28.5m savings accounts, more than 0.23m Burgundy customers, and 10.6m cards. While synergies in terms of cost savings and RoA accretion will take more than two years to accrue, the deal, at 18.7x P/E on CY20 normalized earnings, makes limited economic sense from medium term perspective given the declining revenue profile /cards base of Citi’s business, higher capital charge and high integration cost to be absorbed over the next 2 years. However, over the long term, the success of deal would depend on how well AXSB is able to cross sell its entire bouquet of banking products to Citi customers and also gain from Citi’s well recognized digital and operation processes. CET I ratio is likely to moderate by ~230bp to ~13%, the lowest in the past three years, and may necessitate another capital raise over FY23.



Outlook

However, the small acquisition size (~4% of loans) will have a limited impact on overall profitability. We maintain our Buy rating, but reduce our TP to INR930/share (2x FY24E P/ABV).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

The much awaited Axis-Citi deal was announced yesterday, wherein Axis will acquire Citibank’s self-funded consumer businesses for Rs123bn. Deposits/assets to be purchased will be Rs502bn/274bn with credit card portfolio of Rs89bn. Rationale for the deal is (i) building a premium base of customers and increasing granularity (ii) Citi’s portfolio complementing that of Axis, as both entities have different customer profile and (iii) good cross sell opportunities for Axis which would eventually lead to synergies. In our view, the deal is positive for Axis Bank in medium term, however the key is customer retention. With systemic asset quality risk receding and credit growth prospects improving, Axis could be one of the main beneficiaries.



Outlook

We raise the multiple/TP to 2.3x/Rs975 as we roll forward to FY24E ABV. Upgrade to ‘BUY’ from Accumulate.

Citi’s retail buisness is a good deal but customer retention would be key, it said. Purchase consideration at 19x earnings is fair and will not be earnings dilutive. Deal will be 8-9 percent book dilutive but there will be a +150 bps RoE accretion, it said.

Jefferies has also retained “buy” call with the target at Rs 1,040 a share, a rise of 37 percent from the current level. ""It lifts credit card base by 31 percent and wealth AUM by 42 percent.

American banking major Citi has joined a long list of foreign banks that have either exited or cut down on their business presence in India with the sale of its consumer banking business to Axis Bank for Rs 12,325 crore.

Except for Singaporean lender DBS Bank, which has expanded its presence in the country and also acquired a domestic private sector bank, many foreign lenders have cut their presence in the country due to a slew of reasons, including global strategies or also technological shifts like automation and online banking which make branch banking redundant.

The foreign lenders also have a litany of concerns with the regulatory landscape in India, starting with priority sector lending (PSL) under which they have to devote 40 per cent of their loans to segments mandated by the government or face a penalty, the insistence on operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary and not as a branch of a foreign subsidiary to ring-fence local operations and also others like data localisation.

However, nearly all the major foreign lenders including those who do not have banking operations in the country, use India as a back office to support their global operations and employ thousands of techies in cities like Bengaluru and Pune.

Before Citi's exit from the consumer banking business was announced on Wednesday, global banking majors such as ANZ Grindlays, RBS, Commonwealth Bank of Australia have scaled down their operations in India.

Citi's scaling down of operations in India is part of its strategy to exit retail businesses in 13 markets to conserve capital and focus on higher-yielding revenue streams. It had entered India in 1902 and started the consumer banking business in 1985.

Earlier in 2012, British banking major Barclays massively scaled down India operations by closing a third of its branches located in the non-metro areas. Shrinking its operations in India was part of the UK based bank's strategy to move away from retail banking to concentrate more on the corporate banking, investment banking and wealth management verticals.

In 2016, Commonwealth Bank of Australia exited India operations saying the decision was taken after a careful evaluation of its India operations alongside its refocussed strategy.

The same year, Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) too decided to wind up its corporate, retail, and institutional banking business in the Indian market as it wanted to reduce its global footprint.

Australia and New Zealand Bank, in 2000, wound up domestic operations here after selling its Grindlays Bank unit to Standard Chartered for USD 1.34 billion. However, it re-entered the Indian market in 2011 by opening a new branch in Mumbai.

ANZ was in India since 1984 through its presence as Grindlays Bank. In 2011, Deutsche Bank sold its credit card business to IndusInd Bank. In 2013, UBS exited India operations while Morgan Stanley surrendered its banking license while continuing its investment banking business.

Likewise, Merril Lynch, Barclays and Standard Chartered scaled down their operations in 2015.

Among others, HSBC halved its branches to just over two dozen on technological shifts, and reduced its presence in 14 cities in 2016, while BNP Paribas shut down its wealth management business in India in 2020.",553,-0.9697513182957967

Axis Bank Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Chaudhry on March 30 called the bank’s move to acquire Citibank's India consumer business as a “deal of a lifetime”. The buyout will give Axis Bank access to 2.5 million Citibank customer cards and will result in an increase of around 31% to its existing card base.

The transaction will aid the lender in increasing its card spends market share by 480 basis points, the MD said. “Citibank has a complimentary and quality portfolio of close to 2.5 million cards with amongst the highest monthly spends per card across industry and a book size of approximately Rs 8,900 crore as of June 2021,” he added.

Further, post conclusion of the transaction, the combined assets under management of Axis Bank’s wealth management business will increase by 42%, making it the third-largest wealth manager in the country, as per Chaudhry.

The combined current account and savings account ratio, on a proforma basis, post completion of the transaction would improve by 200 basis points to 47% and it will also be liquidity coverage ratio accretive, the management said.

“The consumer lending portfolio of approximately Rs 18,500 crore consists of mortgages, asset-backed finance, small business lending, and personal loans. These are our focus segments as well and will deepen our relationship in this space by offering differentiated financial solutions,” the MD said.

Apart from improvement in the CASA ratio, net interest margin, and credit card market share, the deal would also give Axis Bank access to the premium set of high spending customers.

Addressing a press conference today, Chaudry said Axis Bank has grown organically all these years and scaled well but its aspirations are bigger. “This deal gives us the strategic thrust to close the gap between us and some of our peers. We hope this particular acquisition will improve the quality of our franchise across many parameters meaningfully,” he said.

When asked whether the bank will raise capital to fund this acquisition, Chaudhry said the bank intends to pay for this transaction from its own balance sheet. However, going ahead depending on the credit demand and macro-economic conditions, the bank will look at raising capital.

On a question about how the bank aims to tackle the attrition problem of Citibank India customers, Chaudhry said as per data shared by Citi with the bank, the customer retention levels remain satisfactory.

“Obviously there is a risk that there could be customer attrition. We believe very strongly that Axis Bank has a bigger suite of products and services to offer to Citibank customers. Citibank was limited by branch presence, perks that it could offer, Axis Bank has much more to offer,” he said.

He added that there were certain price-adjusted mechanisms that were part of the deal which will kick in if customer attrition goes beyond certain numbers.",481,0.9696485267745124

The employees who are part of Citibank's India consumer business, who number up to 3,600, will be transferred to Axis ""upon completion of the proposed transaction"", the Citigroup said.

Citi India CEO Ashu Khullar said the deal with Axis is a ""positive outcome for our staff"", adding that the company's priority has been on securing their future.

""We continue to remain committed to contributing to India’s growth and development as we deepen our presence through our institutional businesses and our community initiatives. Citi will also continue to harness India’s rich talent pool in the areas of technology, operations, analytics, finance and allied functional areas through its network of Citi solution centers that are located in five cities in India and support our global businesses,"" Khullar added.

In a disclosure to the stock exchanges, Axis Bank said it looks at this acquisition as a ""healthy strategic fit"", which will provide ""access to the large and affluent customer franchise of Citibank having a bouquet of fee-oriented and profitable segments"".

The acquired portfolio, the bank said, would increase its credit card customer base by around 31 percent with an additional 2.5 million cards, ""which will in turn bolster the cards balance sheet position to be amongst the top three players in the Indian market"".

The deal comes almost a year after Citibank had announced that it will exit its consumer franchises in 13 markets, including India, and refocus on its more lucrative institutional and wealth management businesses. Its Indian consumer banking business comprises credit cards, home loans and retail banking.

Axis Bank emerged as the lead buyer after beating rivals like Kotak, another private lender which was reportedly ""more aggressive"" and had submitted a bid lower than that of Axis, CNBC TV18 reported earlier today. Other factors like job security for current Citigroup employees, competition concerns, and more were also considered before taking the final call, the report added.

Axis Bank MD and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said the acquisition will add an ""enviable retail franchise and a high-quality talent pool as we continue our journey towards becoming a premier financial services brand"".

""The amplified scale and width of offerings, the diversified portfolio of products and global best practices will enhance customer experience, while greater synergies both on revenue and cost side will augment value for the new franchise,"" Chaudhry added.

The deal, according to the statement issued by Citigroup, is ""expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023"" subject to requisite regulatory approvals.

Citibank India ""will ensure that it is done in as seamless a manner as possible"" in order to prevent any immediate impact on its customers in the consumer businesses segment, it noted.

""Upon closing, Citi expects the transaction to result in the release of approximately US$800 million of allocated tangible common equity,"" Citigroup added.

Urban educated women's participation in the workforce still not at desired levels, Axis Bank has kicked off the 'HouseWorkIsWork' initiative, offering opportunities to those who want to rejoin the professional space.

The intent behind this initiative is to give these women the confidence that they are employable, they have skills and they can fit in various job roles in a bank and it is about getting these women back to work, Axis Bank President and Head (HR) Rajkamal Vempati said in an interaction on the bank's recent hiring initiative 'HouseWorkIsWork'.

She said it is a challenge for a large organisation like Axis Bank to hire right and skilled people and 'HouseWorkIsWork' is the bank's way of exploring beyond the tried templates.

""This is one way of saying that we move beyond the templates and be open to hiring different kinds of people. It is also about the women who have not participated in the workforce.

""The point to be highlighted is that the urban educated Indian women are not there much in the workforce and this is about getting these women to the workforce,"" Vempati said.

Citing an example, she said the idea of 'HouseWorkIsWork' bloomed from one interesting and innovative resume of one such latest hiree Pallavi Sharma, who beautifully put her various job roles at home akin to those at professional organisations.

Pallavi's resume introduces her as an employee at 'Sharma Residence' in roles such as head multiple projects (finance and HR; DE&I, learning and development; facilities and employee engagement) and these are all the roles she plays while managing her household, finances and raising kids, among others.

This pushed the bank to not only rethink about their hiring heuristics but also take steps to bring about a paradigm shift in people's mindsets about the valuable work undertaken by homemakers instead of categorising that as a break, Vempati said.

Axis Bank has been receiving encouraging participation from women across the country for these job offers ranging from freelancers, customer care executives, IT professionals, human resources, CSR and others that can keep women employed or regain work.

""There are many women who want to come full time, so it extends to all formats of work not only GIG-A, including women who want to come and work in branches,"" said the HR head of the lender.

GIG-A-Opportunities is Axis Bank's new platform for alternative work models to attract the finest talent, with a promise of growth with flexibility, diversity and inclusivity. She said that given the overwhelming response, of over 3,000 resumes received, the bank has pushed the cap to hire more over time.

On the salary part, Axis Bank will pay such joinees as per their suitability to the job, skill-set and experience. The price of the job is more important, and the employee benefits will be at par with the regular employees, Vempati added.",486,0.4415116459131241

Citibank's retail business in India is set to be acquired by Axis Bank and a closure of the deal is expected to be finalised by next week, reported CNBC-TV18.

""Citibank is set to announce the closure of deal for its consumer business in India next week,"" sources told CNBC-TV18.

It also reported that the size of the deal is between $2 and $2.5 billion. As part of the deal, Citibank will continue to service the customers during the integration period so that the transition is seamless and no one is inconvenienced.

""Total size of the deal expected between $2 to $2.5 billion including cash component and incentives. Citi may continue to service customers during the integration period with Axis as part of the deal,"" sources added.

Axis Bank will also acquire Citibank’s credit card division in India, according to the report. Citi has a lucrative customer base of 2.6 million credit card holders.

The global bank has 35 branches in India and close to 4,000 employees. Its customer base is about 2.5 million account holders with 1.2 million loan accounts.

Moneycontrol had earlier reported that Axis Bank was most likely to strike an all-cash deal for Citi's India retail assets.

Subject to approval from the RBI, an agreement for the consumer unit is scheduled to be announced in the next few weeks.

Various media reports have noted that the deal would include a cash component of less than $2 billion, accounting for the consumer business's liabilities. Citi's India retail business involves over 2.5 million customers and more than 1.2 million bank accounts.

Last month, Moneycontrol had reported that Axis Bank was most likely to strike an all-cash deal for Citi's India retail assets, which could be worth $1.5 billion. This would include milestone payments of up to $300-400 million depending on the future performance.

Axis Bank emerged as the lead buyer after beating out rivals like Kotak, another private lender which was reportedly ""more aggressive"" and had submitted a bid lower than that of Axis. Other factors like job security for current Citigroup employees, competition concerns, and more were also considered before taking the final call.

Reports suggest that Axis Bank will need around six more months to merge its consumer business in the country with Citigroup’s once the acquisition comes through.

To put Citi’s consumer business in India, which comprises credit cards, retail banking, home loans, and wealth management into perspective, the bank has 35 branches in the country and employs 4,000 people in the consumer banking business. It had a 0.6 percent market share in advances and 1.1 percent in deposits, along with 2.58 million credit cards outstanding, as of October 2021.

The offloading of retail banking segments by Citigroup forms a part of the comprehensive restructuring undertaken by the US lender to do away with such operations in 13 countries, namely Australia, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, whilst maintaining an exclusive focus on high-growth businesses like wealth management.

This augurs well for Axis Bank as well, which is India's third-largest private sector lender and has been looking to boost retail loans to harness the pent-up demand in the wake of the pandemic.

In January, the bank had stated that its quarterly profit more than tripled on robust earnings from lending and its non-core business fees and trading, as the easing of the coronavirus pandemic helped a revival of consumer demand.",395,0.3462393681208293

The Nifty saw good upside during the last 5-6 trading sessions and post the budget session. After nearly 1,000 points rally from 16,840 to 17,800 level, the index is now facing resistance at the 20-day SMA (17,750) (simple moving average) which confluences with the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the previous fall (18,350-16,840).

From past 2 sessions, the index is facing resistance in the 17,750-17,800 zone. The downside support for the index is placed at 17,440 (50-day SMA) followed by 17,250 level.

Broadly, we expect the index to trade in a range of 17,000-17,800. For any further upside, it is important that the index breaks and sustains above 17,750-17,800 resistance zone.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 799.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 760 | Target: Rs 936 | Return: 17 percent

The RSI (relative strength index) plotted on the weekly time frame has moved above the 50 mark and is currently moving higher towards the overbought level, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.

Going ahead, we expect the prices to move higher towards the previous swing high of Rs 870, after that we might see a move towards Rs 936.

We recommend a stop-loss of Rs 760 on daily closing basis.

Maruti Suzuki: Buy | LTP: Rs 8,593.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 8,200 | Target: Rs 10,000 | Return: 16 percent

The RSI plotted on the weekly chart can be seen placed above the 50 nark and moving higher, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.

Going ahead, we might see the prices move higher towards the Rs 9,600 mark. If the prices manage to breach above the Rs 9,600 mark we might see further up move towards the Rs 10,000 level.

We recommend a strict stop-loss of Rs 8,200 on daily closing basis.

Biocon: Buy | LTP: Rs 392.70 | Stop-Loss: Rs 370 | Target: Rs 460 | Return: 17 percent

Biocon has broken above the 6 months consolidation. Along with the breakout the stock has also breached above the 50-week SMA resistance and formed a strong bullish candle.

The RSI indicator plotted has also broken out of the range and is confirming the breakout.

We expect the stock to move higher towards Rs 430 and if managed to cross above Rs 430 then eventually towards Rs 460 level. One should maintain a strict stop-loss of Rs 370 on daily closing basis for this trade.

The BSE Sensex added more than 360 points to close above 57,850 levels, while the Nifty50 rallied more than 120 points to close above 17,270 levels, backed by Banks, Auto, FMCG, Metals and Pharma stocks.

The broader markets also participated in the bull run with the Nifty Midcap 100 index and Smallcap 100 indexes rising 1 percent each.

Maruti Suzuki, closing 6.83 percent higher at Rs 8,602.60 apiece, was the top Nifty gainer, followed by Axis Bank, which settled 6.76 percent higher at Rs 752.20 per share.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises, surging 7.72 percent to close at Rs 288.80 apiece, was the top gainer in the futures & options segment. On the other hand, Bharat Dynamics rose 4.16 percent to settle at record closing high of Rs 465.35.

Here's what Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Maruti Suzuki India

This counter seems to have registered multiple breakouts apart from a minor consolidation breakout on daily chart. However, on weekly charts this counter is moving in a well-defined 30 week channel and hence its initial target can be the upper boundary of the said channel whose value is placed around Rs 8,700 levels.

Therefore, for further upsides it needs a breakout above the said channel and in that scenario eventually life time highs present around Rs 9,990 can be expected.

For time being, fresh buying should be considered on dips but with a stop-loss placed below Rs 7,887 on closing basis and look for near term target of Rs 9,000 levels.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises

This counter appears to have taken support as it entered into the wide bullish gap zone of Rs 281 – Rs 261 levels registered on September 22, 2021. Considering the strong bounce witnessed in last trading session a tradable bounce can be expected from the current levels.

Therefore, sustaining above Rs 262 levels a higher target of Rs 330 can be expected. Dips can be considered as an opportunity to create fresh longs with a stop below Rs 260.

Axis Bank

Strong recovery of this counter by erasing 8-day old corrective structure in just a single session is hinting not only the end of correction but also suggesting this counter might have embarked on a fresh leg of upswing.

Therefore, any dip towards its 200-day moving average (Rs 718) can be an opportunity to create fresh long positions and sustaining above Rs 708 levels a higher target of Rs 820 can be expected. Stop-loss suggested for the trade is a close below Rs 718 levels.

Bharat Dynamics

This counter is displaying a better relative strength, when compared to the indices, as it remained unruffled even in the midst last 5-day carnage of the broader markets.

Moreover, for last 64 weeks this counter is moving in a well-defined ascending channel with multiple touch points.

Hence, sustaining above Rs 435 levels it can head to test its upper boundary of the said channel whose value is placed around Rs 497 levels. For time being one can buy the slight dip with a stop-loss below Rs 435 and look for a target of Rs 495.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after December quarter earnings:

Goldman Sachs

The foreign research firm has kept a buy call on the stock with a target at Rs 927.

""There was a miss on core operating profit, slightly offset by lower provisions. However, the lender is well positioned to benefit from the ongoing industry consolidation,"" Sachs said.

CLSA

CLSA has kept a buy rating on the stock with a target at Rs 1,080 per share as the results were strong across the board with 6.9% on-quarter loan growth and 17% on-year rise in net interest income.

The core PPoP (pre-provision operating profit) was up 8.4% on year in line with estimates due to a further spike in opex.

The improving liability and asset momentum is a positive, while valuation is undemanding for clear RoE (return on equity) visibility of 15-16%.

The bank is amongst the top picks and a part of the India focus portfolio.

Credit Suisse

The broking house has kept an outperform call with a target price at Rs 960 as growth and asset quality beat estimates even as opex dragged operating profits.

The broking house continues to expect 15% ROE in FY23/24.

Nomura

The broking firm has kept a buy call with a target at Rs 980 as NIM (net interest margin) and asset quality improved.

The liability franchise continues to scale up, Nomura said.

Motilal Oswal

Axis Bank delivered a strong operating performance, led by robust loan growth, higher margin, and controlled provisions. Asset quality improved sharply, aided by controlled slippages and higher recoveries and upgrades.

Restructured loans were in control, while a higher provisioning buffer provided comfort.

""We expect slippages to remain in control, enabling a sustained improvement in credit costs,"" Motilal said.

""We estimate Axis Bank to deliver FY24E RoA/RoE (return on asset) of 1.6%/16% in FY24E. We maintain our buy rating with a target price of Rs 975/share (2x Sep’23E ABV+ INR134 from its subsidiaries).""

Sharekhan

""We believe its valuations are reasonable and there is potential for re-rating as we expect strong growth. With strong performance on all parameters – loan book, operating performance, and improvement in asset quality -- the bank is poised for robust growth going ahead,"" Sharekhan said.

""We expect its credit cost to normalise and deliver RoA of 1.5% in FY2023E. Hence, we maintain our buy rating with an unchanged price target of Rs 940.""

At 09:19 hrs Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 710.35, up Rs 6 or 0.85 percent on the BSE.

Private lender Axis Bank is inching closer to the takeover of Citibank's India consumer business, with the acquisition deal likely to be finalised this month, news agency Reuters reported on January 17, citing two sources familiar with the development.

Citi's India consumer business is being valued at $1.5 billion in the planned deal, Reuters learnt from the sources. Kotak Mahindra Bank, another private lender which is also in the acquisition race, has submitted a bid lower than Axis Bank's, they reportedly added.

While both the lenders did not react to the Reuters report so far, Citi India told the news agency that it is moving ahead with its plan to offload the consumer retail business in the country.

“We continue to move forward with our process with respect to our India consumer business sale in accordance with our broader strategic refresh,” Citi India was quoted as saying.

Last month, CNBC TV 18 had learnt from sources that Axis Bank is likely to strike an all-cash deal for Citi's India retail assets, which could be worth $1.5 billion with up to $300-400 million milestone payments which depends on performance in the future.

Citi's India retail business involves over 2.5 million customers and more than 1.2 million bank accounts.

On December 7, a report in The Economic Times claimed that Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank have emerged as the top contenders to clinch the deal. The report, citing a source, had said Kotak was more ""aggressive"" between the two bidders.

Notably, Citibank runs a profitable franchise in India and had a loan book of Rs 68,800 crores as on March, 2021, of which Rs 28,000 crore was retail loans. These mainly included cards, mortgages and personal mortgages, said a report released by investment group CLSA on September 8.

Citibank is the sixth largest card issuer with market share of 4.2 per cent in cards issued, the report added. As per CLSA's estimates, Citibank could have a credit card book of approximately Rs 9,000 crore.

On April 16 last year, Citi said it will exit consumer/retail operations in 13 countries across Asia and Europe. The 13 nations include Australia, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

Citi’s consumer business in India comprises credit cards, retail banking, home loans and wealth management. The bank has 35 branches in the country and employs 4,000 people in the consumer banking business. It had a 0.6 percent market share in advances and 1.1 percent in deposits, along with 2.58 million credit cards outstanding, as of October 2021.",430,0.7333053052425385

India's Axis Bank has started offering structured derivative products to leading companies including Reliance Industries after a ban on these deals was lifted by the Reserve Bank of India effective Monday.

Axis Bank, India's third-largest private sector bank said the first of these transactions was executed with Reliance Industries which involved the use of Barrier FX options for their currency risk management, it said in a statement.

The bank also concluded another transaction with Supreme Petrochem Ltd.

Hundreds of Indian corporates who had entered into such tailor-made, OTC contracts with banks prior to 2008, cried foul when their bets went sour.

After the derivative losses — where banks also took a hit due to customers not honouring deals - the central bank banned exotic products, allowing only plain-vanilla currency options before lifting the bank with stricter guidelines last year.

""We expect the usage of these products to grow over time as the market matures and clients get more accustomed,"" said Neeraj Gambhir, Group Executive and Head – Treasury at Axis Bank.

""What has changed is the focus on risk management and customer education. Customers need to fully understand the risk reward of the transactions they are entering into. It may see a tapered pick up and growth, but the market should develop,"" he told Reuters.

Gambhir said the structured deals offered in India are still basic compared with those in global markets and there would need to be more customer education before smaller corporates get on board.

Axis Bank plans to focus on larger companies for the time being but is keen to be a frontrunner in structured derivatives and has put in place the necessary staff and infrastructure, he added.",296,0.3325481017430623

The benchmark equity indices on December 22 saw a gap-up opening tracking global peers and closed slightly above 1 percent thereby filling the gap created between 16,840 and 16,970.

The bounce got extended for the second consecutive trading session and the structure of the index appears to be in a consolidation range from 16,850 - 17,200. The lower high and lower low formation will be neglected only above 17,600 till then this can be considered as a relief rally.

Prices are trading below 21-week EMA (exponential moving average) which is placed at 17,134 acting as immediate resistance and above 50-Weekly EMA which is at 16,000.

On the daily Charts, momentum oscillator RSI (14) is still showing a reading below 50 and similarly ADX (Average Directional Index) which shows the strength of the trend has moved to 26 and rising with negative DMI (Directional Movement Index) moving up.

Nifty has reached a good hurdle zone of 16,950. If it manages to sustain above it, then some short-covering can't be ruled out and 17,140 will be the next level for the index. The immediate support is coming near 16,850.

Here is one buy call and one sell call for next 2-3 weeks:

Mindtree: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,533.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,240 | Target: Rs 4,940 | Return: 8.97 percent

The Mindtree has witnessed major support around the Rs 4,250 levels. It has created a 'Harami' candlestick pattern. Relative strength index (14,9) is currently reading around 50 and sustaining above the moving average. It has created a higher bottom near 38 levels.

On a relative basis, it is consistently outperforming the major indices. On the higher side, retesting of Rs 5,060 is possible. But on the move, there will be small resistance around Rs 4,930 levels.

Axis Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 669.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 695 | Target: Rs 587 | Return: 12.25 percent

Axis Bank is consistently creating bearish lower low lower high chart formation. It is consistently below major EMA (200, 50 &20). In the chart, one can easily observe that it has taken resistance around 200 EMA and again sold off.

Relative strength index (14,9) is currently reading 50 and below the moving average. At the same time stochastic too, it is sustaining below the moving average. Both indicating towards further weakness in the stock.

Price extension from the top of October 25 is generating the target of Rs 586.

The market bounced back sharply on December 7 after a steep correction in the previous two sessions amid the easing of Omicron fears and ahead of the RBI monetary policy decision.

The Sensex rallied nearly 887 points to close at 57,634, and the Nifty surged 264 points to end at 17,177, getting support from every sector.

Nifty bank, financial services and realty indices gained more than 2 percent each ahead of December 8 interest rate decision of the Monetary Policy Committee. Metal was the biggest gainer among sectors, rising 3 percent. IT, FMCG and auto gained 1-1.6 percent.

The broader markets also participated in the run, with the Nifty midcap 100 and smallcap 100 indices climbing over a percent each.

Stocks that were in focus included Axis Bank, which was the third biggest gainer in the Nifty50, rising 3.6 percent to close at Rs 687. National Aluminium Company (NALCO) was the top gainer in the futures & options segment, closing 7.10 percent higher to Rs 96.6.

Torrent Pharmaceuticals was also in action, registering 4.69 percent gains at Rs 3,074.60. Ramky Infrastructure gained momentum after several months of consolidation, freezing at 20 percent gains to close at Rs 210.05.

Here's what Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Axis Bank

The tradable bottom seems to be in place in this counter as it registered a higher top and higher bottom kind of bullish sequence.

This stock, however, is trading way below its 200-day exponential moving average whose value is placed around Rs 722.

Hence, sustaining above 670 levels should be the test of the 200-day moving average. Therefore, traders can hold on to their long positions and can also initiate fresh longs placing a stop below Rs 669 and look for a target placed around Rs 720.

NALCO

This counter appears to have made a decent base in the last couple of trading sessions and seems to have embarked on a decent pullback rally on huge volumes. If it sustains above Rs 92, it can initially head to test its interim top of Rs 104.

On a decisive close above that, a higher target of Rs 118 can't be ruled out. Therefore, positional traders should buy into this counter with a stop loss below Rs 92 and look for an initial target of Rs 104.

Torrent Pharmaceuticals

Despite this counter witnessing a sharp spike on the back of relatively higher volumes, the larger trend seems to be sideways. For a sustainable upswing, the stock needs a fresh breakout on a close above Rs 3,250.

However, traders who already own this counter can hold for a target of Rs 3,240, whereas fresh buying should be considered only on a dip into the zone of Rs 3,000–Rs 2,950 with the stop loss below Rs 2,930.

Ramky Infrastructure

After a prolonged underperformance —since its lifetime high of Rs 471 in the year 2010—this counter seems to have embarked on a medium-term uptrend. However, it needs to sustain above Rs 210, which seems to be a critical hurdle on long-term charts.

Moreover, this counter may remain vulnerable to profit-booking as it swiftly moved from the lows of Rs 146 in the last four trading sessions. If it consistently trades above Rs 210, eventually a higher target of Rs 270 can be expected.

For the time, fresh buying should be considered only on a dip between Rs 190 and 180 levels by placing a stop below Rs 175 on a closing basis.

Cryptocurrencies provide India an opportunity to turn into a net exporter from a net importer of technology, according to Ashish Singhal, Founder and CEO of crypto exchange CoinSwitch Kuber.

Speaking at Mumbai Micro Experience of FinTech Festival India 2021-22, Singhal said, “We cannot be the late movers in accepting crypto. We already missed the first bus of Internet 1.0. Today 70 percent of our revenues go to US-based tech giants. We are a net importer of technology. We import over $10 billion of this technology every year and it is expected to grow to $45-30 billion over the next 3-4 years.”

Early participation in cryptocurrencies could give India the chance to become a net exporter of crypto and blockchain technology, Singhal added.

Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, Member of the Governing Council of RBI Innovation Hub and Board of Supervision of NABARD and Member of Insurance Advisory Council of India, voiced concerns that RBI has around cryptocurrencies.

“RBI’s apprehension regarding cryptocurrency is emanating because the three critical things, entry barriers, supervisory framework, and cross border aspect are not getting translated into the crypto world,"" Mahapatra said.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has repeatedly said that the regulator has concerns around cryptocurrencies and the same has been conveyed to the Centre. Das had recently said that there was a need for deeper discussions on cryptos.

According to Mahapatra, “Systemic risk and the psychological risk of denting the political stability and social stability because of economic instability even if it is the minutest are creating concerns in the minds of the policymakers.”

Acceptance and regulation of cryptocurrencies can have a cascading effect on various facets of the economy, including banks as the meaning of investing is changing rapidly.

Speaking from a banker’s perspective, Saugata Bhattacharya - Executive Vice-President & Chief Economist at Axis Bank, said, “If an environment of cryptocurrencies including global central bank digital currencies begin to evolve then there are multiple implications for banks, some good and some bad. They need to be aware and need to design their systems in place for this technological shift.”

The past few days saw chaos in the crypto world after the Centre released a list of bills to be tabled in the Winter Session of the Parliament that is set to begin on November 29. The crypto bill, named ‘Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021’ is part of the list.

Industry experts and lawyers expect that cryptocurrencies will be regulated and there will be no blanket ban. The regulations are expected to ensure better monitoring of crypto transactions and guidelines around penalties for fraudulent activities might be framed. However, clarity is awaited on how crypto assets and related services will be taxed.",450,0.003517220417658488

Emkay Global Financial's report on AXIS Bank

Despite slower growth, lower NIMs and higher opex weighing on PPoP (down 11% yoy), Axis reported a PAT beat at Rs31.3bn (est: Rs27.5bn) mainly due to contained provisions. Growth disappointed again, but asset quality trends were better vs. peers. GNPA ratio was down 32bps qoq at 3.5%, while restructured pool stood at 0.64% (+31bps qoq) of loans. Credit growth remains an irritant (+10% yoy), lagging peers like ICICI (17%)/HDFCB/KMB (15%). However, Axis expects to improve the growth trajectory with the help of retail/SME businesses and a gradual pickup in large corporates. NIM too remains an irritant, but Axis pins hope on better growth/change in the product mix and declining PSL drag. We believe the bank has undergone a major transformational journey in the past few years, fortifying the balance sheet, building strong capital/provision buffers and revving up the digital banking platform and even the subsidiaries.

Outlook

However, it will have to deliver on growth/core-profitability to re-rate from hereon. Factoring in slower-than-expected growth/NIMs, we trim our earnings estimates for FY22-24 by 1-3%. However, we still expect the bank's RoA/RoE to improve from a low of 0.7%/7% to 1.7% %/17% in FY24E. Retain Buy with a revised TP of Rs1020 (Rs960 earlier), valuing the core bank at 2x Dec'23E ABV and subs/investment at Rs75.

The market seems to have witnessed profit-booking after a day of rebound, and fell a third of a percent on October 27, dragged by private banks, metals and auto stocks. However, IT, pharma, PSU bank and FMCG stocks offered support.

The Nifty50 shed 57 points to close at 18,211 mark, and The BSE Sensex was down 207 points at 61,143.33, while the broader markets outpaced frontliners as the Nifty Midcap 100 index rose 0.08 percent and Smallcap 100 index gained 0.27 percent.

Stocks that were in focus include Asian Paints, which rallied 4.2 percent to close at Rs 3,094.65 and was the biggest gainer in the BSE Sensex after a price hike of products. Godrej Consumer Products continued its run for the second consecutive session, rising 4.76 percent to Rs 1,009.90, which was the second biggest gainer in the F&O segment.

Private sector lender Axis Bank was the biggest loser in the BSE Sensex and F&O segment, falling 6.46 percent to close at Rs 787.50 after the September quarter earnings.

Here's what Gaurav Sharma of Globe Capital Markets, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Asian Paints

The stock is bouncing back after testing its 200 EMA (exponential moving average) placed around Rs 2,856 levels. This is a positive sign as that moving average will limit its downside movement.

Overall, the stock is in a strong uptrend and is now available after some profit-taking from higher levels. This provides good opportunity for investors to accumulate the stock.

The ongoing festive season is also a positive and will impact its next quarterly numbers. Hence, we advocate taking long positions for an immediate target of Rs 3,400, while Rs 3,700-plus is also a reasonable target for the medium to long term.

Godrej Consumer Products

This stock has underperformed the benchmark in the recent past, which is not an exception as the majority of FMCG stocks saw profit-taking in the past couple of weeks, especially after Hindustan Uniliver's numbers. Technically, this profit-taking should be considered a healthy sign as it gives traders an opportunity to take fresh long positions.

We see the stock heading towards Rs 1,060-1,120 levels in the immediate near term. Sustenance above that mark will open the gates for a further up move till Rs 1,200 and beyond. Traders are advised to keep a stop loss below Rs 900.

Axis Bank

On October 27, the stock witnessed steep selloff, which was a reaction after the quarterly numbers were announced. Prior to this, it was in a strong up trend, poised to scale higher. We still see the bullish trend intact till Rs 720 is held on the downside.

Hence, medium to long term traders are advised to utilise the ongoing profit-taking to accumulate the stock for targets close to Rs 1,000.

Private sector lender Axis Bank on October 26 reported a healthy 86.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone profit at Rs 3,133.32 crore for the quarter ended September 2021 (Q2FY22) owing to a significant fall in provisions.

""The bank carried a provision of around 24 percent on restructured loans, which is in excess of regulatory limits.""

After being in beta mode since June, fintech veteran Jitendra Gupta’s new neobank venture Jupiter said on October 25 that it is now opening up its platform to more users. However, new users will be taken on board on an invite-only basis.

Founded in 2019, Jupiter is a digital banking platform that allows users to open a bank account digitally, provides Visa debit cards and insights on spends by customers. The startup does not have a banking licence itself and operates in partnership with Federal Bank and Axis Bank.

Existing users can invite their acquaintances, others can request the existing community for access or try getting one of the limited invites on the app. The startup’s focus is salaried individuals in the age group of 18 to 35 years.

The platform aims to have one million users and add lending and deposit products in the next six months. Currently, 200,000 people have opened accounts and another 3,000 users are opening savings accounts every day on the app that saw over 1 billion deposit transactions in the last 30 days, the startup said.

“We are like a bank, so the basic expectation of a consumer from a bank is that we should have a deposit product and a lending product. These two are our immediate priorities and we will keep adding features on both these products,” said Gupta in an interaction with Moneycontrol.

The startup, which possesses a non-banking financial company (NBFC) licence, plans to lend only to customers who are bank account holders through the platform. While the product is still months away from being launched, the credit requirements of these customers are expected to be in the range of Rs 10,000 to as high as Rs 3 lakh.

Jupiter plans to do the risk assessment and underwriting for these loans with its in-house team as well as using credit bureau scores. The company also has its Bullet product which allows customers to make all UPI-based payments in one go with a 15-day billing cycle.

Neobanks are a growing tribe with players like Open, RazorpayX, EpiFi, and Niyo competing with Jupiter. However, Gupta does not see this as a challenge.

“There are over 50 mainstream banks in India and all of those are doing very well on the retail side. If they all can do well, I am sure 10 neobanks can do well, too. So the market opportunity is very big,” Gupta said.

Jupiter is Gupta’s second startup after CitrusPay, which he sold to Naspers-owned PayU in 2016 in a $130-million deal and was recorded as one of the largest exits in the Indian fintech services ecosystem at the time.

In its last Series B funding round, Jupiter had raised $44 million led by Brazil’s Nubank Global Founders Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Matrix Partners India. The round was supplemented with a $10 million raise from US-based QED Investors.

The funding was done in a year that saw a boom in investments in the Indian startup space at every stage, leading to ballooning valuations. With a total of over $70 million raised until now, Gupta said the startup is adequately funded for the next two to three years.

“The market is crazy right now. There are all kinds of investors available in the world who want to figure out where to deploy their money. Raising money in this market is not a challenge, but we still have more than half of our first-round funding in the bank,” he explained.

Gupta had raised $25 million in a Series A round from investors like Sequoia, Matrix Partners, 3one4 Capital, former Tiger Global head honcho Lee Fixel and others while Jupiter was still in stealth mode.",617,0.15941882133483887

Private sector lender Axis Bank on October 26 is likely to show significant growth in profitability for the September 2021 quarter with an expected fall in provisions and improvement in asset quality.

Net interest income and loan growth could be in double digits but slippages are key to watch out for.

The stock reacted strong after healthy earnings performance by peer ICICI Bank, rising 3.5 percent on October 25. It gained 21.2 percent this financial year so far and 13 percent since July. Now the earnings will decide whether the stock can extend the rally or not.

""We expect the loan growth at 10 percent YoY with greater focus on retail. Net interest margin unchanged QoQ at 3.7 percent (aided by lower interest de-recognition). Operating profit growth at 5 percent YoY would be primarily due to lower treasury income and normalisation of operating expenses,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities, which sees 96 percent YoY increase in profit and 10.5 percent growth in net interest income for the September quarter.

ICICI Direct, too, expects NII to grow 10 percent and loan growth to come in at 11 percent YoY, led by a traction in retail segment. ""Within the retail book, growth should be driven by home loans. Deposits growth is expected at 17 percent YoY with sequential 30 bps rise in CASA ratio.""

The brokerage said credit cost should decline as a result of better show on the asset quality front while the bank is estimated to post a profit growth of 78 percent YoY.

Kotak expects slippages of around Rs 4,000 crore (around 2.5 percent of loans) mostly led by retail and low slippage from the corporate portfolio. ""We expect non-performing loan ratios to decline aided by stronger recovery/upgrade.""

The life insurance industry saw strong growth in August, especially by private life insurers. Increased awareness around protection, importance of insurance and under-penetration, and the growth momentum for the life insurance industry is expected to continue.

To understand how the industry is performing and how Max Life Insurance is placed, Prashant Tripathy, MD & CEO of Max Life Insurance, in a exclusive conversation with Moneycontrol, talks about the industry dynamics, the deal with Axis Bank and the outcomes expected. He also touched upon the company's product and distribution mix, COVID impact on pricing and the roadmap ahead for Max Life Insurance. Edited Excerpts:

How’s the industry outlook, considering we are halfway of FY22? How was H1 and how do you see H2?

The industry is doing well and H1 numbers will come out in a few days. In Q1, the private life insurance industry grew at more than 20 percent, and Max Life grew around 34 percent.

The need for life insurance has been well understood one more time through the pandemic period. The momentum continued in July and August also. Even in September, we might see an expeditious growth.

The industry is in a healthy shape and most players are recording impressive growth. Overall, the industry is in full momentum. Of course, there’s a base effect due to the lockdown in the first half of FY21. I wouldn’t be surprised if growth in H2 remains pretty robust. It may be a bit lower now, but we are still expecting a robust growth rate in the second half of FY22.

As the awareness around importance of protection has gone up, how is your product mix looking like?

We have always believed in a balanced product mix. We don’t put all eggs in one basket. We have maintained that trajectory. There’s equal focus on all categories. We have always believed in selling traditional plans.

In the last one quarter, our overall traditional plans, including par and non-par and protection products, would be 65 percent and the remaining 35 percent has been ULIPs.

Within traditional, the categories which are doing well are the non-participating savings plans. During times of uncertainty, people tend to gravitate towards certain outcomes and that’s doing well.

Protection policies are not as strong as last year, predominantly because of COVID, as underwriting norms are still restricted. We are still doing reasonably good business.

As the dust settles on COVID and related fears, protection is going to be a bet for the long term and going to be a strategic area for us.

This year, we have also started to bet on driving retirement annuity sales and we are seeing very robust growth. Overall, the product mix is balanced.

In the second half, we have a slew of new products planned in areas of par, non-par, ULIP, etc. In the first half of FY22, we focused on protection, annuity and riders. By the year-end, we will have new products across all areas.

How’s the outlook on the Axis Bank deal?

Our relationship with Axis Bank is more than 11 years. This year is special as, apart from being the largest distribution partner, they have also become our shareholder. Max Life is now a joint venture between Max Financial and Axis Bank.

It’s a milestone event. It has given enough strength to Max Life Insurance. Having an association and parenthood with a large financial institution is a matter of strength. With their know-how and vast reach, Max Life will be on a journey of multi-year expeditious growth.

The hunger to expand at Max Life has multiplied manifold and we are very open to new relationships. It could be in the areas of organic and inorganic, we would be looking out for areas for growth.

When we talk about organic, we will focus on all elements like banks, small finance banks, fintechs and ecosystem-based growth.

The opportunities of synergies with Axis Bank are humongous. There is a sea change in the relationship. Earlier, it was a distribution relationship, now they have participation in our board. We have frequent meetings with them, and we will work through product designs and marketing efforts, making sure the size is leveraged. The list is endless when two large organisations come together.

Any specific area you would want to strengthen by means of inorganic growth opportunities?

Our bias is to have or acquire complementary skills. It could be in the area of bringing in distribution through banks or a strong agency. It will be in the area of bringing in new skills or geographical presence.

We have our minds open. We are very open to reviewing. At the same time, there will be a bias to look at complementary skills and not just go ahead and acquire.

How is your distribution mix and road ahead to strengthen it?

In the last one year, the contribution of bancassurance went up, predominantly because they were better placed.

On an ongoing basis, little over two-thirds is from banks, and close to one-third is our own distribution. Within our own, a large part comes from agencies, but we have also experimented and proved certain models through our own sales force.

We have registered strong growth in our protection business through digital sales, across counters like aggregators, our own channels etc. We are the number one sellers of protection through digital e-commerce.

While our overall market share is a little over 10 percent, our market share in the digital space is close to 30 percent. Every one out of three customers, when they buy protection products through digital means or directly through e-commerce, that comes from Max Life Insurance.

In the long term, the focus will be on our channels. One of the big task in the next five years is to grow our own channels considerably, and internet or e-commerce channels.

Any new areas you would want to touch upon?

We are going to focus on two segments. One will be in the area of protection – health and wellbeing. Here, we are looking at the entire ecosystem over and above term plans. We came up with riders and wearables, where the new premium could get a discount based on the health consciousness of people.

The other strategic segment is retirement. The retirement market is going to be very, very large, and the way it is currently set up, there will be new opportunities, not in terms of accumulation but in the overall retirement space. We were recently allotted the NPS fund management licence by PFRDA, and we are slowly going to build the retirement business as we move along.

What sort of remodelling and reassessment have you all gone through? Impact on pricing?

It is a question of balancing three things – customer needs, pricing and margins. It needs to be balanced with mortality experience. The good part is that Max Life has done a good job in maintaining these vectors and we will be competitive.

COVID did spike up claims. The good part is that the trend is settling down every passing month, with July being the peak month, and it tapered down in August and September.

I hope that, by year end, it will stabilise, if there’s no third wave. Hence, I’m very optimistic, collectively with our reinsurance partner, we will be able to come up with pricing solutions which take into account both short-term as well as long-term mortality.

The pricing trends are generally upwards. This is how it is expected to be. In a few months, we will know how high it will be. Protection prices in India are still one of the cheapest in the world.

Keeping all three things in mind, customer, price sensitivity and margins, we will take a call which will balance all the three.

Any upper band?

We are competitively priced. We will have some discussions with our reinsurers in the absence of how those rates are moving. It’s hard to say but I’m not anticipating a huge increase. It may be a marginal increase.

How is Max Life approaching digitisation?

We are approaching digitisation in a comprehensive manner, looking at vertical as well as horizontals. The elements of prospecting, onboarding and customer service are going through transformational changes.

Across all channels, 100 percent policies come to us digitally. It gets underwritten through AI/ML-based solutions, which immediately make the decision and that process has been 100 percent digitised.

We have about 85 percent of customer queries coming to us through digital means and getting responded digitally. All the recruitment, and we are a big recruiter of agent-advisors, happens digitally.

The effort is to be a comprehensive digital organisation. We have now two rounds of accelerator programmes, where we ask fintech companies to solve some of our problems, which could be related to onboarding, underwriting, analytics, customer service, etc. This helps our team also to learn and continuously evolve.

Digital is a big play for us, whether in Axis Bank or our own agency. Currently, we are on a multi-year programme to completely digitise our operations and sales.

Growth estimate for FY22?

The target will be to repeat last year’s performance or do better. It is hard to pinpoint a number at this point of time. The first half is lighter than second half. A big part of sales is yet to unfold.

At this point, I’m looking at growth rates, which is upwards of 20 percent. We will definitely target a number, which is upwards of 20 percent.

The fund size of Max Life has moved from Rs 4,700 crore to Rs 100,000 crore now. We recently crossed this milestone. It has been growing at 30 percent CAGR in the last one decade. That’s a reflection of business growth, and a big driver of that has been healthy persistency.

With the Axis Bank partnership taking a new dimension, the business is poised to take the next leap and we are working to create a platform and framework for that growth.",1668,0.7546527197486476

The country's third largest private sector lender Axis Bank has committed Rs 30,000 crore lending till fiscal year 2025-26 under its sustainable financing framework, a senior official said.

These commitments are in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), supporting India’s commitments under the Paris Agreement.

""As part of its commitments, the bank has set a target of incremental lending of Rs 30,000 crore over the next 5 years, under wholesale banking towards pertinent sectors included in its Sustainable Financing Framework (SFF),"" Rajesh Dahiya, Executive Director (Corporate Centre), Axis Bank told PTI.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) is a measure which investors use as a tool to assess how good the practices of a company are. For the last 3-4 years, the words sustainability and ESG have made people sensitive about the whole idea of a sustainable planet, Dahiya said.

""These are the metrics which have been spoken about for about 3-4 years now. However, with COVID and all its problems, it highlighted the issue of sustainability in a very big and magnified manner.""

""In the next five years, we want to lend Rs 30,000 crore more incrementally as wholesale banking towards pertinent sectors including Axis Bank's SFF. We want to increase our portfolio of green lending,"" Dahiya said.

He said the bank's existing wholesale banking portfolio towards SFF, including green and social sectors, is little over Rs 29,000 crore and it intends to lend to companies where there are green practices.

After five years till 2025-26, the bank will assess these lendings to see positive social and environmental outcomes and increase it further, he added.

Going forward, the lender will also scale down its exposure to carbon-intensive sectors in its wholesale banking business portfolio.

The lender said it is expanding its ESG risk coverage in credit appraisal under its ESG policy for lending.

Axis Bank is building and deploying an ESG risk assessment toolkit, with ESG stress testing and ESG scenario analysis, for its large corporate, SME and agri-business verticals by 2022-23.

The lender will incentivise the borrowers for adopting good practices by offering 0.5 per cent interest waiver on new electric vehicle loans, effective immediately.

""We will make 5 per cent of our retail two-wheeler loan portfolio as electric by 2023-24 ,"" he said.

Besides, the bank has set the target of incremental disbursement of Rs 10,000 crore by 2023-24 under Asha Home Loans for affordable housing, and increasing share of women borrowers.

Also, the bank will aim to reach 30 per cent female representation in its workforce by 2026-27, aligned to its #ComeAsYouAre Diversity Charter.

Among others, it will plant 2 million (20 lakh) trees by 2026-27 across India towards contributing to creating a carbon sink.

Dahiya said Axis Bank is probably the first among corporates to constitute an ESG Steering Committee comprising heads of key departments who shall act as ESG champions within and outside the bank.

""Since the day COVID hit, our board got us together and decided...we want to create a practice which is differentiated and which is measurable,"" he added.

The bank has announced its commitments ahead of the upcoming 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) at Glasgow, UK from October 31 - November 12.

Sharekhan's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank eyes calibrated retail-led growth driven by low-cost deposits and a strong capital base. Conservative provisioning, strong capital base, overall franchise value and a high provision coverage ratio (PCR) are positives, which will help the bank ride over medium-term challenges and support growth and valuations. Q1FY22 earnings increased 94% y-o-y but fell 19% q-o-q. Margins declined 10 bps q-o-q to 3.46%; GNPA rose by 15 bps q-o-q to 3.85% as of Q1FY22.



Outlook

We maintain a Buy on Axis Bank with a revised PT of Rs. 940, given its strong focus on retail loans, robust capital base and provision buffer.

Among the lenders that have recently raised funds through AT1 Bond issues are State Bank of India (SBI), Axis Bank and HDFC Bank. The coupon rate on these bonds differs as per market conditions. Why do banks use these instruments? What are the benefits and risks for investors? Here is a primer:

What are AT1 bonds?

AT1 bonds, as these instruments are popularly known, are a type of perpetual debt instrument that banks use to augment their core equity base and thus comply with Basel III norms. These bonds were introduced by the Basel accord after the global financial crisis to protect depositors.

How are these bonds different from other debt instruments?

These bonds are perpetual in nature — they do not carry any maturity date. They offer higher returns to investors but compared with other vanilla debt products, these instruments carry a higher risk as well. If the capital ratios of the issuer fall below a certain percentage or in the event of an institutional failure, the rules allow the issuer to stop paying interest or even write down these bonds, as happened in the Yes Bank case. These bonds are subordinate to all other debt and senior only to equity.

What can investors do with AT1 bonds?

As mentioned above, AT1 bonds do not have a maturity date. Banks have a call option that permits them to redeem these bonds after a certain period.

Are they safe for investors?

Since these bonds can be written down by banks under the directions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the event of an institutional failure, they are seen as high-risk instruments. If the bank reaches the point of non-viability, AT1 bonds are the first part of debt that will be written down. AT1 bonds worth Rs 8,414 crore were written off fully during the Yes Bank reconstruction scheme in March 2020. Those AT1 investors are still locked in a court battle with the RBI and the bank seeking the return of their investments. In this backdrop, it is fair to say that AT1 bonds are high-risk instruments for investors, especially retail investors.

Why do the banks tap the AT1 bond route?

Banks periodically raise money issuing such bonds. At one point, lenders used to even pitch these to retail investors as an attractive option, often with returns higher than a traditional fixed deposit would offer. Indeed, there used to be significant retail interest in AT1 bonds till the Yes Bank episode.

The market for AT1 bonds took a hit after the Yes Bank write-off, as part of the State Bank of India-led bailout in March 2020. Investors have begun to look at these instruments with caution since then.

Which banks have taken the AT1 Bond route to raise funds recently?

State Bank of India (SBI) and Axis Bank are the lenders to have most recently raised money through AT1 bonds. Axis Bank recently raised $600 million through an AT1 Bond issue, while State Bank of India announced on September 1 that it had raised Rs 4,000 crore of the Basel-compliant bonds. The country’s largest lender raised the amount at a coupon rate of 7.72 percent. In August, HDFC Bank, too, raised $1 billion by selling AT1 bonds to overseas investors.",567,-0.9979617595672607

A debt-ridden branch manager of Axis bank has been sacked after he tried to loot an ICICI bank branch, stabbing the deputy branch head to death. The Axis bank manager attempted to flee but was caught by the locals, police informed on July 30.

""The prime accused Anil Dubey -- the Naigaon Axis Bank Branch Manager, who is a former employee and ex-manager of the ICICI Bank, has been arrested. There is no other person involved as of now,"" Virar Police Station Senior Police Inspector Suresh Warade told IANS.

The incident took place around the evening of July 29, after ICICI Bank's Virar East Branch, Mumbai was closed. Most staffers had left for the day, barring two women employees- Deputy Manager Yogita Nishant Choudhary and her cashier colleague Shraddha Devrukhkar.

Dubey drove down from Naigaon to the ICICI Bank Virar East branch, stepped inside, whipped out a sharp weapon and threatened Choudhary and Devrukhkar, reported IANS.

He ordered them to hand over all the cash and jewellery which he then dumped into a bag and attempted to flee the scene of crime. However both the women started screaming for help and attempted to pin down Dubey who retaliated by attacking them both with the knife several times before breaking free to run out.

By then, a few people from neighbouring shops had gathered who managed to grab hold of Dubey, took the booty-filled bag and kept it in the ATM cabin and summoned the police.

The knife had wounded both the women badly. Devrukhkar, 32, who was hit in the neck and shoulder, is undergoing treatment at a local hospital, informed Inspector Warade. Unfortunately, the other colleague suffered gashes in the throat, shoulder and other parts of her body and succumbed to her injuries eventually.

According to Warade, the accused Dubey had ostensibly run up huge debts of over Rs 1 crore and may have resorted to the shocking heist to clear off his dues, reported IANS.

Axis Bank has taken the matter very seriously and along with sacking Dubey has launched an internal probe into the matter.

""As a responsible institution, Axis Bank has zero-tolerance towards unscrupulous elements and is committed to fully cooperate with the relevant authorities in resolving this issue. We have taken strict disciplinary action immediately,"" an official spokesperson told IANS.

ICICI Bank declined to comment on the issue.

The penalty is violation of certain provisions issued by RBI on ‘Strengthening the Controls of Payment Ecosystem between Sponsor Banks and SCBs/UCBs as a Corporate Customer’ dated May 9, 2019, ‘Cyber Security Framework in Banks’ dated June 2, 2016, ‘Reserve Bank of India (Financial Services provided by Banks) Directions, 2016’ dated May 26, 2016 (Updated as on September 25, 2017), ‘Financial Inclusion- Access to Banking Services – Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account’ dated August 10, 2012 and ‘Frauds – Classification and Reporting’ dated July 02, 2012, the RBI said.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank reported a slight miss on PAT at Rs21.6bn (vs. est. Rs22.9bn) in Q1FY22 due to subdued margins and higher opex/provisions. Higher-than-expected gross slippages (84% retail) led to a 15bps rise in GNPA to 3.85%. However, the bank did not utilize the Covid-related buffer in Q1, which remains steady and healthy at 0.8% of loans. Credit growth was moderate at 12% yoy/-1% qoq, lagging large peers (14-17%). However, the bank expects a better growth trajectory as the economy opens up, led by retail and SME businesses. As per Axis, the changing portfolio mix toward high-margin retail and the reduction in RIDF should boost margins. Axis has significantly revamped its subsidiaries (mainly Axis Cap/Axis Sec/Axis Fin) in past 3 years and made strategic investments in insurance (Maxlife) and fintech (Freecharge) as part of its 'One Axis' strategy to become a financial super-store. We believe there is huge scope to scale up subsidiaries in line with peers and drive up value for shareholders.

Outlook

The bank has undergone a major transformational journey, fortified the balance sheet and revved up the digital banking platform. We believe it is now ready to accelerate growth and deliver better return ratios (RoA/RoE at 1.5-1.6%/15-16% in FY23-24E). Retain Buy with a TP of Rs960 (valuing core bank at 2x Sep'23E ABV and subs/investment at Rs75).

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB reported an in line 1QFY22, with a PAT of INR21.6b and core PPOP growth of 13% YoY. Business growth remains flattish, while margin moderated by 10bp QoQ due to interest reversals, excess liquidity, and change in its product mix. Fresh slippages stood elevated at INR65.2b (INR52.8b in 4QFY21), led by the Retail segment (84% of total). As a result, asset quality ratios deteriorated by ~15bp QoQ. Restructuring stood at 0.33% of loans (additional 11bp of restructuring, which is approved, but not implemented). While slippages could remain elevated in the near term, healthy PCR of ~70%, coupled with additional provision buffer of 2% (including standard provisions) is likely to protect the Balance Sheet against any potential stress. We estimate AXSB to deliver a RoA/RoE of 1.6%/15.2% in FY23E.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating. We maintain our Buy rating with an unchanged TP of INR925/share (2x FY23E ABV).

Axis Bank, country's third largest private sector lender, posted a standalone profit of Rs 2,160.15 crore for the quarter ended June 2021 (Q1FY22), thereby rising 94.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) due to low base.

The standalone profit in Q1FY21 at Rs 1,112.17 crore was impacted by the higher provisions due to nationwide lockdown to control COVID spread.

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew by 11.1 percent to Rs 7,760.27 crore in Q1FY22, from Rs 6,985.31 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.

""The balance sheet grew 14 percent YoY and stood at Rs 10,12,050 crore as on June 2021. The total deposits grew by 16 percent on period end basis and by 11 percent YoY on quarterly average balance (QAB) basis,"" said Axis Bank, adding advances grew 12 percent YoY to Rs 6,14,874 crore as on June 2021.

The bank further said retail loans grew 14 percent YoY and were largely flat on a sequential basis to Rs 3,31,242 crore and accounted for 54 percent of the net advances. The share of secured loans was around 80 percent, with home loans comprising 37 percent of the retail book, it added.

Provisions and contingencies remained elevated at Rs 3,532.01 crore in Q1FY22, higher by 7.2 percent compared to Rs 3,294.98 crore in Q4FY21, but have fallen 20 percent compared to Rs 4,416.42 crore in Q1FY21, the period which impacted by COVID-led lockdown.

The bank has not utilised COVID provisions during the quarter. It holds cumulative provisions (standard + additional other than NPA) of Rs 12,425 crore at the end of Q1FY22.

Asset quality weakened for the June 2021 quarter. The gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances increased 15 bps sequentially to 3.85 percent and net NPA as a percentage of net advances rose 15 bps QoQ to 1.20 percent in Q1.

Gross slippages during the quarter were Rs 6,518 crore, which were higher than Rs 5,285 crore logged during Q4FY21 and Rs 2,218 crore in Q1FY21.

""Slippages in Q1FY21 were moderated due to regulatory forbearances that do not exist in the current quarter. Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs during the quarter were Rs 2,543 crore while write-offs were Rs 3,341 crore. Consequently, there were net slippages in NPAs (before write-offs) for the quarter of Rs 3,976 crore,"" said Axis Bank.

As of June 2021, the bank's provision coverage, as a proportion of gross NPAs at 70 percent was lower compared to 72 percent as of March 2021.

""The standard restructured loans under resolution framework for COVID-19 related stress as of June 2021 stood at Rs 2,192 crore that translates to 0.33 percent of the gross customer assets. The bank carries a provision of around 23 percent on restructured loans, which is in excess of regulatory limits,"" said Axis Bank.

Non-interest income (other income) grew by 38.7 percent YoY to Rs 3,588.17 crore in Q1FY22 as the fee income increased 62 percent YoY to Rs 2,668 crore.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Axis Bank's CEO Amitabh Chaudhry is third on the list who received Rs 6.52 crore, the bank's annual report said, adding that the top management was not given any salary increment in FY21.

According to the ICICI's annual report, its executive director in-charge of wholesale banking Vishakha Mulye grossed Rs 5.64 crore. This was despite the decisions taken by material risk takers including executive directors, chief financial officer and company secretary to voluntarily opt for for a 10 per cent salary reduction from May 1 in their payments due to COVID-19.

When compared with the bank's median salary, ICICI's Jagdishan allowances were the highest at 139 times the median salary of a bank employee, while Chaudhry earned 104 times the median and ICICI Bank executive directors drew 96 times the median salary.

HDFC Bank had 200 executives in the exclusive club, while Axis Bank had 69 bankers, according to annual reports of the banks.

The deal comes almost a year after, Citigroup had announced that it will shutter its retail banking operations in 13 countries including India as part of a global business strategy.

Let’s decode the most common questions of Citi credit card customers pertaining to reward points, dues and more.

Should I continue holding the Citi credit card after the announcement that Axis Bank is acquiring the credit card business?

Do not rush to surrender the Citi credit card right away after this announcement. “Axis bank is a significant player in the credit card segment and has a good credibility in the market. Wait until the migrating offer from the Axis Bank to existing Citi credit card customers,” says Parijat Garg, a digital lending consultant. He adds, you can plan to exit after evaluating the offer from Axis Bank. Anyone who has Axis bank credit card right now and also a Citi bank credit card. They should evaluate which card is better for them and continue with one. You may not like to hold two credit cards with similar benefits in your wallet.

Assume a customer is using a Citi IndianOil Credit Card or Citi Gold credit card. “It will be interesting to see how it will get mapped to AXIS bank credit card as they also have a separate set of credit cards,” says Garg. He adds, it’s important you migrate to a credit card that has equal or better rewards and offers. Also, your credit limit should remain the same or improve. Then it makes sense for Citi credit card customers to continue with Axis Bank.

Will Axis Bank devalue Citi reward points during acquisition?

No, Axis Bank will not devalue reward points while acquiring. “The customers will have better terms and offers, a wider set of services. We believe we can match those offers and retain it that’s guaranteed for any customer who is coming over as part of this transaction,” says Subrat Mohanty, Group Executive – Banking Operations & Transformation of Axis Bank.

I have an ongoing dispute with the Citi credit card related to an outstanding amount. What I should do now?

If you have some disputes related to an outstanding amount or late payment charges with Citi bank, then clear them while it is still in operations in India and make sure your credit history is clean. Once Citibank exits its India retail business, i.e. after this acquisition gets over in six to nine months, getting a resolution to your card complaints might be difficult and time-consuming. “An unresolved dispute may also reflect in your credit report. In future, there could be challenges while applying for a loan,” says Garg.

Will Citi’s exit impact my credit score?

No, there won’t be any impact on your credit history, if you exit from Citi bank's credit card or you are transferred to the acquiring bank. “The credit history travels with you and it’s not linked to a particular organisation,” says a spokesperson from www.creditcardz.in.

What parameters should I evaluate to decide whether to continue with the credit card or exit?

The Citi reward points do not expire. But, Axis bank may set some expiry date for your points, depending on the type of card. Ajay Awtaney, editor of LifeFromALounge.com, says, “When you are transferred to the acquiring bank, you must evaluate the acquirer's history and experience in the credit cards segment, whether existing benefits will be continued.”

The credit limits offered by Citibank on credit cards are much higher compared to most of the banks. Will there be a re-look on those limits now by Axis Bank?

Mohanty says that the credit limits of all Citi customers are most likely to remain the same. “The limit on credit cards is determined by the quality of the customer. So, it’s not always comparable,” says Mohanty. But he adds that the bank has done its due diligence and has ""fairly done a detailed understanding and analysis of Citi's customers. So, existing credit limits will continue.""

But, if you have a poor credit history during this transition period, there is a possibility that Axis bank will lower your credit limit.",742,0.00037792325019836426

Large banks with strong balance sheet would continue to grow faster than their peers in an environment impacted by the pandemic, and sustained fiscal and monetary support by the government and the RBI would help economic recovery by the second half of this fiscal, Axis Bank's top official said. The impact of the second wave of COVID-19 continues, Axis Bank Managing Director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said.

""I…hope that the acceleration in vaccination drives and continued fiscal and monetary measures by the government and the (banking) regulator would help the economy to recover from this pandemic by H2 of fiscal 2021-22,"" Chaudhry said in the bank's annual report for 2020-21.

""In such an environment, large banks with healthy operational performance, strong balance sheet and capital position, superior risk management, and operational capabilities would continue to grow faster than the overall sector,"" Chaudhry said in his message to shareholders in the annual report.

During 2020-21, the bank's focus was on building granularity across businesses coupled with strong focus on execution that helped it deliver strong growth across focused segments, he said. The bank's CASA (current account savings account) deposits grew 20 per cent, with the share of CASA increasing by 3.72 percentage points to 45 per cent in overall deposits.

With a revision in ATM withdrawal and cheque leaf charges enforceable starting July 1, account holders of various private banks like Axis and IDBI bank, along with public sector banks like Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda, Syndicate Bank and SBI, one of India’s largest lenders will be impacted. Check out all the changes here:

As Syndicate and Canara bank merge, the customers of Syndicate bank will be given new IFSC codes for functioning effectively today. All IFSC codes starting with SYNB will be deactivated starting today. For the uninitiated, the IFSC (Indian Financial System Code) is a unique, 11 digit alpha-numeric code that identifies a bank branch for online fund transfers. The first four characters are representative of the bank name, the fifth character is zero, and the remaining digits signify the branch.

Customers will be required to use new cheque books provided by Union Bank from 1st July, which amalgamated Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank on 1st April 2020 under the mega-merger of public sector banks undertaken by the Finance Ministry last year. All cheque books issued by both of these banks will no longer be functional.

IDBI Bank has revised its cheque leaf charges. Earlier, the bank offered 50 free leaves per quarter and levied Rs 3 per leaf post the limit. Now, the customers will have a ceiling of 20 free leaves per year, with a charge of Rs 5 per leaf post the stipulated limit. However, it is noteworthy that the IDBI “Sabka Savings Account” does not fall under this change.

In addition to increasing cash withdrawal charges from ATMs beyond the free limit of 5 transactions, Axis Bank has also raised the minimum balance threshold for savings accounts. Earlier, the withdrawal charges stood at Rs 5/1,000 or Rs 150, whichever was higher. Now the effective charges beyond the free limit will be Rs 10/1,000 or Rs 150, whichever is higher.

The minimum balance requirement for Easy Savings Scheme, in metro locations particularly, has been raised from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000. The bank also hiked its SMS charges, with the SMS alert free effective from today standing at 25 paise per SMS, with a maximum limit of Rs 25/month. This was earlier set at Rs 5/month for value-added service alerts. However, OTP and promotional messages sent by the bank will not count under these charges.

The country’s biggest lender SBI (State Bank of India) also introduced a change in charges levied. Beyond the stipulated 4 free transactions, the bank will levy a charge of Rs 15 plus GST per cash withdrawal from ATMs (both SBI and Non-SBI) or its branches.

Additionally, SBI will supply 10 free cheque leaves per financial year to its BSBD (Basic Savings Bank Deposits) or Zero Balance account holders. Barring senior citizens, the charges that will be levied on cheque leaves thereon would be as follows:

Even as policy makers grapple with ways to revive demand in the pandemic-hit economy, an online sale fest launched by Axis Bank offering 15 percent discounts is witnessing a 10-times surge in daily volumes, a senior official has said.

The bank is giving its debit and credit card holders a flat 15 percent cashback on partner e-commerce portals like Flipkart and Amazon as part of the ten-day ""Grab Deals Fest"" which is on till July 4.

“We are witnessing a 10x jump in overall spends by gross merchandise value (GMV) if I were to compare it with daily average in the month prior to launch and almost similar increase in the number of customers who are availing the offer,” its president and head of digital business and transformation, Sameer Shetty, told PTI.

It can be noted that the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has hit demand across the economy, with many analysts saying that private consumption has fallen in such a way that even staples have been hit. Even as the lockdown measures get eased, they say demand will take time to revive as income generation needs to come back first.

Usually, a lot of the e-commerce sales activity happens around festive season towards the end of the year, and there are reports saying the e-commerce players are expecting a subdued activity this year.

Shetty said the bank is witnessing a surge in ordering from urban areas where e-commerce ordering is active, but stressed that the ordering is across income segments.

The products ordered can largely be called as discretionary items, Shetty said, hinting that the bank's experience cannot be exactly compared with the macro picture because of a slew of factors like a small set of people in the economy it serves and their background.

The bank launched the offer because it thought that the second wave is now receding and people are coming out of stressful times. The lender's main focus is making as many customers avail of the offer rather than look at the GMV, he said, adding that such schemes are aimed at deepening the connect with customers.

The discounts are shared between the bank and the e-commerce major, Shetty said, maintaining that the bank does not want to do big bang shopping festivals and will continue with such deals regularly.

The response to the current offer is “far beyond” expectations, Shetty said, exuding confidence that by the time the offer ends the bank would have done significantly better than what it aimed for initially.",432,0.3138972322146098

Amazon Web Services (AWS) on Tuesday said it has inked a multi-year deal with Axis Bank to power the digital transformation programme of the country's third largest private sector bank.

As part of the agreement, Axis Bank will draw on the breadth and depth of AWS services to build a portfolio of new digital financial services to bring advanced banking experiences to customers, including online accounts that can be opened in under six minutes and instant digital payments. This will help the bank increase customer satisfaction by 35 per cent and lower costs by 24 per cent.

Axis Bank stock has jumped 72% in a year, brokerages believe it can rise 35% more

To date, Axis Bank has deployed over 25 mission-critical applications on AWS, including a Buy Now Pay Later product and a new loan management system to support it, Account Aggregator, Video-Know Your Customer (V-KYC), and WhatsApp Banking. Axis Bank plans to migrate 70 per cent of its on-premises data centre infrastructure in the next 24 months to further reduce cost, improve agility and customer experience.

Puneet Chandok, President (Commercial Business), AWS India and South Asia, Amazon Internet Services Pvt Ltd (AISPL) said digital transformation for banks is no longer an initiative but it's becoming the only way to thrive and serve customers better every day. AISPL is a local legal Indian entity that acts as a seller for AWS services in India.

He cited various reports to state that India has the highest fintech adoption in Asia (87 per cent) and that 59 per cent of Indian consumers in metros are willing to move to a digital-only bank in the next two years. ""The picture is clear that consumers no longer only expect but they demand personalisation, they demand convenience, and they want an enhanced user experience which is improving every day,"" he told reporters.

Talking about the partnership with Axis Bank, Chandok said AWS is helping build a secure foundation for digital at the bank, driving innovation, and migration and core modernisation. He noted that cloud technology is transforming not just the financial industry but other sectors as well.

""Virtually every business segment in India, we are seeing re-invention happening, driven by the cloud. Be it insurance, banking, manufacturing, media and discontinuities like this, push all of us to step back and change,"" he added. Financial services customers across banks, insurers and fintechs are increasingly running business critical applications on AWS, where they started their journey with small workloads, but have now moved more business critical applications to the cloud.

Subrat Mohanty, Group Executive at Axis Bank said over the last 18 months, the organisation has been working with a very specific focus on making Axis Bank, the best digital bank in the country. About 73 per cent of its customers are digitally active, 73 per cent of FDs opened are opened digitally and over 800 people are working on digital projects, he added.

""In the course of last six months, we are starting to see the results…about 50 million-plus daily transactions that actually happened on the app. If you see our customer footprint over the last 24 months or so, it has really exploded,"" he added. Axis Bank has over 200 million customers who increasingly demand new and innovative digital banking services, including digital deposits, digital loans, and digital credit cards, to better manage their finances.

Last year, Axis Bank made the decision to deploy all new customer facing applications on AWS. While 15 per cent of the bank's applications are already on the cloud currently, the bank aims to take this number to 70 per cent in three years. ""We are committed to investing in India and the intent is to put the power of AWS Cloud directly into the hands of our customers and partners, so that they have the tools to really experiment, innovate and deliver impact at scale in India,"" Chandok said.

He added that the investments are directed towards strengthening its technical support teams, building capabilities and infrastructure to support its growth in the country. Leveraging AWS' solutions, Axis Bank has built new digital banking products using microservices that support any application architecture, irrespective of scale, load, or complexity.

For example, the bank has built fully digital offerings which include its LEAP savings account with a virtual debit card, its NOVA online current account, and OLIVE, its credit card engagement platform that has serviced more than 3.5 million users since its launch less than two months ago. Using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud, Axis Bank will scale workloads on demand to support 10 million daily real-time payments through India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI).",788,0.9869762744222369

The shares of Axis Bank have logged strong gains in the last year, outperforming the benchmark index Sensex by a significant margin and yet analysts and brokerages believe it has more legs to go in the medium term.

Axis Bank has logged a gain of 72 percent on BSE in the last year against a 51 percent gain in the Sensex. In 2021 so far, the stock is up 19 percent, while the Sensex is up 10 percent.

Brokerages believe the stock will rise further as the fundamentals of the stock are intact and the impact of the second wave of COVID-19 will be lower than the first wave due to the absence of a moratorium.

Global financial firm Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,000, a 35 percent upside from the current market level of Rs 739.65.

""There will be near-term impact owing to the second COVID wave. However, the bank expects to re-accelerate growth across segments as the COVID-related concerns subside,"" Morgan Stanley said.

Despite near-term COVID-led disruption, the bank claims to be ready for accelerated growth with a clear focus on RARoC (risk-adjusted return on capital)-based lending, mainly driven by retail/SME, brokerage firm

Emkay Global said.

Emkay has a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 960, which is a 30 percent upside from the stock's current market price.

""The bank claims that lower ECLGS (emergency credit line guarantee scheme) disbursement among peers corroborates better-quality SME back-book and plans to re-accelerate growth (partly gaining market share from PSBs). On the corporate front, the focus will be on building granular working capital and mid-corporate book. We build in 15-22 percent growth for FY22-24E,"" Emkay said.

""The bank has undergone a major transformational journey, fortified balance-sheet and is now ready to re-accelerate growth, delivering better return ratios (RoA/RoE at 1.5-1.6 percent/15-16 percent in FY23-24E),"" said Emkay.

The bank posted a net profit of Rs 2,677 crore for the quarter ended March 2021 following a sharp decline in bad loan provisions. The double-digit growth in net interest income, non-interest income and pre-provision operating profit boosted profitability.

Jyoti Roy, DVP Equity Strategist, Angel Broking, said while there is going to be some impact of the second COVID wave on the asset quality in the first quarter of FY22, Axis Bank holds additional provisioning of 1.9 percent of advances which provides comfort.

""At the current level, Axis Bank is trading at P/ABV of 2.1 times FY22 adjusted book of Rs 357. Given the improvement in asset quality and excess provisioning on the books, we remain positive on Axis Bank, and it is one of our top picks in the large-cap banking space,"" Roy said.

While brokerages and analysts are positive on the stock, the road ahead is not free of bumps. While COVID remains a looming risk that could trigger a rise in NPA, the bank's asset performance, too, has been volatile.

""Despite considerable liability increases, Axis' asset performance has been volatile. Overdue retail/SME accounts and the implementation of corporate assets growth is not substantial over last year,"" said Ashis Biswas, Head of Technical Research at CapitalVia Global Research, who has a ""hold"" call on the stock with a target price of Rs 820.

Biswas, however, said the bank's substantial provisioning buffer and lower incremental stress will cushion.

The deposit franchise is gaining traction, and this tactical buffer will help improve the NIM forecast in the future. As a result, NIM is expected to increase in FY22 as the interest income reversal unwinds, he said.

In line with the proposed deal, Axis Bank is likely to raise its stake in Max Life Insurance to about 20 per cent over the next 12-18 months, said the insurance company's CEO Prashant Tripathy said.

Currently, Axis Bank and its two subsidiaries -- Axis Capital Ltd and Axis Securities Ltd -- collectively own 12.99 per cent in Max Life Insurance post approval of the deal in April this year.

With this, Axis entities have now become co-promoters of Max Life with three board seats.

""Axis Bank is to increase to 19.99 per cent in tranches. Thirteen per cent is already done over the next two quarters, we will seek approval for the balance seven per cent. So, it will reach about 20 per cent and that will be the ownership of Axis Bank,"" Tripathy told PTI.

When asked about the timeline for the completion of the remaining stake transfer, he said: ""It should happen in the next 12 to 18 months.""

Under the deal, the Axis entities also have the right to acquire an additional stake of up to seven per cent in Max Life, in one or more tranches, subject to regulatory approvals.

Tripathy said there is no change in brand but the tagline will have the name of Axis Bank as the joint venture partner.

Talking about synergy, he said, ""We are coming up with a new strategy for future growth. We are working together as a common team to ensure that Max Insurance life grows faster than the industry. We are working together to look at product mix to drive Axis channel so outcome is favourable for both customers and the company.""

Besides, he said working on analytics areas to leverage on each other's capabilities.

He said the company launched 14 products or product variants last year and increased the margin by 3.60 per cent in 2020-21.

Max Life Insurance recorded a 22 per cent rise in its total new business premium (individual and group) to Rs 6,826 crore in the financial year ended March 2021.

The renewal premium income of the insurer rose 15 per cent to Rs 12,192 crore, taking the gross premium to Rs 19,018 crore, up by 18 per cent from a year ago.

In terms of individual APE (adjusted premium equivalent), the company witnessed a growth of 19 per cent to Rs 4,907 crore.

Spandana Sphoorty Financial share price rallied more than 30 percent in two consecutive sessions - June 3-4 - on reports that private sector lender Axis Bank may take over the microfinancier.

Last Thursday, the stock was locked at 20 percent upper circuit and the rally continued till Friday. However, it witnessed a bit of profit-booking, falling more than half a percent. In the last 12 months, the stock has rallied 35 percent.

On June 4, sources privy to the matter told Moneycontrol that the lender is looking at acquiring Spandana Sphoorty, in an attempt to reduce its priority sector lending (PSL) cost. The interest in this deal has been evinced on both sides, they said.

Experts feel the deal is a win-win for both Axis Bank and Spandana Sphoorty.

""Spandana Sphoorty's customer base will help Axis Bank in expanding its existing customer base and improve its cross-selling abilities,"" Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research told Moneycontrol.

On the other hand, ""the microfinance institution would gain huge support from the parent bank and be able to sail through the tough times, amid pandemic, easier compared to its competitors,"" he said.

Investors can hold Spandana Sphoorty with a medium to long term perspective, Garg advised.

In a clarification note to the exchange, Spandana Sphoorty said the company was unaware of the source of Moneycontrol's report, adding that it does not ""comment on media speculation.""

The company is primarily engaged in the business of microfinance, providing small value unsecured loans to low-income customers in semi-urban and rural areas.

Spandana Sphoorty reported a significant fall in standalone profit to Rs 41.64 crore in March 2021 quarter, compared to Rs 77.5 crore in March 2020 quarter. In the same period, revenue from operations increased to Rs 459.2 crore from Rs 421.1 crore.

It is the second-largest microfinance company in India with assets under management (AUM) of Rs 8,157 crore and an active customer base of 24.45 lakh. It has a strong distribution network of 1,052 branches spread across 289 districts of 18 states.

""Assets under management grew by 19 percent YoY and 5 percent QoQ to Rs 8,157 crore in March 2021 quarter. Disbursements reached highest ever of Rs 2,426 crore in Q4 FY21, rising by 6 percent YoY,"" said Spandana Sphoorty in its BSE filing on May 22.

The microfinance lender raised Rs 1,914 crore during Q4 FY21 and Rs 5,482 crore in FY21.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on June 4 announced a status quo in its key lending rate at 4 percent and downgraded its FY22 economic growth forecast to 9.5 percent after a three-day, bi-monthly monetary policy committee meeting.

The decision came on the expected lines.

Additionally, the RBI announced a series of liquidity measures including an on-tap liquidity window for contact-intensive sectors. From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, the RBI has announced a series of measures to guard the economy and keep the liquidity conditions comfortable for financial system.

In an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol, Saugata Bhattacharya, Executive Vice President - Business and Economic Research & Chief Economist, Axis Bank spoke on a range of issues including the central bank’s tough fight ahead to keep the growth-inflation trade-off under control:

Edited Excerpts:

Do the GDP growth estimates for FY22 now look more realistic?

RBI’s earlier 10.5 percent FY22 GDP growth forecast had already been quite conservative and at the lower end of economists’ and analysts’ forecasts. The current lowering to 9.5 percent is now more in line with analysts’ post second wave of forecasts. Please note that this is an evolving analysis based on the reductions in infections and easing of lockdowns.

What are the risks?

Predominantly, these relate to the incidence of a third infections wave, and the resulting need for further lockdowns. Given the rising availability of vaccines, these risks are coming down. Also, a combination of high commodities prices, domestic inflation and earlier than expected normalisation of easy monetary policy by global centrals banks can require an early response from MPC and RBI, which can slow down growth recovery momentum.

Do you think RBI should begin unwinding now on the easy liquidity stance?

Given the above forecasts of growth slowdown and resulting loss of incomes, it is important to keep interest rates, particularly lending rates, at reasonably low levels. There are indeed some risks of the current surplus liquidity levels adding to inflationary pressures and unanchored inflation expectations. However, given the likely magnitude and prolonging of weak demand, the benefit of the ample system liquidity far outweigh the risks. However, RBI has shown exceptional ability to anticipate emerging risks, and can calibrate liquidity levels to manage these risks as needed.

Do you think inflation will surprise on the upside this year? Kindly explain.

There is a risk of CPI inflation pushing up higher than RBI’s forecast of 5.1 percent, due to the factors mentioned above, especially high crude prices. However, we think, as the RBI statement emphasises, that the risks are balanced, with the prospects of a normal monsoon keeping food prices in check, and a lack of a sharp increase in aggregate demand coupled with gradually normalising supply dislocations keeping CPI items under controls.

RBI has aggressively focused on liquidity enabling measures. Your view?

RBI’s response since March 2020 has been exceptionally dynamic and proactive, using large surplus system liquidity levels as a significant instrument to anchor short term rates at low levels. This is in line with the response of all major global central banks.

Is the RBI forward guidance losing its credibility?

On the contrary, RBI and MPC’s forward guidance are being even more closely parsed and tracked. RBI had, in its April ’21 review, shifted from a time dependent to a state dependent forward guidance. In today’s statement, it has augmented its commitment to “continue its accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive and sustain growth …”, adding “revival” to its April statement of sustaining growth. For good measure, the statement also added the willingness to “continue to use all instruments at its command”.

Do you think the fiscal response is adequate to complement RBI measures?

A large fiscal counter-cyclical response is certainly warranted to partially offset the economic losses resulting from the second set of lockdowns. The Govt has also demonstrated its willingness to increase the fiscal stimulus both in FY21 and the budgeted expenditures for FY22. As to the timing, the Govt has the kind of data and insights into the nature of the economic scarring from the disruption in economic activity, which will enable to craft a stimulus response better than analysts. We think a large targeted expenditure boost is likely once the restrictions start being relaxed.

How do you assess Shaktikanta Das performance as RBI Governor so far?

Governor Das and his RBI team have been exceptionally innovative and dynamic in anticipating and responding to the evolving economic and market risks, and have had a large role in incentivising credit, maintaining stability in financial and credit markets. This flexibility of response is remarkable, given that this once-in-a-century public health shock has no playbook to follow.",796,-0.2025717000166575

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank (AXSB) reported a strong quarter, with PAT above our estimates, aided by lower provisions. Business growth was strong across segments, with retail disbursements at an all-time high. - On the asset quality front, the slippage trend subsided sequentially (INR52.8b v/s INR67.4b in 3Q) and total restructuring stood at 0.3% of loans. Also, the total funded and non-funded book declined to 2.0% of loans (v/s 2.4% in 3QFY21). Also, AXSB has ~72% coverage on GNPL and additionally holds a provision buffer of 2% (including standard provisions) to protect the balance sheet against any potential stress. However, the resurgence of COVID and state-wise lockdown would be a key monitorable in the near term.

Dolat Capital Market's research report on Axis Bank

Axis bank reported NII and PPoP growth of 11% and 17% YoY respectively. The miss in NII estimates was compensated by higher fee and treasury gains. Margins were stable QoQ at 3.56% despite improving CoF. Asset quality metrics improved sequentially with 85 bps decline in gross NPA ratio to 3.7%, contained slippages at 3.6% for the quarter, decline in ‘BB and below’ book by 40 bps QoQ 2% of advances, and restructured book at 0.3% of loans (against 0.5% for other large private peers). Limited SME restructuring (0.02%) and net slippages (5% of total) also allude that asset quality risks are limited/receding.



Outlook

With encouraging asset quality trends, improving core operating metrics, healthy capital and provisioning buffers, and increased traction in retail liabilities, the bank seems well poised to grow its book. Possible pressures on NIM given its higher CoF vs other large private peers remains a key risk. Tweaking our estimates marginally, we maintain BUY on the stock with revised TP of Rs875 (from Rs840 earlier), implying a multiple of 2.1x FY23E P/ABV.

Over the last year, the Indian banking industry has focused on risk mitigation. Major private banks, with a few exceptions, shifted the focus to safer retail assets from high risk corporate loans. This trend has continued in the fourth quarter as well. The common theme in the Q4 earnings report cards of two big private banks—Axis Bank and ICICI Bank—is a clear shift to secured retail advances. Among the banks, ICICI Bank has grown its retail book more aggressively than its rivals. Analysts call this a timely shift to de-risk the loan book. HDFC Bank, on the other hand, chose to grow its corporate book at a faster pace than retail loans.

Some numbers first

In the case of ICICI Bank, retail book grew by 20 percent year-on-year (YoY) and 7 percent sequentially during the quarter ending March 31, 2021. Retail loans comprised 67 percent of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2021. In the case of Axis, the retail loans grew 10 percent YoY (year-on-year) and 7 percent QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) and accounted for 54 percent of the net advances of the Bank. Domestic retail loans grew 11 percent YoY and 7 percent QoQ. The share of secured loans was 81 percent with home loans comprising 36 percent of the retail book.

Retail disbursements touched new all-time highs led by higher contribution from secured loan segments. Disbursements in Consumer segment were up 45 percent YoY and 44 percent QoQ, with secured segments like home loans up 73 percent YoY and 45 percent QoQ, and LAP (loan against properties) was up 53 percent YoY and 51 percent QoQ. Compared with this, HDFC Bank has grown its retail book at a slower pace. It's domestic retail loans grew by 6.7 percent and domestic wholesale loans grew by 21.7 percent. The domestic loan mix as per Basel 2 classification between retail and wholesale was 47:53.

Where is the growth coming from?

According to analysts, banks are growing retail books both through fresh business acquisition and buying out or taking over loan portfolios from NBFCs and cooperative banks where rates continue to be high. “These banks offer lower rates. NBFC and co-operative banks provide high cost loans. They are ripe targets,” said Jyoti Roy, analyst at Angel Broking.

Most of the growth is coming from the home loan portfolio. Within retail, home loans are the favourite of banks because of relatively low risk and high margin. Banks have aggressively grown their mortgage book attracting the retail borrowers with lower rates and benefitting from the recent stamp duty cuts. In the case of ICICI bank, home loans form almost half of the retail loans and this chunk has grown 22 percent on a year on year basis.

For Axis, the growth in home loans was 73 percent on YoY basis and 45 percent QoQ. Home loans now comprises 36 percent of the Axis’ loan book. HDFC Bank, in comparison, has grown home loans by 10 percent YoY and 5 percent on QoQ. Except in HDFC Bank case, both ICICI Bank and Axis have grown their retail book at a much faster pace.

Another reason why big banks are focusing on retail could be lower demand from corporates. Over the last one year, the economic activity has been severely impacted by the pandemic. This has reflected in demand for fresh loans also. The Indian economy is likely to have contracted by 7.5 to 8 percent in FY21. Not just big corporations, demand from small and medium-sized companies too have slowed down over the last one year.

Will huge growth in retail continue?

In the conference call post the announcement of the results, ICICI Bank management said the high growth seen in retail loans may not be continue going ahead. The lender attributed the high growth in Q4 to reasons like stamp duty cuts and benign interest rate environment. Axis Bank too said it will walk cautiously looking at the quality of assets. “We will grow both our secured and unsecured books but the way things are on the ground, we will be cautious on the unsecured loans,” said the management officials at the post result press conference.

Will the aggressive push on retail loans back fire?

Some analysts have sounded caution. “Retail demand is good but can’t say how the asset quality will pan out after a year,” said Siddharth Purohit, analyst at SMC Global securities. ""Banks need to be cautious on asset quality,"" said Purohit.

Purohit is right. COVID situation is worsening across certain states forcing many states to go into partial or full lockdowns. These include Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. Prolonged lockdowns can lead to job losses and impact the repayment ability of the borrowers. Last year, the impact of the economic stress was not visible on the bank balance sheets due to the RBI's intervention. The RBI offered support to the banking sector in the form of loan moratorium and restructuring while the government announced an economic stimulus package to fight COVID.

Banks’ aggressive shift to retail assets could boomerang if COVID second wave gets prolonged and vaccination drive doesn’t progress as planned.",886,-0.06951958482915704

Axis Bank share price rose nearly 2 percent in early trade on April 28 after the company reported strong numbers for the quarter ended March 2021.

The private sector lender posted a net profit of Rs 2,677 crore for the quarter ended March 2021 following a sharp decline in bad loan provisions. The bank reported a loss of Rs 1,387.8 crore in the year-ago period.

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew 11 percent to Rs 7,555 crore in Q4 FY21 compared to Rs 6,807.7 crore in Q4 FY20, with net interest margin expanding 1 basis point YoY to 3.56 percent at the end of March 2021.

Also Read - Axis Bank posts Q4 profit at Rs 2,677 crore as provisions dip, net interest income rises 11%

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and company after Q4 earnings:

Macquarie | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 780

Strong provisioning, capital & liquidity buffers give us comfort and confidence of credit costs normalising over the next two years. The core P/BV at 1.5x FY23e is cheap.

Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Raised to Rs 910 from Rs 840

The profit was ahead of estimate with lower provisions & higher treasury, while operating profit growth was weaker than peers, reflecting slower loan growth.

The uptick in disbursements & healthy CASA growth will lift loan growth. The slippages were a tad higher than estimates but manageable. COVID provisions at 1.4% offer cushion & lower credit cost will lift the RoA.

Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Raised to Rs 880 from Rs 770

The growth picked up & it continues to build buffers. The capital levels are healthy at 15.4% and we expect RoEs to improve to over 14%.

CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Raised to Rs 1,025 from Rs 1,000

The rerating should continue for the stock as the results were strong on asset quality with slippages of just Rs 5,000 crore.

We expect the company to deliver a 16%-17% core PPoP CAGR over FY21-23. It remains one of our top picks.

Kotak Institutional Equities | Rating: Buy | Target: Raised to Rs 810 from Rs 775

The headline gross NPL Ratio, net NPLs & slippage ratios declined QoQ. The upgrade in earnings reflects potential lower stress factoring COVID buffer.

Looking at FY22 towards a faster normalisation of return ratios and frontline large banks would benefit in this leg of the cycle.

JPMorgan | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 750

The growth is broad-based & corporate banking has seen a pick up in Q4. The slippages were 3.6% with two-third of it coming from the retail sector.

Goldman Sachs | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 742

The Q4 core missed estimates, while asset quality/loan growth was healthy. The bank lags behind other larger banks in terms of profitability. The RoA/RoE may rise to 1.5%/15% over FY22-23.

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Accumulate | Target: Rs 770

Bank has maintained PCR of 72% and 80bps of COVID provisions over and above regulatory specific provisions on non-NPAs. With legacy NPAs provided for, better growth and initiatives are working gradually to move ratios towards a high ROE goal of 17-18%.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 925

Axis Bank has delivered a strong performance and appears well-positioned to report robust earnings traction. Moreover, moderation in fresh slippages, coupled with improved underwriting and an increasing retail mix, would help maintain strong credit cost control.

Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 900

Axis Bank is available at 2.2x/2.0x its FY2022E/FY2023E ABVPS. We believe valuations are reasonable and there is potential for re-rating as earnings pick up and the economic scenario normalises.

A conservative provisioning policy, comfortable capitalisation, overall franchise value, and a high provision coverage ratio (PCR) are positives, which will help the bank ride over medium-term challenges and provide support to growth and valuations.

At 09:21 hrs, Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 698.25, down Rs 1.05, or 0.15 percent on the BSE.

The share touched a 52-week high of Rs 800 and a 52-week low of Rs 333.05 on 16 February 2021 and 22 May 2020, respectively.

Currently, it is trading 12.72 percent below its 52-week high and 109.65 percent above its 52-week low.

Axis Bank, the country's fourth-largest private sector lender by market capitalisation, posted a net profit of Rs 2,677 crore for the quarter ended March 2021 following a sharp decline in bad loan provisions. The bank reported a loss of Rs 1,387.8 crore in the year-ago period.

The number is also higher than CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of Rs 2,175.1 crore. The double-digit growth in net interest income, non-interest income and pre-provision operating profit also boosted profitability.

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew 11 percent to Rs 7,555 crore in Q4FY21 compared to Rs 6,807.7 crore in Q4FY20, with net interest margin expanding by 1 basis point YoY to 3.56 percent at the end of March 2021.

Provisions and contingencies for the quarter stood at Rs 3,294.98 crore, registering a steep 57.4 percent decline compared to the year-ago period and 28.4 percent fall on the sequential basis.

Specific loan loss provisions for Q4FY21 were Rs 7,038 crore (including reclassification of NPA provision of Rs 4,266 crore on account of Supreme Court judgment shown as other provision in the prior quarter), compared to Rs 4,204 crore in Q4FY20, said Axis Bank.

During the quarter, the bank made additional provisions aggregating Rs 803 crore on account change in NPA provision rates on loans to commercial banking segment. Net of the two adjustments, specific loan loss provision for Q4 FY21 would have been Rs 1,969 crore, the bank added.

The bank held cumulative provisions (standard + additional other than NPA) of Rs 12,010 crore at the end of Q4FY21. These cumulative provisions translate to a standard asset coverage of 1.95 percent as of March 2021, said the bank.

Credit cost for the quarter ended March 2021 (net of CBG provisioning policy change) stood at 1.21 percent, improving compared to 2.77 percent at Q4FY20, it added.

On the asset quality front, gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances increased to 3.70 percent as of March 2021 from 3.44 percent in the December quarter. Net NPA also climbed to 1.05 percent from 0.75 percent in the same period.

Gross slippages during the quarter were Rs 5,285 crore, lower compared to Rs 7,993 crore during Q3FY21. ""Slippages from the loan book were at Rs 5,038 crore and that from investment exposures stood at Rs 247 crore,"" said Axis Bank.

Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs during the quarter were Rs 3,462 crore while write-offs were Rs 5,553 crore, the bank added.

Consequently, there were net slippages in NPAs (before write-offs) for the quarter of Rs 1,822 crore as compared to Rs 5,831 crore in Q3FY21, said the bank.

""The standard restructured loans under resolution framework for COVID-19 related stress as on March 2021 stood at Rs 1,848 crore that translates to 0.3 percent of the gross customer assets. The bank carries a provision of 26 percent on restructured loans, which is in excess of regulatory limits,"" the bank added.

Non-interest income (other income) grew by 17.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,668.3 crore in the quarter ended March 2021.

""Fee income for Q4FY21 stood at Rs 3,376 crore, up 15 percent YoY and 16 percent QoQ. Retail fees grew 16 percent YoY and 17 percent QoQ; and constituted 64 percent of the bank's total fee income.

Axis Bank launched a range of devices that allows its customers to make contactless payments. The State Bank of India (SBI) had launched a contactless payment solution with Titan last year.

Axis Bank offers a wristband, a keychain, and a small device, called a loop, that users can fit on a watch's strap. In the case of SBI, the customer must purchase a Titan watch for contactless payment.

Contactless payment from SBI and Axis Bank - Here are a few things you should know

-Titan pay watches start at Rs 2,995. The devices start at Rs 750 for Axis Bank. Both devices use near-field communication or NFC for payments. The devices, therefore, need not be smart devices with other on-the-go functionalities. They have an NFC chip embedded in them. For payments, these devices are linked with the customer's bank account.

-Axis Bank offers 10 percent cash back only on the first three transactions within 30 days of the device's issuance, and the total spend must be Rs 600 or more. The max cashback will be Rs 100. There is also cashback on the fifth transaction every month, where the customer must spend at least Rs 200, and the maximum cashback that the bank will offer is Rs 100.

In the case of SBI, the watch is linked to the bank's YONO app. Customers get applicable discounts and cashback. For both the banks, the service works on MasterCard-enabled point of sale terminals.

-Based on the Reserve Bank of India's guidelines, transactions up to Rs 5,000 will happen without entering a PIN. For transactions above this limit, users will need to authenticate payments using their PINs. Only up to five transactions in a day can be done without a PIN, even if they are below the Rs 5,000 limit.

-Axis Bank also offers a fraud cover. It is available if the fraud happens due to the bank's deficiency or an act done by a third-party. In the case of negligence by the customer, the insurance cover will not be valid. Third-party breaches include SIM duplication fraud, identity theft frauds, account takeover fraud, and skimming or card cloning. Also, the customers must inform the bank within three days for zero liability.

For SBI, too, similar conditions apply as they are part of RBI's regulations, wherein the bank must compensate customers in case of frauds that occur without the customer's negligence.

-There's an annual fee of Rs 500 for contactless payment devices, according to Axis Bank's website. In the case of SBI, it's not clear whether there's an annual fee.",436,

Max Financial Services share price jumped over 6 percent intraday on February 25 after Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) gave its nod for the acquisition of up to 12 percent stake in Max Life Insurance by Axis Bank and its subsidiaries.

Max Financial was trading at Rs 906.25, up Rs 52.90, or 6.20 percent at 10:31 hours. It touched a 52-week high of Rs 938.65. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 938.65 and an intraday low of Rs 893.45.

The IRDAI approval was an integral step in this long-awaited joint venture transaction which was first announced in April 2020.

As per the proposed transaction, Axis Entities have the right to acquire up to 19 percent stake in Max Life, of which, Axis Bank proposes to acquire up to 9 percent and Axis Capital Limited and Axis Securities Limited together propose to acquire up to 3 percent of the share capital of Max Life in the first leg of the transaction.

Max Financial Services said in a statement that in addition, Axis Entities have the right to acquire an additional stake of up to 7 percent in Max Life, in one or more tranches, which they intend to acquire over the course of the next few years.

Analjit Singh, Chairman of Max Group and Max Financial Services (holding company of Max Life Insurance) said that this joint venture will strengthen their position as a top leader in the Indian life insurance sector which is showing clear indications of rapid and enduring growth.

Also, share price of Axis Bank gained over 3 percent and was the top Sensex gainer following the deal.

After an advisory by Reserve Bank of India, Axis Bank and its subsidiaries agreed to enter into revised agreements with Max Financial for acquisition of up to 19 percent of the equity share capital of Max Life.

The initial plan was for Axis Bank to acquire up to 29 percent in Max Life. But, Axis Bank in August 2020 reduced this and proposed to acquire 17 percent share in Max Life.

Global research firm CLSA has reiterated buy on Max Financial and has raised target to Rs 1,225 per share. It is of the view that IRDAI nod for Max Live deal removes the distribution overhang, according to a CNBC-TV18 report.

""Axis JV can help structural improvement in growth outlook and VNB margin and have the company as our top pick,"" the research firm said.

Jefferies has upgraded the stock to buy and has raised target to Rs 1,000 per share. It has raised earnings estimates and said that visibility of agreement can support re-rating.

On the other hand, Morgan Stanley has maintained its overweight rating on Axis Bank with target at Rs 1,000 per share, according to CNBC-TV18 report. Axis Bank was trading at Rs 775.55, up Rs 26.80, or 3.58 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 779.05 and an intraday low of Rs 760.

Research and broking firm Motilal Oswal is of the view that IRDAI’s approval addresses the long awaited overhang and clears the way for a longterm strategic partnership between the two entities. This partnership improves the long-term growth visibility/cross-sell opportunity for Max Life. It also increases the focus towards higher margin products and productivity improvements from the distribution mix. We expect VNB to grow at 21 percent CAGR over FY20-23E and estimate operating RoEV to grow ~20 percent in FY23E, with embedded value (EV) reflecting 18 percent CAGR over FY20-23E.

""We maintain our buy rating with a revised target of Rs 1,000 per share, considering 80 percent stake for Max Financial and 20 percent holding company discount. Max Life remains our preferred pick in the life insurance space.

Axis Bank and its promoter United India Insurance Company have settled with regulator SEBI cases of alleged disclosure lapses and have paid more than Rs 51.5 lakh as total settlement amount.

The matter pertained to alleged lapses in disclosures with respect to change in promoter's shareholding in the private lender. The entities were alleged to have violated Prohibition of Insider Trading (PIT) norms, as per two separate settlement orders passed on Monday.

An investigation by SEBI found that during October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018 period, the value of trades by United India Insurance Company in the securities of Axis Bank on each trading day was more than Rs 10 lakh.

The promoter was required to make disclosures about such transactions to the private lender within two working days as required under PIT norms.

However, in five instances, the said disclosures were made by United India Insurance Company to the lender with a delay of 10-17 days, SEBI noted.

Besides, Axis Bank was required to disclose the same to the stock exchanges within two trading days of the receipt of the disclosure from the promoter.

""However, the same was disclosed by the applicant to the stock exchange only on October 16, 2020, only with a delay of 1,072 -1,080 days,"" SEBI said.

In December 2020, the regulator had issued notices of summary settlement to the entities, intimating that the proceedings may be settled on filing of settlement applications and remittance of settlement amounts of Rs 41,43,750 by Axis Bank and Rs 10,13,906 by United India Insurance Company.

Accordingly, the entities filed settlement applications with the regulator proposing ""to settle without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusions of law.""

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank earnings of Rs11.2bn (PLe:20.7bn) was lower than estimates mainly on back of higher provisions & miss on PPOP which was due to marginally lower NII and high opex. Pro-forma slippages of Rs67.4bn (84% retail) looked under control, while restructuring book of Rs27.1bn (45bps of loans) was on lower side. Only negative was high provisions despite carrying additional Rs112bn of provisions and also higher write-off in the quarter. High provisioning levels (75% PCR & 208bps of addl provisions) should act as strong cushion for P&L hits as we watch slippages trends ahead with restructuring more or less done for the bank. Operationally, fees need to pick up, improve back loan growth and tight opex control will keep PPOP strong.

Outlook

We retain at ACCUMULATE with revised TP of Rs725 (from Rs750) based on 1.9x Mar-23 as we marginally cut NII growth, increase opex & increase w.offs

ICICI Direct's research report on Axis Bank

For Q3FY21, Axis Bank posted a mixed set of results on the operating front as profits were slightly below our estimates owing to higher opex and provisions. Asset quality saw a small blip but the bank has sufficient provisions to absorb any shock and smoothen earnings. NII for the bank was up 14.3% YoY at rS 7373 crore, a slightly slower trajectory than past few quarters. This was account of modest credit growth and interest reversal. Margins were steady at 3.59%. Excluding interest reversal, the same would have been at 3.89%. Other income was flattish at rS 3776 crore, owing to tepid fee income growth (5% YoY) and 29% YoY decline in treasury income. Operating expenses for the quarter were up 19.3% YoY mainly due to increments in salary and, thus, gratuity adjustments. Provisions were at rS 4604 crore (up 32.7% YoY) of which rS 3899 crore was towards proforma NPA. As a result of higher provisions and opex, PAT for Q3FY21 was down 36.4% YoY to rS 1117 crore.

Outlook

we remain positive on the stock and arrive at a target price of rS 800 (rS 710 earlier), valuing the stock at ~2x FY23E ABV. We maintain BUY rating.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Axis Bank

Axis reported a lower PAT of Rs11bn (vs. estimate of Rs19bn) mainly due to higher opex and elevated provisions. The bank has maintained a provisioning buffer of 2.1% of loans (best among peers) to largely absorb the asset quality pain in FY21 and walk into FY22 with a stronger balance sheet to ride the ensuing growth wave. Overall credit growth continues to disappoint (up 6% yoy) due to corporate drag, but clocks better growth in retail/SME. The bank resisted giving numerical guidance on growth in FY22, but we expect a better growth trajectory on the back of the strong balance sheet and reviving retail/corporate credit demand. Overall proforma GNPA ratio of 4.6% was in line with the expectation, while restructuring pool at 0.4% (with no major risk of spill over in Q4) was far lower than management’s own guidance, pointing to lower LLP in FY22/FY23 (160/110bps vs. 260bps in FY21).



Outlook

We like Axis’ aggressive stance to front-load provisions, which could depress RoA/RoE at 0.7%/7% in FY21E but should improve to 1.5%/15% by FY23E, aided by better growth, cost ratios and moderate provisions. Retain Buy with a TP of Rs850, valuing core bank at 1.9x FY23 ABV and subs at Rs40.

Arihant Capital's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank has reported 36% YoY decline in net profit due to higher provision and high OPEX which has impacted the earnings adversely. NII for the quarter grew by 14% YoY to Rs 7,373 cr was impacted by interest reversal during the quarter adjusted for which NII was up 19% YoY. Operating profit growth was lower at 6% YoY due to flat other income growth and higher OPEX. Cost-income ratio increased sharply due to few one-off charges along with gradual recovery in business volumes and collection cost. Provisioning buffer of the bank continues to remain high at 33% YoY/0.5% QoQ to Rs 4,604 cr. On the business front, loan book growth was lower at +6% YoY/+1% QoQ to Rs 5.82 lakh cr while deposits grew smoothly to Rs 6.54 lakh cr by +11% YoY. Despite having 18bps interest reversal impact, NIM stood flat at 3.59% QoQ.

Outlook

We maintain our Accumulate rating on the stock with a revised TP of Rs 794, valuing the bank at 2.0x FY23E ABV. Considering significant provision buffers which makes balance sheet stronger, superior liability profile, lower restructuring and strong capital position (CAR at 18.7%), we continue to keep our positive stance on Axis Bank.

HDFC Securities' research report on Axis Bank

AXSB continued to build higher-than-expected provisions on its pro forma portfolio as it continued to search for stability in its back book coverage. The sustained build-up in standard asset provisions was a negative surprise. Although prudence is generally welcome, at 2.1% standard asset cover, the road to credit cost normalisation is longer than originally envisaged.

Outlook

We trim our FY21 full-year earnings estimates by ~13% and continue with our BUY recommendation with a revised target price of Rs 705.

If a borrower defaults on a bank loan, his other loans drawn from the same bank too may become non-performing assets (NPAs) affecting the customer's credit worthiness, bankers said.

All loans may be tagged as NPAs even if the customer is prompt on the repayment of other loans to the same bank. For example, if you default on a credit card loan to a particular bank, your home loan or car loan in the same bank, on which the loan repayment is prompt, may also become a bad loan.

This is because the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) norms require banks to follow NPA classification at a borrower level and not on one particular loan, said private sector Axis Bank in a response to a Moneycontrol Query.

“The asset classification per extant applicable income recognition and asset classification regulations, requires every bank to follow asset classification at a borrower level and not at a facility/product level,” Axis Bank spokesperson said in a statement.

“We have used the said regulations for determination of our proforma NPA and provisions made in the financial statement for Q3FY21. Hence, the borrower level classification is a RBI regulatory requirement and not an Axis Bank specific choice. The actual customer classification shall be done only upon final order of the Supreme Court,” the bank said.

On January 27, the Times of India reported that Axis Bank customers who default on credit cards will see their home loans too getting the NPA tag. Clarifying on the report, the lender said this action is nothing specific to the bank, but applicable to all banks as per the RBI norms.

Another senior banker from a public sector bank too said one loan default will impact the asset classification of other loans taken by the same borrower. ""That happens,"" said the banker, who didn't want to be identified. ""The other loans too become NPA and your CIBIL score gets impacted,"" said the banker.

This rule means that a customer needs to make sure all his loan repayments are proper to avoid the NPA tag. “It is upto the bank how to exercise the RBI norms on a borrower level. Generally banks have been increasing provisions expecting an increase in stress in the system,” said Siddharth Purohit, Senior Analyst at SMC Global Securities.

What if loans are from two group entities?

But, the NPA tag on other loans may not come if the loans are given by two separate group entities, experts said. For instance, if the home loan is from the bank and the credit card loan is from a different entity in the same group, then one loan default may not impact the other loan.

“IRAC (Income Recognition and Asset Classification) norms are clear on this issue. If the loans are from the same bank, one facility going bad will lead to all facilities being declared as NPA,” said Naresh Malhotra, a senior banking consultant and former State Bank of India (SBI) Executive.

However, in case of a credit card loan default in SBI, this rule wouldn’t apply because SBI credit card is issued by a different entity and other loans are given by the bank, Malhotra said. ""Hence one default will not affect the other,” Malhotra said.

But, if one takes the home loan and a car loan (both from the same bank), one default could impact the asset classification of the other, Malhotra said.

What happens when a loan becomes an NPA?

As per rules, a loan becomes an NPA if there is no payment of interest or principal for 90 days. Once a loan is classified as an NPA, it is bad news for both the bank and the borrower. The bank will have to set aside money to cover the likely losses on such loans, while the customer’s credit score will get impacted on loan default. Higher provisions impact the profitability of the bank. For the borrower, a lower credit score will impact his ability to secure another loan at cheaper rate.

Banks have seen their bad loans going up substantially in the recent years. The RBI has projected the overall GNPAs to shoot up to 13.5 percent of total loans by September this year from 7.5 per cent in September last year in a base case scenario. In a worst case scenario, the bad loans could go up to nearly 15 percent of the total loans, the RBI said.",745,-0.3696831464767456

Axis Bank will now classify home loans of credit card defaulters as non-performing loans. This is being done as a part of its prudent provisioning practice to tackle troubled loans, the bank said. , as per a report by The Times of India.

The move comes even as a Supreme Court order has stayed classification of defaults during the pandemic, the report added.

NPLs from banks’ perspective means a hit on earnings as it will have to provision for the loan while interest payment received on the loan will no longer be income.

For borrowers, the bank can now initiate recovery proceedings at any time to recall even the lump sum amount. Loans are usually classified as NPAs after erring on payment by 90 days.

A spokesperson for Axis Bank told Moneycontrol: ""The asset classification per extant applicable income recognition and asset classification regulations, requires every bank to follow asset classification at a borrower level and not at a facility/ product level. We have used the said regulations for determination of our proforma NPA and provisions made in the financial statement for Q3FY21. Hence, the Borrower level classification is a RBI regulatory requirement and not an Axis Bank specific choice. The actual customer classification shall be done only upon final order of the Supreme Court.”

The report noted that, while Axis bank was making provisions from its earnings, proceedings might yet not be initiated due to the SC order.

This was confirmed by Axis Bank CEO and MD Amitabh Chaudhry. While announcing the bank’s results for the quarter ended December 2020, Chaudhry said profits were “adversely impacted due to prudent expense and provisioning charge of Rs 1,050 crore.”

For year-on-year (YoY) from December 2019, profits slumped 36 percent to Rs 1,116 crore in December 2020 from Rs 1,757 crore, while in Q3 Rs 6,736 crore worth of additional loans slipped into default, Chaudhry said.

“We are in the risk-taking business... we have to make prudent provisions. We have provided as though the SC dispensation (barring lenders from classifying loans as NPA) is not there. We have reversed interest earnings and fees from our income on these loans,” he said.",368,-0.9808973073959351

Axis Bank share price fell over 2 percent in the early trade on January 28 after the private lender reported a 36.4 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in standalone profit for the quarter ended December 2020, with elevated provisions (up 33 percent YoY). The profit for the quarter stood at Rs 1,116.6 crore against Rs 1,757 crore in the corresponding period last year.

Provisions and contingencies increased considerably to Rs 4,604.28 crore in Q3FY21, rising 32.7 percent compared to corresponding period and half a percent over previous quarter.

Here what is brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after the Q3 numbers:

Sharekhan

Axis Bank is available at 2x / 1.8x FY2022E / FY2023E ABVPS and we believe valuations are reasonable and there is potential for re-rating once earnings and economic scenario normalises. A conservative provisioning policy, comfortable capitalisation, the overall franchise value and a high provision coverage ratio (PCR) are positives, which will help the bank ride over medium-term challenges and provide support to growth and valuations.

The deal with Max Financial Services and other bancassurance partnerships augurs well for fee income sustainability and growth in the long run. We maintain a ""buy"" rating on the stock with a revised price target of Rs 800.

Motilal Oswal

The bank has delivered a resilient performance amid a challenging macro environment and appears well-positioned to report strong earnings traction, as fresh slippages subside, while improved underwriting and an increasing retail mix help maintain strong control on credit cost.

On the business front, retail disbursements have shown strong QoQ growth and surpassed pre-COVID levels. The bank has adopted conservative accounting policies and further strengthened the balance sheet by making additional provisions. We increase our FY22/FY23E earnings by 21%/10% and estimate AXSB to deliver RoA/RoE of 1.6%/15.4% in FY23. Maintain buy, with a target price of Rs 750 (1.8x Sep’22e ABV)

Dolat Capital

We lower our slippage estimate for FY21E to 2.8 percent from 4 percent earlier, upgrading earnings by ~30 percent for FY21E/22E. With encouraging asset quality trends, declining concentration risk in wholesale book, improving core operating metrics ex of the one-offs this quarter, increased traction in retail liabilities, we upgrade our rating to buy from accumulate, with a revised target price of Rs 840, implying a multiple of 2.1x Dec-22E P/ABV.

CLSA

The research firm maintained a buy call and raised target price to Rs 1,000 from Rs 850 per share. The results were a big beat on asset quality with slippage of just Rs 6,700 crore.

The bank is the best placed to handle any potential stress. It should see credit cost normalisation in FY22 itself. The improvement in underwriting in the last four-five years should lead to a big rerating.

CLSA lift its FY22-23 earnings by 5-12 percent as it remains one of the top picks. It’s the best way to play benign credit cycle for corporate and retail loans from FY22, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Jefferies

Jefferies has maintained buy call and raised the target to Rs 840 from Rs 800 per share. The higher slippages disappoint, but outlook is better. The profit was below estimates due to higher credit cost and disappointed in higher slippages at 1.2 percent of past year loans.

The management expects slippages to fall from Q4 and normalise from FY22. The growth in core operating profit & CASA was healthy, reported CNBC-TV18.

Citi

The research house kept a buy rating with a target at Rs 800 per share. There was a higher provisioning and lower restructuring. It’s up-fronting lot of NPA recognition & provisions in FY21.

The low restructuring and high provision buffer should imply lower credit costs for FY22. The lower PAT estimated for FY21 by 14 percent adjusting for higher provisions and lower NIM, reported CNBC-TV18.

Macquarie

Research firm Macquarie has maintained outperform call on the stock with a target at Rs 780 per share. The biggest positive is strengthening of balance sheet by making provisions. The low restructured assets and 2 percent provisioning buffer give us comfort. Macquarie raises earnings estimates by 8-12 percent for FY22-23, reported CNBC-TV18.

Bernstein

The research firm has kept market-weight call on the company, with a target at Rs 530 per share. The higher provisions kept headline numbers weak. The new NPAs from moratorium bucket got tagged as NPAs and expected to trail into Q4. The bank guarded against providing upbeat guidance.

It expects FY22 to be back on course for medium-term growth and profitability guidance, reported CNBC-TV18.

JPMorgan

The research firm is overweight on the stock, with the target at Rs 710 per share. The earnings miss is on higher slippages, while given guidance for improved F22.

It has cut F21 EPS by 14 percent but keeps F22/23 largely unchanged. It assume credit cost normalisation to 1.2 percent FY22 onwards, reported CNBC-TV18.

Axis Bank will report its December quarter earnings on January 27 wherein brokerages expect the lender to report modest growth in loan and deposit even though net interest income (NII) may see double-digit growth.

Brokerages point out that the December quarter is likely to be the first quarter which would reflect the underlying business trend, especially on the asset quality, if the regulator allows them to recognize stress.

The estimates of Motilal Oswal Financial Services shows Axis Bank can report a 14.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in NII.

Operating profit can rise 18.9 percent YoY. Gross NPA may stand at 5 percent for Q3FY21 while net NPA may come at 1.4 percent, Motilal Oswal said.

Brokerage firm Antique Stock Broking expects an 18.2 percent YoY rise in NII while net profit can jump 44.3 percent YoY.

Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities expects loan growth at 7 percent YoY with a greater focus on retail while operating profit growth may come at 11 percent YoY led by better cost controls.

Kotak expects Axis Bank to report slippages of about Rs 5,000 crore (nearly 4.5 percent of loans) subject to the court ruling.

""We expect gross NPL to rise QoQ. The focus would be on the expected quantum of restructured loans by Q4FY21 and an update on the loan book as the moratorium is lifted,"" Kotak said.

Brokerage firm Phillip Capital expects Axis Bank's NIM to remain stable QoQ despite MCLR cut owing to the declining cost of fund.

Phillip Capital expects a 17.3 percent YoY rise in December-quarter NII. Total loan-related provision is expected to reach 5.1 percent of loan book against 4.9 percent in Q2, said the brokerage firm.

The National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) on Monday announced a $107 million investment into its 'master fund' from Canada's PSP Investments, US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and domestic private sector lender Axis Bank.

After the new commitment from the three investors, the overall size of the 'master fund' has touched $2.34 billion and NIIF also announced the final close of the master fund.

The NIIF also announced that it is targeting to raise $2.1 billion for a private equity fund.

The master fund invests in operating assets in core infrastructure sectors, primarily transportation and energy, according to a statement.

Public Sector Pension Investment Board or PSP Investments, one of Canada's largest pension investment managers and DFC, a development finance institution of the US federal government, are new investors in the master fund, while Axis Bank was already invested.

Other investors in the master fund include Government of India (GoI), Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), AustralianSuper, CPP Investments, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Temasek, HDFC Group, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance.

International investors have rights to co-invest an additional $3 billion alongside the fund, it said, adding that DFC and PSP will join the other investors of the Master Fund as shareholders of NIIF, the investment manager.

The master fund is India's largest domestic infrastructure equity fund which has successfully anchored platforms in ports and logistics, renewable energy, smart meters and roads sectors, it said.

Department of Economic Affairs secretary Tarun Bajaj said the government is pleased to see some of the largest global investors of the world have invested in NIIF Master Fund and the final close has exceeded the initial targeted corpus of $2.1 billion.

“NIIF will benefit from PSP Investments' strong global infrastructure investing experience, while DFC brings along opportunities for NIIF to continuously learn about highest global standards such as the Blue Dot Network and commitment to best practices with respect to transparency and management of environmental and social risks,” NIIF's managing director and chief executive Sujoy Bose said.

The NIIF said after the close of Master Fund, it will now be raising $2.1 billion equivalent for a NIIF Strategic Opportunities Fund (SOF), which will be one of the largest India-focused private equity funds.

At present, NIIF, which is a collaborative investment platform for international and Indian investors anchored by the Government of India, manages over $4.4 billion of equity capital commitments across its three funds.",412,0.9999433358510336

The pandemic due to COVID-19 has ushered in an inflection point in the entire banking system which is going to bring in radical changes in terms of lending parameters, MD and CEO of Axis Bank Amitabh Chaudhary said on December 11.

Speaking at a session on financial system organised by XLRI, he said that the COVID crisis has created a huge disruption in the banking system in the country where individual banks are feeling its impact. He said that due to the pandemic, individuals ability to repay loans has reduced significantly while 90 percent of the banks' books is in moratorium.

""The crisis has increased the health costs and the average individual household needs money while banks at the same time will have to be more cautious. A vicious negative cycle has set in while discretionary spending has hit an all time low"", Chaudhary said.

At Axis, he said the bank has been able to raise capital to provide comfort to the depositors while the provision coverage ratio has gone up from 70 per cent to 124 per cent. Chaudhary said that the bank had also been modernising its monitoring aspects leading to fall in GNPA and NNPA levels.

According to him, the banking system will have to opt for more granular mode using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) which will form the basis of lending decisions.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Chaudhary also said that data points like credit card payments and salary pay-outs will also be used for taking a lending decision. This, he said, will be supplemented by robust underwriting, also determine the long-term survival potential of the sectors and also look at the history of the promoters who are seeking loans.

Chaudhary said Axis bank had activated its quick response team before the crisis surfaced in India looking at the experience of China.

He also said that for the first time, stress is building up in the retail sector putting the banks in a precarious situation which will have an impact on the price of loans and interest rates.

Max Life Insurance CEO and managing director Prashant Tripathy has said that approval from the insurance regulator on Axis Bank proposal to raise its stake in the insurer to about 19 percent should come through within next three months.

Earlier in October, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not approve Axis Bank's proposal to raise its stake up to 29 percent but scaled it down to an aggregate of 19.02 percent with the subsidiaries of private sector lenders.

Axis Bank was to originally acquire an additional about 29 percent stake in Max Life. However, some changes had to be made to the deal following correspondence from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).

The bank has shown its willingness to raise its stake directly and through its subsidiary in the Max Life Insurance, Tripathy said.

""This particular transaction in the permissible zone as per the RBI regulation, so it may not require any approval from RBI. It requires approval from IRDAI. We filed for IRDAI's approval about two weeks ago. It is under process. We should get approval in this financial year itself,"" he told PTI.

Axis Bank currently holds about 1 percent stake in Max Life and is the biggest banking channel partner for the distribution of the insurer's products. Products sold through the bank reportedly account for 54 percent of Max Life's revenues.

Axis Bank had said its total stake in Max Life will remain within the limits stipulated under the applicable laws and regulations.

""Under the revised agreements, Axis Bank will acquire up to 9.002 percent of the equity share capital of Max Life, and Axis Capital Limited and Axis Securities Limited will together acquire up to 3 percent of the share capital of Max Life.

""In addition, Axis entities will have a right to acquire an additional stake of up to 7 percent of the equity share capital of Max Life, in one or more tranches, in accordance with existing laws and regulations,"" the bank had said.

The bank being the promoter of this company is definitely of strategic advantage, he said.

""While the branch network is already available with us, but through this relationship there will be several other elements of governance, joint product development, IT integration, etc will also flourish and develop,"" he said.",409,0.006755053997039795

Private sector lender Axis Bank has partnered with fintech lending platform Rupifi to offer a business credit card powered by Visa. The card will be offered to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to transact on aggregator platforms for their business purchases.

Rupifi works with large aggregators like food delivery platforms, e-commerce companies, grocery, pharma, agri-commodities and others to reach out to micro businesses selling on their platforms. They underwrite these companies on the basis of transaction data and extend credit to them. Now with the credit card, Rupifi and Axis Bank can enable business loans to these entities through the card.

The average credit limit offered will be in the range of Rs 1 and 2 lakh per month and will be decided based on business data of the MSME’s transactions with the aggregator platforms, GMV (Gross Monthly Volume) of last six months and overall revenue among other factors.

“This partnership will give Axis Bank an opportunity to tap into the unexplored and lucrative MSME segment, which is an addressable market of over $100 billion. This will also help us penetrate further into retail and commerce, food, tech, travel, transport, mobility, and logistics businesses,” said Sanjeev Moghe, Head, Cards and Payment at Axis Bank.

Sharing details on the card features, the bank said there is a joining fee of Rs 1,000 and comes with a revolving 51 days interest-free credit period. Like a normal credit card, businesses can either pay off the entire amount within the due date or carry the balance over by paying the minimum due.",298,0.9997400641441345

Consumption-led businesses have shown strong growth in this festive season. In the initial five months of the pandemic and during the nationwide lockdown, consumption had reduced. In an interaction with Hiral Thanawala of Moneycontrol, Sumit Bali, President and Head – Retail Lending & Payments, Axis Bank, who joined the bank during the pandemic, discusses how consumption-led demand has been picking up. As of September 2020, Axis bank had 80 per cent secured and 20 per cent un-secured loans. Home loan, loan against property and loan for passenger cars contributed up to 65 per cent in the half-year ended September 2020.

How was the festive period for the bank in terms of lending growth?

Consumption-led businesses have shown strong growth in the festive season. People are spending at shops and restaurants again. Post-Diwali, it’s a cooling off period for couple of weeks. But we are expecting business to pick up again from mid-December, when the holiday season resumes, as customers will travel, shop and dine. Also, we expect demand for car loans to pick-up with year-end offers coming from manufacturers. The demand for home-loans has been steadily increasing and is expected to continue for the bank because interest rates are at a 15-year low; good offers from developers and state governments offering lower stamp duty for a limited period of time are also demand drivers.

Given that you joined the bank in the midst of the pandemic, how has been the journey so far?

Yes, I joined in July and it was an interesting point in time, as the unlock phases had just begun in the country. When I joined, an important task was to increase the volume of loan disbursals, while maintaining the asset quality. We decided to increase volumes strategically, focusing more on secured loans and less on unsecured loans. This approach worked well.

From July, the disbursals picked up. Our loan book is also growing steadily month-on-month and we are almost back to pre-COVID levels in all the secured products. On the unsecured side, we are scaling up in a measured way by focusing on existing bank customers. The unsecured products include personal loans, credit cards and business instalment loans.

Home loan interest rates are at a 15-year low. Has there been a rise in demand from existing home loan borrowers for balance transfers?

Yes, there has been a fair bit of activity on balance transfers in the home loan segment. This is because some of the housing finance companies (HFCs) have not been passing on the rate cut benefit to their existing customers. The internal benchmark rate at HFCs, to which rates are linked, has not moved down in line with reduction in borrowing costs. Therefore, we are seeing a lot of those customers opt for home loan balance transfers to banks, where the rates are linked to a transparent external benchmark such as the repo. Banks are thus gaining market share in mortgages.

In the last 15 months, we have seen two private banks and a co-operative bank being placed under moratorium by the RBI. What are the key lessons for depositors from these episodes?

Depositors should bank with the safe, reputed and well-managed banks. These are important parameters to consider while banking. Due to the recent events, customers have become more discerning about where they keep their money. Hence, we are seeing deposits shift to well-managed private sector banks.

How have loan collections been after the moratorium period ended in August? Has there been greater demand for loan restructuring as per RBI’s guidelines?

Overall, the collections were better than our projections, after the loan moratorium period ended. In secured loans, the collections are almost close to pre-COVID levels in terms of performance which is a pleasant surprise.

In terms of loan restructuring, we have not seen much demand yet. We don’t expect this to be a material number.

Axis Bank share price gained 2 percent intraday on November 24 after Jefferies retained ""buy"" call on the stock and has raised the target to Rs 700 from Rs 610 per share.

The research firm is of the view that the overall trend has improved with a better than expected festival season, CNBC-TV18 reported.

It feels that RBI's actions with Lakshmi Vilas Bank and DBS Bank and new banks can raise competition. Jefferies sees earnings recovery in FY22 onwards.

The stock was trading at Rs 607.50, up Rs 11.90, or 2 percent, at 1024 hours. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 609 and an intraday low of Rs 601.

The private sector lender reported a net profit of Rs 1,683 crore for Q2 FY21 as against a net loss of Rs 112 crore in Q2 FY20. The bank’s operating profit for the quarter grew 16 percent year-on-year (YoY) and 18 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to Rs 6,898 crore.

The bank said its net interest income (NII) grew 20 percent YoY to Rs 7,326 crore in Q2 FY21 from Rs 6,102 crore in Q2 FY20. The net interest margin (NIM) for Q2 FY21 was 3.58 percent as against 3.51 percent for Q2 FY20.

Emkay Global Financial Services likes Axis Bank's aggressive stance to front-load provisions. ""It may depress RoA/RoE at 0.7 percent/7 percent in FY21 but should improve to 1.4 percent/13 percent by FY23, aided by better growth, cost ratios and contained provisions,"" the research firm said.

""We upgrade Axis Bank to buy and revise the target to Rs 620 (from Rs 520), valuing core bank at 1.5x Dec’22 ABV and subs at Rs 23,"" it added.

The big takeaway from the report of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s internal working group (IWG) on ownership guidelines for private banks is the proposal to allow large corporate and industrial houses to promote private banks.

In the past, the RBI has been largely hesitant to let large businesses promote banks.

In the previous rounds, when the RBI had issued private bank licences, the banking regulator had permitted corporate houses to apply, but turned down their applications, and preferred financial institutions which had experience in banking transactions.

That approach may change now.

The proposal, however, comes with certain riders. According to the IWG recommendations, large corporate/industrial houses may be allowed as promoters of banks only after necessary amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

This is aimed at preventing connected lending and exposures between the banks and other financial and non-financial group entities and strengthening of the supervisory mechanism for large conglomerates, including consolidated supervision.

The other major takeaway from the proposals is to allow large non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to convert into banks. Well-run large NBFCs, with an asset size of Rs50,000 crore and above, including those which are owned by a corporate house, may be considered for conversion into banks, subject to completion of 10 years of operations and meeting due diligence criteria and compliance with additional conditions specified in this regard.

This too will help many corporate houses running NBFCs under their fold to become banks if they wish to do so.

The last time (2013-14) when the RBI invited applications for new private banks, a host of corporates including Tata Sons; the Aditya Birla Nuvo, part of the Aditya Birla conglomerate; L&T Finance Holdings, part of India's largest engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro; Reliance Capital; and INMACS Management Services Ltd, which provides management consultancy, corporate finance, audit, tax, and legal advisory services, had applied for permits.

Only Bandhan and IDFC got licences.

Focus on NOHCs

The IWG group has put lot of emphasis on the Non-operative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC) model. NOFHCs should continue to be the preferred structure for all new licences to be issued for universal banks. However, it should be mandatory only in cases where the individual promoters/promoting entities/converting entities have other group entities, the group has said.

While banks licensed before 2013 may move to an NOFHC structure at their discretion, once the NOFHC structure attains a tax-neutral status, all banks licensed before 2013 shall move to the NOFHC structure within five years from announcement of tax-neutrality, the report said.

Till the NOFHC structure is made feasible and operational, the concerns with regard to banks undertaking different activities through subsidiaries/ joint ventures/associates need to be addressed through suitable regulations. However, banks currently under the NOFHC structure may be allowed to exit from such a structure if they do not have other group entities in their fold.

The RBI has issued bank licences in three rounds since liberalization. In the first round in 1993-94, the RBI gave licences to 10 private sector banks, namely Global Trust Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, UTI Bank Ltd (renamed Axis Bank Ltd), Bank of Punjab, IndusInd Bank Ltd, Centurion Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank Ltd, Times Bank, and Development Credit Bank Ltd.

In 2003-04, two more banks were given licences—Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd. In 2014 IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank were given the licence.

The different guidelines on capital norms and ownership guidelines in each round had created confusion on appropriate rules. It is in this context that the IWG proposals are important.

The proposals have clearly said the RBI should take steps to ensure harmonisation and uniformity in different licensing guidelines, to the extent possible. Whenever new licensing guidelines are issued, if new rules are more relaxed, benefit should be given to existing banks, and if new rules are tougher, legacy banks should also conform to new tighter regulations, but a non-disruptive transition path may be provided to affected banks, it said in its report.

Promoter holding

There seems to be an attempt for consensus with respect to the percentage of stake the private bank promoter can eventually hold. The cap on promoters’ stake in the long run (15 years) may be raised from the current level of 15 per cent to 26 per cent of the paid-up voting equity share capital of the bank, the RBI group has said.

As regards non-promoter shareholding, a uniform cap of 15 per cent of the paid-up voting equity share capital of the bank may be prescribed for all types of shareholders, the proposals said.

There were tussles between private bank promoters and the regulator with respect to promoter holding. Private sector lender, Kotak Mahindra Bank had taken the regulator to court in connection with a dispute on promoter Uday Kotak’s holding. The RBI let the promoters, Uday Kotak and family, retain 26 percent stake, but capped the voting rights at 15 percent.

Similarly, the RBI had taken some punitive actions on Bandhan Bank for failing to reduce promoter holding. The restrictions were withdrawn after the bank complied with the regulations.

Overall, the IWG group recommendations address some of the contentious issues with respect to ownership norms of private banks.",881,-0.3277445236841838

Axis reported a PAT of Rs16.8bn (vs. estimated Rs14.6bn) mainly due to better NIMs and contained opex, partly offset by the continued strengthening of contingent provisioning buffer - now at 1.9% of loans (one of the highest among large peers). Overall loan growth was moderate at 11% yoy, including retail growth at 12% yoy/2% qoq. Though the bank has not given any numerical guidance, it expects overall growth trajectory to improve, led by retail and corporate growth largely in better-rated corporates. BB & Below rated corporate pool increased to 2.3% of loans, but Axis expects the overall restructuring pool to be lower at 1.6% of loans, for which it has already made 20% provisioning (10% required). Overall SMA 1 book (30 DPD) was moderate at 2.3% of loans and collection efficiency is expected to reach 97% by Oct’20-end.

Outlook

We like Axis’ aggressive stance to front-load provisions, which may depress RoA/RoE at 0.7%/7% in FY21E but should improve to 1.4%/13% by FY23E, aided by better growth, cost ratios and contained provisions. We upgrade Axis to Buy and revise the TP to Rs620 (from Rs520), valuing core bank at 1.5x Dec’22 ABV and subs at Rs23.

ICICI Direct's research report on Axis Bank

In Q2FY21, Axis Bank reported net interest income (NII) growth of 20% YoY to Rs 7326 crore. Strong NII growth was driven by expansion in net interest margin (NIM), which jumped 7 bps YoY, 18 bps QoQ to 3.58%. Sequential 18 bps expansion in NIM was due to 3 bps from capital raise, 5 bps from lower interest reversals and 10 bps from better liquidity management. From Q1FY21, the bank is adding some amount in NII reserve. As a result, NIM was negatively impacted by 5 bps. Other income for the quarter increased 47% sequentially to Rs 3807 crore, which was on account of 67% QoQ rise in the fee income (insurance distribution surged). Cost to income ratio declined 90 bps QoQ to 38.0%. Part of this can be attributed to relatively lower business volumes as a result of less cost. PAT for the quarter increased 51.3% QoQ to Rs 1683 crore compared to a loss of Rs 112 crore.

Outlook

The management held its guidance to remain well above industry credit growth, though it is currently cautious on certain segments. It can see minimal loans going for restructuring (estimated 1.6% of loans). Strong capital position, healthy operating metrics and reasonable prudence in provisioning provides comfort for steady earnings visibility and return ratios reaching 0.9% RoA and ~9% RoE by FY22. We value the bank at 1.6x FY22E ABV to arrive at a revised TP of Rs 600 (from Rs 530). We maintain BUY.

HDFC Securities' research report on Axis Bank

AXSB saw strong operating profit growth, led by robust NII growth, a sequential rebound in core fees, and controlled operating costs. Even as we expect the bank to register a rise in GNPAs in FY21E, it has already built significant provision buffers, which will limit the need for incremental provisioning. Further, strength on the funding side (CRAR and deposit traction) will allow the bank to capture resurgent credit growth.

Outlook

We maintain BUY on AXSB with a target price of Rs 616.

YES Securities' research report on Axis Bank

We retain BUY on Axis Bank and increase price target to Rs586 (Rs550 before) underpinned by earnings/BV upgrade. Earnings have been revised upwards by lifting NIM and core fee growth assumptions. Considering management’s assessment of probable restructuring pool and encouraging collection trends (demand resolution at 97% in Oct), we believe that downside risks to our prevailing credit cost estimates has diminished.

Outlook

Hence, bank’s return ratios will most likely recover sharply in FY22. The stand-alone bank trades at 1.4x FY22 P/ABV, and represents an attractive risk-reward.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis bank reported earnings of Rs16.8bn which was strong beat on estimates (PLe: Rs13.9bn). This was led by NII growth of 20% YoY driven by reduction in funding cost (30bps QoQ) and strong recovery in fees (up 4% YoY/67% QoQ). Bank retained its provisioning rate mainly towards COVID-19 and also for probable restructuring. Total pool of all excess provision was ~Rs100bn or 170bps of loans of which 25-30bps is on potential restructuring. Stress BB & below book moving higher by 60bps QoQ to 2.3% is disappointment and incl. probable restructuring is 3.16% of customer assets, although adequate provisioning should act as cushion and hence P&L hits should be under control.

Outlook

We upgrade to ACCUMULATE (from HOLD) with revised TP of Rs570 (from Rs480) based on 1.6x Sep-22 (from 1.5x Mar-22) on good comfort on provision & capital and better growth.

Private sector lender Axis Bank on Friday said the lender and its subsidiaries have agreed to enter into revised agreements with Max Financial for acquisition of up to 19.002 per cent of the equity share capital of Max Life.

Under this, Axis Bank's total stake in MLI will remain within the limits stipulated under the applicable laws and regulations.

Under the Revised Agreements, Axis Bank will acquire upto 9.002 per cent of the equity share capital of Max Life, and, Axis Capital Limited and Axis Securities Limited will together acquire upto 3 per cent of the share capital of Max Life.

In addition, Axis Entities will have a right to acquire an additional stake of upto 7 per cent of the equity share capital of Max Life, in one or more tranches, in accordance with existing laws and regulations the bank said.

The Revised Agreements will supersede the previous agreements entered into between the parties, the bank said.











The initial plan was for Axis Bank to acquire up to 29 percent in Max Life. But, Axis Bank on August 24 reduced this and proposed to acquire 17 percent share in Max Life



""...Axis Bank now proposes to acquire 17 percent of the equity share capital of Max Life, resulting in total ownership of 18 percent post the transaction. The parties have executed the definitive agreements,"" the company said in a BSE filing then.



Axis Bank and Max Life will shortly approach the respective regulatory authorities, with revised applications for their consideration and approval. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, the regulatory filing further added.









Initially when Axis Bank and Max Life had approached the insurance regulator (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) for a nod to the deal, IRDAI is said to have advised some changes in the deal. This includes the 'value creation options' proposed in the deal.

In the April deal structure, Axis Bank and Max Life had also agreed that if the value creation options are not completed within 63 months from the closing, the transaction provides for a put option for Axis Bank. The insurance regulator is said to have sought clarity on these options.

Also, as per this put option, there can be a sale of all shares held by Axis Bank in Max Life at a price of Rs 294 per share (subject to adjustments) within nine months of exercise of such put option.

Post this, Axis Bank announced in July 2020 that it is making some changes to the deal structure.

This deal was an outcome of the discussions after Axis Bank, Max Financial and Max Life had signed a confidentiality and exclusivity arrangement on Feb 20, 2020 to explore the possibility of a long-term strategic partnership between Axis Bank and Max Life.

The two companies have had a business relationship for over a decade, providing long term saving and protection products to over 1.9 million customers.",496,

Private sector lender Axis Bank is expected to report a profit in the range of Rs 1,400-2,000 crore during Q2FY21 against a loss of Rs 112.1 crore in the year-ago quarter. The lender is also likely to report a sharp sequential growth in profit to lower provisions.

Net interest income (NII), the difference between the interest income from lending activities and the interest paid to depositor, is seen rising more than 15 percent year-on-year with 10 percent loan growth and 11 percent growth in deposits compared to the year-ago period, while pre-provision operating profit may grow in the 6-8 percent range YoY.

""We expect loan growth at 10 percent YoY with a greater focus on retail. We expect operating profit to grow at 8 percent YoY led by better cost controls,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities, which sees profit at Rs 1,982 crore and 17.5 percent growth in NII.

HDFC Securities sees around 10 percent YoY loan growth and a marginal improvement in NIMs are expected to drive core earnings (NII) growth of 16 percent YoY.

Asset quality is expected to be largely stable on a sequential basis with the focus on the quantum of loan restructuring but credit cost may stay higher.

""We expect slippages of around Rs 2,500 crore (around 2 percent of loans) subject to a court ruling. We expect gross NPL to remain flat QoQ. The focus would be on the expected quantum of restructured loans by Q4FY21 and update on the loan book as the moratorium is lifted,"" Kotak said.

Derivatives & Quantitative Outlook

Banking stocks have relatively underperformed in the last few months while the broader market has seen a good recovery. Most banking stocks remained largely range bound in the last six months. However, heavily beaten down stocks from the sector have started exhibiting relative outperformance in the recent up move. Unlike other stocks, the open interest in Axis Bank remained high as it has remained under pressure since July 2019. The sell-off in March has been quite relentless as the stock got dragged below Rs 300 levels from highs of Rs 750, which were seen in February 2020. A significant sell off in the stock has risen in open interest. The first few sessions of the new series saw closure of open interest suggesting continuing short covering. We believe ongoing short covering will continue, which should take the stock higher.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Human resource officials said that there are seven more organisations, two each in the financial services sector and IT/ITeS sector, and one each in the consumer goods, real estate and media/entertainment space that are looking to adopt this model in FY21.

Unlike regular gig roles, the new-age gig opportunities across Indian companies will have similar entry requirements as a regular employee. So, if it is a senior hire, the required work experience would be 10 years and above.

How will this differ from a regular gig? Will the pay be lower? Moneycontrol attempts to answer these questions for you.

What are the new gigs?

The new gig roles aim at attracting people who would otherwise not be open to full-time roles. It could be highly qualified professionals who may not be able to travel to work because of ailing family members, or differently-abled persons who may find it tough to travel.

Similarly, women who have quit their jobs, post maternity or a difficult pregnancy, can continue working from home through these gig roles.

Also Read: Job losses don’t worry blue-collar workers, there are gigs on offer

The idea is also to get a diverse workforce since the new age-gigs are expected to have flexible work timings.

Traditionally, gig roles are considered to be inferior to a full-time job. This is because semi-skilled or unskilled workers are hired for short-term roles based on demand. Some of these include delivery personnel or logistics staff.

However, the new-age gigs could even have a former vice-president working on a short-term project. This effectively means that the educational qualifications and work experience requirements would be the same.

Unlike regular freelance jobs, where one individual works on multiple projects across companies, the new-age gig roles would have non-compete agreements where a professional cannot work in such roles in the same sector or industry.

How do companies benefit?

The new-age gigs would be specialist roles that will last between 6-12 months. After the project or assignment is over, he/she would need to be redeployed to some other job position, or, worse, be laid off.

Regular gigs like the ones seen in the e-commerce space have a possibility of being extended or the person being absorbed as a full-time staff. However, the new-age gigs don’t hold this possibility.

Also Read: Here’s how firms are keeping work-life balance of employees intact as they work from home

One reason why the role works well for the individual as well as for the company is that a qualified worker from any part of the world can be hired for new-age gigs without distance acting as a barrier. Travel costs need not be paid since these are virtual roles.

Companies also save costs since the specialist is hired only for a short period. Long-term employee benefits like provident fund, insurance cover and gratuity won’t be available for these positions. The new-age gigs would be 100 percent virtual so physical infrastructure cost for the hire is also saved.

HR experts estimate that compared to less than 3 percent currently, India Inc would have close to 10-15 percent working on new-age gigs in the next five years. Customer-facing roles and shop-floor positions, however, won’t be on a gig model.

Axis Bank, for instance, has said that the new-age gig roles would be offered in areas like digital banking, technology, risk modelling, virtual sales, audit and credit policy, which are the first set of pilot offers.

How would hiring be different?

The hiring process for the new-age gig roles would be exactly similar to a regular shortlisting process. First, candidates would need to apply for the role. This will be followed by one or multiple rounds of online interviews. Companies having aptitude tests for new hires would follow the same rigour for the new-age gig roles as well.

IT firms as well as financial institutions like banks, mutual funds and insurance companies have background verification as a standard part of the selection process. So, for new-age gig roles as well, this will be no different.

Regular gigs of semi-skilled workers involve a phone call from the hiring manager, after which the individual may join the role. However, the new-age gigs would follow the standard procedures of hiring, and, hence, the shortlisting process will be as lengthy as a regular hire.

Will the pay be lower than a regular hire?

HR officials said that the compensation payable for new-age gigs would be on par or even higher than that of a regular hire. This is because the short-term contracts require highly skilled individuals who command a premium pay in the job market.

Especially for job roles like virtual sales, data analytics and audit roles, it is estimated that the compensation would be 10-15 percent higher than a regular salaried employee.

Since long-term benefits like PF and gratuity would be absent, other perks like entertainment allowance, travel vouchers and food allowance could be offered.

Are there any challenges?

While new-age gigs are expected to be hassle-free, there are a few issues which human resource experts need to work on.

The first is the labour laws pertaining to hiring, firing and compensation. Labour laws talk about over-time payment for staff if work timings exceed. But HR officials would need to work with the legal teams to ensure that the differences on payment for overtime are ironed out.

Companies also need to keep in mind that it will be tougher to lay off short-term employees even if there are cost constraints. The exact circumstances under which the new-age gig workers could be fired needs to be spelled out clearly in the employment contract.

An added component here is replacement hiring in case of emergencies. HR consultants told Moneycontrol that companies must have a back-up plan to get an alternative worker within 7-10 days in case the particular hire has to quit due to a medical emergency or family commitment.

The second challenge would be in the area of violation of company policies and penal actions. For instance, sexual harassment using virtual interaction tools would be a challenge. POSH Act has said that any employee, be it contractual, third-party vendor or full-time employee can file a sexual harassment complaint.

Here, the compliance teams would have to work out ways to minimise such risks and also train recruits on the dos and don’ts of the workplace.

Finally, the most critical aspect would be on how productivity could be measured. For sales roles, there are targets, but for others, there wouldn’t be any quantifiable measure. For this, corporates need to work out a mechanism to measure the weekly and monthly productivity of each gig hire and also define what their daily tasks are, as per their job description.",1153,-0.13127389550209045

In an interview with the Economic Times, Chaudhry said that the economy is nowhere out of the woods and is currently operating at 70-75 percent of capacity. ""The recovery remains uneven with a faster rise in supply than demand. We can’t expect a miracle overnight. The recovery will take some time, it is a bit of a long haul,"" he was quoted as saying.

He further said that Indian economy is likely to return to pre-COVID-19 levels between the first and second quarter of next calendar year, subject to availability of vaccines on a scale that gives people the confidence to step out of their homes.

Asked whether banks should be blamed for being risk-averse, Axis Bank MD said that the bank is answerable to shareholders. ""We have to ensure that we lend conservatively and keep all our risk factors in mind before we give money to the customers. That is what the shareholders expect of us and that is what the RBI expects of us.""

Citing the RBI's latest annual report, Chaudhry said that the RBI governor has been warning the banks to be careful with money and raise capital.

""Recapitalisation plan for public and private sector banks assumes critical importance. The minimum capital requirements, which are calibrated on the basis of historical loss events, may no longer suffice to absorb post-pandemic losses,"" the RBI said in its report.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, too, had recently asked banks to prepare for the COVID shock by enhancing their capital strength. A series of banks, including Axis Bank, recently raised capital from the market to guard against the bad loan shock.

According to Chaudhry, banks will continue to remain risk-averse for some time. ""The banks have learnt their lesson after the last crisis, they are not going to be in a lending hurry,"" he told the newspaper.

Speaking about the bank's plan to raising more capital, Chaudhry, ""Nothing is happening at this stage. But at the right price, if the right deal was to come along and it is long term money, we don’t want to deprive ourselves of the money,"" he said, as per the report.

Max Life Insurance and Axis Bank have modified some terms of their proposed joint venture (JV) in order to comply with regulatory norms.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) in June raised concerns over four clauses in the agreement, according to a Mint report.

""Max Life and Axis have made significant alterations in their proposed JV agreement to secure regulatory approvals and expedite closure of the deal. Max Life and Axis Bank have erased some key clauses in their agreement in order to convince IRDAI,"" a source told the publication.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

Axis Bank, Max Life Insurance and IRDAI had not yet responded to queries sent by Mint.

In April, Axis Bank said it will raise its stake in Max Life Insurance to 30 percent from 1 percent, after purchasing shares from Max Financial Services (MFS) for nearly Rs 1,600 crore.

The companies have removed a clause that proposed listing of Max Life Insurance after merging it with its listed parent company MFS, since it would have violated Section 35 of the Insurance Act, 1938, a source told Mint.

The report said the IRDAI had also objected to a clause permitting Axis Bank to appoint a observer in Max Life Insurance's board. This clause has also been scrapped.

Another clause been removed after IRDAI raised concerns, which gave the right to one of the two parties to appoint auditors in Max Life Insurance, the report added.

""Now, in the revised deal, both parties have agreed to allow equal rights to Max Life and Axis Bank,"" a source told the paper.",278,-0.9999730587005615

Axis Bank has plans to employ nearly 1,000 people under its new hiring initiative 'Gig-a-Opportunities', a model devised to attract skilled talent that can work with the bank remotely, from anywhere in the country, according to a company official. This hiring model comprises two working patterns, first is full-time permanent job and the second is based on the duration of a project.

""Our idea is that Gig would be large (regular) jobs. We wanted to make it as effective as a normal job would have been for anyone both in terms of being content with the job or what people learn from their jobs...over the next one year, we will add 800-1,000 people working through this model and that is the minimum I am saying,"" Rajesh Dahiya, Executive Director (Corporate Centre), Axis Bank, told PTI.

Earlier, the mindset was that for working, you have to come to the office, but now this work from home concept has changed many things, he said.

Stating that people were hesitant in the first place about working from home, Dahiya said but now they have got used to it and this is proving to be very productive and also very efficient.

He said the bank will look for good talent, including young people, experienced mid-level professionals and women, from across the country.

'Gig-a-Opportunities' typically will have full-time permanent jobs and also project specific jobs with a fixed term that can finish in 8 months or a year, he added.

Dahiya said Axis Bank is offering these opportunities not on a part-time basis but ""these are full-fledged jobs"", which will be as per the industry standards.

""We have put up many job roles under this initiative on our website and under each head we will take many people. Just in the 3-4 days of opening this platform, we are sitting with more than 3,000 CVs from all over India. We don't want to compromise on quality of the people and hence we will not compromise on the compensation also,"" he added.

Dahiya said the first batch from 'Gig-a-Opportunities' is expected to be enrolled from October 1 or 2 and hence onwards it will become an ongoing process.

Stating that banking today has changed drastically in view of evolving technologies, he said it is not necessary that one has to be from the banking background to apply for these jobs.

""Today I have more than 700 people working in the IT (information technology) department, I have 250 people who work in digital department who make my app and all that. I have more than 500 people who are in data analytics and I have 400 plus people in my HR department,"" Dahiya said.

So Axis Bank is a company which employs over 80,000 people, he said adding that then there are group companies as well. ""Banking jobs today are not only core banking jobs.""

""We work with people, we work with technology. There have been migration, job losses, etc, we have been looking for good people. With good people we will be able to do good jobs,"" Dahiya said.",523,0.9999921321868896

The novel coronavirus pandemic has led to a massive surge in digital transactions as customers maintain their distance from bank branches. Data from leading lenders confirms the trend.

The share of alternative channels in the total transactions for State Bank of India increased to 93 percent in the first quarter ended June 30 from 90 percent in the same period last year, SBI executive said as per a report by Hindu BusinessLine.

""We are seeing a lot of traction in the bank’s technology platform, YONO,"" he said.

Similarly, for ICICI Bank, more than 90 percent of savings account transactions in the first quarter came through digital channels. The share was 87 percent during the same period last year.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

“COVID-19 has had almost the same positive impact as demonetisation,"" said Prabhu Ram, Managing Director and Group CEO of Payswiff, a payment transaction solution provider.

""Even the traditional payments, like payments to milkman and paperboy have gone digital now because people fear touching currency notes,"" Ram added.

Digital payments in the country should touch 1.5 billion transactions a day if they keep growing at the current rate and the Reserve Bank of India is putting in place systems to support the growth, a top official of the central bank had said.

As many as 100 million digital transactions were being recorded daily in the country against 120 million reported before the coronavirus outbreak, said P Vasudevan, chief general manager, department of payments and settlement systems at the Reserve Bank of India.

“For context, in 2016 we were doing 22 million, now we are at 100 million, this shows that digital transactions are growing at an annual growth rate of 58 percent and the future of digital payments is tremendous and sizeable,” Vasudevan had said at the virtual Global Fintech Fest on July 22.

Indian market hit a fresh five-month high on August 11, but experts advise caution at higher levels. The S&P BSE Sensex closed above 38,400 while Nifty50 also climbed 11,300 levels.

Sectorally, the action was seen in metals, banks, finance, and oil & gas space, while profit-taking was visible in telecom, healthcare, and consumer durables.

Experts are of the view that there are no visible signs which suggest that investors should go short but a close below 11,299 can be considered as an initial sign of weakness.

ITC has rallied for the fourth consecutive day in a row and has also witnessed a rise in volumes. The stock has rallied more than 4 percent so far in August. Axis Bank rose on raising Rs 10,000 crore via QIP.

Bank of Baroda share price declined 3 percent in early trade on August 11, a day after the lender reported its June quarter numbers. The bank posted a net loss of Rs 864.3 crore for the June quarter 2020 due to provisioning on standard accounts.

We have collated views of an expert on what investors should do when the market resumes trading on 12 August:

Expert: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

ITC: Fresh buying can be considered on dips with a stop below Rs 190

This counter appears to be in a sideways consolidation phase in a larger range of Rs 210–191 levels and Tuesday’s move also appears to be on the back of decent base which it has built around 191 levels.

However, it appears to be faltering from around the upper end of the said consolidation zone of Rs 210 levels.

Interestingly, this counter is also facing resistance at 189-Day exponential moving average as the scrip encountered selling pressure after testing the said average on multiple occasions in the past including in last Tuesday’s session.

Hence, to strengthen its momentum on the upside it needs a strong close above Rs 210 levels. In that scenario, a decent target of 239 can be expected.

Positional Traders can continue to retain a positive outlook on this counter as long as it sustains above Rs 191 levels. Fresh buying can be considered either on dips with a stop below Rs 190 on a closing basis.

Axis Bank: Traders can look for a target of Rs 470

There seems to be a short-term trading opportunity in this counter as it appears to have registered a breakout on lower time frame charts from an extremely narrow range of 10 points between Rs 437–427 in which it was moving in the preceding three trading sessions before registering the said breakout.

Hence, as long as it sustains above Rs 435 levels a modest target of Rs 470 can be expected but to embark on a medium-term sustainable upmove it needs a close above Rs 485.

For time being traders can remain positive and look for a target of Rs 470 with a stop below Rs 430 on a closing basis.

Bank of Baroda: Fresh buying should be avoided

After retracing 50 percent of its last leg of the rally from the lows of Rs 36–55 levels it appears to be consolidating around Rs 45 levels. However, it is critical for this counter to sustain above the said level as this scrip has been looking weak in the last two trading sessions.

Hence, fresh buying should be avoided but can be considered on a close above Rs 49 for an initial target of Rs 54 whereas traders who are already long shall maintain a tight stop below Rs 45 on a closing basis.

Axis Bank in its complaint alleged that some office bearers of Cox & Kings and its sister-concerns cheated the bank of Rs 1,030 crore after availing loans, which were not repaid.

In its complaint, Kotak Mahindra Bank alleged that the travel company in “manifold transactions” managed to “siphon off huge sums … from banks, financial institutions and public investors” through subsidiaries and offshore companies.

Shares of Axis Bank closed 1.39 percent higher at Rs 434.85 on BSE on August 5, a day after the company launched Rs 10,000 crore qualified institutional placement (QIP).

Axis Bank and Max Financial Services will make changes to certain options that were agreed upon earlier this year for the lender to hike stake in Max Life Insurance, following a correspondence from regulator Irdai, according to a filing. As per the definitive agreements entered into by the two companies, they had agreed to ""certain Value Creation Options and related rights"".

In April, Axis Bank agreed to increase its stake in Max Life Insurance, a subsidiary of Max Financial Services (MFS), to 30 per cent from about 1 per cent.

""Based on correspondence from Irdai received by the company, the company and Axis Bank have agreed to make some changes to the Value Creation Options and factor in some alternate mechanisms subject to regulatory approvals and as maybe permitted under applicable law,"" MFS said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.

Specific details about the changes were not disclosed.

In April, MFS had said the company and Axis Bank intend to create long term value for all shareholders of Max Life by working towards a merger of the company with Max Life.

""Should the merger not be completed by a pre-agreed timeline, the parties have contractually agreed on certain other outcomes which are detailed in the transaction documents including a swap up Axis bank's shareholding to Max Financial, tax consequence of which will be equally borne by the parties,"" MFS had said in a regulatory filing and also described them as 'Value Creation Options'.

At that time, the company had also said that if the Value Creation Options are not consummated within 63 months from the closing, the transactions provide for a put option for the bank.

The bank would have the put option on the ""company to sell all shares held by Axis Bank in Max Life at a price of Rs 294 per share (subject to adjustments mutually agreed between parties) within 9 months of exercise of such put option,"" the filing had said.

""Customary rights like minority protection rights for Axis Bank at Max Life level, anti dilutive provisions, consequences of identified events of default form a part of the inter-se agreements,"" it had said.

On the proposed 70:30 joint venture, Axis Bank earlier this week said the definitive agreement to become joint venture partners in Max Life Insurance Company Ltd has been signed.

Since then, the parties have approached regulators for approvals and that the deal continues to be on track, Axis Bank had said.",418,0.6108838319778442

ICICI Direct's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank reported healthy Q1FY21 numbers with a strong operational performance. QoQ fall in provisioning led PAT to come in at Rs 1121 crore. Main highlight was sharp reduction in moratorium book from 28% to 9.7%. Provisioning for the quarter was at Rs 4416 crore (~79 bps of advances) vs. Rs 7730 crore in Q4FY20. The bank has made additional provisioning of Rs 915 crore during the quarter of which Rs 733 crore is for Covid-19. Accordingly, outstanding contingent provisions were at Rs 6898 crore (~1.2% of advances). Sequential decline in provisioning led the bank to report a profit of Rs 1121 crore vs. a loss of Rs 1388 crore in Q4FY20.

Outlook

Covid-19 provisions, subdued business growth are delaying a revival in RoE. However, given healthy asset mix, liability strength, adequate capital, superior customer profile, we believe the bank is well poised to face near term challenges. A 1.2% provisioning coupled with lower moratorium book provides cushion for delinquency shocks post Morat period. We value the bank at 1.7x FY22E ABV to arrive at a revised TP of Rs 530 and maintain BUY.

Naveen Tahilyani, group head in-charge of transformation at Axis Bank, has quit within seven months, joining a string of senior executives who have left the private sector lender in the recent past, according to sources.

The sources also said that Tahilyani, who had joined Axis Bank this year, might be headed back to Tata AIA as the head of country operations.

When contacted, a bank spokesperson confirmed the development, saying Tahilyani - group executive and head of banking operations and transformation - will be stepping down in November to pursue opportunities outside Axis Bank.

The development at the Amitabh Chaudhry-led lender comes within weeks of its executive director for retail Pralay Mondal quitting to join the much smaller CSB Bank - what was termed as ""compulsions"". Mondal's exit was preceded by the exit of chief financial officer Jairam Sridharan, who joined Piramal Finance as the chief executive of a newly started consumer finance business.

Rajesh Dahiya, Axis Bankbusiness,companies,Bank,Axis Bank,India's Executive Director (Corporate Centre), said, ""Naveen has been instrumental in bringing key operations and service transformations to the bank.

HDFC Securities' research report on Axis Bank

We have slightly reduced our earnings estimates, as we build slower loan growth, lower NIMs, and slightly higher provisions. Improved risk practices (post CEO change), a strong balance sheet (CRAR ~17.5%, PCR ~75%), and a strong liability franchise will hold the bank in good stead. Our constructive stance on AXSB ties in with our broad thesis that large private banks with strong balance sheets and deposit franchises will emerge stronger.

Outlook

We maintain a BUY on Axis Bank with a target price of Rs 565.

Sharekhan's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank posted strong results Q1FY2020 with Operating results better than expectations and adopting a conservative provision policy and slow growth on business impacted the fee income. Notably, the moratorium book has declined to 9.7% from ~26% earlier, which is a positive. With a decent CRAR (CET1 of 13.5%) the bank is well capitalised and plans for additional capital raise. If these plans fructify, it will help improve the capital base and augur well for the bank.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a revised price target (PT) of Rs. 585.

Emkay Global Financial's report on AXIS Bank

In Q4, Axis Bank did heavy lifting in terms of Covid-19-related contingent provisions and reported a loss, but it returned to profitability in Q1 with Rs11bn in PAT despite reserving interest on potentially stressed loans and accelerating specific PCR as a prudent measure. The bank has adopted a conservative stance in extending the moratorium in Phase 2 (June’20) with a low moratorium rate of 9.7% and initiate collections. The collection rate is 72% in the book under the Phase 1 moratorium (25-28% of loans) and the rest is either part of the Phase 2 book (9.7% of loans) or in the SMA 1 pool, which may lead to higher NPAs in Q2 instead of deferring it for a prolonged period. The bank now carries a high specific PCR at 75%, at par with HDFCB and ICICI, while contingent provisioning buffer is far higher at 1.2% of loans. Its CET 1 stands at 13.5%, and has approval in place to raise Rs150bn to shore up the capital buffer.



Outlook

We like Axis’ increasingly prudent stance in the wake of the ensuing asset quality storm, but it needs to keep the frequent management rejig in check. We retain Hold/OW stance in EAP, with a TP of Rs520 (valuing core bank at 1.4x FY22ABV + subs value of Rs21).

YES Securities' research report on Axis Bank

Strong operating performance adjusted for conservative changes in accounting policies in areas of fee and expenditure recognition, provisioning for std. investments and red flagged accounts and NII reserving on std. advances. Bur for the impact of these changes, the reported PPOP and PAT would have been 12% and 240% higher than our estimate. Conservatism was also reflected in the bank adding Rs7.3bn to its contingent provisions balance which now stands at 1.2% of std. adv. and raising PCR on NPLs by 6 ppt. Axis Bank accreted capital during the quarter as the incremental asset growth was driven by high-rated corporate lending and investments. Portfolio under moratorium stands at ~10% in second phase. Morat book largely comprises retail customers who had opted for first moratorium. Retail morat portfolio in majority represents secured loans (HL & LAP) and ETB customers with prime bureau scores. On the first morat portfolio (not taken/offered second morat), the collection rate is 70-80%.



Outlook

Upgrading reco from ADD to BUY. Resilient PPOP, sizeable provisioning buffer, announced capital raise and reduction in morat pool to soften the Covid impact in coming quarters. Expect sharp recovery in RoA/RoE during FY22 as growth and credit cost near normalizes. Core bank trades at 1.3x FY22E P/ABV; valuation more sensitive to FY22 outcomes and not FY21.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis bank’s earnings of Rs11.1bn was inline (PLe:10.9bn) mainly driven by NII growth of 19.5% YoY and relatively lower provisioning. Important data point to note was trackable moratorium book was only 9% of loans v/s 25-28% in last quarter with basic difference that morat 2.0 was on selected basis v/s opt out in most business segments. Bank has collected for 80% of customer from morat 1.0 which is basically on June dues as Mar-May have been adjusted in respective tenures, while the rest 20% are being collected or will move according to dpd. Tail risks are high from Morat 2.0, few collections from morat 1.0 and those have been given adjustments in tenure due to moratorium, hence we keep our slippage for FY21/FY22 intact at 2.2% and ~210bps of core credit cost. ~1200bps of PCR improvement from last year gives us good comfort now.



Outlook

Retain HOLD with revised TP of Rs480 (from Rs475) based on 1.5x Mar-22 ABV.

Dolat Capital's research report on Axis Bank

Despite weaker other income, PPoP growth was better than expected aided by higher NII growth at 20% YoY and decline in opex. Though slippages were low at 1.6% owing to moratorium, higher credit costs at 250 bps was mainly led by rise in PCR to 75% (from 69%) and incremental provisions of ~90% on net slippages. Apart from weak loan originations, fee income was also impacted by change in accounting policy where the bank is now amortizing upfront fee from debit cards/LCs. Sharp decline in moratorium levels to 9.7% from 26% was mainly led by approval based approach. We like the bank for its lower asset side risks (holds true for all large banks), improving risk practices, and gradual strengthening of its liability profile.



Outlook

However, risks of delay in normalization in corporate stress pool and increase in retail/SME NPAs remain. We maintain our ACCUMULATE rating with TP of Rs520, valuing the bank at 1.7x FY22E P/ABV.

Axis Bank reported an 18.8 percent year-on-year decline in standalone profit for the June quarter, impacted by lower other income and higher provisions. Profit during the quarter declined to Rs 1,112.17 crore compared to Rs 1,370.08 crore in the corresponding period last year.

The net interest income (NII) grew by 19.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,985.3 crore in the quarter, with strong loan growth of 17 percent (including TLTRO investments) and deposits growth of 19 percent on quarterly average basis (QAB).

Asset quality has seen improvement on sequential and yearly basis. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of gross advances declined 14 bps QoQ to 4.72 percent and net NPAs dropped 33 bps QoQ to 1.23 percent in June quarter 2020.Here are the highlights of Axis Bank's analyst call on earnings, compiled by Narnolia Financial Advisors:

Management Participants: Amitabh Chaudhary, MD & CEO, Puneet Sharma- CFO

The bank's NII reserving has been done on standard assets and is not related to a specific asset and the bank will continue to evaluate the situation and make future reserves. NII reserving is done as prudent provisions to cover the reversal that may happen in the future.

The bank's moratorium book at the end of the quarter stands at 9.7 percent in terms of value and includes retail MFI portion, which is 0.5 percent of the book and out of them, 67 percent was paid in June.

A large part of the moratorium is retail, out of which 78 percent are secured and a large part of them are existing customers and the historical default rate is low and 70 percent of the customers are bureau prime scores, they said.

In the mortgages segment, nearly 80 percent of the customers are with ready properties, which reduce the concentration risk and more than 77 percent have LTV less than 75 percent and 90 percent of the mortgage customers have bureau vintage of more than three years.

In the unsecured book, a large part of the customers are salaried and existing bank customers with a low default rate; 95 percent of the credit card customers have zero DPD and 90 percent have bureau vintage for more than 12 months.

The bank's management further said, ""Collections from Moratorium 1 customers have been over 80 percent in corporate and around 70 percent in retail in the month of June, in retail, collection from non-moratorium customers have been over 95 percent. Customers worth value of Rs 4,600 crore paid in June despite opting for the moratorium and are not part of 9.7 percent.""

The management said that 81 percent of the retail book is secured as of Q1FY21 with 67 percent of credit card customers salaried.

The bank has been cautious in its small and medium enterprise portfolio, which is reflected in reducing of SME portfolio by 10 percent over the last one year with 87 percent of the book which is SME 3 or better and 88 percent is secured and balance is supply chain finance with linkages to large and well-rated corporates. LTV is 67 percent in home loan business and in LAP in 37 percent, they added.

The management said the wholesale banking book has seen tightening of standards over the year and 82 percent of the book has rating of A- and better, 95 percent of the incremental advance in last 12 months was in A- and above category with 75 percent in AA- and above category. Exposure to top 20 borrowers has reduced from 110 percent to 102 percent.

Axis Bank had 9.7 percent of its loans under moratorium at the end of the April-June quarter. It may be a coincidence that HDFC Bank, another large private sector bank, too, had similar loan moratorium figures.

These numbers point to a trend--larger private banks have clearly taken a more cautious approach in extending the second round of loan relief to customers.

The fall in moratorium book could be due to two reasons. One, banks are not extending the moratorium to all customers. Two, a lesser number of customers approached their banks for EMI deferrals in the second round.

In the fourth quarter of the last fiscal, Axis Bank had said about a quarter of its loan book was under moratorium (25-28 per cent). The value of moratorium loans substantially declined at the end of the first quarter of the financial year 2020-21.

Also, an extra cautious approach is visible against coronavirus uncertainties in the future. This is reflected in a substantial increase in additional provisions. Provisioning is the money set aside by banks under the Reserve Bank of India norms to cover likely losses in problematic loan accounts.

Additional provisions held by Axis Bank now stand at Rs 6,898 crore, which is well above RBI’s norms.

That it is well-prepared for the COVID-shock was emphasised by the bank in its interaction with media. It said that the additional provisions were over and above the NPA provisioning included in PCR (provision coverage ratio) calculations and the 0.4 percent standard asset provisioning requirement.

“The overall additional provisions held by the bank towards various contingencies together with the standard asset provisions, translate to a standard asset coverage of 1.56 per cent at June 30, 2020,” the bank said.

This is both good and bad news for investors. The good news is the bank refusing to lower guard against the coronavirus-shock and being cautious both on moratorium loans and provisioning. The bad news is that despite all the precautions if the coronavirus crisis prolongs, a sizeable chunk of moratorium loans can turn bad.

In a conference call after the results, the management said most of the moratorium loans in the second round were retail loans. These could be risky in a prolonged economic downturn when job losses tend to be rampant.

The impact will be similar to smaller companies. In the conference call, Axis Bank management repeated that in the small and medium enterprises (SME) space, fresh lending was extended to only top rated companies.

SMEs are most vulnerable in the present climate, as their business has been hit and these firms typically have a weak cash buffer for a crisis compared to the bigger players.

Axis Bank’s approach to COVID-19 provisioning is in line with the industry. HDFC Bank, which has a similar moratorium loan level (9 per cent), has set aside floating provisions of Rs 1,451 crore and contingent provisions of Rs 4,002 crore as on June 30.

Total provisions (comprising specific, floating, contingent and general provisions) were 149 percent of the gross non-performing loans as on June 30. Large non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), too, are being cautious. Bajaj Finance, for instance, has increased COVID-19 provisions to Rs 2,350 crore as on June 30. This is about 11 percent of the total moratorium book.

In the Q1 result presentation, Axis Banks said 82 per cent of its corporate book was rated A- and above, with 96 percent of incremental sanctions in Q1 to corporates rated A- and above. It also said, as mentioned above, only high-quality SME borrowers are getting preference.

To sum up, the bank has done all the right things to guard against the coronavirus shock but much will depend on how the economy shapes up.",626,-0.5678673055436876

Axis Bank share price rose 8 percent in the early trade on July 22 after the company reported its first quarter earnings.

The company has reported an 18.8 percent year-on-year decline in standalone profit for the June quarter to Rs 1,112.17 crore compared to Rs 1,370.08 crore in the corresponding period last year.

Net interest income (NII) grew by 19.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,985.3 crore in the quarter, with strong loan growth of 17 percent (including TLTRO investments) and deposits growth of 19 percent on a quarterly average basis (QAB).

The private lender's savings account deposits grew 15 percent YoY, current account deposits 8 percent and retail term deposits (RTD) were up 27 percent on QAB basis while including TLTRO (Targeted Long Term Repo Operations) investments, corporate loans grew 26 percent and retail loans 16 percent.

Also Read - Axis Bank Q1 profit falls 19% to Rs 1,112 crore, NII grows 19.5%; slippages decline

Here's what brokerages are saying about the stock and the company:

Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Raises to Rs 550 from Rs 450

The company’s Q1 results were relatively healthy despite a sharp decline in loans under moratorium. The management is conservative on both provisioning and accounting. Its slippages contained at 1.4 percent, aided by the moratorium, BB & below book.

The moratorium moderation share will help to ease asset quality concerns. Its CET was at 13.5 percent which is comfortable and the company is likely to raise buffers, reported CNBC-TV18.

CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Raised to Rs 600 from Rs 580

The Q1 results were better than muted expectations on PPoP and asset quality. The moratorium of 9.7 percent may not include some stressed loans and expect the bank to deliver 14 percent RoEs by FY23.

The capital raise of Rs 12,000 crore will lead to 180 bps accretion to CET-1 in FY21, reported CNBC-TV18.

Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Raised to Rs 550 from Rs 530

The moratorium was down reasonably, but collections are key to watch. Its Q1 profit was down 19 percent YoY, but ahead of the estimates. The key positive was a fall in moratorium loans from 30 percent to 10 percent.

CASA grew well, but debit-card additions are still low. The slippages a tad higher than Jefferies estimates at 1.8% of past year loans. It see some pressure on NIMs with a rise in share of corporate loans, reported CNBC-TV18.

Citi | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 500

The company continues to build the buffer, while there was a sharp fall in moratorium. Citi like that the bank is being conservative & continue to build provisioning buffer. The slowing loan growth, low NIM & elevated credit costs will keep the profitability low, reported CNBC-TV18.

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Hold | Target: Rs 480

Axis bank’s earnings of Rs 11.1 bn was inline (PLe: 10.9bn) mainly driven by NII growth of 19.5 percent YoY and relatively lower provisioning. The important data point to note was trackable moratorium book was only 9 percent of loans versus 25-28 percent in last quarter with basic difference that moratorium 2.0 was on selected basis v/s opt-out in most business segments.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 600

Axis Bank reported in-line 1QFY21 earnings led by strong NII growth, controlled opex and sequential decline in provisions. Even PCR improved 580bp QoQ to 75 percent. Outstanding funded BB & below pool declined slightly to Rs 64.2 b while moratorium book plummeted to 9.7 percent, which eased concerns on the asset quality outlook.

The country's third-largest private sector lender Axis Bank has reported an 18.8 percent year-on-year decline in standalone profit for the June quarter, impacted by lower other income and higher provisions.

Profit during the quarter declined to Rs 1,112.17 crore compared to Rs 1,370.08 crore in the corresponding period last year.

Net interest income (NII) grew by 19.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,985.3 crore in the quarter, with a strong loan growth of 17 percent (including TLTRO investments) and deposits growth of 19 percent on quarterly average basis (QAB).

The private lender's savings account deposits grew 15 percent YoY, current account deposits 8 percent and retail term deposits (RTD) were up 27 percent on QAB basis, while including TLTRO (Targeted Long Term Repo Operations) investments, corporate loans grew 26 percent and retail loans 16 percent.

Other income or non-interest income (comprising fee, trading profit and miscellaneous income) for Q1FY21 declined 33.1 percent to Rs 2,587 crore YoY as fee income fell 38 percent YoY to Rs 1,651 crore, the bank said. The bank attributed the decline in fees to lower business volumes and velocity of throughput of transactions.

Pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) declined 0.8 percent to Rs 5,844.4 crore compared to the corresponding quarter of the last fiscal.

""Adjusted for accounting policy changes and NII reserves created during the quarter, NII, operating profit and PAT for the quarter would have been Rs 7,100 crore, Rs 6,151 crore and Rs 1,626 crore, respectively, growing by 22 percent, 4 percent and 19 percent YoY, respectively,"" Axis Bank said in its BSE filing.

Asset quality has seen improvement on sequential as well as yearly basis. Gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances declined 14 bps QoQ to 4.72 percent and net NPAs dropped 33 bps QoQ to 1.23 percent in June quarter 2020.

Axis Bank said it recognised slippages of Rs 2,218 crore during Q1FY21, compared to Rs 3,920 crore in Q4FY20.

""Slippages from the loan book were at Rs 2,011 crore and that from investment exposures stood at Rs 207 crore. Corporate slippages stood at Rs 1,355 crore. Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs during the quarter were Rs 608 crore while write-offs were Rs 2,284 crore,"" it added.

Provisions and contingencies were higher by 15.8 percent to Rs 4,416.42 crore at the end of June quarter 2020, but were lower by 42.9 percent compared to the March quarter.

The bank said it had made incremental provisions of Rs 733 crores in Q1 FY21 towards COVID-19. ""In June 2020, the bank holds in aggregate additional provisions of Rs 6,898 crore. It is pertinent to note that this is over and above the NPA provisioning included in our PCR calculations, and the 0.4 percent standard asset provisioning requirement on standard assets.""",468,0.06572975052727593

Axis Bank, the country's third largest private sector lender, is expected to return to profit in June quarter 2020 compared to March quarter, but on a year-on-year basis, there could be double-digit decline in profits.

The bank had reported a loss of Rs 1,387.78 crore in March quarter 2020.

Higher provisions, lower other income and decline in pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) may impact profitability during the quarter YoY.

""The profitability of the bank is expected to come down on account of lower fee income, moderation in advance growth and bank guiding for material increase in provisioning,"" said Narnolia Financial Services.

According to brokerages, net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, is expected to be around 14-16 percent higher year-on-year with focus on retail segment and stable net interest margin.

""We expect loan growth at 13 percent YoY with greater focus on retail; NIM unchanged QoQ at 3.5 percent (led by loan composition and funding costs),"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees profit declining 27.5 percent, NII 14 percent and PPoP 5 percent YoY.

HDFC Securities Institutional Research also sees 14 percent YoY loan growth and 16 percent increase in NII.

""Stable NIMs are expected to drive core earnings growth of 16 percent YoY. Drop in non-interest income (with muted core fees and higher recoveries in base quarter), will result in PPoP de-growth of 11 percent YoY and 10 percent QoQ),"" the brokerage said.

Axis Bank's asset quality is expected to improve and slippages are likely to fall on sequential basis in Q1.

""Asset quality of the bank is expected to be largely stable with moratorium being extended. However the trend going forward into Q3FY21 will be important to track,"" Narnolia said.

Remember, the six-month moratorium period on loans will end on August 31.

""We expect slippages of around Rs 2,500 crore (around 2 percent of loans) mostly from 'below investment grade book' but loans currently in moratorium. We expect gross NPLs to decline QoQ due to lower slippages. Moratorium should decline meaningfully for the bank,"" Kotak said.",357,-0.3393507540225983

Technical View

The share price logged a resolute breakout from the last three months triangular consolidation pattern indicating conclusion of corrective trend, auguring well for structural turnaround. Thereby offering fresh entry opportunity. Over the past three months consolidation phase the stock has seen strong volume of more than double of the 50 weeks average volume of 9 cr. share per week highlighting accumulation and larger participation at support area Based on the above technical observations we expect the stock resume up move and head towards Rs 508 levels in the coming months as it the confluence of the previous major breakdown area and 50% retracement of the February – March decline (Rs 760-286) placed around Rs Rs 520 levels.

Fundamental View

Axis Bank, third largest private bank in terms of advances, offers entire spectrum of financial services to customers covering large and mid-corporates, MSME, agriculture and retail businesses. The long term focus is on loans offering higher return on risk-weighted basis and tight control on cost to enhance return ratios. In a bid to gain traction in the life insurance sector, Axis Bank has entered into a transaction with Max Financial, which post completion will become 70:30 JV in Max Life Insurance. Covid-19 and related lockdown would delay a revival in RoE. However, given healthy asset mix, liability strength, adequate capital and superior customer profile, we believe the bank is poised to face near term challenges and benefit in the phase of normalisation. Hence, we remain positive on the fundamentals of the stock.

Dolat Capital's research report on Axis Bank

The bank’s annual report analysis shows strengthening of core metrics – improving cost efficiencies, decline in NFB exposures, better capital consumption (decline in RWA/total assets), rise in PPoP/assets (even ex of treasury gains), declining concentration in deposits and advances, and reduced exposure to vulnerable sectors. Despite highest branch openings in a year during FY20, opex/assets and CI ratios improved during the year owing to branch size optimization and cross sell opportunities. However, corporate book was back to making loss after reporting a profit in FY19 owing to elevated slippages & credit costs, with incremental NPAs mainly coming from the SME (trade) and FI sector. While the several initiatives implemented under the bank’s GPS strategy including RoROC based loan pricing, leveraging on the one-Axis strategy, strong liability focus, and strengthening digital and analytics have helped the bank be in a better position, the onset of COVID-19 is likely to defer normalization in RoE.

Outlook

We maintain our Accumulate recommendation with TP of Rs510, valuing the bank at 1.7x FY22E P/ABV.

Global rating firm S&P Global on July 14 applauded the decision of India banks to raise fresh capital stating that the move will provide solidity to the organisations during these rocky times and assist them to withstand the economic slump amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The rating agency said in a release that ""the large capital-raising is credit positive,"" appending that ""large capital increases across India's financial institutions support the system's stability during these rocky times.""

S&P said that the Indian banks have expressed an intention to increase equity include ICICI Bank (Rs 15,000 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 15,000 crore), Yes Bank (Rs 15,000 crore), State Bank of India (Rs 20,000 crore), Bank of Baroda (Rs 9,000 crore), and Punjab National Bank (Rs 7,000 crore.

Kotak Mahindra Bank and IDFC First Bank are other banks that recently issued substantial amounts of capital.

""We believe top-tier Indian private sector banks are adequately capitalised,"" said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Michael Puli.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

They are raising further capital to strengthen their balance sheets, unlike state-owned banks, which generally have only small buffers over regulatory capital, he said.

""We expect large private sector banks, State Bank of India and a few other major public sector banks to be able to raise capital relatively easily,"" the release said adding that Yes Bank's follow-on public equity offer at a huge discount to the market price shows that the banks are willing to go the extra mile as well to get sufficient capital.

Further, S&P Global Ratings projected non-performing loans to shoot up to 13-14 per cent of the total loans in the current financial year, from an estimated 8.5 per cent in 2019-20.

It also said credit costs may rise to about 3.7 per cent of average loans in 2020-21.

""This cost should drop to 2 per cent in fiscal 2022, but this would still be above the 15-year average of 1.5 per cent,"" it said.

According to the release, most Indian public sector banks improved their capitalisation last year, which should provide some support.

The common equity tier-1 (CET1) ratio of public sector banks (PSBs) was 10.1 per cent as of December 31, 2019, higher than the regulatory requirement of 8 per cent (including a capital conservation buffer).

Similarly, PSB' tier-1 capital adequacy ratio was 11.1 per cent, higher than the regulatory requirement of 7 per cent, it said.

The agency expects that government-owned banks in India in aggregate will be able to absorb the estimated credit losses without breaching the regulatory minimum, but these banks need capital to grow.

""In our base case where we have factored in 4-5 per cent credit growth for government-owned banks in the current fiscal year, we estimate these banks need additional capital of Rs 35,000 crore-Rs 40,000 crore this year,"" it said.

Some finance companies are also looking to bolster capital adequacy to address asset quality issues and improve liquidity, it said.",768,0.9184456268946329

Top five private sector banks may see their slippages double to 5 percent this fiscal due to the poor loan offtake and the moratorium-driven contraction in net interest margins, warns a report.

These five banks-- HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank--collectively control a quarter of the system and three-fourths of the private banking space, according to a report by India Ratings on Friday.

""We forecast FY21 slippages to nearly double to around 5 percent for these banks from 2.3 percent in FY19 and 2.7 percent in FY20, even though net slippages would be lower if refinancing remains a challenge, resulting in a 4 percent contraction in their net interest margin,"" says the report.

As loan demand remains tepid, banks are parking their excess liquidity in low yielding alternatives such as government bonds and top-rated corporate securities due to their higher credit risk perception and widening duration spreads, even as deposit inflows have been robust.

On the other hand, growth in deposits for these top five private banks in FY20 was 18.8 percent which was 18.5 percent in FY19, while loan growth declined to 15 percent from 19.1 percent during this period.

Additionally, the Reserve Bank has injected Rs 1.7 lakh crore of liquidity into the system over the last six months through open market operations and secondary market purchases.

Without quantifying, the report expects a significant spike in delinquent assets due to the deep troubles the economy is facing due to the impact of the GDP destruction on the banking sector in the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally, banks have moved a large amount of the surplus liquidity into reverse repo where the rates have declined by 215 bps in the last one year, yielding 3.35 percent and with cost of funds falling to 5-6 percent, this could result in a negative carry.

Over FY17-FY20, net advances of these five private banks and bank credit grew at a CAGR of 15.7 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively, while the unsecured retail portfolio grew at a CAGR of 21.8 percent, and these give banks have increased the proportion of unsecured retail portfolio over the same period.

Analysts at the agency also expect pre-provisioning operating profit or operating buffers of these lenders to be about 80 bps lower than their steady state pre-provisioning operating profit, which in FY20 was 4.9 percent which may curtail their ability to withstand credit costs without capital erosion, the report warned.

Analysts at the agency attributed fall in operating buffers as outcomes of lower portfolio yields due to an increase in slippages; poor loan growth and transaction volumes and the resultant lower fee and other income; slower pace of repricing for deposits reflecting the falling interest rates; and higher liquidity deployed in low earning government securities or under reverse repos.

Stating that the impact of the rising bad loans “will not be benign,” the report notes that this comes at a time when sector was putting its house in order after the last six painful years on the corporate side, even though retail, SME and agri loans were already showing up pain areas before the pandemic hit all of us.",540,-0.7744582951068878

The Bank’s SME advances stood at Rs 61,921 crores as on March 31, 2020, and constituted 11 percent of its total advances.

“During fiscal 2020, given the uncertainties on the macro-economic front and the underlying weakness in the economy, the Bank had maintained a cautious stance on SME space,” the bank said in its annual report.

SME industry has faced stress in a slowing economy. The Covid-19 lockdown added to the woes of the segment. Many SMEs have shut shop since March due to lack of demand and liquidity stress. Banks too have adopted a cautious stance while lending to SMEs fearing future loan defaults.

""The nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus - which has been extended for the third time, until 31 May - has taken a severe toll on businesses, supply chains and individual incomes. The impact for many micro and SME sectors is structural, a meaningful revival is unlikely even when the lockdown ends,"" Fitch Ratings said in a note last month.

""We assume that both consumer demand and manufacturing are likely to remain tepid... The stress is occurring across sectors, but SME and retail are likely to emerge as higher risk due to both stressed industrial activity and rising unemployment,"" the agency said.

However, banks have resumed lending following the launch of government-guaranteed Rs 3 lakh crore MSME loan scheme by Union finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman early this year. Under the scheme, banks have so have disbursed around Rs62,000 crore and sanctioned around Rs 1.2 lakh crore loans. Public sector banks have disbursed Rs 38,372 crore loans while private sector lenders have disbursed Rs23,615 crore.

At the same time, during fiscal 2020, Axis Bank’s corporate loan growth was up 11 per cent over fiscal 2019. The Bank’s domestic corporate loan book growth was strong with a Y-o-Y growth of 13 per cent, it said.

Retail banking

Also, Axis bank has grown its retail lending portfolio over the last decade with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) growth of 31 per cent over the last 10 years and currently stands at Rs 3,05,400 crores as on March 31, 2020, up 24 per cent over last year, the bank said in its annual report.

The Bank continued to increase its share of retail loans to total advances, which stood at 53 per cent as compared to 50 per cent last year.

According to the bank, while it has significantly diversified the book over the years in terms of product offerings, the book continues to remain largely secured at 80 per cent of the book with home and mortgage finance, automobile finance and loans against property being the major components of the Bank’s retail lending portfolio, it said.

These three segments constitute 35 per cent, 13 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively. The proportion of higher-yielding Retail Lending products comprising mainly of Personal Loan, Credit Card and Small Business Banking (SBB) stood at 22 per cent as on March 31, 2020.

“The growth of retail and consumer lending in India has been a consequence of growing affluence and changing consumer behaviour. Retail Lending is one of the Bank’s core growth areas,” the bank said in its annual report.

As on March 31 2020, Bank had average priority sector lending (PSL) achievement of 41.77 per cent for fiscal 2020. PSL loans refer to loans to economically weaker sections, which banks have to comply with according to RBI guidelines. The Bank has also been buying PSL certificates (PSLC) to narrow the gap between achievement and RBI mandated targets in the sub-segments. During fiscal 2020 the Bank purchased PSLCs of an aggregate amount of Rs48,321 crores at a cost of Rs611 crores, it said.

Payments business

In FY 20, Axis Bank sourced 45 per cent of credit cards through paperless digital platforms. The Bank said its focus continued on affluent segment helped improve Affluent Credit Card sourcing mix to 12 per cent of overall volumes in fiscal 2020 as compared to 9 per cent for the previous year.

Private sector lender Axis Bank plans to raise up to Rs 50,000 crore through debt securities and equity share to maintain adequate level of capital for risk weighted assets and fund business growth.

Under the proposal, Axis Bank will raise Rs 35,000 crore through debt securities in Indian or foreign currency, while Rs 15,000 crore to be raised through issuance of equity shares or securities convertible into equity shares, Axis Bank said in a regulatory filing.

The board of bank has already approved the capital mop-up.

The private sector lender said its annual general meeting (AGM) is to be held on July 31, 2020 and it will seek shareholders' approval for the proposals. The AGM will take place through video conferencing.

Keeping in view the projections of the bank in domestic and overseas operations, it may need to raise additional funds in one or more tranches in Indian as well as overseas market in the form of capital to maintain desired capital to risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) by issue of debt securities denominated in Indian rupees or any other permitted foreign currency, Axis Bank said.

The debt securities, it said, can be through instruments like long term bonds, green bonds, masala bonds, optionally/compulsorily convertible debentures, and non-convertible debentures on a private placement basis, during the period of one year, from the date of passing of this special resolution.

Axis Bank said the board of directors will seek to obtain permission of shareholders for borrowing/raising funds of ""an amount not exceeding Rs 35,000 crore, on a private placement basis"".

The said limit of Rs 35,000 crores will be within the overall borrowing limit of Rs 2,00,000 crore as approved by the members in June 2018, it said.

On the equity fund raise, it said the bank has grown consistently over the last several years. Since the last equity capital raised by the bank in 2019, the business of the lender has continued to grow across various business lines.

Regulatory requirements for equity capital continue to increase with the adoption of Basel III requirements by the Reserve Bank of India.

As on March 31, 2020, the bank's common equity Tier I (CET 1) ratio was 13.34 percent.

Regulatory requirements for equity capital continue to increase with the adoption of Basel III requirements by the Reserve Bank of India.

As per this roadmap, the minimum CET 1 ratio has increase to 8 percent, with effect from September 30, 2020.

Axis Bank said COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted many businesses across the country and a stronger capital base will further strengthen its ability to deal with unanticipated contingencies or market disruptions which may arise due to the pandemic.

""Lending opportunities for the well capitalised banks continue to be strong, and the relative competitive position of the Bank in the sector continues to strengthen as well.

""As macro-economic growth improves from current levels, to support the growth aspirations of the Bank, and to meet increasing regulatory requirements, it is important that the bank remains well-capitalised, with a strong CET 1 capital base,"" it said.

In order to further strengthen CET 1 ratio and be well placed to deal with the COVID-impact on business from a position of strength, while ensuring that there is capital to support growth as the economy revives, the bank proposes to raise equity capital of not exceeding Rs 15,000 crore, it added.

It said the board in the AGM will seek permission of members to create, offer, issue and allot with or without green shoe option, such number of equity shares, and/or equity shares through depository receipts, and/or securities convertible into equity shares or any other instrument or securities representing equity shares by way of a private placement, including qualified institutions placement (QIP).

S&P Global Ratings on Friday lowered its ratings on Axis Bank due to increased economic risks for banks operating in India.

S&P also put Indian Bank ratings on 'Credit Watch' because it expects a high risk that the public sector bank's credit profile could weaken over the coming quarters due to COVID-19 as well as the merger with the weaker Allahabad Bank.

""We lowered our ratings on Axis to reflect our expectation that heightened economic risks facing India's banking system will affect the bank's asset quality and financial performance. While Axis' asset quality is superior to the Indian banking sector average, its level of non-performing assets (NPAs) will likely remain high compared to international peers',"" S&P said.

It expects the bank to maintain its strong market position and adequate capitalisation. The stable outlook reflects our view that our ratings on Axis already factor in some deterioration in the bank's asset quality and performance over the next 12 months.

The agency said economic conditions have turned adverse for Indian banks due to COVID-19 and drastic efforts to curtail the spread of the virus have resulted in a sharp economic contraction.

""The government's stimulus package, with a headline amount of 10 per cent of GDP, has about 1.2 per cent of direct stimulus measures, which is low relative to countries with similar economic impacts from the pandemic. The remaining 8.8 percent of the package includes liquidity support measures and credit guarantees that will not directly support growth,"" S&P added.

It has forecast a 5 percent contraction in the economy in fiscal 2021.

S&P expects tough operating conditions to lead to a rise in non-performing loans (NPLs), credit costs, and delays in recoveries for the banking system.

""In our base case, we expect the weak assets of Indian banks to shoot up to 13 -14 percent of gross loans by March 31, 2021. Our forecast is higher than the peak of 11.6 percent witnessed in fiscal 2018, and about 8.5 percent estimated as on March 31, 2020,"" S&P said.

The agency said it anticipates the resolution of weak assets to be delayed until at least fiscal 2022. Consequently, banks will likely be saddled with a large stock of weak loans in fiscal 2022 too.

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) has directed Axis Bank and National Stock Exchange to maintain status quo in a matter pertaining to release of certain securities by the private lender, directed by NSE. The tribunal will hear the matter again on July 3, according to a SAT order.

The interim order came on an appeal by Axis Bank against a direction by the NSE to release certain securities.

Axis Bank filed the appeal in the capacity of a professional clearing member who cleared the trading of Modex International Securities Ltd.

Axis bank contended that orders passed by NSE are ""illegal and arbitrary"" as it directs it to release certain securities for which the lender is the actual owner since those securities have been legally transferred to its account.

It further said that the order passed by Sebi in April 2020 against Modex, which is claimed to be the authorizing order based on which the NSE has passed the directions, does not even contain any direction against the lender.

The SAT has also directed Axis Bank, Modex International Securities, Sebi and others to appear before NSE on June 24.

""Based on the database of NSE and other parties rights in respect of the securities in question shall be reconciled/determined within one week thereafter,"" the SAT order said.

In its plea, Axis Bank said that it had submitted a list of securities to NSE in January, 2020 stating that those securities are given by clients of Modex and have dues pending in favour of Modex. Therefore, Axis Bank sought to liquidate the shares contained in that list to enable it to recover its entitled amount of Rs 21.62 crore and thereafter the remaining securities can be transferred.

""Therefore, the impugned directions by NSE ... do not have any legal basis to arbitrarily transfer the securities rightfully belonging to the appellant (Axis Bank) to certain third parties,"" the lender said.

The lender sought intervention of tribunal to stay the orders as well as to allow it to dispose of the securities worth Rs 21.62 crore and then release the remaining securities given by Modex to Axis Bank.

On the other hand, counsels of markets watchdog Sebi and NSE stressed that Axis Bank is holding securities worth more than Rs 90 crores given by Modex and the direction is relating to only securities worth Rs 34 crore.

Even assuming that the lender's entitlement is about Rs 22 crore, it is still holding excess securities which legitimately do not belong to it.

Since the impugned directions are not yet implemented Axis Bank is actually holding on to about Rs 70 crore worth securities legitimately belonging to others, they said.",456,

Fitch Ratings on June 22 revised the outlook on State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, and six other banks to Negative from Stable in line with rating changes to India's sovereign outlook due to the coronavirus impact.

The rating agency revised the outlook for Export-Import Bank of India (EXIM), SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of Baroda (New Zealand), Bank of India, Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank while affirming their ratings.

At the same time, Fitch has affirmed IDBI Bank (IDBI) rating, while maintaining the outlook at negative.

""The rating actions follow Fitch's revision of the outlook on the 'BBB-' rating on India to negative from stable on June 18, 2020, due to the impact of the escalating coronavirus pandemic on India's economy,"" it said in a statement.

Fitch said the ratings of all the nine Indian banks are support-driven and anchored to their respective sovereign country rating. ""They are based on Fitch's assessment of high to moderate probability of extraordinary state support for these banks, which takes into account our assessment of the sovereign's ability and propensity to provide extraordinary support.""

The negative outlook on India's sovereign rating, it said, reflects an increasing strain on the state's ability to provide extraordinary support, due to the sovereign's limited fiscal space and the significant deterioration in fiscal metrics due to challenges from COVID-19 pandemic.

""The rating action does not affect the banks' Viability Ratings (VRs),"" it said. ""EXIM does not have a VR as its role as a policy bank makes an assessment of its standalone credit profile less meaningful.""

While EXIM is of high strategic and systemic importance due to its unique policy role, SBI is the largest Indian bank with nearly 25 per cent market share in system assets and deposits.

SBI is 57.9 per cent state-owned and has a much broader policy role than peers.

""SBI is highly likely to receive extraordinary state support, if required, due to its very high systemic importance,"" it said.

For ICICI and AXIS Bank, Fitch said it expects a moderate probability of extraordinary state support for these banks, due to their systemic importance, market position and private ownership.

""The probability of extraordinary state support for the two large private banks will be lower than for large state banks, which are likely to have priority due to the sovereign's constrained finances,"" the agency said.

The other banks whose outlook was lowered too have ""high systemic importance"" stemming from their significant market share, majority government ownership and role in policy lending.

On keeping outlook unchanged for IDBI, it said this reflects expectation that the state's propensity to provide extraordinary support to IDBI may diminish following the government's proposal to sell its stake in the bank and dispose of part of its stake in the lender's majority shareholder, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC).

Pralay Mondal, executive director of Axis Bank in charge of retail banking, has resigned, the bank informed the stock exchanges on June 15.

""This is to inform you that Pralay Mondal, Executive Director (Retail Banking) of the Bank, has today informed the Bank that he would like to pursue other career opportunities and as such has resigned from the services of the Bank, with effect from the close of business hours on Monday, 14th September 2020,"" the bank said.

Prior to Axis, Mondal had stints with different banks in leadership roles.

The private sector lender is looking at share sale via qualified institutional placement (QIP) or rights issue or a follow on public offering (FPO), said a report by The Economic Times.

“It is still early days…route will depend on valuations we get. Investment bankers will meet on June 5 to take stock of the issue,” one source told the paper. A date is not yet set, they added.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

On the preferred route, a second source said it would depend on how investors respond as they cannot charge a premium for QIP while the bank’s stock price is “not great”. QIP is the fastest method of fundraising.

""A FPO will allow us to charge a premium but since it is a public issue it will need more time and compliance. So we will have to weigh our options,"" they added.

The source added that their pitch would be a “ready bank with all vectors in place” in a growing market. The report said that the bank is hopeful that investors will “look to the future, ignore the past”.

“We will need to be sure that we can pull off a minimum amount or get commitments from investors before we go ahead,"" said a source quoted in the report.

A staggering 1.3 billion UPI transactions originated from SBI in the first four months of 2020. Origination means customers have used an SBI bank account to make these payments. The payment may have been done through the SBI app or any other third party app like Google Pay.

In the same four months, Axis Bank originated close to 450 million transactions, followed by HDFC Bank (427 million), Paytm Payments Bank (386 million) and ICICI Bank (340 million).

SBI recorded 350 million transactions in February, the highest in the last four months. In January it carried out 347 million transactions. In March, this fell slightly to 338 million. In April, this slipped to 298 million transactions, when the entire country was under a strict lockdown due to the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic.

UPI is an interbank digital payments mechanism which allows consumers to make payments through smartphones, either by transferring money to another UPI ID or by scanning QR codes. Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, Yes Bank, HDFC Bank and Paytm Payments Bank are the largest banks in this space, data shows. In May, UPI recorded 1.2 billion transactions supporting the transfer of Rs 2.2 lakh crore.

“UPI has ensured that any bank account holder can easily participate in digital payments, irrespective of that bank’s digital capabilities. Third-party UPI apps have made payments both inter-person and merchant payments seamless using a bank account of the customer’s choice,” said Deepak Abbott, who was previously a Senior Vice-President at Paytm.

While Yes Bank has been one of the major players in UPI, it has mostly seen transactions coming into its bank accounts. That means consumers have paid Yes Bank account holders.

“This has happened because they have acquired merchants for digital payments very aggressively who would have received these transactions. Historically, Yes Bank has been one of the leaders in merchant payments on UPI,” said a senior banker on the condition of anonymity.

Yes Bank recorded more than 573 million such transactions. A bulk of this could be merchant payments. NPCI did not offer any separate distinction between merchant transactions and person-to-person transactions.

Among popular third-party payment apps Google Pay, Paytm and PhonePe are the major competitors vying for a share of the UPI payments pie. Facebook-owned WhatsApp Payments is also set to go live on UPI soon. It all depends on the instant messaging app submitting data localisation plans for NPCI and Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) consideration.

NPCI data showed that in terms of transaction success rates, Axis Bank has shown highest success rate in April at 96 percent, followed by ICICI Bank around 95 percent. Banks consistently have shown upwards of 90 percent transaction success rates.",481,0.03161397576332092

Axis Bank will later add other departments like risk and corporate credit and eventually roll out the model for all its employees in the next six weeks.

“While COVID-19 has posed a lot of challenges, it has also opened up new approaches to work.

Axis Bank posted mixed numbers for Q4FY2020. While operating results were in line, elevated provisions (especially provisions related to the COVID-19 impact) caused the bank to post a loss. We believe that while Axis Bank’s is being prudent, the COVID-19 impact is likely to impact both growth and credit costs for the banking sector including Axis Bank.

Fitch Ratings on Thursday downgraded the viability ratings (VR) of State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and Axis Bank to 'bb' from 'bb+' on account of deteriorating operating environment for banks amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The global rating agency also downgraded Bank of Baroda's (BOB) VR by one notch to 'bb-', from 'bb'.

The agency affirmed the long-term issuer default ratings (IDR) of SBI and BOB at 'BBB-' and those of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at 'BB+'.

The outlook for all the four banks has been kept as stable.

""The rating actions are driven by rapid deterioration in the operating environment for banks in the country following the coronavirus pandemic and measures to contain its spread,"" the agency said.

For SBI and BOB, the VR downgrades reflect the heightened risks that weakening asset quality will pose to their less-than-satisfactory loss-absorption buffers.

""We expect SBI's and BOB's financial performances to worsen, although their asset-quality problems may not materialise until the effects of the 90-day regulatory moratorium on impaired loans recognition wear off,"" it said.

The VR downgrades of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank highlight heightened risks to their asset qualities and earnings from the disruption in business and consumer activity, which the rating agency expects to continue well beyond the lockdown in the country.

Besides these banks, the rating agency also affirmed IDRs of Punjab National Bank (PNB), Bank of India (BOI) and Canara Bank at 'BBB-', with stable outlooks.

The viability rating of PNB has been affirmed at 'b' and that of Canara Bank at 'bb-'.

Private sector lender Axis Bank on April 28 posted net loss of Rs 1,387.78 crore for January-March quarter 2020, largely impacted by spike in provisions. However, higher other income, pre-provision operating profit and NII limited the loss.

The bank had reported a profit of Rs 1,505.06 crore in the same quarter the previous year and Rs 1,757 crore in the previous quarter.

Net interest income during the quarter rose 19.3 percent to Rs 6,807.74 crore compared to the corresponding period last year.

Axis Bank expects fee income growth to slow down and provisions to increase in FY21. ""Further downgrades are expected in BB & Below book during FY21.""

Advances grew 15 percent YoY to Rs 5,71,424 crore as on March 2020, while retail loans rose 24 percent YoY to Rs 3,05,400 crore (which accounted for 53 percent of the net advances) and corporate loan book growth at 11 percent YoY to Rs 2,04,103 crore.

Here are the highlights from the Axis Bank's Q4FY20 earnings call as compiled by Narnolia Financial Advisors:

Management Participant: Amitabh Chaudhary - MD & CEO

Customers opting for moratorium currently are around 10-12 percent in number and by value approximately 25-28 percent. The 2/3 unsecured retail customers have enough money to pay but they are conserving liquidity.

During the quarter, the bank has made provisions of Rs 7,730 crore including Rs 3,000 crore of contingent provisions related to COVID-19; taking the overall additional provisions held by the bank in the balance sheet to 5,983 crore.

If the moratorium was taken only on NPA the provision on moratorium required would only be Rs 73 crore, if taken at all greater than 0 days overdue requirement would be Rs 560 crore. The cumulative COVID-19 provision was Rs 3,000 crore in additional to that Rs 475 crore provision was on account of not taking RBI dispensation OF June 7 circular.

Due to RBI relaxation on asset quality standstill slippages were Rs 691 crore lower, provisions were Rs 340 crore lower, GNPA/NNPA were lower by 11 bps/6 bps.

Retail unsecured portfolio stands at 20 percent of the retail book out of which 82 percent is from salaried segment which has very low default rate and 80 percent of the borrowers are existing customers of the bank. 67 percent of the salaried customers are from premium multinational companies, corporates.

All of the incremental wholesale book growth in FY20 has come from the AAA and AA rated clients and book has also been diversified with loans to outside top 10 sectors. 80 percent of the wholesale book now has rating of A- and better, the 95 percent of the incremental advances last year were in the A- and above category. Exposure to top 20 borrowers as percentage of tier 1 capital has come down to below 90 percent.

In respect to commercial banking portfolio 85 percent of the portfolio is secured and majority of the balance is supply chain finance to well rated corporate. Book is spread across 120 locations and 35 broad sectors.

Fee income growth is expected to slow down and provisions are expected to increase and further downgrades are expected in BB & Below book during FY21.

The deal between the bank and the Max Financial is subject to approval of regulatory authority.

Bank has reviewed its international book and has identified some stressed assets there, but all the exposure is part of BB and book. Bank over last one year has either shutdown or is in process of shutting down the Hong Kong, Shanghai, Colombo and now in process of shutting UK office.

Bank has not given moratorium to any NBFC nor has it been approached barring MFI classified as NBFC.

On the SME side 85 percent of the book was SME 3 or better.

India has had the strictest lockdown with no major fiscal support like other countries, said Chaudhry, adding that it will take 6-9 quarters for revival of the economy.

""We know that the lockdown will take time to get lifted, we know that the economic activity will take a lot of time to come back to normal. In that scenario, it is almost a given that a number of corporates and individuals will go through a severe stress and some will become non-performing,"" Chaudhry told CNBC-TV18.

The private sector lender on April 28 reported a surprising loss of Rs 1,388 crore for the quarter ending March 31, as provisions rose sharply compared to a year ago.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Despite a healthy 19 percent net interest income growth over the last year, 15 percent growth in its loan growth, and a 17 percent rise in operating profit, the bank posted a loss because it set aside Rs 7,730 crore as provisions and contingencies in Q4 FY20 against only Rs 2,711 crore during the previous year.

The steep rise in provision is partially due to COVID-19 related uncertainties, and a clear indicator of the times ahead.

The CEO said that the retail part of the business was practically shut and that no one is borrowing.

Jefferies

The research house has maintained a buy call with a target price of Rs 530 per share, reported CNBC-TV18.

Performance of moratorium book is the key as it forms 25 percent of overall loans. The FY21 PAT will be weak on higher credit costs and weaker topline.

However, the key cushion for earnings is in its buffer provisions, while a strong deposit franchise and well-capitalised balance sheet can help return to growth in FY22.

CLSA

The bank has reported decent operating performance as loans grew 15 percent YoY, while the loss of Rs 1,400 crore was due to a higher provision for buffer, reported CNBC-TV18.

It has maintained a buy rating with target at Rs 595. The deal with Max Financial is positive, CLSA added.

It has lowered its loan & fee growth assumptions marginally.

The recurring question in Axis Bank’s conference call after the announcement of fourth-quarter results on April 28 was about the management’s view on the impact of Covid-19 on business. And the answer from the top executives was largely the same throughout the call. “If you look out of the window, all you can see is that the economic activities have come to a standstill. We need to see how long this situation continues.”

Expecting bad days ahead, the bank has made a substantial provision of Rs 7,730 crore in the fourth quarter, of which Rs 3,000 crore is marked to cover the COVID-19 shock. Is this provision sufficient? The management is not committing to this question since it doesn’t know what lies ahead. The impact, the management said, depends on how soon the lockdown ends and economic activities resume. This view is largely similar across banks.

The COVID-19 has caught everyone by surprise. The extent of the impact is not known to the financial world. But analysts are curious. “The fact that the bank has made substantial COVID-19 provision in Q4, which was largely unaffected by the virus, itself shows that bank may be expecting a substantial impact in the fourth quarter,” said Siddharth Purohit, an analyst at SMC Global Securities.

That apart, a quick reading of Axis Bank’s fourth-quarter numbers shows a healthy report card. The bank has steered the ship through tumultuous waters fairly well. Bad loans have come down in the March quarter compared with the preceding three months. That the bank has posted a net loss for the quarter at Rs 1,388 crore from Rs 1,505 crore shouldn’t be a surprise given the fact that overall provisions have jumped to Rs 7,730 crore from Rs 3,471 crore in the previous three months. Of this, Rs 3,000 crore is to cover the COVID-19 shock. Look at the loan growth in deposits and loans, the figures are impressive. A 15 percent overall advances growth contributed by 24 percent jump in retail loans and a 19 percent growth in deposits augurs well for the bank. Retail loans account for more than half of the total loans (53 percent). Of the total retail loan book, only about 20 percent is unsecured book. In Q4, the total fresh slippages of the bank stood at Rs 3,920 crore from Rs 6,214 crore in the preceding quarter.

Axis Bank doesn’t worry about the Franklin Templeton meltdown. It has covered for this as part of this larger corporate loan book. About 10 percent of Axis’ customers, in terms of number, has opted for loan moratorium facility offered by the RBI as part of COVID-19 package, and 25 percent in terms of value. The growth trend in loans and deposits is largely comparable with that of HDFC Bank, which announced results last week. HDFC too had posted a healthy set of numbers logging an impressive 24.3 percent jump in its deposits and a 21.3 percent increase in advances on a year-on-year basis. The non-performing assets (NPAs) came down over the quarter.

But for banking analysts, Q4 numbers aren’t that important. All eyes are on the April-June quarter when the world will emerge out of the 40-day-long lockdown. That is when the RBI relief for borrowers, in the form of moratorium and liquidity stimulus, will come to an end. What remains healthy on the books of banks post the lockdown and what doesn’t will decide the future course for banks. Economists expect a large-scale impact on the Indian economy on account of COVID-19. The economic impact of a sharp, painful slowdown will be felt on cash flows of companies. Watch out for the Q1 numbers.",619,0.9999963641166687

Country's third-largest private sector lender Axis Bank on April 28 reported a loss of Rs 1,387.78 crore for the quarter ended March 2020, missing the estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18 which estimated profit for the quarter at Rs 1,580.1 crore.

The profitability was impacted largely due to spike in provisions, but higher other income, PPoP and NII limited the loss. The bank had reported a profit at Rs 1,505.06 crore in corresponding period last year and Rs 1,757 crore in December quarter.

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and expended, increased 19.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,807.74 crore, which was a beat compared to CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of Rs 6,560.2 crore for the quarter.

Advances grew 15 percent YoY to Rs 5,71,424 crore as on March 2020, while retail loans rose 24 percent YoY to Rs 3,05,400 crore (which accounted for 53 percent of the net advances) and corporate loan book growth at 11 percent YoY to Rs 2,04,103 crore.

""83 percent of corporate book is now rated A and above with 95 percent of incremental sanctions in FY20 being to corporates rated A- and above,"" said the bank.

On the asset quality front, gross non-performing loans as a percentage of gross advances dropped 14 bps sequentially to 4.86 percent in Q4FY20, and net NPAs declined 53 bps QoQ to 1.56 percent in March ended quarter.

Axis Bank recognised slippages of Rs 3,920 crore during Q4FY20, lower compared to Rs 6,214 crore in Q3FY20.

""Slippages from the loan book were at Rs 3,418 crore and that from investment exposures stood at Rs 502 crore. Corporate slippages stood at Rs 1,839 crore,"" the bank explained.

""Excluding one account of Rs 750 crore which got upgraded during the

quarter and downgraded again out of total corporate slippages, 84 percent of this came from previously disclosed BB and below rated clients (fund based loans, non-fund based loans and investment holdings), it further explained.

Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs during the quarter were Rs 2,489 crore while write-offs were Rs 1,270 crore.

Consequently, net slippages (before write-offs) for the quarter stood at Rs 1,431 crore compared to Rs 3,792 crore in Q3FY20, while net slippages

(before write-offs) in retail and SME stood at Rs 305 crore and Rs 107 crore respectively, the bank said.

Provisions and contingencies during the quarter stood at Rs 7,730.02 crore, increasing significantly by 185.1 percent year-on-year and 122.7 percent quarter-on-quarter.

The bank said it made other provisions aggregating Rs 3,526 crores in Q4FY20 of which Rs 3,000 crore is towards COVID-19.

""At March 31, 2020, the bank holds in aggregate additional provisions of Rs 5,983 crores. It is pertinent to note that this is over and above the NPA provisioning included in PCR calculations, and the 0.4 percent standard asset provisioning requirement on sStandard assets,"" it added.

The bank in its filing said other income during March quarter rose 13 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,985.46 crore, while pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) grew by 16.7 percent to Rs 5,851.11 crore YoY.

In financial year 2019-20, net profit fell sharply by 65 percent to Rs 1,627 crore compared to previous year, impacted by higher provisions taken in FY20 and the one time DTA charge taken in Q2 to incorporate revised corporate tax rates.

Adjusted for these one-offs, net profit for FY20 would have been Rs 5,182 crore, up 11 percent over previous year, said the bank.

NII in FY20 rose 16 percent YoY to Rs 25,206 crore.

In separate news, Axis Bank on April 28 said it will acquire a 29 percent stake in Max Life Insurance. With this acquisition, the total stake of Axis Bank in Max Life will be at 30 percent.

""The negative outlook on Axis reflects our expectation that heightened economic risks facing India's banking system will likely affect the bank's asset quality and financial performance,"" it reasoned.

Axis plunged 50 percent in the quarter ended March 2020 and lost 51 percent in FY20, while the year-to-date (2020) loss for the stock stood at 44 percent, underperforming the Nifty Bank which fell 40.5 percent, 37 percent and 39 percent, respectively.",747,-0.10699183493852615

Axis Bank and Max Life Insurance have entered into a deal where the former will acquire 29 percent stake in the life insurer. Both entities have announced a six to nine month time limit for the transaction to be completed.

Interestingly, the long-term intent of the partnership, according to the statement given to exchanges, is to merge Max Financial Services (MFS) with Max Life.

MFS is the holding company of Max Life and is listed on the stock exchanges. Currently, Max Financial Services presently holds 72.5 percent stake in Max Life. MFS does not engage in any other financial business except managing Max Life Insurance.

“Axis Bank and MFSL intend to create long-term value for all shareholders of Max Life by working towards a merger of the company with Max Life,” the statement said.

In June 2016, when a proposal was presented to merge Max Life with HDFC Life, the structure was similar. First, Max Financial Services was to be merged with Max Life and then with HDFC Life.

However, insurance regulatory rules state a non-insurance company cannot merge with an insurance company. This was used as the reason to reject the merger between HDFC Life and Max Life.

Now when it comes to the Axis Bank deal with Max Life Insurance, the two entities have stated that should the merger not be completed by the pre-agreed timeline, the parties have contractually agreed on certain other outcomes.

“While there are insurance rules defining the type of mergers, necessary legal opinions have been taken prior to the deal. So, we are not expecting any roadblocks,” a source said.

As per the transaction documents filed with the stock exchanges, if the merger is not completed as per the timeline, both entities have agreed that there will be a right to swap Axis Bank’s shareholding with Max Financial. The tax consequence of which will be equally borne by the parties.

Further, the entities have also agreed that if the value creation options are not completed within 63 months from the closing, the transaction provides for a put option for Axis Bank.

























While these 'value creation options' have not been publicly stated, some of it could include sales projections and fee income benefits for Axis Bank post the stake acquisition as well as the ability to cross-sell the bank's loans and other retail products to Max Life customers.



As per this put option, there can be a sale of all shares held by Axis Bank in Max Life at a price of Rs 294 per share (subject to adjustments) within nine months of exercise of such put option.























Once the transaction is completed, Axis Bank will have the right to nominate three directors and MFS will have the right to nominate four directors on the Max Life Board. One nominee director of the promoter group on the MFS board will be a person identified by Axis Bank.

The deal would have to be approved by both Reserve Bank of India and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India. The respective legal teams of the banking and insurance regulator will also study the deal contours before giving their approval.",542,0.9467039406299591

One nominee director of the promoter group on the Max Financial Services board will be a person identified by Axis Bank.

Axis Bank is the third largest private bank and Max Life is the fourth largest private life insurer in India. The two companies have had a successful business relationship for over a decade, providing long term saving and protection products to over 19 lakh customers. The total premium generated through this relationship has aggregated to over Rs. 38,000 crore.

Amitabh Chaudhry, MD and CEO, Axis Bank said, “We see this joint venture creating immense value for our stakeholders given our long standing, high performing partnership with Max Life. We believe this transaction will allow us to deepen our working relationship leading to better integrated teams and infrastructure and a superior alignment in our approach.”

Max Life will gain from its exclusive presence in Axis Bank’s 4,415 branches while the bank will be able to boost its fee income from this partnership.

Mohit Talwar, Vice Chairman, Max Group and Managing Director, Max Financial Services said that this joint venture has the potential to catapult Max Life further up on the life insurance league table.

This is not the first time Max Financial Services is eyeing a partnership. In June 2016, Max Financial Services and HDFC Life had entered into an agreement for a merger. However, this was called off since they did not receive a regulatory approval.",612,0.9999998807907104

Axis Bank has almost finalised a deal to acquire a nearly 30 percent stake in Max Life Insurance from Max Financial Services for Rs 1,600 crore, The Economic Times reported.

Axis Bank already owns around 2 percent of Max Life Insurance. Max Financial Services' stake in the insurer will lower to 70 percent after the transaction, the report said.

""In the secondary share sale transaction, Max Financial Services will divest 28.6 percent stake in Max Life Insurance for about Rs 1,600 crore to Axis Bank,"" a source told the publication.

Share price of Axis Bank jumped 5 percent intraday on April 28 ahead of its March quarter result which is scheduled to come out today, April 28.

The third-largest lender is expected to report a decline in Q4 FY20 profit on the back of higher loan loss provisions though lower tax rate may cushion the fall.

Most brokerages expect a double-digit decline in profit after tax which could fall as much as 62 percent year-on-year, while net interest income could grow by more than 16 percent YoY due to slower loan growth (around 15 percent) amid economic crisis and stress in the retail and MSME segment. However, they expect the margin to be stable.

Provisions are expected to be higher due to COVID-19 led current economic crisis and slippages are also likely to be on the higher side due to stress in retail and MSME segments, but asset quality is expected to be stable due to the moratorium announced by the RBI.

""We expect loan growth at 15 percent YoY with a greater focus on retail. NIM will be unchanged at 3.6 percent (led by loan composition and funding costs),"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees profit declining 47 percent and net interest income rising 16.3 percent YoY.

According to ICICI Direct, margins are estimated at around 3.5 percent thereby leading to NII growth of 19.8 percent YoY.

""Given the current economic situation, provisions are expected to remain higher at around 65 bps in Q4 FY20 versus 55 bps in Q4 FY19. As banks would not be recognising any NPAs during the moratorium period, the gross NPA ratio is expected to be steady at 5.1 percent. Telecom exposure of Rs 16,000 crore remains a hangover ahead. Extension of lockdown could lead to a further slowdown of crucial sectors, thus adding to asset quality worries,"" said ICICI Direct.

The stock price has gained over 22 percent in the last one month and was quoting at Rs 442.05, up Rs 14.75, or 3.45 percent at 09:35 hours. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 448.50 and an intraday low of Rs 438.90.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on March 27, instructed all the lending institutions to give a three-month moratorium on term loan equated monthly installments (EMIs). Banks and other lenders were directed to give borrowers a grace period of three months for payment of EMIs, including home loans, auto loans, personal loans, EMIs on debit cards and even credit cards.

If you have an ongoing loan, you do not have to pay the EMI for March, April and May. It is a grace period for three months and not the waiver of your EMI - which means you do have to pay these EMIs later on.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Further, the bank clarified to its customers that it is only a deferment option and not a concession or waiver, since interest would continue to accrue for this period.

The repayment would resume from June 2020, once the deferment period is over.

Borrowers whose cash flows are not impacted and do not wish to avail the moratorium, may choose to opt out from the moratorium by sending an email or by reaching out to any of bank branches, Axis Bank said adding, it is deemed that borrowers have opted for the moratorium if there is no written communication stating otherwise.

Meanwhile, a host of state-run banks, which control over two-thirds of the system, have gone for an option where the repayments automatically get deferred unless a customer informs of her willingness to pay.

Experts have already made it clear that this is not an interest waiver, but a deferment of payments, meaning the additional interest costs will have to borne by the customers.",611,0.5091626048088074

The Shiv Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has invested only Rs one crore in fixed deposit with the Axis Bank out of its investments worth Rs 6,300 crore in nine banks in January.

Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' wife Amruta Fadnavis holds a senior position at the Axis Bank.

Following a war of words between the Shiv Sena and Amruta Fadnavis, the private sector lender Axis Bank has in the recent past lost some salary accounts of government establishments to other banks.

In January, the cash-rich Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) made 446 fixed deposits of amounts worth Rs one to three crore for a period of 12 to 24 months in nine different public and private sector lenders, including the Axis Bank, according to an official document.

The BMC has invested Rs one crore in the Axis Bank, which has offered an annual interest rate of 6.5 per cent, as per the document presented by the civic administration to the BMC's standing committee.

The document indicates that the FD amount invested by the BMC in the Axis Bank is the lowest among all its investments made in nine banks. The civic body's FD with the Axis Bank will mature in July 2021.

The BMC has deposited Rs five crore in the Municipal Cooperative Bank, which has offered the highest interest rate of 7.5 per annum, as per the document.

The interest rate of 6.5 per cent offered by the Axis Bank is the second highest.

All other banks, including the private lender ICICI, where the BMC has invested Rs 329 crore in FDs, have offered interest at a rate lower than 6.4 per annum, according to the civic body's document.

Notably, in December last year, Thane Mayor Naresh Mhaske directed officials to shift the accounts of the Thane Municipal Corporation from Axis Bank to a nationalised bank.

In the past, Amruta Fadnavis had courted controversies with her tweets.

In the latest such row, she last week termed Shiv Sena leader and state cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray a ""worm"".",351,-0.13706916570663452

Private sector lender Axis Bank on February 20 hinted at raising stake in Max Life Insurance Company, whose policies it has been selling for nearly a decade. The bank, which signed an agreement with Max Financial Services and its subsidiary Max Life Insurance Company, did not reveal the quantum of stake it will be buying.

Axis Bank said it has entered into a confidentiality and exclusivity arrangement to explore the possibility of entering into a long-term strategic partnership with Max Life.

A media report which was published hours before the announcement had claimed that the lender is eyeing more than 20 per cent stake in Max Life. Speculation about a potential transaction being in the works had been on for long.

Virtually all the major banks in the country have a presence in the insurance segment through joint ventures with foreign players, as the bank's ability to distribute products gives them an edge in the sector that delivers one of the best profitability ratios over a long term.

Products sold through Axis Bank, which owns 2 percent of the life insurance company, reportedly contribute for 54 per cent of Max Life's revenues.

In a statement, Axis Bank said the three entities have signed a ""confidentiality and exclusivity arrangement to explore the possibility of Axis Bank entering into a long-term strategic partnership with Max Life"".

""We constantly keep assessing various strategic opportunities and we see a potential for greater participation in the under-penetrated life insurance space,"" the bank's managing director and chief executive Amitabh Chaudhry said.

He added that a completion of the ""proposed transaction"" will create significant value for all stakeholders.

""The strategic interest of Axis Bank in Max Life will lead to the much awaited permanence and allow both companies to work towards an enduring future for policyholders and other stakeholders,"" Analjit Singh, the founder and chairman of Max Group, was quoted as saying.

The bank's executive director for retail banking Pralay Mondal said the Axis and Max teams have been working closely for a while and ""time is right to leverage this unique camaraderie and bring in a more strategic intent"".

Max Group's vice chairman Mohit Talwar said proposed deal is a ""natural evolution"" in what has been a productive partnership till now.

The statement said Axis Bank has helped generate new premium of over Rs 12,000 crore for the insurance player till now.

At present, Max Financial Services owns 72.5 per cent of Max Life, while 25.5 per cent is with Japanese player Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, it said.

There was a 20 per cent growth in the bancassurance channel or the business received through the bank in the first nine months of the fiscal ending December 2019, the statement said.

The last major deal done by the bank was an acquisition of digital payments company Freecharge in 2017 for Rs 385 crore.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Private sector lender Axis Bank, Max Financial Services and its subsidiary Max Life Insurance have entered into an arrangement to explore a long-term strategic partnership.

The entities have not mentioned the nature of this transaction. But a company source said that the deal with be to enable Axis Bank get a ‘promoter’ tag in the company by increasing its stake from the present 2 percent to as high as 20 percent.

Right now, Axis Bank is a bank selling insurance (bancassurance) partner of Max Life and contributes 55 percent of the insurer’s business. However, the bank also sells the products of other insurers like Life Insurance Corporation of India and Bajaj Allianz Life. The idea behind this deal could be to get a permanent and exclusive bank partner.

Max Life is currently the largest non-bank owned private life insurer in India. Max Financial Services presently holds a 72.5 percent stake in Max Life while Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and Axis Bank hold 25.5 percent and 2 percent stake respectively.

Also Read: Will Max Life be second time lucky?

Max Life will gain from its exclusive presence in Axis Bank’s 4,415 branches while the bank will be able to boost its fee income from this partnership.

Axis Bank and Max Life have had a successful bancassurance arrangement for nearly a decade. A release filed with the exchanges noted that the new premium generated through this arrangement has aggregated to over Rs 12,000 crore over this period, while maintaining high persistency. Both companies have invested extensively in product and need-based sales training, thereby leading to consistent increase in productivity.

Amitabh Chaudhry, MD and CEO, Axis Bank, said, “At the Bank, we constantly keep assessing various strategic opportunities and we see a potential for greater participation in the under-penetrated life insurance space. We have had a long standing bancassurance relationship with Max Life and the on-going discussions are a step further to deepen and strengthen this strategic partnership.”

He added that the successful completion of the proposed transaction is expected to create significant value for all stakeholders.

Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as well as Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), will need to give their approval for this deal. RBI in particular has expressed apprehension about banks buying large stake in insurance companies.

For Max Life, in the first nine months of FY20 (9MFY2020), the bancassurance channel saw a 20 percent growth. The Value of New Business (VNB) that written during the first nine months of FY20 was Rs. 576 crore, growing 24 percent over the previous year over a shift in the product mix towards non-participating (products that don’t offer any bonus) ones.

The insurer’s total first year premium increased 19 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,693 crore. Having an exclusive bank partner will help in premium growth.

Analjit Singh, Founder and Chairman, Max Group, said that the strategic interest of Axis Bank in Max Life will lead to the much awaited permanence and allow both companies to work towards an enduring future for policyholders and other stakeholders.

The transaction will be subject to applicable regulatory approvals, satisfactory completion of due diligence, execution of definitive documentation and satisfaction of other conditions, including the necessary corporate approvals.

This is not the first time Max Financial Services is eyeing a partnership. In June 2016, Max Financial Services and HDFC Life had entered into an agreement for a merger. However, this was called off since they did not get regulatory approval.",587,0.7673274959836688

Private lenders have reported healthy profits in the December-ended quarter on back of recoveries from resolutions and lower cost of funds. However, their slippages remained elevated with additional bad loans being higher than the first half in some cases.

With interest rates on the downtrend, thanks to five consecutive rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2019, and surplus liquidity conditions since past few months, banks were able to reset their deposit rates leading to lower cost of funds in the third quarter.

Indusind Bank reported higher net interest margins (NIMs) at 4.15 percent in third quarter, from 3.83 percent in same period last year, on lower cost of funds. ICICI Bank's NIMs also rose to 3.77 percent, which was a multi-quarter high.

While bulky recoveries from bad loan resolutions like Essar Steel in third quarter led to write back in provisions, fresh accounts that turned sour limited its impact.

ICICI Bank posted 158.4 percent growth in net profit for October-December, but its slippages more than doubled to Rs 4,363 crore in the third quarter, as compared to Rs 2,091 crore in the same period last year.

Apart from Karvy Stock Broking and a South India-based industrial company, ICICI Bank also saw slippages from retail and agriculture loans.

Also, while its provisioning coverage ratio was higher at 85.7 percent, the bank has not made any extra provisions towards the troubled telecom sector despite having most of its sectoral exposure (1.8 percent of loan book) to the top two players. Its stressed loans list is also likely to remain high going ahead.

Kotak Mahindra Bank added Rs 1,062 crore worth of bad loans in December-ended quarter, a third of which came from corporate loans outside its watchlist. Its Joint Managing Director Dipak Gupta said that these were ""unknown unknowns"" referring to highly-leveraged, top-rated companies that unexpectedly defaulted on loans.

Most lenders also reported higher slippages after accounting for divergences from RBI's assessment of their bad loans as reported in 2018-19.

In terms of credit growth, demand from corporates remained subdued, while retail loans grew at a healthy pace.

""Axis Bank reported steady loan growth amidst economic slowdown, led by continued momentum in the retail business. However, the slippage trajectory remains elevated with 'BB & below' pool driving most of the corporate slippages,"" said analysts Nitin Aggarwal and Himanshu Taluja, Motilal Oswal in a report.

Axis Bank's watchlist or the below ‘BB’ rated loan book stood at Rs 5100 crore at the end of December 2019, with Rs 900 crore worth of fresh additions to the list in the quarter. However, the bank said that the pool of stressed assets has eased to a seven-year low level, which is less than 3 percent of the corporate loan book.

HDFC Bank reported 33 percent growth in net profits but its asset quality weakened due to slippage in agriculture loans that more than doubled from last year. ""Although, net non-performing assets (NPAs) were higher than estimated, HDFC Bank's overall provision cover, including floating, contingent, and standard asset provisions increased 500bps from previous quarter to 119 percent of gross NPAs,"" said analysts Ravikant Bhat and Prithvish Uppal, IndiaNivesh.

Smaller private lenders like DCB Bank, RBL Bank and Federal Bank did not have a smooth quarter.

""Federal Bank's operating performance was lacklustre on various fronts. While the headline slippages were higher, the silver lining was these were largely driven by known-stress in the corp book, and granular slippages were contained,"" said Darpin Shah, Analyst, HDFC Securities.

DCB Bank, on the other hand, also cut its PCR to 53 percent from 63 percent amid deteriorating asset quality, which was disappointing, Anand Dama, analyst from Emkay Securities pointed out. The bank's gross NPAs on vehicle loans rose to 5.6 percent from 4.4 percent in previous quarter.

RBL Bank reported a 69 percent drop in net profit for October-December quarter, due to a spike in provisions and expects more slippages from its watchlist in the last quarter of current financial year. The bank saw slippages of Rs 1,048 crore in the third quarter. Of this, about Rs 700 crore came from the watchlist that comprises of 3-4 accounts.",702,-0.16615089972813923

Axis Bank posted steady performance for Q3FY2020, wherein its operating results were strong and asset quality improved. However, the pace of slippages remained elevated, which indicates elongated ROA normalisation going forward. Its balance sheet and operational strengths along with available headroom in valuations are key positives in its favour.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with an unchanged price target (PT) of Rs. 882.

Just as the government prepares to announce the Union Budget 2020-21, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor has called for more structural, fiscal measures to boost demand and economic growth in the country, citing limitation in the monetary policy to do so on its own.

He added that steps like prioritising food processing industries, tourism, e-commerce, startups and efforts to become a part of the global value chain could give significant push to growth.

This week a number of private lenders like ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Axis Bank announced their third quarter results. While their profits showed improvement, slippages still continue to remain elevated.

Need structural, fiscal measures to boost demand and growth: RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das said that there is need for structural and fiscal measures along with monetary policy to augment demand and growth in the economy. ""Monetary policy, however, has its own limits. Structural reforms and fiscal measures may have to be continued and further activated to provide a durable push to demand and boost growth,"" Das said on January 24.

ICICI Bank classifies Karvy as NPA, slippages riseICICI Bank ,that posted 158.4 percent growth in net profit for October-December, mostly on account of recoveries from Essar Steel, saw two other big slippages in the third quarter, including its exposure to Karvy Stock Broking.

Budget 2020: Things to watch out for the banking sectorApart from bank recapitalisation that the government has already prioritised for the merging lenders, there may not be much in store that could directly impact the sector in Budget 2020. However, due to the banking sector’s linkages to all other sectors in the economy, they may be affected by the Centre’s decision on sectors where they have a reasonable exposure. And there could be more downside risks than benefits due to these measures.

Axis Bank says stressed asset pool back to 'normal' levelsAxis Bank on January 22 reported lower-than-expected net profit for the October-December quarter on the back of higher provisioning. The private lender said that it may continue to set aside more against bad loans going ahead, as slippages remain high.

Axis Bank share price gained nearly 3 percent in the early trade on January 23 after the company turned profitable in the quarter ended December 2019.

The company has reported a 4.5 percent year-on-year gain in net profit at Rs 1,757 crore. Higher provisions and high base in Q3FY19 due to recovery in the steel sector supported profitability.

The bank had reported a loss of Rs 112.08 crore in the previous quarter.

Net interest income (NII), the difference between interest earned and interest expended, grew by 15.16 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,452.98 crore.

Loan growth was strong for the quarter at 5.5 percent sequentially and 16 percent (the highest since Q3FY18) YoY, indicating the bank has been gaining market share along with healthy NII.

Net interest margin at 3.57 percent was the highest in the last 10 quarters.

IDFC Securities | Rating: Outperform | Target: Cut to Rs 830 from Rs 840 per share

The research house has cut FY20 earnings to account for higher provisions and slippages.

It expects the company to enhance its competitive position in the banking sector and in the worst case, BB pool will rise by an additional 1-1.2 percent.

Kotak Institutional Equities | Rating: Reduce | Target: Rs 740 per share

The company delivered a mixed revenue performance, while 5 percent YoY earnings growth led by a lower tax rate.

The strong NII offset by a decelerating fee income growth, while slippages stubbornly high (4% of loans) this quarter. The provisions are likely to be high in the near term and could be a near-term risk.

Citi | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 850 per share

The asset quality stress overshadows the pre-provision operating profit growth. The slippage & provision related concerns could be an overhang.

The reduction in BB and below book & NPA recovery could lead to better trends in FY21. It lower FY20/FY21 profit estimates by 16%/5% to factor in higher provisions.

HSBC | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 930 per share

The company’s slippages are at an elevated level, but arise mostly from BB & below rated assets. The consistency in delivery should now drive re-rating.

Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: R 850 per share

The stable operating performance and credit costs remain elevated. The capital levels are comfortable with CET at 14.3%.

The company should continue to gain market share. It cut estimates by 5-23% on the back of higher credit costs.

At 09:17 hrs, Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 728, up Rs 15.25, or 2.14 percent. on the BSE.

Axis Bank on January 22 reported lower-than-expected net profit for the October-December quarter on the back of higher provisioning.

The private lender said that it may continue to set aside more against bad loans going ahead, as slippages remain high.

""After the elevated levels of slippage in the last three quarters, the stock of our ‘BB’ rated portfolio has declined substantially and is now in line with normalised levels. We have continued to focus on what is in our control, strengthening our balance sheet and being conservative when it comes to rating downgrades, asset classification and provisioning,"" said Amithabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Axis Bank.

The bank's watchlist or the below ‘BB’ rated loan book stood at Rs 5100 crore at the end of December 2019, with Rs 900 crore worth of fresh additions to the list in the quarter. The bank said that the pool of stressed assets has eased to a seven-year low level, which is less than 3 percent of the corporate loan book.

Axis Bank reported slippages of Rs 6,200 crore in the third quarter of current financial year. This is higher compared to slippages of Rs 4,798 crore in the first and Rs 4,983 crore in the second quarter this year.

About 81 percent of additional bad loans came from previously disclosed accounts, the bank said.

The bank's gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio was at 5 percent in October-December quarter, from 5.75 percent in the same period last year. Its net NPA ratio also eased to 2.09 percent, from 2.36 percent a year ago.

""We might still want to be more prudent and conservative and want to increase the level of provision on existing NPAs as we go forward,"" said Jairam Sridharan, chief financial officer, Axis Bank. He added that the pool of stressed accounts may remain around the same levels, while slippages are likely to normalise going ahead.

The bank's provisions increased to Rs 3470.92 crore in the third quarter, from Rs 3,518.39 crore in the previous quarter. Its provisioning coverage ratio was at 78 percent, which is likely to move up going ahead, the bank said.",366,0.4374798536300659

Private sector lender Axis Bank was in the black in the December quarter reporting a 4.5 percent year-on-year gain in net profit at Rs 1,757 crore. Higher provisions and high base in Q3FY19 due to recovery in steel sector supported profitability.

The bank had reported a loss of Rs 112.08 crore in the previous quarter.

The year-ago quarter had included a significant recovery of Rs 800 crore in the steel sector.

""Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs during the quarter were Rs 2,422 crore while write-offs were Rs 2,790 crore. Consequently, net slippages (before write-offs) for the quarter stood at Rs 3,792 crore compared to Rs 2,770 crore in Q2FY20 and Rs 2,124 crore in Q3FY19.""

Other income (non-interest income) fell 5.35 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,786.6 crore due to a high base in the year-ago period, but pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) grew by 4 percent to Rs 5,742.69 during the quarter.

Private sector lender Axis Bank is expected to report 50-60 percent YoY growth in profit on January 22 on account of lower provisions and the sequentially it is likely to turn profitable (against loss of Rs 112 crore in Q2FY20).

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, is seen rising in the range of 13-15 percent with loan growth in similar range and stable NIM YoY.

""Core operating performance will continue to be strong. Loan growth will be better than industry average given the continued momentum in retail growth and opportunistic pick up in corporate. NIMs will benefit from earlier capital rising, helping sustain core momentum,"" said Edelweiss.

According to Narnolia, advances may grow 15 percent YoY with each segment contributing to the growth.

Axis Bank raised QIP during the last quarter which has enhanced it tier 1 capital to 14.04 percent and CRAR to 18.45 percent which would provide cushion to bank in the tense environment, said the brokerage.

The management highlighted that the raised QIP would be idle for it to grow at around 20 percent CAGR for next 2-3 years.

Overall brokerages expect asset quality during the quarter to improve with decline in slippages.

Kotak expects slippages of around Rs 4,000 crore (3 percent of loans) mostly from ""below investment grade book"". ""We expect an unchanged gross NPL and below investment grade loan portfolio.""

Narnolia sees gross non-performing assets (NPA) falling 30bps sequentially to 4.7 percent and net NPA 10 bps QoQ to 1.9 percent for the quarter ended December 2019.

The order comes after the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on December 20 had asked Sebi to pass an order by January 15, 2020 in the case.

The tribunal had modified its earlier directive passed on December 17, wherein it had asked the markets watchdog to pass an order within 15 days in the case.

Axis Bank had moved SAT seeking the shares pledged by KSBL to the lender be unfrozen, so that it can invoke the pledges. The move had come following a Sebi directive to the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) in November that prevented Axis Bank from accessing the securities pledged with the lender by KSBL.

KSBL owed Rs 81 crore to the bank which was given in the form of overdraft against shares.

As per the data provided by NSE, securities pledged by KSBL in favour of Axis Bank belonged to its fully paid as well as partly or unpaid clients. The value of securities belonging to fully paid client is Rs 171.74 crore and the value of securities of other than fully paid clients is Rs 13.69 crore.

Regarding pledging of securities of fully paid clients, Sebi said a stock broker has no authority to pledge the securities of its fully paid clients. If a broker pledges securities of its fully paid clients, it amounts to misappropriation of clients' securities.

""Even if securities belonging to fully paid clients are pledged by the stock broker, such pledge does not pass any title to the pledgee, as the stock broker in such case himself/itself does not possess any title/right over such securities. Thus, pledge of securities, belonging to fully paid client, is not treated as valid pledge in law,"" Sebi noted.

""Pledging of securities of unpaid clients required taking of 'explicit authorization' by the stock broker from each such client and in respect of each such pledging. The Representor (Axis Bank) has submitted that the PoA (power of attorney) given by the client was sufficient authorization to create such a pledge. However, I do not agree with such interpretation given to the scope of PoA,"" Sebi Whole Time Member Anant Barua said in an order on Tuesday.

He further said PoA given by the client to the broker can be used for the purpose of pledging in favour of the stock broker, “only” for the purposes of meeting the margin requirements.

The bank in its representation to Sebi also said in respect of partly or unpaid clients, KSBL be directed to issue five days notice to the clients or the bank be allowed to issue five days notice to clients to enable the clients redeem the pledged shares by making payment of the corresponding outstanding indebtedness, failing which the lender be permitted to invoke the pledge on shares.

If the bank is able to show proof of authorisation in respect of securities having value of Rs 13.69 crore belong to unpaid clients, such securities can be released to it after following the procedure under supervision of NSE, Axis Bank said in its submission. The regulator has rejected Axis Bank's plea in the matter.

Sebi, through an interim order passed on November 22, barred KSBL from taking new brokerage clients and also prevented it from using the PoAs given by its clients after the brokerage was found to have allegedly misused clients' securities to the tune of over Rs 2,000 crore.

Securities held by KSBL were used by the brokerage for borrowing from the lenders courtesy the PoA.

The securities held by over 83,000 clients were given back to them after Sebi asked NSDL to do so, forcing lenders -- Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank -- to move SAT and secure an interim relief on further transfers.

However, SAT on December 4 refused any immediate relief to top lenders and directed them to approach Sebi by December 6 and that Sebi pass an order.

NSDL's move helped 90 per cent of KSBL's demat account holders get back their securities.

Later, Sebi refused to provide any relief to the four lenders.",701,-0.8188046216964722

The brokerage downgraded the domestic equities to “neutral” from “overweight”, saying scope for outperformance was limited.

“We downgrade our tactical relative stance on Indian equities to neutral. We would look to turn more constructive on India once the domestic economy recovers much more strongly than currently expected, and/or we turn incrementally more cautious on the rest of Asia, particularly North Asia,” the report said.

The global brokerage house had upgraded India to “overweight” in August 2019. With its back against the wall given the growth headwinds, the government had finally decided to go on an offensive to arrest the decline in GDP growth rates by embarking on a series of reforms and growth-boosting measures, it had said.

At the same time, Nomura felt that a deteriorating external environment (largely due to rising US-China trade tensions) could benefit a large-liquid economy/market like India.

Since then, Indian equities have rallied, mostly due to domestic factors rather than external, and for a while, India even outperformed regional indices, as Nomura expected.

“However, as we stand currently, we find our overweight on India did not work as expected, given that North Asian markets have rallied much harder, due to a better external environment on easing US-China trade tensions,” the report said.

The cautious stance, Nomura said, was only for the short term and it remained constructive on Indian equities for the long term.

“India is home to a number of well-run, high-quality-growth businesses, which justifies its premium valuations. India should also do well if global growth slows down, given its domestic-oriented economy (not necessarily the equity index) and less-than-average exposure to electronics as well as the trade cycle,” the report said.

If US-China trade tensions were to re-emerge and India’s domestic growth recovered, India as a market could do well and outperform, it said.

Namura’s top stocks from Indian markets include ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Larsen & Toubro and Dr. Reddy's Lab.

Nomura highlighted these 5 factors for the downgrade:

Global equities more attractive

Nomura believes with the external backdrop is expected to improve marginally and the tech cycle is expected to recover. A domestic-oriented market like India may have a hard time outperforming the more cyclical North Asia markets geared to the tech/growth cycle as well as global growth.

Expectations of slow and prolonged economic recovery

India’s medium-term growth potential remains intact as Nomura continues to believe that the measures adopted, so far, by the government are positive, but more such steps may be needed to boost growth.

The Budget will be carefully watched and the general consensus is that some more “soothing measures” are likely. It is unclear how far these measures will lift the economy and may just boost sentiment on the margin.

The Nomura India Economics team expects GDP growth to average 4.7% in FY20 (year-ending March 2020) and 5.7% in FY21 and are below consensus.

Benchmark Index valuations not inexpensive

Nomura says India benchmark index valuations could remain high (if not expanded further) for reasons such as global/passive flows, channelising of domestic liquidity to stock markets due to fewer investment opportunities elsewhere (e.g. weak property market, and lower domestic deposit rates), and importantly index changes (for example recent MSCI changes added a number of high valuation-high growth stocks which gave, in our view, a one-time boost to index valuations).

Therefore, Nomura does not expect massive mean reversion; however, the brokerage house believes that given the uncertainty on the domestic growth outlook, further multiple expansion is likely capped.

High expectations

With foreign flows relatively strong, expectations are quite high for India to post a recovery soon but Nomura fears that investor patience may be running out.

The investment bank also notes that the Indian equity market (MSCI India or Sensex) is driven by a narrow set of stocks, construed as quality-growth, which has given an uncertain growth outlook.

Nomura is of the view that investors are more than happy to stick to stocks with better earnings visibility.

Rising inflation implies less room for monetary policy

As a house, Nomura expects that policy will continue to take a breather for now, given the rising inflationary pressures. However, it expects the next rate cut in Q2.

There is a risk of fiscal slip

Nomura says the fiscal policy is quite constrained too. The government appears to be using money to fund tax cuts by utilising proceeds from telecom companies (who themselves are funding by raising consumer tariffs, which could inhibit fragile consumption recovery). There is also a risk on fiscal should oil prices remain high.

After entering into a perfect growth stock with promising fundamentals, it becomes even more crucial to book your healthy gains before it washes away.

After a stock gives 10%, 15%, or 20% returns within few weeks, it becomes difficult to decide whether to exit the stock or keep holding it as an up-trending momentum may give you further profits.

Here are some rules, based on extensive back-testing done on 100 years of stock market history, which you can follow to guide yourself in such scenarios:

After making 20–25 percent from a correct buy point (proper breakout from pivot level), most stocks retreat. It is a good time to book your profit, given it took time to reach that level (more than three weeks) and/or the base it rallied from was second-stage or later base.

Stocks breaking out from third and higher stage bases have strong chances of failures.

If a stock gives you returns of 20 percent or more in less than three weeks after the breakout, it shows rare strength and eight-week hold rule triggers.

Under this, you hold the stock at least for eight weeks. Such stocks usually end up giving multi-fold returns.

If a stock moves in your favour in an erratic manner; for example, a stock shows unexplained intra-day volatility, moves down but ends higher giving you the gains, it is a negative signal. Such stock is likely to move against you and should be sold.

If recently you’ve taken 7–8 percent loss in one of your positions, it is prudent to take your profits at 20–25 percent levels, or at least trail your profits from that level.

However, if you’ve taken several 7–8 percent losses, and none of your recent picks have hit the level of 20–25 percent breakout from the pivot level, you need to change your strategy.

You may consider booking earlier than 20–25 percent to cover up losses in your capital. But more importantly, you should re-examine your stock selections, and characteristics of your breakouts/buy signals.

You must also re-examine the overall market direction, and try to steer clear if the market is not in a Confirmed Uptrend.

At least 15,000 Axis Bank employees, mostly at the branch level, have exited the company in the past few months, according to a report by The Economic Times. Some senior executives have also quit, it added.

This wave of resignations is expected to hit the bank hard as branch-level employees handle customers on a daily basis. Many moved out as they struggled to cope with the new management’s steep growth targets, the paper noted.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Several employees were unclear about their roles after the overhaul at the bank and many old-timers are feeling ""discomfort with the cultural change"", a source told the paper.

Axis Bank is now trying to increase its pace of hiring. In FY19, the bank had attrition of 11,500 people and currently has 72,000 employees.

Calling the employees ""our biggest asset and differentiators"" executive director Rajesh Dahiya added that the bank is expanding fast. ""This has been a year of large number of new hirings, substantially higher numbers compared to last year both in gross as well as on net basis,"" he said.

Indian markets began this week on a muted note with some lackluster moves. However, in Tuesday’s session, traders lock profits at higher levels as markets ended the last trading session of 2019 on a negative note.

Traders were seen focusing on stock-specific moves rather than the index as some mid-cap names performed during the last few sessions.

From the derivative front, Call writers were seen at 12300, 12250 & 12200 strikes which added hefty open interest (OI) and kept the markets under pressure.

From the technical front as well, 12300 levels should act as crucial resistance for the Nifty moving forward, because at current juncture the divergences on secondary oscillators on the daily and weekly intervals suggest further consolidation into the prices.

However, a decisive move above 12300 levels in the Nifty (SPOT) should once again trigger a fresh round of short-covering by call writers which could take markets towards new record highs in the coming week.

On the downside 12,100, and 12,000 levels would act as key support levels for the Nifty and any dip into the prices should be used to create fresh longs.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 7-14% return in the next 3-4 weeks:

Axis Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 754| Target: Rs 810| Stop Loss: Rs 715| Upside 7%

The stock has been consistently maintaining its bull run on the daily as well as the weekly interval as prices are holding above its short and long-term moving averages.

The stock is trading in a rising channel with the formation of higher highs and higher lows. At the current juncture, the stock has formed an inverted head shoulder pattern on the daily interval and gave a breakout above the same.

Additionally, the positive divergences on the secondary oscillators also suggest for the next up leg into the prices. Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 750-755 for the upside target of Rs 810 levels, and a stop loss could be placed below Rs 715.

DCM Shriram: Buy| LTP: Rs 396| Target: Rs 451| Stop Loss: Rs 360| Upside 14%

After testing Rs 310 levels on the downside in November’19, the stock has been consistently recovering from its lows and was seen trading in a rising channel on the daily as well as the weekly interval.

Ever since the Shiv Sena-ruled Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) decided to shut all the salary accounts it held with Axis Bank, Amruta Fadnavis and Priyanka Chaturvedi have engaged in a war of words on social media.

Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' wife Amruta has taken Sena's move to shift accounts to a nationalised bank personally, given she is a senior employee at the bank. Hitting out at the Shiv Sena, she took to Twitter to criticise how the present government is targeting BJP leaders at a personal level.

Not one to sit silent in the face of criticism, Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi also targetted Amruta and her husband, in a Twitter spat that dragged on till December 29. She even urged the Maharashtra government to find out ""whether any/ how much CSR was given to the BJP schemes by Axis Bank after moving the accounts?""



Surprised that she is calling it vendetta because if it were,she agrees that the fmr CM favoured moving accounts to Axis Bank as she was employed there

If decision to move accounts was business as usual with zilch involvement of her&fmr CM then where is the question of targeting? https://t.co/eRCOpqMKdW

— Priyanka Chaturvedi (@priyankac19) December 29, 2019



In fact, after reading the interview I urge the Maharashtra government to investigate how moving accounts to Axis bank isn’t a clear case of conflict of interest.

Also investigate whether any/ how much CSR was given to the BJP schemes by Axis Bank after moving the accounts? https://t.co/1Ox2PJFvVF

— Priyanka Chaturvedi (@priyankac19) December 29, 2019

The bitter exchange of words ended with Amruta Fadnavis finally sharing a terse post on the social media platform that stated that having a bad leader is not Maharashtra’s fault but staying with one is.

Her tweet ended with a clarion call for all Maharashtrians: “Jaago Maharashtra”.



Having a bad leader was not Maharashtra’s Fault - But Staying with one is ! जागो महाराष्ट्र ! https://t.co/uc9gmvVrNo — AMRUTA FADNAVIS (@fadnavis_amruta) December 28, 2019

The verbal scuffle between the two women started last week when Amruta stepped in to defend her husband’s tweet condemning Rahul Gandhi’s “my name isn’t Rahul Savarkar” remark.

Devendra Fadnavis had said that no parallel can be drawn between Rahul Gandhi and Veer Savarkar, as the former’s contribution to India is nothing compared to that of the latter.

Amruta had then grabbed this opportunity to taunt Shiv Sena and said no one can become a “Thackeray” just by virtue of sharing the surname.



Very true @Dev_Fadnavis ji ! One cannot be a ‘Thackeray’ also by just putting ‘Thackrey’ surname after his name ! One needs to be true, principled & should think for betterment of people & party members above his own family & power dynamics ! @ShivSena @OfficeofUT https://t.co/3W0AsvcTeG — AMRUTA FADNAVIS (@fadnavis_amruta) December 22, 2019

Replying to her, Priyanka Chaturvedi had said that the present Chief Minister of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray is, in fact, living up to his name and that the former CM’s wife is missing the point.",504,

Indian market witnessed profit-taking at higher levels to close flat on December 30 tracking muted trend seen in other Asian markets amid holiday season. Both Sensex and Nifty recovered losses to close on a mixed note.

Let’s look at the final tally on D-Street --- the S&P BSE Sensex closes 17 points lower at 41,558 while the Nifty50 ended with gains of over 10 points t0 12,255.

Sectorally, the action was seen in telecom, autos, metals, and healthcare stocks while profit-taking was recorded in IT, banks, and finance stocks.

The NiftyBank which hit a record high of 32,613.10 failed to hold on to the momentum and closed in negative weighed down by losses in PNB, Bank of Baroda, YES Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank.

The broader markets outperformed as BSE Midcap and Smallcap ended with gains of 0.3 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. The sectoral indices exhibited a mixed trend.

Experts are of the view that the market is likely to remain rangebound in the absence of any major triggers, but smart money continues to flow into broader markets.

""Market was range-bound, premium valuation and lack of fresh triggers influenced investors to take a cautious approach on heavyweights. But the reasonable valuation of mid & small caps attracted inflows leading to outperformance in the broad market,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“We expect this polarised valuation not to sustain, there could be a shift of money from the overvalued largecaps to midcaps in 2020,” he said.

Nifty gainers – Sun Pharma, Vedanta, Eicher Motors, and Tata Motors

Nifty losers – Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI, and Yes Bank

Stocks & Sectors:

Sectorally, the S&P BSE Auto index rose 1.3 percent, followed by the S&P BSE Metal Index which rose 1.2 percent, and the Telecom index was up 1.05 percent.

Meanwhile, as many as 150 stocks hit a fresh 52-week low that includes names like TCNS Clothing, Prince Pipe, Cochin Minerals, Spectrum Food, etc. among others.

Technical View:

The Nifty50 closed flat with a positive bias to make a small bearish candle on the daily charts resembling a Hanging Man pattern.

It bounced back near its 5-Days EMA placed around 12,223.

The index is just 38 points away from hitting fresh record highs.

It remains critical for the index to sustain above 12,213 levels for the bulls to retain their hold on D-Street

If bulls manages to push the index beyond 12,293 levels then the said index can head into the critical resistance point placed around 12350 levels.

Traders are advised to remain neutral on the long side but they can shift their focus towards stock-specific opportunities, suggest experts

The bull run in 2019 might go down as one of the most ""hated"" rallies as only a handful of stocks attracted the smart money.

The Indian equity market scaled new peaks in 2019 surging about 13 percent. However, the rally was primarily inspired by a few frontliners. These select heavyweights attracted a lot of attention from fund managers or boutique wealth management firms raking in big money from the ultra-rich in 2019.

About 13 stocks emerged as favourites among Portfolio Management Schemes (PMSes) as more than 10 funds included them in their portfolio, data from PMS Bazaar, an online portal used for PMS comparison, investment and analytics, showed.

These include index heavyweights such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, RIL, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv, and Kotak Mahindra Bank.

Experts say the smart money is going in quality stocks or the ones which are displaying growth potential.

“The market has become very narrow where most of the money moved into top-quality stocks, especially the leader of a particular sector, because despite the slowdown in the economy these top 10-15 stocks manage to continue with their strong earnings,” Amit Gupta, Co-Founder and CEO, TradingBells told Moneycontrol.

Note: The above list is for reference and not buy or sell ideas

Portfolio Management Schemes (PMSes) cater to wealthy investors with portfolio sizes exceeding Rs 50 lakh. The professional fee charged by them is slightly higher than regular mutual funds (MFs).

Other stocks that are owned by less than 10 strategies include HDFC, L&T, SBI, Avenue Supermarts, HUL, ITC, Infosys, Jubilant FoodWorks, Berger Paints, Divi’s Laboratories, among others.

The schemes which have delivered maximum returns in the last one year are from the multi-cap category. Multi-Cap category funds are more diversified and include stocks from various market-cap baskets. A typical multi-cap portfolio comprises of stocks from large-cap, midcap, and smallcap space.

IIFL Multicap PMS scheme generated maximum wealth or return for ultra-rich in the one-year period starting from November 2018-November 2019. It recorded 27.76 percent return under the 1-year category, which exceeds returns across all categories, data from PMSBazaar.com showed.

Indian equities after a sharp rally during 2013-17 have largely been in a consolidation mode over the last two calendar years, and much of the consolidation was seen in the small & midcap space.

Experts feel that 2020 could be a year when we could see a catch-up rally in many of the small & midcap names as earnings start to look better with recovery in the Indian economy, so the multi-cap category could do well in the next 12 months.

“There could be earnings and valuation upgrade going ahead as nominal growth is expected to revive from lows which should aid both top-line and bottom-line growth,” Vinay Khattar, Head, Edelweiss professional Investor Research told Moneycontrol.

“2019 was characterized by a Broad-based slowdown in the domestic economy, tight credit conditions, escalating global trade war and muted global growth. Even in such conditions, markets managed to stay afloat though small and mid-caps took a significant beating,” he said.

Khattar further added that 2020 could bring substantial gains in core sectors and undervalued mid and small-cap stocks.

Q) What are your expectations from the budget? Will we see a personal tax cut in the coming year and will it be good for equity markets?

A) Banks will continue to do well in 2020. Apart from banks, telecom and auto will be the other interesting sectors to focus on in 2020.

A) Top 5 stocks that are attractive buy on dips are: SBI, Axis Bank , Ashok Leyland, Infosys and Bharti Airtel.

A) Yes, growth should start improving and quality mid and smallcaps should outperform the large-cap stocks in 2020.

Q) Do you think earnings will start looking up from FY21?

A) Yes, earnings growth will improve as the base of operating profit is soft, which is very likely to improve in FY21.

Q) What are your key takeaways from 2019?

A) The year 2019 was a volatile year and stock picking has been a challenge. The biggest lesson from 2019 is that quality management delivers value sustainably over long periods.

Even as economy turtles south, private sector lender Axis Bank on December 2 launched a wealth management offering aimed at the growing numbers of the ultra-rich.

The new product is targeted at those who can deliver a ""relationship value"" of over Rs 5 crore, as against the earlier Rs 30 lakh under the five-year-old old product.

The management cited independent research that expects a doubling of both the number of the ultra high networth individuals to 2.63 lakh by 2025 from 1.53 lakh, and a higher growth in their wealth to USD 2.6 trillion from present USD 1.07 trillion over the next six years, for the launching 'Burgundy Private'.

Managing director and chief executive Amitabh Chaudhry said the ""time-poor"" rich ensure their business growth, they may not be doing the right thing in managing their personal wealth, creating the need for advisors.

He said it is a ""myth"" that advisory is dominated by non-banking players and that he wants to change this notion.

Axis Bank has built a team of 70, mostly picked from rivals, executive director Pralay Mondal said, adding their only target is to add wealthy clients and not just grow the assets under management.

In the five years since launching the earlier offering targeted at the less-affluent, the bank has around 1 lakh clients now with an assets under management of Rs 1.38 lakh crore, Chaudhry said.

Third largest private sector lender Axis Bank is setting aside more capital, more than twice over the regulatory requirements, for loans in sectors it has identified as ""stressed"", a senior official has said.

The bank is maintaining a standard asset provisioning of 1 percentage point for bad loans in such sectors, as against the regulatory provision of 0.40 percent, its executive director Rajiv Anand told PTI.

The move, which is being followed at least since April, comes amid continuing concerns on high quantum of non-performing assets in its book. The high level of NPAs and the ensuing provisioning have impacted the profits of a majority of lenders, including Axis Bank, over the past four years.

""In sectors identified as high risk, we have increased the standard provisioning to 100 bps as against the mandated 40 bps to take care of any concerns,"" Anand said.

In April 2019, the bank had first disclosed that it had started to provide extra capital, but had not given out the exact levels of the additional provisioning or spelled out the sectors.

When asked if the troubled sectors like real estate or non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) are included on the list, Anand declined to specify the sectors which the bank has identified as stressed.

""We have not closed lending to any sector because of the difficulties that it may be going through. In each sector, there are always strong names which is better rated and has a resilient business model,"" Anand made it clear.

Concerns on higher capital burn due to policies like these can be placated by ensuring that the lending to a particular sector is not very high, which is decided by an internal team.

Anand said the bank has overhauled its risk assessment framework, wherein loan origination is separated from underwriting, and has a chief credit officer reporting directly to the chief executive.

Amid reports of its larger rival ICICI Bank shuttering its project finance, Anand hinted that Axis Bank is also following a similar strategy.

""We generally avoid project finance and our focus is now much more towards cash flow generating businesses and look at the relationship in a manner where we can deliver the full capabilities of our group to the customer,"" he said.

Anand avoided a direct reply when asked if there is demand from greenfield projects but said it will not be apt to classify the loans merely as refinance, adding it is witnessing working capital demand as well.

The bank is targeting to grow its overall book 5-8 percent above the system average, and that private sector banks have been garnering a higher percentage of market share in both loans and deposits lately whereas state-owned banks still are starved of growth capital.

In the comments that come amid difficulties on asset quality or mergers plaguing public sector banks, Anand said over half of the incremental liabilities are coming to the private sector banks, while in loans, the share is at a much higher 75 percent.

On the macro economic prospects, Anand pins hopes on more monetary easing and growth-enhancing measures put forth by the government, but concedes that the second half will also be difficult.

The pick-up will be visible from the first half of FY21, he said, on the back of growth slipping to an over six-year low of 4.5 percent for the September quarter.",572,-0.046626885732014976

Call Writers have started covering their shorts in Nifty 12000 strike price and the further short covering is expected in the days to come. Banks, Auto and Pharma Sectors are likely to perform well.

An NCLT bench headed by Bhaskara Pantula Mohan issued the ultimatum while hearing a contempt petition against Amitabh Chaudhry and Zarin Daruwala of Axis Bank and StanChart India, respectively, for not being personally attending the hearings so far.

However, bank sources said they have never been directed by the tribunal to be present for the hearing and hinted at moving a review petition against the personal appearance of their CEOs.

An Axis Bank spokesperson denied that that the bank is in contempt of the tribunal order as it has not recieved any such notice so far.

""The matter pertains to operations of accounts (held by IL&FS Financial Services' ex-MD Ramesh Bawa and his family) with our branch. The bank has high respect for all court/ tribunal orders. Bank denies the allegations and on receipt of the NCLT order, we will take appropriate steps,"" Axis Bank said in a statement to PTI.

Similarly, Standard Chartered India spokesperson also said, ""we are yet to receive the copy of the NCLT order. Upon review of the contents of the tribunal order, we will decide the way forward.""

The tribunal has fixed the next date of hearing on December 16 and asked Chaudhry and Daruwala to be present and noted that both these bankers never presented themselves before the bench since the issue surfaced last December.

The case relates to these banks allowing ex-head of ILFS Financial Services Ramesh Chandra Bawa and his family withdrawing money from their accounts with these banks and also accessing the lockers even after these accounts were frozen by the tribunal.

But the banks had submitted that the particular transactions took place before they got the copy of the tribunal order freezing these accounts.

The tribunal froze these accounts on December 3, 2018. Following this, the contempt notices were issued these three after the corporate affairs ministry had alleged that the banks facilitated Bawa to withdraw/transfer money from their accounts to his wife Ashakiran and daughter Akansha, apart from letting him access the lockers.

On April 26, 2019, the NCLT issued contempt notices to Chaudhry and Daruwala. Later it also issued a similar contempt notice Bawa for not following its directions.

The ministry also informed the tribunal that Bawa withdrew/ transferred Rs 1 crore and Rs 14 lakh from Axis Bank accounts in two instances violating the December 3, 2018 NCLT order freezing the accounts.

The ministry counsel had also said Bawa accessed his lockers with these bank four times since December 3.

While freezing the accounts, the NCLT on December 3 had also restrained former directors of IL&FS Group from disposing of or creating any third-party rights on their properties.",487,

After a sharp gap-up opening, the market failed to hold onto its gains and saw a volatile session of trade on October 30. The Nifty50 closed at 11,844 up by 0.49 percent for the day.

The broader market indices, the S&P BSE Midcap and Smallcap saw a gain of 0.65 percent and 0.36 percent for the day. The market breadth on the NSE was positive with an advance-decline ratio of 5:4.

The index formed a bearish Hanging Man reversal candle. Thus, it needs to cross and sustain above 11,880 levels for the uptrend to continue.

The next levels for the Nifty are seen at its all-time high of 12,103 levels. If the market starts to trade below 11,785 levels then profit booking can extend towards 11,700-11,650 which was the breakout zone.

In the November monthly expiry options, maximum open interest for Put is seen at strike price 11,600 followed by 11,500; while for Call maximum open interest is seen at 11,800 followed by 12,000.

Here is a list of top four stocks which could give 9-13% return in the next 1-3 months:

Axis Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 747 | Stop Loss: Rs 720 | Target: Rs 825 | Upside 10 percent

The stock hit an all-time high of Rs 828 in June this year and then corrected down towards Rs 623 levels. The price has taken support around its previous swing highs and then reversed.

The stock has formed a W-shaped bottoming out pattern on the daily chart between Rs 740 and Rs 623 levels. It is now showing breakout on the upside.

The stock has moved above its long-term 200-Days moving average (DMA) and also crossed above its 100-DMA that was acting as resistance on the up move.

The price has given a breakout on the upside from Bollinger Band with the expansion of bands indicating a continuation of the trend in the direction of breakout on the daily chart.

Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips towards Rs 740, with a stop loss below Rs 720, and a target of Rs 825 levels.

Muthoot Finance Ltd: Buy | LTP: Rs 706 | Stop Loss: Rs 675 | Target: Rs 800| Upside 13 percent

The stock witnessed some consolidation between Rs 655 and Rs 570 levels in the last four months. In late September, the stock recorded a breakout on strong momentum, but since then it has been trading in a range above the breakout level.

It is now showing a resumption of the uptrend. The price has given a breakout on the upside from Bollinger Band with the expansion of bands indicating a continuation of the trend in the direction of breakout on daily as well as on the weekly chart.

MACD line on the daily chart has also given a positive crossover with its average above equilibrium level of zero suggesting a change in the trend. Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips towards Rs 695 with stop loss below Rs 675, and a target of Rs 800 levels.

Avenue Supermarts Ltd: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,976 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,900 | Target: Rs 2,200| Upside 11 percent

Voltas Ltd: Buy | LTP: Rs 713 | Stop Loss: Rs 685 | Target: Rs 800 | Upside 12 percent

The stock hit a high of Rs 675 in December 2017 and then went into a correction mode to touch a low of Rs 472 levels in October 2018.

For almost two years, the stock witnessed consolidation between 675 and 472 levels to form a rounding bottoming out pattern on the weekly chart and formed a base for the next leg of the rally.

Currently, the stock is trading at all-time levels after its breakout. The Average Directional Index (ADX) line, an indicator of trend strength has moved above the equilibrium level of 20 with rising Plus Directional line on the weekly chart.

The Nifty50 reclaimed its crucial resistance placed at 11,700-11,800 levels, and is well on track to challenge its all-time high placed at 12,103 recorded back in June 2019, ICICIdirect said in a report.

The index which is now trading above crucial short-term and long-term moving averages restored bullish bias. “The ongoing structural improvement makes us believe the index is set to challenge the all-time high of 12,100 in the coming months,” said the note.

“In the process, we do not foresee the index breaching the key support threshold of 11,300. Therefore, dips should be capitalised to accumulate quality stocks amid the Q2FY20 earning season,” it said.

The midcap has formed a strong base on the maturity of price/time-wise correction, as over the past 21-month index retraced 61.8% of preceding 22 months rally.

The slower pace of retracement signifies a robust price structure auguring well for the index to rally 5% from here on and challenge the long term falling trend line at 17000.

ICICIdirect recommends that investors should buy quality midcap stocks as the broader market looks lucrative to participate in the impending technical pullback.

The brokerage firm highlights over 20 stocks under its Bargain buy basket which include names like Havells India, Kansai Nerolac, Hawkins Cooker, Axis Bank, SBI, IDFC First Bank, L&T, Thermax, Kalpataru Power, Wipro, Tata Metaliks, Sagar Cement, CEAT, and Indian Hotels, among others.

Top Indian private lenders are going aggressive on branch expansion and are raking up retail deposits even as credit pick up remains slow.

HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have together added 799 new domestic branches in the first six months of current financial year and plan to add more going ahead.

Branch expansion by top private banks

This marks a reversal in the trend as the number of bank branches had started shrinking over the past few years as more and more customers moved to digital channels. However, regulatory norms require banks to maintain balance between urban and rural centres and customers prefer physical presence over digital in unbanked areas.

Axis Bank, which has been adding almost a hundred new branches each quarter for more than a year, opened 190 branches in the July-September period. For the bank, this was the highest quarterly addition in last six years.

""We will see accelerated branch opening in the third quarter as well,"" said Jairam Sridharan, group executive and chief financial officer, Axis Bank. In all, the lender plans to add 400 branches this year.

The bank saw 23 percent rise in total deposits. Moreover, the mix of deposits saw a change too as customers chased higher returns on fixed deposits in anticipation of reduction in interest rates going ahead.

Axis Bank's deposit growth was mostly led by increase in term deposits as compared to Current Account Savings Account (CASA) in the second quarter, said Sridharan.

He added that the bank will try and achieve current year's branch expansion target by December-end, so as to boost its CASA base. Currently, its share of the low-cost deposits stands at 41 percent of total deposits, lower as compared to 48 percent a year ago.

ICICI Bank plans to add 450 branches this year, of which it has already opened 346 new branches in the first half. Its deposits grew 25 percent in the second qaurter, mainly driven by 35 percent growth in term deposits. The bank's CASA growth slowed to 15 percent due to moderation in savings deposits.

""CASA has declined as fixed deposits are becoming a more important part of our funding strategies,"" said Rakesh Jha, chief financial officer, ICICI Bank.

While HDFC Bank occupies the top spot for highest number of branches among private lenders, the gap is quickly closing. In order to stay ahead of the competition, HDFC Bank added 211 new branches in the first six months this year.

HDFC Bank said that this is part of its plan to strengthen its network by 600-700 branches in all.

The bank's deposits grew 22.6 percent at the end of the second quarter, with term deposits growing at 28.3 percent in the same period.

""We are happy to have excess liquidity up to a certain point in time, which is reflected in the current margin. Our margins would’ve been higher by 15 basis points if we had slowed down on deposits. But from a medium to long term, this is the right way to do it, even if it shaves off a bit of margin,"" said Jimmy Tata, chief risk officer, HDFC Bank.

The bank’s Net Interest Margins (NIMs), that have largely remained in the tight range of 4.2-4.4 percent, slipped to the lower rung after more than a year.",559,0.3362640073666206

Top lenders in India posted their second quarter results this week, with fewer additions to bad loans. However, bank chiefs expressed concerns on the impact of slowdown and delay in resolution of large accounts on the asset quality and credit costs going forward.

ICICI Bank says asset quality steady as slippages ease in Q2

ICICI Bank said that fresh additions to bad loans had stabilized, which led to overall improvement in its asset quality. However, there was an uptick in the lender’s watchlist over concerns of an economic slowdown. The total slippages for the quarter were Rs 2,482 crore, lower than around Rs 2,800 crore in the previous quarter and Rs 3,100 crore in the same period in 2018.

SBI says fresh additions to bad loans will further ease by March 2020

In what seems to be a relief from incurring heavy slippages quarter after quarter, the State Bank of India (SBI) expects that fewer loans will turn sour going forward. The country’s largest lender aims to contain its slippage ratio within 2 percent of its loan book by end of the current financial year, Chairman Rajnish Kumar said. The bank’s loan book stood at Rs 22.48 lakh crore on September 30.

More slippages from watch list likely, says Axis Bank CEO Amitabh Chaudhry

Given the current economic scenario, Axis Bank is likely to witness higher slippages from its pool of stressed assets going forward, the bank’s MD & CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said. Slowing economy, funding issues faced by non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies, promoters facing legal issues and others under the lens of enforcement agencies are the several challenges that may have a bearing on the banking sector.

Economic slowdown likely to push up credit costs, says Uday Kotak

The slowing economy and a delayed turnaround are likely to push up credit costs for the private sector lender going forward, Uday Kotak, MD, Kotak Mahindra Bank said. “We do believe that the credit costs are going to be a little higher than what we had bargained for at the beginning of the year,” Kotak said in an earnings call, adding that the bank expected the credit costs to be around 60 basis points.

Bandhan Bank looks to ramp up home loan portfolio

Bandhan Bank, which specializes in micro lending, is planning to increase its presence in the home loans market after it took over the portfolio from Gruh Finance in a recently concluded merger. The loans of Gruh Finance now form 28 percent of Bandhan Bank's advances book.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis bank's earnings were impacted by large DTA adjustment of Rs21.0bn (we incorporated in full year's earnings) leading to marginal loss of Rs1.1bn. Although, operationally better NII growth of 16.6% YoY, strong treasury led other income and control in opex translated to strong PPOP growth of 45% YoY (30% on ex-treasury). Asset quality marginally saw improvement partly helped by write-offs but slippages have remained at elevated levels (3.9% annualized) with bulk from the disclosed stress accounts. Bank has seen trickle of improvements in metrics like funding cost, continued retail deposit accretion & cost control but credit cost has been up as corporate stress continues to rise, CASA has been much slower and pricing power is limited leading to a very gradual recovery in return ratios.

Outlook

We retain Accumulate, with TP of Rs800 (unchanged) based on 2.2x Sep-21 ABV.

Given the current economic scenario, Axis Bank is likely to witness higher slippages from its pool of stressed assets going forward, the bank’s MD & CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said.

Slowing economy, funding issues faced by non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies, promoters facing legal issues and others under the lens of enforcement agencies are the several challenges that may have a bearing on the banking sector.

“All these create significant uncertainties on the banking business. If left unsettled all these factors will eventually have a bearing on stress in the lending pool of banks. Also, resolution stress accounts has not seen any material progress,” Chaudhry said in an earnings call after announcing the bank's Q2 earnings on October 22.

He added that considerable lack of resolution in large cases under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Act is delaying the recovery cycle. “Early news on pre-festival sales is also mixed,” he said.

Chaudhry said the bank’s slippage numbers have remained elevated in the second quarter, reflecting the situation in corporate lending. ""Almost all slippages have come from the previously disclosed stressed accounts. Moreover, the current environment is not enabling a quick rundown. So to that extent, we expect slippages from this stock to remain elevated,” he stated.

The bank on October 22 reported a net loss of Rs 112.1 crore, posting below than expected Q2 FY20 earnings.

The management said it had incurred a loss in Q2 due to a one-time tax impact of Rs 2,138 crore on change in the corporate tax rate. ""Excluding of this extraordinary item, PAT would have been Rs 2,026 crore, up 157 percent year-on-year (YoY),"" Axis Bank said in a statement.

I would suggest investors have limited exposure to the banking sector and invest only in banks with a better track record like SBI, ICICI, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank, Romesh Tiwari Head of Research CapitalAim, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

edited excerpts:



Q) Indian market rose over 1 percent in the week gone by, do you think we are out of the woods? What should be the trading strategy of investors for the rest of the October series and what important levels should one track?

A) The lurking uncertainty of the revival of domestic demand is fuelling the volatility witnessed this week. Major steps taken by the Finance Ministry will certainly help the profitability of companies but the revival of demand is still unaddressed.

October will be crucial to understand consumer sentiments and the future measures required to boost trading activities.

For the rest of the month, the Nifty can trade in the range of 11,000 on the downside, and 11,700 on the upside in absence of any major news flow from the domestic or global front.

Trade war worries and data from the US economy is also affecting FPI trading activities in the Indian markets.

In October till date, the net investment from FPI is still negative after a negative September. Investors should not buy aggressively at these levels and consider hedging their long positions with put options.

Q) Do you think any adverse decision regarding the trade war, over the weekend, could put bulls on the backfoot? We have seen plenty of volatility in the week gone by already due to trade war rhetoric?

A) Trade war news is surely affecting the sentiments of the traders but the fear of recession is also a major reason that is contributing to the rise in volatility.

The market is keenly watching the numbers coming out from the domestic economy, as well as, from the movers and shakers of the global economy.

Any adverse decision on trade war can easily pull the markets down and can push the Nifty below 11,000 in a quick time. The market is expected to remain volatile due to news flows this week.

Q) Plenty of stocks have slipped from their 52-week highs in the S&P BSE 500 index since September 20 (breakout). What should be the selection criteria of investors in picking stocks?

A) Buying into stocks that recently slipped from their highs may be a good strategy for momentum traders but is not advisable for investors.

Investors should always look for stocks that offer good value and growth prospects for the price and that requires systematic research, patience, and financial discipline.

There is no fixed or iron-clad secret formula for picking stocks as the markets are by nature ""unpredictable"". Investors should always look closely at promoters and insiders' actions (buying, selling or pledging of shares) and motives for the same as they have a far better knowledge about how their company is performing at the moment.

Q) What are your views on Infosys and TCS – which one is a better bet or investors should move funds to midcap IT?

A) I am positive on the IT sector in the current scenario and expect both Infosys and TCS to give good annual returns in the next couple of years.

Though the recently declared result of TCS was a bit subdued while Infosys result met market expectations. I think investors should buy into both on dips for better portfolio returns.

IT majors like Infosys and TCS are robust and can provide a comparatively secured return, while returns on midcap IT will be more volatile, so investors should choose according to their risk appetite.

Q) Banking stocks are back in bear's grip due to the news flow and asset quality woes. What are your view and how should investors approach this sector now?

A) The credibility of the banking sector is badly hit by the revelations of fraud at the topmost level of management. It will not be easy for the sector to gain the investors' trust again and certainly not in the near future.

How can an investor value stock with the aid of data that can be entirely tempered and fictitious? I am not implying that all the banks are untrustworthy but the risk is far greater than the expected returns.

I would suggest investors have very limited exposure to the sector and invest only in banks with a better track record like SBI, ICICI, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank.

The Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy committee on October 4 slashed rates by 25 bps, and kept the stance accommodative to revive growth in Asia's third-largest economy.

The central bank slashed policy rates for the fifth time in a row in line with expectations. Consequently, the rate cut totals to 135 bps in 2019 and the repo rate stands at 5.15 percent now.

On the growth front, GDP projections for FY20 was significantly downgraded to 6.1 percent from the earlier estimate of 6.9 percent, which was expected.

Experts says the central bank still has some more room to cut interest rates further by 15-30 bps.

""We believe there is a possibility of another 15 to 30bps further cut. On the bond markets, while we do not rule out the possibility of yields rising somewhat, but eventually we see them headed lower. Although there is a concern regarding fiscal slippage, we sense that markets have largely baked in the fact that fiscal deficit will widen to 3.7-3.8% of GDP,"" said Amar Ambani, Head of Research – Institutional Equities, YES Securities.

""Having said that, we see interest rates falling significantly, looking at high real rates and scope for fall in credit spread as well as term premium. Moreover, policy transmission will eventually take place, which has not been yet materialised optimally. We see 10-year yields in the range of 6.3-6.7%,"" he said.

A rate cut generally augers well for companies that are debt-laden (as it reduces interest cost), the auto sector, and banks as well as NBFCs, as it brings down the cost of funds for them. For the real estate sector, a fall in interest rates could also mean lower EMIs.

A list of 17 rate-sensitive stocks that are likely to benefit the most from the rate cut:

Analyst: Ajit Mishra, Vice President Research, Religare Broking

M&M and Escorts:

The auto sector has underperformed the benchmark index significantly over the last few months on the back of a demand slowdown, which has sharply impacted the financial performance of the auto companies. Hence, a rate cut could provide some relief and improve the volume trajectory of the players in rural markets.

Axis Bank:

A rate cut will bring down the cost of funds, help in recovering credit growth and lastly, will help improve asset quality, leading to a decline in NPAs. In short, it will bring financial stability to the bank.

Oberoi Realty and Voltas:

We believe that if the banks pass on the rate cut to borrowers, it helps in reviving growth on the ground. Lower interest rates will eventually spur spending and consumption that can benefit stocks such as Oberoi Realty and Voltas.

Analyst: Jitendra Upadhyay, Fundamental Analyst, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd

Oberoi Realty and Godrej Properties:

The rate cut will impact home loan interest rates, leading to reduced EMIs, which, in turn, will be positive for the growth of the real estate sector.

Oberoi Realty and Godrej Properties are the two stocks that have less debt in their books as compared to their peers and will get higher benefit of the rate cut. Banks are also likely benefit, as the cost of funding will get lower and there will be an improvement in the margin and in this space.

Analyst: Amit Gupta, Co-Founder and CEO TradingBells

Ujjivan Financial Services:

Ujjivan is among the few NBFCs that posted better-than-expected results last quarter. There were major changes of key personnel at Ujjivan, which is a positive sign for the company.

Any significant step by the government to solve the NBFC problem will lead to a rally in quality NBFCs such as Ujjivan and Bajaj Finance. A rate cut certainly augers well for the business and the company.

Axis Bank and SBI:

Corporate banks were the theme of the recent bull run, as NPAs showed a decline on a quarterly basis. The outlook for growth is visible as a rate cut cycle has begun. This is where Axis Bank and SBI can lead the rally.

Ashok Leyland:

After a painful period, the auto sector may see some revival as liquidity crisis may be resolved soon and the capex cycle is likely to improve since a stable government is in power.

Ashok Leyland could do well as it is focusing on electric vehicle segment and the government has announced tax benefit for this segment in the recent budget, both for the manufacturers and buyers.

DK Aggarwal, chairman and managing director, SMC Investments and Advisors Ltd

ICICI Bank:

The bank is focusing on growing the core operating profit in a risk-calibrated manner instead of loan growth. The bank aims to improve the share of profitable market opportunities by making delivery to customers more seamless and friction-less through digitisation and process improvements.

The bank's business performance such as domestic loan growth, overall corporate advances, retail loan growth and CASA ratio is continuously improving.

ACC:

The company has made significant progress on its goals in the quarter, with strong operating performance including good net sales growth.

The operating profit has improved significantly. The management believes that higher annual budget allocation for infrastructure, affordable housing, upgradation of roads and the government's focus on improving connectivity will drive cement demand going forward.

Marico:

The company delivered a decent performance in a challenging demand environment. As the management hopes for a recovery in the overall sentiment towards the second half of the year, it will continue to push for volume-driven growth and market share gains.

After being constrained in the last two years, margins should see an uptick this year despite higher investments required to support core franchises as well as fuel the new engines of growth.

The company aims to build healthy foods, premium hair nourishment and male grooming into growth engines of the future and expects to deliver value growth at 20 percent plus CAGR over the medium term in these portfolios.

Torrent Power:

The company is reducing its debt-equity ratio with a focus on improvement of efficiency. Moreover, improvement in transmission and distribution, focus on green-power projects and commissioning of renewable power plants will give good strength to the company.

Government’s policy push such as emphasis on clean coal technologies, replacing old plants with new supercritical plants, automatic transfer of coal linkage, stricter environmental norms and emphasis on digitisation will go a long way in reenergising the coal-based power generation sector.

Larsen and Toubro:

The company continues to focus on profitable execution of the large Order Book, selective order picking, on-time deliveries & operational excellence through digitalisation.

The management is also emphasising on cost competitiveness, continuous optimisation of working capital, restructuring of its business portfolio and value creation with an aim to enhance its return on equity.

Emkay Alpha Portfolio:

Federal Bank:

The bank’s core retail growth is trending well at 28 percent on a year on year basis, in line with its renewed focus on retail to drive higher margins and RoAs.

The brokerage firm expects the bank’s RoA/RoE to improve from sub-1%/10% since FY16, which has been a key irritant for investors, to healthy levels of 1.1%/14.7% by FY21E on better margins, contained opex and lower credit costs.

Emkay believes that better execution of retail strategy and the potential acquisition of an MFI company at reasonable valuations should provide further upside to the bank’s return ratios and its otherwise cheap valuations.

Maruti Suzuki:

The recovery in sales cycle should be sooner in PVs than in 2Ws and CVs as PVs are less impacted by the BSVI transition. MSIL should continue in the pole position in the Indian passenger vehicle market, driven by its focus on new launches and network expansion.

New products such as Spresso hatchback, gasoline Brezza/Scross, electric hatchback, new UV, etc are expected to support sales ahead.

The network has expanded to around 3,000 touchpoints, and the expansion continues toward the medium-term target of 3,500.

""The government has done hue of measures and helped turn the sentiment little positive but next three to four weeks will be crucial because the festive season is on and if these weeks can demonstrate momentum, it will start turning the ship around,"" said Chaudhry, in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

“The issue is not that money is lacking but the issue is can we find the right people who want to consume and can we find those right people with right financial risk profile to give them the money,” he explained.

On NBFCs, Chaudhry said, ""There are quite a few numbers of NBFCs out there who have asset-liability mismatch issue and...a lot of NBFCs have not really come out in terms of sharing and being more transparent about what quality of their asset book is. However, there are also risks attached to disclosing too much about asset book. So, this problem is not going to go away, it will take time to go.""

However, he added that the crisis will not cause further problems in terms of systemic issues.

Talking about the QIP, he said, ""There was a demand for Rs 13,300 crore. The bank managed to raise Rs 12,500 crore...w thought given the economic environment, it was important to have gunpowder in place, have growth capital for the future.""

Axis Bank on September 26 said it has raised Rs 12,500 crore through qualified institutional placement (QIP) to fund business growth. The private sector lender is the second after Yes Bank to raise funds through QIP this year. Yes Bank mopped up Rs 1,930 crore through the route.

""We understand that the transaction is the largest ever QIP by a private sector issuer in India. Despite a challenging macro-economic and market environment, the placement has witnessed strong reception from the global and domestic investor community,"" Axis Bank said in a statement.

In 2017, state-owned SBI had raised Rs 15,000 crore through QIP.

The statement further said the deal was oversubscribed with the aggregate final transaction size being Rs 12,500 crore.

The QIP issuance price of Rs 629 per share is at a discount of 4.91 per cent to the floor price of Rs 661.50 per unit, it said.

Banking and financials emerged as the biggest sectoral gainer in two consecutive sessions ending September 23 as the sector may likely benefit the most from the corporate tax cuts.

Bajaj Holdings, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC, HDFC Bank among others gained 5-9 percent.

The Nifty Bank and Financial Services indices were biggest gainers among sectors, rising more than 5 percent each.

Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, on September 20, reduced the base corporate tax rate to 22 percent from 30 percent. After surcharge and cess, the effective tax rate comes down to 25.2 percent from 35 percent.

""This clearly benefits domestic banks, NBFCs and rating agencies. Banks in the higher tax bracket, such as HDFC Bank, SBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank, DCB Bank, Federal Bank, and RBL Bank, will gain due to the move,"" Joindre Capital Services said.

""NBFCs and HFCs fall into the higher tax bracket and would also gain. Here Bajaj Finance and some insurance players like SBI Life, HDFC Life will also benefit from the reduced tax rates,"" it added.

Prabhudas Lilladher retained its overweight rating on NBFC and increased weightage on Bajaj Finance.

""Bajaj Finance is expected to be one of the key beneficiaries of the anticipated demand recovery in the festive season, bountiful monsoons and improving operating leverage.

The government delivered just what the doctor ordered paving the way for higher growth in the economy and simultaneously giving investors the confidence that the bull cycle is still intact.

In a historic move, the FM announced bold corporate tax reforms. The reduction in the base rate of corporate tax to 22 percent (effective maximum tax rate 25.17 percent) for Financial Year 2019-20 subject to the condition that such companies will not avail any exemption/incentive is one of the boldest tax reforms.

The current base tax rate (excluding surcharge and cess) is 30 percent (effective maximum tax rate 34.944 percent) for companies having a turnover exceeding Rs 400 crores and 25 percent (effective maximum tax rate 29.12 percent) for companies having a turnover up to Rs 400 crores.

What does the tax rate cut mean for Nifty companies?

""There are only 20 Nifty companies which paid more than 30 percent effective tax rate and accounted for 43 percent of the overall net profit in FY19,” Kotak Securities said in a report.

Companies which are paying more than 30 percent tax include names like ZEE Entertainment, HDFC Bank, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindalco Industries, Axis Bank, ITC, GAIL India, and JSW Steel.

Fall in taxes will lead to a rise in EPS by double digits which is a positive sign especially at a time when earnings have been muted or largely in single digits for the last 12-18 months.

Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO, Envision Capital in an interview with CNBC-TV18 said that investors should look at buying companies with high tax rates. The other sectors which are likely to benefit are the ones in sectors like consumer, financials and technology services.

“Any company paying 33 percent tax rate will see its earnings go up by 12 percent. Overall, we can see Nifty earnings going up by ~5-6 percent in FY20 as the effective tax rate was already lower at 26 percent,” said Oza.

He further added that the sentiment booster angle and the way this will be taken positively by FIIs and local investors we can expect the Nifty to rally by 9-10 percent from today’s low of ~10,700. Hence, 11,500-11,600 is very much possible on the Nifty without considering any other factor.

The government has taken a hit on revenues of approximately Rs 1.45 lakh crore per annum by reducing corporate tax for existing companies to 22 percent (25.17 percent effective tax) from 30 percent.

There is a big boost for companies going for fresh capex and make in India as tax rates will be just 15 percent for companies making fresh investment and incorporated after 1st Oct 2019,” Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol.

Despite being a fair distance away from record-high levels, Nifty's slow but steady rise toward 12,000 is good news for the Indian markets especially as more than 50 percent of the stocks in the index are available at attractive valuations.

About 23 companies, or nearly 50%, of the Nifty50 universe is trading at a discount to their 10-year P/E multiple, data from Motilal Oswal and AceEquity showed. These include Tata Steel, ONGC, Coal India, NTPC, JSW Steel, IOC, Gail India, Axis Bank, Power Grid, among others.

Even though the valuations appear mouthwatering, the questions remains– should you buy around these levels or one should stay put or avoid getting into these stocks altogether?

Investors must note that even though these stock appear attractive based on numbers, the fundamentals may present a different story. Most experts we spoke to opined that investors should tread cautiously when it comes to these stocks.

A Price-to-Earnings ratio or PE value the company is a ratio of current market price to its earnings per share. It also referred to as multiple. This measure of valuing the company is used by investors to filter out stocks for investment.

The golden rule of investment is to pour money in stocks that are trading at attractive levels compared to their intrinsic value, thus allowing investors to create wealth over a period of time.

“We would advise not to go by only the price decline from average price as average can shift further below. Key is to look at what are the business ecosystem that can drift the positives turn profitable for the company and how it reflects on share price,” Pritam Deuskar, Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Today, it looks like as if the pharma sector has bottomed out but when it will start working nobody knows. The kind of infra spending, smart cities, airports, and construction budget till 2030 will come out, for sure some of these companies will benefit,” he said.

Well, markets are built on hope and everything gets priced well in advance. Fundamentally speaking, individual stock fundamentals and business developments matter more than just the price of the stock. Should investors bottom fish in some of these names?

“One has to carry out stock-specific analysis while bottom fishing stocks which are trading at a discount to their historical averages,” Dinesh Rohira, CEO & Founder 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“Many of these stocks are cyclical, like Tata Steel, JSW Steel, ONGC and Coal India. These stocks are driven by their commodity-related specifics. Sustainable growth plays an important role while ascertaining a stock’s fundamentals. Sun Pharma and Zee have been in the news for corporate governance reasons, one of them might be out of the woods,” he said.

How relevant are long term averages?

Long term moving averages define the price action of a security. It is a good tool to use while analyzing market movements as valuations are key while analyzing indexes, suggest experts.

The golden rule is that if the index is trading at a significant premium above the moving average then it might be a good time to sell, and vice-versa. But, it should be used with other parameters such as price to book value, as well as moving averages.

“Buying stocks that are trading at deep discounts to long term moving average works better when this happens in cyclical industries. Moving averages like 200 DMA & 30 DMA acts as a general indicator of long term and short term trends,” Romesh Tiwari, Head of Research, CapitalAim told Moneycontrol.

“It must be used with other parameters like PE ratio and Price to book value to make long term buying and selling decisions in quality stocks,” he said.

The Indian market is down by about 9 percent from its record high, which has laid down the groundwork along with other domestic and global factors for a short term rally in high beta stocks.

The conditions for sustained outperformance of high beta and interest rate sensitive stocks are not developing structurally due to the weak private investment cycle. But, the impact of dovish FED, rise in global liquidity, surplus banking liquidity, stimulus announcements, and valuations could result in a short cycle (3-5 months) beta rally, ICICI Securities said in a report.

The report further added that the best high beta and interest rate sensitive stocks to play the rally from the coverage universe include stocks like SBI, Axis Bank, BPCL, NTPC, Power Grid, L&T, and Ultratech Cement.

Over the past one week, NIFTY50 fell marginally (-0.2 percent), underperforming against developed markets (DMs) and Emerging Markets (EMs), while mid-and-smallcaps fared better, up 0.9 percent and 0.6 percent respectively in the same period.

Realty, PSU Banks, FMCG, and Consumers Durables led the fall while Metals, Infra, Auto and Power were up during the past week.

The valuations, too, turned favourable. Bond-Earnings yields spread is at 66bps (much below long-term averages or LTA). The market cap to GDP ratio is at 73 percent which is still lower than the LTA of 78 percent.

ICICI Securities highlights 6 factors which could lead to a beta rally in the near future (two-three months)

Impact of dovish FED on EM flows and currencies

The US FED bought treasuries worth US$14 billion over the past fortnight and is the first such instance of QE since it began its balance sheet reduction program in November 2017.

The dovish signal on rates and liquidity by the US FED and other central banks including India and China could result in a halt to the sharp portfolio outflows from EMs including India and halt the sharp depreciation in EM currencies.

Rising global liquidity will find its way to relatively high real yields for India

Trailing 30 days FPI flows (bonds+equities) have turned positive for India at ~US$300 million, which is also positively impacting the INR.

India real bond yield at 3.4 percent is amongst the highest within EMs and a stable INR could continue to attract foreign capital.

Surplus banking liquidity to surge further

The surplus liquidity in the banking system has consistently stayed above the Rs 1 trillion mark since July and could surge further based on the positive trends in the key drivers of liquidity.

The continued surplus liquidity will also result in excess bank reserves thereby boosting the money multiplier which dipped in FY19 to 5.6 from 5.8 in FY18.

Oil prices continue to be weak

Weakening oil prices thereby support the CAD or the current account deficit outlook while above average monsoon (3 percent surplus as of September 9) to support rural demand.

Government action on policy front

Pro-growth policy announcements and the room to spend after the RBI’s transfer of Rs 1.76 trillion to the government will keep optimism high.

Micro Triggers

The August PMI is soft but is still expanding MoM while the business optimism remains high. The weak growth narrative will continue but may not spring any negative surprise in the short term.

It is too late to exit stocks from the existing portfolio that are hitting 52-week lows, and if someone is looking to buy then this is an opportunity to pick some good names like L&T, Axis Bank, SBI, JSW or Tata Steel, Mehul Kothari, Sr Technical Analyst at IndiaNivesh Securities Limited, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts:

Q: How is the market likely to react to measures announced by the Finance Minister on August 23?

A: Nifty recovered more than 200 points from the day’s low on August 23, on the hopes that government might rollback FPI surcharge. We are likely to see a gap-up opening of around 100-150 points on August 26.

In such a scenario, 11,000 would remain an immediate hurdle for the markets.

Q: Another muted week for Indian markets weighed down by both global and domestic cues. What is your outlook on markets for the coming week?

A: Nifty not only breached the previous year’s close of 10,862 but also sneaked below the recent swing low of 10,780. We had a positional target of 10,600 on the Nifty, and in the recent session, we already saw 10,637.

Going ahead, we expect the things to settle down due to various technical factors. First and foremost, we are now in the demand zone of 10,900–10,500, where the index consolidated from Dec 2018 to Feb 2019 before shooting up to an all-time high.

We expect this to happen again. In addition, the number of oversold Nifty stocks has reached 14. Historically, we have seen that in such a situation, there is a sharp pullback in the markets.

Further, in derivatives, the long-to-short ratio of FIIs in index futures has dipped below 30. Since Feb 2018, we observed that such large short positions in index futures are followed by short covering in the index.

Thus, all the above factors indicate that there could be a bounce in the index in the coming weeks in the range of 11,000–11,180. This view will be negated once the Nifty breaks 10,500 decisively.

Q: More than 500 stocks hit a fresh 52-week low on the BSE on August 23, mostly from the small and mid-cap space. What should investors do if they hold any of them in their portfolio?

A: It’s too late to exit the stocks from the existing portfolio if they are of good quality. In fact, for fresh buyers, this is an opportunity to buy some good names like L&T, Axis Bank, SBI, JSW or Tata Steel.

Q: What is your call on the rupee which has already hit 8-month low?

A: For the near term, technically, we expect 72.50 to act as strong resistance for the USD-INR pair which has already reached 72.00 mark.

Before clearing 72.50 on the upside, we expect the pair to retest 71-70.50 levels in the coming weeks. Thus, there could be some recovery in the rupee.

Q: Any big triggers that investors have to watch for the coming week?

A: Yes, the outcome of the Jackson Hole meeting is of much importance for medium-to-long-term investors since it will lay out the trajectory for interest rates in the US.

However, for short-term traders, we have the F&O expiry on the domestic front, which is nowadays not a big event (after the introduction of weekly options). We expect the series to end on a higher-end, at least from the current levels.

Sticky lending rates on home, auto and other loans may see some respite as banks have started passing on the benefits of past policy rate cuts. While some lenders have decided to link retail loans to the central bank's policy rate, Axis Bank is of the view that there are other ways to carry out monetary transmission.

Axis Bank's executive director Rajiv Anand said that liquidity surplus in the banking system will allow lenders to cut lending rates even under the existing framework of marginal-cost based lending rate (MCLR).

His comments come on the day when RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that the central bank expects lenders to take the initiative on external benchmarking and speed up the process to support economic growth. Das also indicated that the regulator may formalise the arrangement for better transmission.

""It is not necessary to use only external benchmarks, there are multiple avenues such that we are able to meet the requirement that the RBI wants. Given the fact that the underlying liquidity is very easy, the ability of banks now to be able to pass on, what you will now find that...even with the MCLR environment, transmission will certainly be much faster than what you've seen so far,"" Anand said.

Anand also pointed out that linking retail loans to policy rate may not be the way to go as it is more volatile than MCLR. ""Generally, we have seen that retail customers, when the rates are falling, they want to see faster transmission but remember that faster transmission will happen on the way up as well,"" he said, adding that corporate houses may prefer rates linked to policy rates since they are better placed to manage interest rate risks.

On August 17, Axis Bank lowered its MCLR by 10 basis points across tenors, in response to RBI's policy rate cut of 35 basis points earlier this month.

The RBI relased a report on external benchmarking more than a year ago but hadn't made it mandatory for banks yet. State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest lender, was the first to voluntarily link some of its lending rates to RBI's repo rate in May 2019. Other lenders, especially state-owned, are now following the big brother but with a lag.

Punjab National Bank's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Sunil Mehta said that within a week's time, the lender will come up with a set of loan products to be benchmarked to the policy rate. Last week, lenders including Union Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank announced that they will link some lending rates to RBI's repo rate.

Meanwhile, SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said that the bank will link more loan products with repo rate for new customers depending upon their liability behaviour.",472,0.9999887943267822

Petitioner Mohanish Jabalpure, in his plea filed last week, said the state government, through a circular on May 11, 2017, effected transfer of the bank accounts of police officials and beneficiaries of Sanjay Gandhi Niradhar Yojana to the private bank.

The petition alleged the chief minister misused his power and promoted Axis Bank, causing losses to nationalised banks.

The petition is likely to come up for hearing in the Nagpur bench of the high court by the end of this month.

Jabalpure has prayed for the high court's direction for revocation of the government circular and all approvals, agreements, permissions and actions taken in pursuance of it.

The market was under pressure in July, due to renewed worries over the US-China trade war, concerns over economic slowdown and the income-tax surcharge on foreign portfolio investors.

The mutual fund (MF) industry also experienced the heat of selloff. Nevertheless, it still fared better than the pack of heavyweights in Nifty.

In July 2019, cumulative equity assets under management (AUM) stood at Rs 6,84,200 crore, down 5.46 percent while the benchmark Nifty corrected by 5.7 percent.

As per data from Edelweiss Securities, the major contribution to the inflows of equity schemes came from large cap, focused, mid cap and small cap funds to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore.

Fund managers added large-cap private banks, utilities, energy and select FMCG names, whereas exposure to NBFCs and auto was reduced.

Edelweiss Securities in its report has listed 6 stocks which received inflows worth over Rs 1,000 crore each.

Private lender Axis Bank emerged at the top among those stocks as fund managers bought in shares worth Rs 2,145 crore.

Next came ICICI Bank as fund managers bought in shares worth for Rs 1,863 crore.

GAIL was bought to the tune of Rs 1,251 crore while HDFC Bank witnessed an inflow of Rs 1,179 crore. ITC saw inflows to the tune of Rs 1,056 crore and Larsen & Toubro was bought to the tune of Rs 1,051 crore, respectively, in July.

Other than these six stocks, Reliance Industries (Rs 952 crore), Tata Consultancy Services (Rs 743 crore), NTPC (Rs 689 crore), Titan Company (Rs 512 crore), Coal India (Rs 432 crore) and Bajaj Finance (Rs 383 crore) also witnessed decent inflows.

On the contrary, Infosys led the pack of stocks which saw offloading of positions by fund managers. Fund managers offloaded Rs 630 crore in the stock.

Shriram Transport Finance Company (Rs 489 crore), UPL ( Rs 458 crore), Mindtree (Rs 436 crore) and Indian Oil Corporation (Rs 304 crore) were among the other stocks that witnessed outflow of in July.",339,-0.03538305560747782

Axis Bank has settled a case related to alleged violation of debenture trustee norms with Sebi, after paying Rs 2.43 crore towards settlement charges. According to the private sector lender's website, ""Axis Bank is a Sebi-registered debenture trustee.""

The adjudication proceedings against Axis Bank were initiated after the regulator sent a show cause notice in June 2018 on observing violations of debenture trustee regulations.

It was alleged that the bank had ""lent to issuer companies to which it also extended debenture trustee services"" and also failed to obtain quarterly reports from the issuer companies.

Besides, non-incorporation of mandatory clauses in trust deed and lack of due diligence to ensure compliance of listing agreement by the issuer company were among the allegations.

Also, the lender was alleged to have falsely reported that corrective steps had been taken since previous inspection.

However, while the case proceedings were pending, Axis Bank filed a settlement application with Sebi ""without admitting the findings of fact and conclusions of law"".

In May 2019, the lender in its meeting with the internal committee of Sebi proposed terms to settle the alleged defaults.

The amount of Rs 2.43 crore after approval of a panel comprising Sebi's whole-time members was remitted by Axis Bank on July 19, 2019, for the settlement.

Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said proceedings for the defaults have been disposed of.",233,-0.8941103518009186

State-run banks may approve personal, auto and home loans online in 59 minutes, according to a proposal that they discussed with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as one of the measures to create demand and boost the economy, officials aware of the discussions said, requesting anonymity.

The discussions were first of a series of meetings that the government has planned over the next week with executives of several industries, Sitharaman said on August 5, promising steps to improve the state of the economy ‘fairly quickly’.

India’s economy has been facing a slowdown for about a year. The core sector growth in June slowed to 0.2 percent, the lowest monthly growth since May 2015, and weak demand forced many automobile companies to temporarily halt production.

Among the interventions discussed on August 5 was easing access to credit. The bankers suggested the in-principle approval limit on psbloansin59minutes.com portal, which is meant for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) businesses, be raised to Rs 5 crore from Rs 1 crore.

It also suggested opening up the portal to retail customers looking for home, car or personal loans, said one of the officials, asking not to be named.

Launched on November 2 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the 59-minute loan portal — which lets businesses apply for instant loans without having to visit banks — has led to 1.3 million loans being sanctioned till July 17, the Finance Ministry said in a statement to the Rajya Sabha.

“It certainly helps borrowers as it makes the process easy for them, but banks will not give loans without proper verification and documentation. Extending the same for personal and housing loans may help revive demand in sectors such as automobiles,” said a senior executive of a leading government-run bank, asking not to be named.

The August 5 meeting included senior Finance Ministry officials and top executives of banks including State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank. “Today’s meeting is the first of a series of meetings that the Finance Ministry is convening to discuss current economic issues with key stakeholders, including some of the industry sectors whose growth has been affected in recent months,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement after the meeting.

Speaking at a press conference after the banking sector review meeting, Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar said the minister will hold similar meetings with representatives of other sectors: MSMEs on August 6, automobile on August 7, financial markets on August 9, and real estate and homebuyers on August 11.

Sitharaman also said the Finance Ministry will hold discussions with representatives of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) and discuss their concerns on the budget decision to impose a surcharge on the super-rich.

“I am quite open to hear them out what they have to say,” she said, adding that the meeting will be held by Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty soon. “The Budget, presented on July 5, raised surcharge to 25 percent from 15 percent on taxable income between Rs 2 crore and Rs 5 crore, and from 15 percent to 37 percent for income above Rs 5 crore. Although, it was not intended for FPIs, it applies to those FPIs that operate as trusts or as association of persons. FPIs operating as corporates do not attract the surcharge,” she said.

She clarified that the government has not taken any decision about how much or when it plans to issue the proposed sovereign bonds. Since the announcement, nothing more has been done in this regard due to the Ministry’s preoccupations with key legislations including amendments to the IBC, she added.",604,0.3322731852531433

Most state-run banks indicated plans for raising equity current financial year to maintain the minimum capital adequacy levels.

However, their capability to successfully tap markets depends upon recoveries from bad loan resolutions that are stuck at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

The delay is adding to provisioning burden and wiping out lenders’ profits.

SBI Q1: Expect net interest margin at 3.1% for FY20, says Chairman Rajnish Kumar

State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar expects limited improvement of the bank's net interest margins (NIMs) this financial year on the back of muted credit growth and a lack of room for further reduction in the cost of funds.

It will be very difficult for the bank to push margins up in a significant manner in the current scenario where credit growth is muted, Kumar said on an earnings call on August 2.

He added that while there could be some change in term deposit rates, the lender has done whatever it could in terms of bringing down the cost of funds.

Mumbai-based Union Bank of India plans to raise Rs 2,000-3,000 crore equity in the October-December quarter this financial year to boost capital adequacy and support credit growth.

The bank’s capital adequacy ratio stood at 11.43 percent, with Tier-1 at 9.27 percent and Common Equity Tier-1 ratio at 7.87 percent, as of June 30.

The state-owned bank will take the Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) route for fund raising and has started the process of shortlisting advisors, the bank’s MD and CEO Rajkiran Rai G said on August 2.

Arihant Capital 's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank reported strong operating profit growth of 35% YoY on the back of strong trading income and lower operating expenses but due to 14% YoY/41% QoQ rise in provisioning led to a lower PAT of Rs 1370 cr. NII for the quarter grew by 13% YoY/2.4% QoQ to Rs 5844 cr while other income grew by 32% YoY to Rs 3869 cr. Other income growth was mainly driven by healthy treasury gain and strong fee income growth. Cost-income ratio declined by ~640bps QoQ primarily, due to pullback in non-employee cost.

Outlook

We have valued the stock at the P/ABV of 2.5x to its FY21E and arrived at a fair value of Rs 712 per share giving an upside of 7%. At CMP of Rs 669 the stock is available at its FY21E P/ABV of 2.3(x). We have a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis bank's earnings came in lower than estimates at Rs13.7bn (PLe: Rs18.6bn) despite better other income and strong opex gains which were offset by higher contingency provisions and slightly slower NII. Bank gave out new & additional disclosure on stress book outside the BB & Below which were Rs71.0bn (adjusted for already in below BB & NPA) which is another 1.3% of assets taking overall stress close to 3.0%. Although, bank has been making additional provisions (Rs23bn of contingent provisions) over and above and maintaining PCR at 62%. Risks have increased to asset quality and so has credit cost assumptions (interest reversals with that) making it quite tougher for bank to reach the desired targeted ROEs of 15/18% by FY21/FY22.

Outlook

We retain our cautious stance with ACCUMULATE rating though post recent correction valuations have come into desirable zone but still higher than some other peer banks. We revise our TP to Rs766 (from Rs837) based on 2.4x (from 2.6x) Mar-21 ABV.

Axis Bank posted mixed results for Q1 FY20 where the operational performance was in-line, but the asset quality performance deteriorated. Addition to the stressed pool by Rs 10,000 crore is an overhang on the stock. With total non-NPL stress now at 4% of loans, these disclosures are likely to delay the RoE expansion cycle for the bank and lead to a rise in credit costs.

After HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, Axis Bank has now indicated that credit growth may take a hit in the coming quarters as the impact of slowdown intensifies. The private lender also beefed up additional provisioning to absorb any shocks in asset quality going ahead.

""There will be quarters where our growth rates would be modest and others in which it will be brisk. We are equally okay with both,"" Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director, Axis Bank said in an earnings call on July 30. He added that the bank will continue with its conservative approach to credit growth rather than chase targets.

Axis Bank clocked 19 percent growth in domestic advances in the April-June quarter. Chaudhry said the bank has enough opportunities to deliver domestic credit growth of 5-7 percent above industry growth rates for the next couple of years.

""Domestic growth continues to remain soft with weaknesses seen in multiple high-frequency indicators. Auto sales are weak and demand for capital growth remains slack,"" Chaudhry said. ""Transmission of lower interest rates, coupled with easier liquidity conditions can boost credit offtake and trigger a revival in private sector capex demand,"" he added.

The private lender also said it is re-calibrating existing exposure to dealers in the auto sector that is witnessing the slowest pace of growth in a decade.

In the April-June quarter, Axis Bank posted a net profit of Rs 1,370 crore, almost double as compared to the figure in the same quarter last financial year. However, provisioning rose to Rs 3,815 crore, higher than Rs 2,711 crore in the previous quarter and Rs 3,338 crore in the first quarter last year.

Axis Bank added Rs 994 crore to its contingency provisioning pool in the April-June quarter, taking the total provisioning over and above the required norms to Rs 2,358 crore. Its provisioning coverage ratio slightly improved to 78 percent from 77 percent from the previous quarter.

The bank's riskier assets compiled in the 'BB & below' list grew by Rs 2,242 crore in the first quarter and stood at Rs 7,504 crores. Over Rs 1,000 crore of this book slipped into non-performing assets (NPA) category in the first quarter.

The bank has also started providing for non-funded exposure in 'BB & below' book along with Special Mention Accounts (SMA)-2 advances, NPAs and written-off accounts.

Private sector lender Axis Bank's June quarter (Q1) profit grew sharply by 95 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,370 crore, but provisioning and slippages remained higher. It was supported by NII, other income and operating profit.

The profitability was higher due to the low base in a year-ago period. The bank had reported a profit of Rs 701 crore in Q1FY19.

Net interest income increased 13 percent year-on-year to Rs 5,843.65 crore in the quarter ended June 2019, with 13 percent loan growth YoY.

""We continued to grow loan book cautiously and steadily. Domestic loan growth stood at 19 percent and retail loan book grew 22 percent YoY while domestic corporate loan book increased 16 percent YoY,"" the private sector lender said, adding deposits rose 21 percent YoY.

Numbers missed analyst expectations. Profit was expected at Rs 1,897.2 crore and net interest income at Rs 5,910.7 crore for the quarter, according to a poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18.

Gross slippages remained higher at Rs 4,798 crore at the end of June quarter 2019, against Rs 4,337 crore in the corresponding period of the last fiscal and Rs 3,012 crore in Q4FY19.

""Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs during the quarter were Rs 2,177 crore while write-offs were Rs 3,005 crore. Consequently, net slippages for the quarter stood at Rs 2,621 crore compared to Rs 636 crore in Q4FY19 and Rs 1,420 crore in Q1FY19,"" the bank said.

The bank downgraded Rs 2,242 crore into the BB pool this quarter, mostly from groups that have shown new signs of stress in recent months. Post this action, its BB and below rated book remained largely stable QoQ and stood at Rs 7,504 crore, it said.

Asset quality remained stable in Q1. Gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances declined 1 basis point sequentially to 5.25 percent and net NPA also slipped 2bps to 2.04 percent during the quarter.

Provisions continued to be elevated in the quarter ended June at Rs 3,814.6 crore, higher by 41 percent over the previous quarter and increased 14.3 percent compared to the year-ago period.

Provision coverage ratio, as a proportion of gross NPAs including prudential write-offs, improved to 78 percent in Q1, from 77 percent in previous quarter.

Non-interest income (other income) grew by 32.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,868.8 crore, driven by fee income growth of 26 percent YoY and operating profit jumped 35 percent to Rs 5,892.8 crore in Q1 on controlled operating expenses.

At least five banks are planning to raise an aggregate of Rs 62,000 crore in funds this year, according to a report by The Economic Times.

Three public sector banks (PSBs) – State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank – and two private lenders – Axis Bank and RBL Bank – are looking to raise capital to fuel growth.

It is expected that the fundraising will also help the banks grab market share from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).

SBI intends to raise Rs 17,000 crore through the issue of bonds, the report said. Of this, Rs 7,000 crore will be raised as additional Tier 1 capital (AT1).

Axis Bank plans to raise Rs 18,000 crore through a combination of qualified institutional placements and depository receipts.

Axis Bank has already announced its intention to raise Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 crore.

“We will raise capital in the next few months. It will happen this fiscal. We have taken an enabling resolution for raising between Rs 3,000 crore and Rs 3,500 crore, which was confirmed in the AGM last week,” RBL Bank CEO Vishwavir Ahuja told The Economic Times earlier in July.

Canara Bank, too, has announced a plan to raise up to Rs 12,000 crore through a mix of equity and bonds.

Bank of Baroda intends to raise Rs 1,500 crore through employee share purchase scheme (ESPS) and Rs 4,500 crore through AT1 bonds.",246,0.9999994039535522

Axis Bank, India's fourth-largest private sector lender by market capitalisation, is expected to report healthy numbers for June quarter (Q1) on July 30. The earnings result will be closely watched by the Dalal Street especially after its closest peer ICICI Bank reported better-than-expected earnings on all fronts.

Most brokerages expect more than two-fold increase in its Q1FY20 profit on lower provisioning and stable operational income YoY. They also expect double-digit growth in NII and the loan book, compared to year-ago, with stable asset quality.

""Traction in advances is seen improving 15 percent YoY led by a focus on high yielding retail and MSME loans. A decline in G-Sec yield is expected to aid trading income leading to a positive impact on PAT. PAT is seen at Rs 1,725 crore on the back of a stable operational performance and lower provisions,"" ICICI direct said.

The lender had reported a profit of Rs 701.1 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year and Rs 1,505.1 crore in Q4FY19.

According to Narnolia Securities, the loan book is expected to grow by 17 percent YoY with healthy all-round growth across the segment.

Earlier, the management said it expected the domestic loan book to grow 5-7 percent above the industry level while the international book is expected to stabilise in the next two quarters.

The retail segment is likely to be driven by home loan and unsecured loan book, Narnolia said, adding that the bank's strategy on retail assets continues to centre existing customer base. 83 percent of retail assets originations in Q4 were from existing customers.

On the asset quality front, ICICI direct said with no material exposure towards IL&FS, ADAG group, DHFL, etc. slippages are seen lower leading to lower credit cost of 46 bps, and asset quality is expected to largely remain stable with GNPA ratio at 5.2 percent.

The bank is also expected to report double-digit growth in non-interest income (other income), as well as in operating income, which will also boost profitability.

""Other income is expected to grow by 20 percent YoY driven by healthy fee income and treasury profit during the quarter. Corporate fee income is also expected to pick up going ahead,"" said Narnolia which expects pre-provision operating profit growth at 16 percent YoY.

Key issues to look out for include quantum of corporate slippages from BB and below list and any revision in the size of the stressed assets, outlook on the power assets and CASA performance.

Top lenders expressed their disappointment over NCLAT order in Essar Steel case this week, which ruled out the distribution ratio decided by the Committee of Creditors, and asked for more equitable share among operational creditors. Its been more than two quarters since the resolution has been stuck in IBC, which is adding to lenders' discontentment. They are now second guessing the entire process.

Essar Steel: Parity with operational creditors a huge disincentive, says SBI Chairman

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's (NCLAT) recent judgement in the Essar Steel case, which draws parity between secured and operational creditors, may drive away banks from approaching the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) route for resolutions going ahead. While lenders are gearing up to challenge the NCLAT's ruling in Supreme Court, there is hope that amendments will be made in the IBC law to ensure faster resolutions in future.

NBFC crisis not a systemic issue but may take time to resolve: Amitabh Chaudhry, Axis Bank MD

The ongoing crisis in non-banking finance companies (NBFC) is related to specific companies and not for the sector as a whole, but the time taken to resolve the issue is becoming a matter of concern, said Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Axis Bank. Chaudhry said that the promoters of NBFCs that are in need of capital should look at bringing in equity infusion without further delay. He added that relying on regulatory and government intervention to bail out sick NBFCs would seem unfair.

The ongoing crisis in non-banking finance companies (NBFC) is related to specific companies and not for the sector as a whole but the time being taken to resolve the issue is becoming a matter of concern, said Amitabh Chaudhry, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Axis Bank.

""Crisis is right now related to specific companies with asset-liability mismatch or where people are raising questions about asset quality. There are enough NBFCs with no issues. While it is not a systemic issue, the worry is that it will take time to resolve,"" Chaudhry said.

Chaudhry said that promoters of NBFCs that are in need of capital should look at bringing in equity infusion without further delay. He added that relying on regulatory and government intervention to bail out sick NBFCs would seem unfair.

In the Financial Stability Report released in June, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that in case of further stress, around eight percent of NBFCs will fail to maintain the minimum regulatory capital requirements.

To enhance liquidity access for the sector, the government announced one-time 6-month partial guarantee of Rs 1 lakh crore to state-run banks for purchasing consolidated high-rated pooled assets of financially-sound NBFCs. The move was immediately followed up with liquidity easing measures by the RBI.

""In order to enable the banks to implement this announcement and deal with the NBFCs/HFCs issue effectively, the RBI will provide required liquidity backstop to banks against their excess G-Sec holdings,"" the central bank said in a release issued after the Budget announcement on July 4.

The IL&FS defaults created an environment of risk aversion, leading to shortage of liquidity in the sector. Investors, including mutual funds, cut their exposure to the NBFC sector, leaving them with no option but to turn to banks. As of March 2019, the share of bank loans to total borrowings rose to 29.2 percent from 23.6 percent in March 2018 and 21.2 percent in March 2017, data from RBI showed.

The budget also proposed strengthening RBI's regulatory powers over NBFCs. Chaurdhry said that this could help bring back investor confidence in the sector.",361,-0.5960586190223693

To tap the growing pool of online retail shoppers, private lender Axis Bank and e-commerce giant Flipkart have launched a credit card. To woo customers, the credit card will offer ""unlimited cashback"".

Under the partnership, Axis Bank and Flipkart expect to issue one million cards within a year.

""We want to be the fastest co-branded card to reach a million. We'll get there within a year,"" said Sanjeev Moghe, executive vice-president, cards and payments, Axis Bank.

Apart from Flipkart, the card offers cashback on Myntra and 2GUD. It carries benefits for users of MakeMyTrip, Goibibo, Uber, PVR, Gaana, Curefit, UrbanClap. The card is powered by Mastercard.

Banks are increasingly resorting to cashback offers to lure customers, despite some frauds being detected in the recent past.

In May, Citibank launched a co-branded credit card with mobile wallet Paytm -- backed by Visa -- which was loaded with cashback offers. This was shortly after Alibaba-backed payments portal reported a cashback fraud of over Rs 10 crore on its e-commerce arm-Paytm Mall. Following the fraud, over 100 sellers were de-listed by the company and over 10 employees were sacked.

Porush Singh, Divisional President for Mastercard - South Asia, said on July 11 that the cashback feature was aimed at enabling better market penetration in India.

""One-third of consumer spending is going to come from cities where the population is less than 10 lakhs. So as we go into these areas, we have to create the right value proposition for those people who are not looking for miles. Hence, the cashback,"" Singh added.

Talking about the ban on Merchant Discount Rate (MDR), Singh said that global payments companies will evaluate the way forward after seeking clarifications on the latest law.

As part of Union Budget 2019, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that banks or merchants with annual turnover of over Rs 50 crore will no longer be allowed to charge MDR to customers. The move was aimed to encourage use of digital payments instead of cash.",342,0.10698184967041016

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank's (AXSB) annual report analysis reveals the bank's focus on improving its earnings metrics and asset quality. As part of its FY20-22 strategy, AXSB targets an RoE of 18% by FY22, with credit cost, opex and business mix identified as the key drivers for the achievement of this goal. Digital initiatives at the bank are gaining traction, with 43% of its personal loans sourced digitally versus 22% in FY18. Also, the bank's market share in credit cards expanded to 12.4% from 5% in FY13, helping it become the fourth largest credit card issuer in the country. The concentration in top 20 advances/exposures improved by 171bp/86bp YoY to 8.6%/12.4% in FY19. However, on the liability side, the concentration of top-20 depositors increased by 39bp YoY to 11.8%. The bank has shifted its deposit strategy away from CASA to 'CASA + retail term deposits'. Though the bank has strong management team and a well-articulated strategy in place the execution is going to be critical to deliver long-term sustainable growth and earnings. NPL cycle has shown improvement signs and we estimate earnings to recover though credit cost trajectory can still remain uneven given sluggish macro.

Outlook

We thus estimate RoA/RoE to improve to 1.4%/17.0% by FY21 and maintain our Buy rating with a TP of INR925 (2.7x FY21E ABV + INR42 for subsidiaries).

The IL&FS crisis has not only affected borrowers of the beleaguered company but also hurt the confidence of investors in the Indian financial market leading to a liquidity crisis situation.

Companies like Dewan Housing, Reliance Capital (ADAG Group) and Indiabulls Housing Finance have suffered the most in this meltdown. Hence, it is time to move out of stocks that are under stress to more stable stocks such as SBI and Axis Bank, ICICIdirect said in a report.

Rating agencies have downgraded Dewan Housing Finance, Reliance Home Finance and Reliance Commercial Finance to D (Default).

Most of the housing finance companies (HFCs) are also suffering from an asset-liability mismatch apart from high funding costs in a tight liquidity scenario.

The domestic brokerage firm is of the view that in the current NBFC crisis, banks are the real beneficiaries both on costs (due to rich CASA) and asset (due to market share gains, competitiveness).

A sharp decline in 10-year G-sec yields to 6.8 percent is expected to result in treasury gains. The asset quality for banks is on a recovering trajectory while larger case resolution should add to the profitability of large corporate banks such as SBI and Axis Bank, added the ICICIdirect report.

Here’s why ICICIdirect recommends SBI & Axis Bank as top buys:

State Bank of India: Buy| Target: Rs 400

SBI and corporate banks, in general, have been underperformers in the past few years due to slower economic growth, muted credit demand and asset quality concerns.

Also for SBI, the merger of subsidiaries was an overhang as GNPA from subsidiaries and higher employee cost burden was to be provided. Most of the asset quality concerns are fading.

The bank has around 15-18 percent exposure to NCLT accounts and 10 percent exposure in stressed power assets. So, the bank is poised to benefit from the faster resolution of these NCLT accounts.

In terms of valuation, the bank is trading attractively at ~1.2x FY21E ABV. With improving return ratio, the brokerage firm expects the bank to trade at ~1.5x ABV with a target price of 400 (includes subsidiaries valuation).

Axis Bank: Buy| Target: Rs 880

Axis Bank is one of the large private sector banks with advances at Rs 4,94,798 crore and deposits at Rs 5,48,472 crore. Weakening asset quality has been a major pain point for large corporate banks including Axis Bank in the last few years.

High concentration to the power sector, particularly stressed ones had been a key concern in the past. The rise in stressed assets wiped the profitability of the bank to Rs 276 crore in FY18 compared to Rs 3679 crore in FY17.

Exposure to BB and below rated corporate is on the continuous decline and now stands at just Rs 7,467 crore or 1.3 percent of bank’s customer assets. However, the bank is poised to benefit from the faster resolution of NCLT cases. Provision coverage stands healthy at 77 percent.

With the bulk of the pain recognised, lower exposure to IL&FS and anticipated recovery of large stressed cases referred to NCLT, expect GNPA ratio to improve to ~4 percent by FY21E.

In terms of valuations, the stock is currently trading at ~2.5x FY21E ABV. With the revival in profitability and thereby return ratios, the bank is poised for a re-rating. Therefore, we expect the bank to trade at 2.9x FY21E ABV with a target of Rs 880.

Axis Bank shares gained 0.4 percent intraday on June 26 after global research firm Macquarie upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and raised target price by 22 percent.

The brokerage increased its target to Rs 925 from Rs 760 to factor in capital raise and higher valuation multiple on lower credit costs.

""Bank is focusing on de-risking balance sheet and improving the relationship with corporates and we like this new Axis Bank and will keenly watch for return on assets improvement,"" Macquarie said.

In addition, while maintaining neutral call on the stock, JPMorgan also hiked target price to Rs 850 from Rs 720, implying 9 percent potential upside from current levels.

The franchise has levers to deliver on return on equity guidance and execution remains key, the brokerage said, adding credit cost normalisation is likely to be gradual and margin improvement can be difficult.

Private sector lender Axis Bank has set a target of achieving 18 per cent Return on Equity (ROE) on sustainable basis as cost of funds is on decline. The ROE of the bank stood at 8.09 per cent at the end of March 2019.

""Our aspiration is to deliver around 18 per cent Return On Equity (ROE) on a sustainable basis. The reduction in credit cost to below our long-term averages, portfolio choices driven by a risk-adjusted returns framework and improvement in operational efficiency would be the key drivers for RoE improvement over the next three years,"" Axis Bank CEO Amitabh Chaudhry said in the annual report.

Though it seems a tall order, the lender has delivered ROEs in excess of 18 per cent few years back and hence the bank aspire to do it again - on a sustainable and consistent basis.

""In recent years, driven in part by some unexpected negative surprises at the Bank, we have dented the trust of investors. We need to win it back. The only way to win it back is to have a business model, which sustains and generates credible financial outcomes quarter after quarter over a long period of time,"" it said.

From the perspective of the financial industry as a whole, the liquidity issues faced by some of the non-banking financial companies and housing finance companies over the last year can create some friction going ahead, but it presents opportunities for banks, it added.

The banking industry has seen return of credit growth and pricing power on account of shift in credit demand from NBFCs and bond markets back to banks, the lender said, adding banks with a healthy capital position, NBFCs with a robust parentage and financial intermediaries with significant market share are well placed to grow profitably, at a faster pace than their peers in their respective industries.

In this context, it said, 'One Axis' franchise with its presence across business segments is uniquely positioned to leverage this opportunity and grow at a faster pace. Great product mix, vast physical footprint, cutting-edge digital capabilities, robust corporate governance practices and one of the most valuable brands in India - all these combined open many possibilities for the Axis franchise in the near future.",387,0.929873545964559

ICICI Bank and Axis Bank shares fell around a percent each intraday on June 4 after global rating agency Fitch downgraded both by a notch saying financial health of the private sector banks has weakened.

Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 809.90, down Rs 2.40, or 0.30 percent, and ICICI Bank was down 0.48 percent at Rs 420.80 on the BSE at 0952 hours IST.

Fitch Ratings said it has downgraded ICICI Bank as well as Axis Bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB+' from 'BBB-' and its Viability Rating to 'bb+' from 'bbb-'. The Outlook on the IDR is Stable, it said.

It has also affirmed banks' Support Rating at '3' and Support Rating Floor at 'BB+'.

BB rating indicates speculative grade while BBB points at good credit quality.

Fitch lowered its midpoint for India's operating environment to 'bb+' from 'bbb-' following a review of the banking sector's performance, particularly in the last three years, and its regulatory framework, as well as the outlook in the near term.

""We also compared India with other sovereign jurisdictions in Asia rated in the 'BBB' category including the key metrics of GDP per capita and the ease-of-doing-business ranking,"" it said.

The rating agency concluded the sector will perform below the average of its peers over the next one to two years in spite of its expectations of high economic growth and improving business prospects in India.

The performance of Indian banks should have largely bottomed, but the sector is still struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalisation, it said.

Global brokerage house, CLSA sees limited impact from revision in credit ratings by Fitch to below investment grade. ""Downgrade comes on the back of Fitch’s concerns about the operating environment. While Fitch rates Axis' instruments, its ratings on ICICI Bank are unsolicited,"" it said.

According to the brokerage, rating downgrade may not have any material impact on their earnings but risks can arise from downgrades by other agencies.

CLSA expects banks to see 15-16 percent return on equities by FY21. It maintains buy ratings on both.

Axis Bank June 3 said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved appointment of Rakesh Makhija as chairman of the bank. The board of the bank in March had approved appointment of Makhija as chairman subject to RBI clearance.

""We would like to inform you that RBI vide its letter dated 3151 May 2019 has approved the appointment of Rakesh Makhija (DIN: 00117692), independent director as the non-executive (part-time) chairman of the bank, for a period of 3 years, with effect from July 18, 2019, up to July 17, 2022 (both days inclusive),"" Axis Bank said in a regulatory filing.

Makhija has been an active participant and contributor to the industrial and technology sectors, both internationally and in India during his career spanning over four decades.

He has held a number of top management positions within the SKF Group. Prior to joining SKF, he was the chief executive officer and managing director of Tata Honeywell Ltd.",170,

In a statement, the agency said it has issued a ""provisional attachment order under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), attaching movable and immovable properties worth Rs 2,95,92,351 of Puneet Jain, Hemraj Singh, Vinod Deshmukh, Rajeev Singh Kushwaha, Mehfooz Khan, Pravesh Kumar Gandhi and others in the Axis bank demonetised currency conversion case"".

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had filed a criminal case in the matter based on an FIR filed by the Delhi Police after it seized Rs 3.70 crore in old notes of Rs 1,000 in 2016.

Demonetisation of old Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016.

""Investigation revealed that on announcement of demonetisation policy, accused Mohit Garg, Nitin Gupta, Vineet Gupta, Shobhit Sinha and Axis bank officials used shell companies like M/s Beagle Marketing, M/s Sunrise Trading Co, M/s R D Traders, M/s Himalayan Traders of Rajeev Singh Kushwaha for illegal exchange of demonetised currency of Vinod Deshmukh, Puneet Jain, Hemraj Singh, Pravesh Kumar Gandhi and others,"" it said.

The ED said Mohit Garg, Nitin Gupta and Rajeev Singh Kushwaha used to collect demonetised currency from people and deposited them in the account of shell firms operated by Kushwaha.

""This was done with the help of Axis Bank officials. The amount deposited in these shell companies were further transferred to the account of different bullion traders for buying gold.

""Thus, they converted demonetised currency into gold/RTGS form on commission basis and illegally exchanged demonetized currency into gold,"" it said.

Investigation also revealed that demonetised currency worth of Rs 40 crore of different persons was converted in this manner, the ED charged.

Kushwaha, Vineet Gupta and Shobhit Sinha -- all officials at the Axis Bank's Kashmere Gate branch -- were arrested by the ED in this case and at present they are out on bail.

The employees were later removed by the bank.

The ED has filed two charge sheets in this case till now.",365,

Amitabh Chaudhry and Ravneet Gill, the new heads of private sector lenders Axis Bank and YES Bank, have hit the ground running. They've announced a series of measures to treat deep-rooted issues plaguing the lenders like deteriorating asset quality and high slippages, the two major reasons why the banking regulator was unhappy with the previous CEOs.

While Axis Bank managed to go back to making profits, YES Bank slipped in red and posted its biggest quarterly loss ever. However, there are some of the common steps that both lenders have announced:

Conservative approach to growth

Both banks have now adopted a calibrated business model, with reasonable growth targets and an aim to stabilise the pace going forward. Axis bank, on a mend since past year, aims to achieve credit growth at 500-700 basis points higher than the banking system in the current financial year. The system loan growth was at 13 percent for FY18.

YES Bank’s Gill also pulled in the reins on the bank’s aggressive credit growth targets and decided to grow at half the pace going forward. The bank has pegged credit growth at 20-25 percent for the current financial year. For March-ended 2019, the bank's loan book grew by 18.7 percent over last year and shrunk by 1 percent over the previous quarter. It had registered a growth of 53.9 percent in 2017-18 and 34.7 percent in 2016-17.

Focus on retail deposits

Chaudhry, who took over in January 2019, said that Axis bank has reoriented its entire organisational structure in both retail and wholesale businesses, in order to streamline and simplify the bank’s functioning. “On the liabilities side, the dedicated focus is on acquiring and servicing deposit customers. In the retail lending business, the team is now organised in a product-focused structure and into a smaller but larger number of regions,” he said.

Gill also expressed intent on shoring up YES bank’s low-cost deposits. He said that the bank is currently looking to fill a senior position who will drive the retail liabilities growth for the bank.

Agressive Provisioning against stressed sectors

It's the start of fourth quarterly earnings season for lenders and both Axis Bank and YES Bank have set the trend of setting aside chunks of contingency provisioning.

Axis Bank has marked Rs 1,300 crore of provisioning against self-identified stressed assets, over and above the regulatory norms, while YES Bank allocated Rs 2,100 crore for around Rs 10,000 crore worth of assets of below investment grade rating identified on its loan book. It expects half of these loans to slip into the non-performing assets (NPA) category in future.",443,-0.047481914361317955

Private sector lender Axis Bank on April 26 said it plans to raise Rs 35,000 crore debt instrument, including in foreign currency, to fund business growth.

The decision in this regard will be taken at the annual general meeting held on July 20.

The board has already given an approval to raise funds in Indian or foreign currency by issue of debt instruments including but not limited to long-term bonds, non-convertible debentures, perpetual debt instruments and tier-II capital bonds up to an amount of Rs 35,000 crore, Axis Bank said in a regulatory filing.

The bank has reported a net profit of Rs 1,505 crore for the March quarter of 2018-19 as against a net loss of Rs 2,188 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.

Gross non-performing assets as percentage of loans has declined to 5.26 per cent in the March quarter of 2018-19, from 6.77 per cent in the year-ago period.",168,0.12384673953056335

Axis Bank reported good set of numbers for Q4FY19 led by 62% YoY decline in provisions and hence 37% growth in operating profits. Its NII grew by ~21% YoY in Q4FY19 led by healthy loan growth (+13% YoY) and an improvement in the Net Interest Margins (3.4% in Q4FY19 Vs 3.3% YoY). The non-interest income reported a growth of ~26% YoY in Q4FY19 majorly led by 1) 23% YoY growth in the fee income and 2) the treasury has reported a profit of INR 354 crores in Q4FY19 as compared to INR 216 crores in Q4FY18.

Outlook

At a CMP of 745, the stock is trading at FY21E adjusted P/BV of ~2.5x. The bank use to trade at 2.7x of its last three years forward Adj. P/BV, we have assigned similar multiple (and valued subsidiaries separately) to arrive at a fair value of INR 882 per share, seeking an upside of 18.4% from the current levels.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis bank's earnings were marginally below estimates at Rs15.0bn (PLe: Rs15.7bn) mainly as strong other income growth was used to make additional higher provisions on certain balance sheet items. NII growth came in at 20% tad lower than estimates as bank's focus to push retail term deposits led to strong funding cost rise but some pass on through yields helped NIMs being largely steady. Bank expects in medium term NIMs to move towards 3.8% but will be flattish in FY20 mainly on challenges from lending mix & liability accretion which remains core factor of our concern to take ROEs towards 18% by FY22.

Outlook

We retain Accumulate rating with revised TP to Rs 837 (from Rs845) based on 2.6x Mar-21 ABV post factoring in the reserve adjustment.

HDFC Securities' research report on Axis Bank

Slippages dipped QoQ (~2.48% vs. 3.22%) led by a reduction in corp (3% ann.) and retail (40bps) slippages. Only a single corp a/c (Rs 3.35bn) slipped outside the BB and below rated book. Exposure to BB and below rated advances was ~2% of the book. As the pool of identified stress moderates, we expect slippages to trend down over FY19-21E (~1.9%). NPA provisions dipped ~87/67%, even as PCR improved. Std asset provisions jumped to ~Rs 7bn due to a change in a/c policy (see Page 2). Consequently, our provisions increase to ~1.6% vs. 1.1% earlier over FY19-21E, to accommodate higher provisions on std assets. Our NPA provision assumptions remain largely unchanged (1.46%). Further, a sustained increase in coverage (+200bps QoQ to ~62% calc.) is a positive.

Outlook

The strong 4Q performance bolsters our stance on meaningful change at the bank. Maintain BUY with a TP of Rs 896 (2.8x Mar21E ABV of Rs 310+Rs 30 for subs).

Dolat Capital's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank’s PAT were lower than our estimates, due to 1) a lower-than-expected loan growth (at 13% YoY), 2) NIM compression of 2 bps (ex one off, it remains stable), 3) gross slippages (partly outside the watch list), and 4) higher provisions on stressed standard assets that limited a decrease in credit costs. The core fee income remained strong, growing 18% YoY. We believe that the bank remains one of the preferred stories among corporate banks, with a strong retail franchise and the improved earning quality is expected to trickle by 2HFY20.

Outlook

We maintain Accumulate. The risk to its ambitions target is dependent to the credit costs which depends on lumpy recoveries and the resolution of larger stressed loans. The sustained sluggish economic growth is a risk as well.

The Axis Bank stock has been in an uptrend in 2019 so far, up nearly 20 percent. That also reflects in the fact that the private sector lender turned profitable in the March quarter compared to loss reported in the year-ago period.

It posted a profit of Rs 1,505 crore for the quarter ended March 2019 on better asset quality and decline in slippages.

In January-March quarter, it set aside Rs 1,300 crore for provisioning against self-identified stressed assets, over and above the regulatory norms, as part of its new “conservative” approach under the new leadership.

Reacting to the earnings, CLSA maintained its buy rating but raised its target price to Rs 890 from Rs 840 earlier. Jefferies has put out the most aggressive target of Rs 960 which translates into an upside of nearly 30 percent from April 25 closing price of Rs 740.

Here’s how global brokerage firms reacted post Q4 results of Axis Bank:

CLSA: Buy| Target raised to Rs 890 from Rs 840 earlier

NPLs were stable but CASA disappointed. Pick-up in CASA is key in supporting its growth ambitions, said the CLSA note.

Stable delinquencies helped bring gross NPLs down to 5.8 percent. Earnings should see a turnaround from FY20, said the note. The bank may look to raise capital over the next 12-18 months which is also positive.

Jefferies: Buy| Target: Rs 910

The bank witnessed strong revenue momentum which was in-line with estimates although opex was 4 percent ahead of estimates.

In spite of one large NPL, the overall slippage came in below Street expectation which was the key positive. Provisions were beefed up which should materially smoothen out from FY20 onwards.

The stock remains the top pick in the sector. FY20 EPS estimate was cut by 1.8 percent due to a flattish margin build-up. The global investment bank forecast a 12 percent Adj BV CAGR in FY19-21.

Deutsche Bank: Buy| Target Rs 875

The asset quality has improved which is a positive sign but net interest margins which were stable fell below expectations.

The private sector lender is moving towards more conservative provisioning. “We expect growth & profitability to be back on focus from FY20,” said the note.

The corporate affairs ministry will Friday file contempt of court petitions against Axis Bank and Standard Chartered Bank for their alleged role in ex-IL&FS Financial Services managing director Ramesh Chander Bawa and his wife disposing off a portion of their assets which were frozen by the NCLT.

The ministry is filling two applications and a petition against Bawa and his wife and the banks after it has come to light that the parties have broken the orders of the bankruptcy tribunal.

A bench of VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy had on December 3, 2018 had restrained the former directors of the crippled IL&FS group from mortgaging/selling, or creating third-party interests or in any way alienating movable or immovable or jointly held properties.

However, the NCLT had allowed the former directors of the crippled group to withdraw Rs 2 lakh each per month from one of their bank accounts after intimating the the tribunal.

The NCLT has posted the matter for hearing on Friday.

Axis Bank posted profit of Rs 1,505 crore for the quarter ended March 2019, as provisions fell sharply and asset quality improved with a decline in slippages.

The bank had posted a loss of Rs 2,188.74 crore in the corresponding period last year. Higher NII, other income and operating income also supported profitability during the quarter.

Net interest income in Q4 grew by 21 percent year-on-year to Rs 5,705.6 crore with credit growth at 13 percent YoY and net interest margin at 3.44 percent.

""Domestic loans grew 18 percent while the overseas book de-grew by 29 percent. Retail loans which accounted for 50 percent of net advances grew 19 percent YoY and corporate loan book increased by 5 percent,"" Axis Bank said.

The total deposits on quarterly average basis (QAB) rose by 24 percent and on a period end basis, the total deposits grew 21 percent YoY, it added.

Other income or non-interest income increased 26 percent to Rs 3,526.3 crore and operating income shot up 37 percent to Rs 5,014.4 crore compared to year-ago.

Asset quality of the bank improved considerably during March quarter. Gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances dipped to 5.26 percent against 5.75 percent in previous quarter and net NPA declined to 2.06 percent against 2.36 percent in Q3, which were on expected lines.

In absolute term, gross NPAs were lower by 13 percent at Rs 29,789.44 crore and net NPAs by 32 percent to Rs 11,275.6 crore compared to previous quarter.

Slippages for the quarter at Rs 3,012 crore were lower than Rs 3,746 crore reported in previous quarter and significantly lower than Rs 16,535 crore reported in March quarter 2018.

The private sector lender said corporate lending slippages stood at Rs 1,369 crore. ""72 percent of this came from disclosed BB & below accounts. Its BB and below-rated book stood at Rs 7,467 crore. This is 1.3 percent of the bank’s gross customer assets, significantly down from 7.3 percent at peak.""

Recoveries and upgrades from NPAs during the quarter were Rs 2,376 crore while write-offs were Rs 1,701 crore. Net slippages (before write-offs) in retail and SME stood at Rs 215 crore and Rs 189 crore respectively.

Provisions and contingencies fell 11 percent sequentially to Rs 2,711.43 crore in March quarter and the same declined 62 percent compared to year-ago.

Provision coverage ratio of the bank, as a proportion of gross NPAs including prudential write-offs, sequentially improved to 77 percent from 75 percent as it created higher provisions against select standard assets and made multiple changes to increase conservatism in provisioning, Axis Bank said.

For the financial year 2018-19, net profit stood at Rs 4,677 crore, which was quite higher compared to Rs 275.68 crore reported in previous fiscal.

Axis Bank, country's third largest private sector lender, is likely to register healthy growth across parameters in March quarter driven by lower credit cost and lower slippages. The bank will declare its results on April 25.

""Lower credit cost and lowering slippages should drive earnings. NII growth to also accelerate on back of rise in MCLR and changing loan mix,"" Prabhudas Lilladher said.

Profit for the quarter ended March 2019 is expected to be in the range of Rs 1,500-2,300 crore against loss of Rs 2,188.7 crore in same period last year.

""Strong margins and stabilisation in the credit cost on account of lower slippages will drive the earnings with PAT growth of 40 percent QoQ at Rs 2,358 crore. Management targets to achieve 18 percent return on equity over the medium term,"" Narnolia said.

Motilal Oswal expects profit at Rs 1,518.5 crore for fourth quarter, thus resulting in total PAT of Rs 4,690 crore for FY19.

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, is seen growing at least 20 percent on healthy loan (credit) growth, with net interest margin at around 3.5 percent.

""Axis Bank in a bid to achieve its long-term target is poised to show incremental progress on operational matrix with improvement in credit growth as well as NII growth. Credit growth is expected at 17.2 percent YoY led by traction in retail as well as corporate portfolio,"" said ICICI Securities which expects NII growth of 19.6 percent YoY.

""Loan growth will be better than industry average given the continued momentum in retail growth and opportunistic pick up in corporate,"" said Edelweiss which expects NII growth at 27 percent YoY.

Pre-provision operating profit is expected to be strong with Reliance Securities, Antique Stock Broking, Edelweiss, Narnolia and Kotak seeing the growth in the range of 30-52 percent YoY.

Asset quality is expected to see further improvement in March quarter with lower slippages than the third quarter.

""Asset quality is expected to improve with the moderation in slippages ratio at 0.53 percent in Q4FY19. With high provision coverage ratio of 75 percent, credit cost is likely to be lower in Q4FY19,"" Narnolia said, adding gross non-performing assets may be around 5.2 percent in Q4 against 5.8 percent in Q3.

According ICICI Securities, credit cost may remain lower at 52 bps on the back of moderation in slippages.

""We expect slippages of Rs 2,400 crore (2 percent of loans) mostly from 'below investment grade book'. We expect more traction on recovery from write-off pool. No major concerns on asset quality,"" Kotak said.

Key issues to watch out for

- quantum of corporate slippages from BB and below list and any revision in the size of the stressed assets;

- outlook on the power assets,

- bank's strategy on retail, unsecured and business banking loans",479,0.5807793644758371

In January-March 2019, an ex-insurer and ex-foreign banker were entrusted with the responsibility to guide two of India's top private lenders--Axis Bank and YES Bank, towards a new growth path in a dynamic business environment. Focus is now on these new leaders who will set the stage for rest of their tenures, as the two banks gear up to unveil their fourth quarterly performance this week.

Amitabh Chaudhry, MD & CEO, Axis Bank

Chaudhry took over the reins of the bank at the very beginning of the fourth quarter and laid out a three-year roadmap with a focus on growth, profitability and sustainability. One of the key tasks was to embed ""conservatism"" in the bank's internal policies and practices. While it remains to be seen how this impacts the bank's business growth, its asset quality certainly needs immediate attention.

HDFC Securities said 2.1 percent of the bank's book still pertains to unrecognised stress, the non-watchlist slippages have been sticky and asset quality has been volatile. ""Factoring these, we expect slippages to take a while to trend below 2 percent,"" said the report.

The bank's gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio was at 5.75 percent at the end of December 2018, from 5.28 percent in the same quarter last year. The net NPA ratio, however, improved to 2.36 percent from 2.56 percent in the same period. Centrum Research said the ageing of NPAs could see credit costs remain elevated. However, it expects additions to NPAs to continue to decline in the fourth quarter.

Ravneet Singh Gill, CEO & MD, YES Bank

Gill assumed charge of the bank in March 2019. Prior to this he was the CEO of Deutsche Bank in India. Markets are keen to study Gill's strategy for the bank, considering the unceremonious exit of the previous head Rana Kapoor. ""New leadership’s commentary on medium-term business strategy, his focus areas and stance on growth will be key monitorables,"" HDFC Securities said in a report.

The bank reported a 6.96 percent fall in net profit to Rs 1,001.85 crore in the quarter ended December 2018, from Rs 1,076.87 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. While its advances grew 42.2 percent, the gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio increased to 2.1 percent of the total advances in the quarter, compared with 1.72 percent in the year-ago period. Net NPA also increased to 1.18 percent from 0.93 percent in the same period.

""Growth is likely to moderate from the higher levels seen in earlier quarters, albeit still much higher than industry; asset quality trends to be benign. The strategy under new management will be key monitorable,"" Edelweiss Securities said in a report.",451,0.4520741105079651

Private banking is one of the most lucrative sectors as of now and it seems smart money has already picked its bet—Axis Bank. The lender has rallied over 20 percent so far in 2019 compared to a little over 6 percent rise in its peer HDFC Bank, data showed.

On a one-year basis, Axis Bank has gained nearly 40 percent while HDFC Bank has risen 18 percent in the same period. Axis Bank is well placed to generate best-in-class return ratios, a global investment bank said in a report.

UBS examined whether Axis Bank can deliver strong growth and profitability at a lower risk when compared to HDFC Bank. Well, the result suggests former is due for a re-rating and is the preferred pick among the financials.

“We expect Axis growth and profit differential with HDFC Bank to narrow over FY19-22, driven mainly by Axis' favourable loan mix change, gains from its physical/digital network and lower credit costs,” it said.

So, will it get re-rated to 3x P/BV? UBS feels that it could, but only if it reduces its risk profile over the next two to three years.

“We lower our FY19 earnings estimate by 24 percent due to higher provisions, and raise it by 4 percent for FY21,” the report added.

UBS maintained its buy rating on Axis Bank but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 1,010 from Rs 780 earlier, which translates into an upside of over 30 percent from April 11 close of Rs 752 on the BSE.

Can Axis Bank bridge the ROA differential with HDFC Bank?

Axis Bank return on assets (ROA) differential with HDFC Bank is due largely to the gap in the net interest margin (NIM) and credit costs whereas fee income and opex are small contributors.

UBS analysis suggests that a 128bps ROA differential in FY19E could narrow to 20bp by FY22E. UBS includes a potential capital-raising of $2.75 billion (10 percent equity dilution) which would add 330bp to its Tier-1 capital.

Potential for share price to double in 3 years:

A quick look at the history suggests that HDFC Bank’s success over the past 20 years has been linked to consistent performance. The bank sustained a 3x P/BV (or 18x PE).

Going forward, UBS is of the view that the bank should deliver 20 percent EPS growth, 18 percent ROE and have steady earnings (low credit/liquidity risk) in addition to solid management. In the past five years, HDFC Bank has traded at an average 3.4x P/BV and 18.5x PE.

UBS believes that Axis Bank could gradually re-rate to 2.9x P/BV. It will also track: 1) consolidation stage; 2) reacceleration of growth and cost efficiency; 3) higher profitability, and 4) evidence of a reduced risk profile.

In the next 30 months, UBS believes that the stock could be valued at Rs 1,500 that is 2.9x FY23E PBV. On the other hand, the key risk to the thesis is execution failure, which is UBS downside scenario, where UBS value the stock at Rs 660, implying 1.8x FY21E P/BV (without capital-raising).

In a bid to overhaul its business and cut costs under a new leader, Axis Bank has laid off over 50 mid-level managers, The Economic Times reported. The terminated executives led various functions in corporate and retail banking.

Amitabh Chaudhry, the new CEO of the bank from January 1, 2019, reviewed the company and decided that these supervisory roles were redundant. The bank could not find other suitable jobs for these people and let them go, sources told the paper. ""They have been asked to look for other jobs. This has rattled many old-timers in the bank,"" one person said. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the claims made in the report.

Axis Bank responded to the ET report by saying that changes were taking place in the bank to raise efficiency but manpower reduction was not a part of the plan. Skirting the terminations, the lender said, ""While a few employees have opted for early retirement as a result of this process, the bank has no plans to reduce manpower.""

Chaudhry has embarked upon a new strategy for the bank's operations ever since he took charge, which is one of low risk and high growth. He has brought in new people and changed the organisation structure.

The cultural change brought in by Chaudhry has not been accepted positively by everyone. ""There is some unease at the way new people have been brought in while some in the senior management from among the old-timers have been left with truncated portfolios.

ICICI Direct's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank’s top management provided deep insights into the bank’s strategy to achieve aspired RoE of 18% in the medium term (FY22E). New MD & CEO, Amitabh Chaudhary, showcased their Growth- Profitability- Sustainability (G-P-S) strategy. Drivers to lead to uptick in RoE are; 1) Risk normalisation (controlled asset quality and credit cost), 2) business mix optimisation (RAROC based portfolio choice), 3) operating efficiency (cost to asset ratio to trim below 2%). Our RoE estimates, without factoring in capital infusion, are at ~15.4% in FY21E. Hence, RoE target of 18% by FY22E, along with capital infusion, seems a bit difficult.

Outlook

We remain positive on the bank and upgrade our target price to Rs 825 (earlier Rs 790) valuing core bank at 2.6x FY21E ABV. We maintain BUY rating.

With the share of retail increasing to ~70% by FY21 from 62% and likely continued interest in the stock; as it is one of the better bets in the current systemic growth trends with a lower probability of negative surprises; we raise our target multiple, maintain Accumulate.

Shashikant Rathi, Vice-President and Head of Treasury and Markets at Axis Bank, who has been leading India's local bond underwriting business for more than a decade, has now warned that the industry may be facing its biggest challenge since the Lehman Brothers crisis in 2008.

Bond underwriters help companies raise funds by selling debt securities. Developments like the series of defaults by Infrastructure Lending & Financial Services (IL&FS) and the new electronic bidding platform have caused disruptions in the Rs 7.56 lakh crore market.

The new electronic platform approved last year enables investors to place buy orders for any issuer without the need of placing the order via a broker.

Rupee corporate bonds usually fetch the highest fees, but their sales fell this quarter to a 2016 low. Rathi told Bloomberg that the market is in complete chaos. ""I have not seen such a crisis since the 2008 Lehman bankruptcy,"" he said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a 0.25 percent rate cut at its February monetary policy meet, and there is an expectation of further easing as early as April, which, however, did not help lower funding costs. Rathi said the market will settle and issuances will pick-up only after the general elections scheduled for April-May.

The government's attempt to grow the corporate bond market is facing troubles, with Rathi sustaining the business through his personal long-standing relationships in the market.

The government is trying to change the course of the market. From April, companies with outstanding long-term borrowings of Rs 100 crore and a credit rating of 'AA and above' will have to compulsorily raise 25 percent of their debt from the bond market.

Rupee bond sales in 2019 have seen a steady 15 percent rise, but this is not beneficial to those like Rathi as issuances by state-run firms don't pay underwriting fees, the report said.

""Issuers still need arrangers as we are the bankers who can give them a firm commitment, advice on the right borrowing level and help market-making,"" Rathi said.

Despite these problems, Rathi's deals are high-value. ""I am a conservative risk taker. I will not take undue risk and end to change my strategies as the need of the hour is,"" he said. With the help of his exhaustive database, he now aims to make Axis Bank among the top three arrangers for Indian corporate issuers selling foreign currency bonds.",411,-0.20136789083480836

The month gone by saw a notable change in sector and stock allocation of funds from the mutual fund industry.

On a month-on-month (MoM) basis, during February, the weight of oil & gas, private banks, consumer, cement, capital goods and utilities increased in the mutual fund industry portfolio, while that of PSU banks, healthcare, NBFCs, metals and chemicals moderated, according to Mutual Fund Tracker report from Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Last month, five of the top-10 stocks that saw maximum change in value were from private banks and oil & gas.

Private banks with 18.6 percent exposure was the top sector holding in February 2019, followed by technology (9.5 percent), NBFCs (8.4 percent) and Consumer (8.1 percent).

Oil & Gas weight increased for the fourth successive month to reach a new high of 7.8 percent. The sector now stands at the fifth position in sector allocation of mutual funds – it was at the seventh position 12 months ago.

STOCK MOVEMENTAxis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Reliance Industries, L&T and NTPC saw the maximum value change on a MoM basis while stocks that saw maximum decline in value were SBI, Vedanta, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Tata Chemicals.

Axis Bank was one of the preferred stocks among MFs in February, with net buying by 19 funds. The value increased by Rs 21 billion, despite the stock corrected by 1.9 percent during the month under review.

Kotak Mahindra Bank was another preferred stock in the month, with net buying by 15 funds. Value increased by Rs 20.4 billion even when the stock corrected by 3.3 percent in the month.

Reliance Industries saw a value increase of Rs 19.2 billion in Feb 2019, despite stock being flat (+0.4 percent MoM). Notably, the stock saw net buying by 17 of the top-20 funds.

SBI was the least preferred stock among MFs last month, that saw net selling by just 5 funds and net buying 13 funds. Value decreased by Rs 14.8 billion, as the stock was down 8 percent in the month.

The total equity value of the top-20 AMCs increased 0.9 percent MoM and 12.9 percent YoY in February, as against the Nifty’s flat performance MoM (+2.9 percent YoY).

Indian benchmark indices ended flat (-0.4 percent MoM) for the third consecutive month in Feb 2019, as the street exercised caution amid a flurry of unsupportive domestic and global cues.",407,0.1363540768623352

Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol Research

Highlights:

- Axis Bank has the potential to take over the baton from HDFC Bank

- The bank has best in class liability profile

- It is diversifying and de-risking asset book

- The new management has eyes set at 18 percent RoE

- The focus on risk-adjusted return to ensure quality

- Valuation gap with HDFC Bank to narrow

-------------------------------------------------

The worst is over for Axis Bank (CMP: Rs 732, Market Cap: Rs 188,247 crore) and it could well become the next HDFC Bank for the stock market.

In the past twenty years, HDFC Bank has demonstrated an impeccable track record of execution and the brand is now synonymous with consistency. In this period, its profit grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.5 percent, and market capitalisation at a CAGR of 34 percent.

Axis Bank, like most of its peers, could not escape the non-performing asset mess. But the crisis has forced a change of guard – which is a game changer in our view - as well as a rapid clean-up of its balance sheet. That will allow it to embark on a growth journey with quality.

Worst of the NPA cycle largely behindLike most Indian lenders, Axis Bank witnessed a sharp deterioration in its asset quality. Its gross and net NPA that was hovering around 1.67 percent and 0.7 percent respectively in March 2016 shot up to 6.77 percent and 3.4 percent respectively by March 2018 driven largely by corporate slippages. The bank also reported a divergence with the RBI audit on recognising bad assets for FY17.

However, the clean-up led to recognition of the bulk of the stress (low-rated corporate portfolio down from Rs 27,411 crore in Q1 FY17 to Rs 7645 crore now). While higher provisioning did result in elevated credit costs, it also led to an improvement in the provision coverage ratio to 75 percent, one of the best in the industry. Going forward, with the rating downgrades largely behind, we expect normalisation of slippages as well as credit cost. That should greatly support incremental earnings.

Best in class liability franchiseOver the years, Axis has leveraged its “branch banking model” to build a robust liability profile. The share of granular deposits is high with low-cost CASA (current and savings account) and retail term deposits close to 80 percent of total deposits.

While CASA deposits have stagnated in recent times and remains an area of focus for the new management, the bank, nevertheless, has done a commendable job on the liability side. Its market share in the banking system’s deposits has risen from 3.7 percent in March 2016 to 4.3 percent in December 2018; its incremental market share in the system’s deposits in the past one year was a high 9.7 percent. Incidentally, in the current environment, where deposit growth is lagging credit growth, Axis Bank stands out with a respectable credit to deposit ratio of 92 percent.

Source: Company

Diversifying and de-risking the lending bookThe composition of the loan book is changing. The share of retail loans that stood at 27.4 percent in March 2013 rose to 49 percent in December 2018. Retail and SME together constitute 62 percent of the portfolio now. The bank has been broad-basing its retail offering with the addition of high-yielding products like personal loans, loans against property, credit cards etc. while trying to minimize risks by cross-selling to existing deposit customers, sourcing customers through branches and using analytics for underwriting.

De-risking efforts have gathered pace in non-retail as well, with 86 percent of the SME exposure rated at least SME3 and 82 percent of corporate exposure rated A or better. The corporate banking book is tilting in favour of working capital. The fall in the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets stands testimony to the gradual de-risking of the book.

With the competitive scenario weakening, in view of the stress in PSU banks and funding constraints of NBFCs, Axis Bank with its superior funding costs is in a vantage position to expand its loan book (both in corporate as well as retail) without on-boarding excessive risk and maintain an upwards trajectory in its interest margin.

Fee income: Room to improveFee composition is showing stability with 79 percent coming from retail and transaction banking. However, the ratio of core fees to assets at 1.1 percent suggests that there is enough headroom for improvement.

The new management could be the game changerAxis Bank has recently seen a change of guard with Amitabh Chaudhry (ex-Managing Director and CEO of HDFC Standard Life Insurance) taking over from Shikha Sharma from January 1. We see this as a potential re-rating trigger for the bank should his articulated strategy pans out.

While growth, profitability and sustainability are the cornerstone of this strategy, what appears to be reassuring and has a striking resemblance with the HDFC group’s ethos is the focus on risk adjusted return on capital (RaRoc). The appointment of Deepak Maheshwari (formerly Group Head of Corporate Credit Risk at HDFC Bank) as the Chief Credit Officer is the first step in overhauling the underwriting processes of the bank. Several other senior management changes are being effected as well to implement the stated strategy.

Extensive use of technology, effective sweating of assets, focus on CASA (current account-savings account) and fee income and reduction in credit costs below historical average are some of the other key areas of focus with the objective of improving profitability on a sustainable basis and reaching a return on equity (RoE) of 18 percent in the next three years (by FY22).

Subsidiaries: Untapped potentialA meaningful scale up of subsidiaries is also an area of attention. So far Axis Bank’s share price does not factor in any contribution from subsidiaries and this remains a probable upside. For Axis Bank, the acquisition of FreeCharge remains a potent tool to capture digitally savvy customers. The bank plans to scale up capital market-linked businesses like Axis AMC, Axis Securities and Axis Capital, organically as well as inorganically. Axis Finance, the non-banking finance subsidiary, also has strong growth plans ahead. Finally, with an ex-insurance chief at the helm, the possibility of Axis Bank getting into manufacturing of insurance (from the present distribution only model) cannot be ruled out.

Valuation discount to HDFC Bank could narrow

The bank had last raised capital (Rs 11,626 crore) in 2017 and has adequate resources (Capital Adequacy Ratio 16.4 percent with CET 1 11.77 percent) for growth. While there are several weak spots that warrant immediate attention, should the management succeed in addressing majority of them, the earnings traction and re-rating could be meaningful. Despite the 32 percent rally in the stock in the past one year, shares are valued at 2.1 times FY21 estimated book, a discount to HDFC Bank’s valuation at three times FY21 estimated book. Should the journey to achieving 18 percent RoE pans out, we expect the valuation gap to narrow.

Bigger banks have shown good improvement in asset quality in the quarter ended December 2018. After a couple of years of concerns, Q3 performance has given confidence to analysts to project a strong turnaround in FY20 earnings.

Global research house Morgan Stanley views 2019 as the year of big banks given moderating credit costs with pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) acceleration and pickup in deposit market share.

The research house highlighted a continuing improvement in asset quality, with bad loans ratio moving lower to around 10 percent of loans against around 12 percent in FY18 and coverage improving to more than 50 percent versus around 45 percent. This should drive moderation in credit costs to 90-125bps in FY20, it said in a report.

It further said liquidity position of banks is also strong, with liquidity coverage ratio at around 120-140 percent. An increased focus on retail term deposits is driving deposit growth acceleration with large private banks' incremental deposit market share at over 30 percent in FY18-19.

Three of the largest lenders, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI, have reported sharp acceleration in PPoP growth – 12 percent YoY in Q3 versus 2 percent in FY18, mainly led by higher margins.

Morgan Stanley believes PPoP growth is sustainable because loan spreads adjusted for this have also improved sharply (+25bp QoQ for private banks).

Brokerage calls: UBS bullish on most pvt banks; HSBC advises buy ONGC, Oil India

Coupled with pickup in loan growth and cost efficiency, the research house expects more than 20 percent PPoP growth.

""Moreover, loan yields should improve further, reflecting a) full impact of MCLR hikes, b) moderation in NPLs, and c) improving loan spreads and also loan mix towards higher-margin segments,"" it added.

The liquidity concerns raised after IL&FS issue hit non-banking finance companies as well as banks due to exposure to IL&FS group. However, Morgan Stanley feels large banks are relatively less exposed to IL&FS, telecoms, NBFCs, and real estate.

""In a weak scenario of significant increase in stress in the above sectors, we estimate around 200-400bps rise in credit costs. Large banks face relatively lower impact, particularly ICICI Bank, followed by Axis Bank among corporate lenders,"" Morgan Stanley said in a report, adding the most affected are Yes Bank and state-owned banks but SBI is better placed in that group.

Considering above factors, Morgan Stanley preferes big corporate lenders. ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, SBI and HDFC Bank are its best pick among retail banks. Its FY20 and FY21 estimates remain above consensus for these banks.

On Yes Bank, the brokerage is still underweight given low capital, low liquidity coverage ratio, high exposure to stressed sectors and weakening PPoP.

In case of SBI, Morgan Stanley expects 43 percent upside in stock at Rs 375 while in bull and bear case scenario, its target price would be Rs 545 and 205, respectively.

""We apply probability weights of 75 percent to base case and 20 percent to bear case to reflect risks pertaining from SBI stepping forward to bail out funding-constrained NBFCs and/or state-owned banks. We still attach just a slight probability (5 percent) to bull case value, reflecting the low probability of a strong economic recovery. Our probability weights remain unchanged,"" it said.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB under the leadership of a new CEO reported highest profit in the past 11 quarters at INR16.81b. This was led by steady NII growth (+18% YoY; 3% beat), controlled opex and healthy recoveries/treasury gains (INR10b/INR3.8b). NIM expanded 11bp QoQ to 3.47% (5bp contribution from one large recovery), and AXSB expects continued buoyancy as the loan book re-prices further. Fee growth improved to 16% YoY, led by a 22% YoY increase in retail fees. Loan growth stood at 13% YoY (+4% QoQ), led by 20% YoY retail loan growth and 13% YoY SME loan growth.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis bank's PAT of Rs16.8bn (PLe: Rs12.5bn) was better than expectations on back of better NII (partly on interest write back) and high recoveries in w.off a/c & sale of investments gain which were used for PCR enhancement and contingent provisions on risks pertaining in BB & Below book.

Management articulated its new strategy till FY22 of reaching 18% ROEs with strong focus on business mix & RAROC, optimizing cost and bringing credit cost near below average levels, this coupled with operations strengthening and improving process/technology. We see gradual improvement in core operations as credit cost normalizes, NIMs improve and given the historically swift movement towards different business profiles should improve risk adjusted return.

Outlook

We retain Accumulate rating with revised TP to Rs745 (from Rs681) based on 2.5x (from 2.3x) Sep-20 ABV.

Axis Bank, which will announce its earnings for October-December period on January 29, is expected to report healthy growth in profitability due to a low base a year-ago.

Overall, analysts expect third-quarter profit growth in the range of 50-110 percent over the same period last year, partly driven by lower provisions.

Edelweiss Securities expects maximum growth in profit at 110 percent whereas Antique Stock Broking sees over 50 percent growth compared to a year-ago period.

Net interest income, the difference between interest earned and interest expended, is likely to grow more than 10 percent along with credit growth of over 10 percent and stable margin YoY.

""Advance growth is expected at 11.5 percent YoY, led by traction in retail and corporate portfolio. Increase in MCLR to be offset by a rise in the cost of funds, keeping margins broadly stable at around 3.5 percent,"" ICICI Securities said.

Edelweiss Securities said loan growth will be better than industry average given the continued momentum in retail growth and opportunistic pick up in corporate while Prabhudas Lilladher also said loan growth should be better on loan buyouts from NBFCs and raised MCLRs should benefit yields and marginally NIMs leading to 13-14 percent NII growth.

Margins are expected to expand sequentially to around 3.5 percent as the loan book re-prices, Motilal Oswal said.

Asset quality is expected to improve sequentially with controlled slippages for the quarter ended December 2018.

According to Prabhudas Lilladher, gross non-performing assets (NPA) as a percentage of gross advances may fall at 5.62 percent against 5.96 percent sequentially whereas Motilal Oswal said gross NPA could be at 5.9 percent against 5.96 percent QoQ.

Edelweiss Securities said trajectory on slippages should be controlled as credit cost will remain elevated.

Net stressed loans for the bank have declined to 5.8 percent, as the bank has already improved its coverage ratio to 73 percent.

""Though there are some signs of recovery in NPL cycle, we expect slippages to moderate to around 2.9 percent (from 4.6 percent a year ago) as the bank proceeds to clean up its balance sheet,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Key issues to watch out for

> Quantum of corporate slippages from BB and below list and any revision in the size of the stressed assets, outlook on the power assets

> Bank's strategy on retail, unsecured and business banking loans

> Strategy of new management on business growth and rejig in the top portfolio will be keenly observed",418,0.6388732574202798

Axis Bank gained a percent in morning on Thursday after global brokerage house CLSA increased price target to Rs 800 from Rs 750 earlier, implying 20.5 percent potential upside from January 16's closing levels.

While maintaining a buy call on the stock, the research house said more management changes are likely at the top level as new CEO has been preparing a new team.

On December 31, 2018, Shikha Sharma retired from the services of the bank and has accordingly ceased to be the Managing Director & CEO of the bank.

Now Amitabh Chaudhry is the new Managing Director & CEO of the bank with effect from January 2019 on the terms and conditions relating to the said appointment, including remuneration, as approved by the RBI.

The clarity on new strategy/execution quality will drive next leg of stock returns, it said, adding cyclically, the bank is in a sweet spot as it exited NPL recognition.

Hence, CLSA sees return on equity improving to 15 percent by FY21. The warrant conversion in FY20 will lift net worth by 3 percent, it said.

At 09:49 hours IST, the stock was quoting at Rs 666.95, up Rs 3.30, or 0.50 percent on the BSE.

For the last four weeks, Nifty is witnessing narrowing of trading range forming a short-term symmetrical triangle pattern and it has also completed 5-wave structure.

Thus, we expect a breakout soon. On the downside, if the index starts to trade below 10,692 then we expect the decline towards 10,628. Going below 10,628 would confirm a breakdown and the index can see decline towards 10,425.

On the upside, the index has resistance zone in 10,840-10,870 bracket. But, crossing above 11,000 sustainably will confirm the uptrend.

In Nifty options, maximum open interest for Puts is seen at strike price 10,500 followed by 10,000; whereas for Calls it is seen at strike price 11,000 followed by 10,900.

A further rise in VIX above 17 will be negative for the market. It needs to sustain below 16 for the market to move higher.

Here is a list of five stocks which could give 5-15 percent return:

Divi’s Laboratories Limited: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,520| Stop loss: Rs 1,455| Target: Rs 1,700| Upside: 12 percent

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic have given a positive crossover with their respective averages on the weekly chart that suggests consolidation is over.

Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips to Rs 1,420 with a stop loss below Rs 85 and a target of Rs 1,700.

Info Edge (India) Limited: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,674| Stop loss: Rs 1,570| Target: Rs 1,800| Return: 7 percent

The lows were formed at 200-day moving average indicating value area for the stock. Though the stock is witnessing resistance on the upside, it has rallied sharply from the lower end of the range and declines have been on below-average volumes that indicates buying participation in the counter.

MACD line has given positive crossover with its average above equilibrium level of zero on weekly chart suggesting resumption of the uptrend. Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips towards Rs 1,620 with a stop loss below Rs 1,570 and a target of Rs 1,800.

Dabur (India) Limited: Buy| LTP: Rs 423| Stop loss: Rs 410| Target: Rs 490| Return: 15 percent

As the Nifty inches upwards in 2019, we could see a strong bounce back in many mid and smallcaps, but this revival would still be part of a major bottoming-out process for this space, Amar Ambani, President & Head of Research at YES Securities, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpt:

Q) The New Year started off on a muted note. What is your outlook on markets ahead of Budget or Vote on Account?

A) 2018 proved to be a year of severe disruption for the equity markets. The first setback was the introduction of the LTCG tax, which was followed by a litany of lethal blows, including MF scheme reclassification, ASM list announcement, Nirav Modi saga, NBFC liquidity crisis among others.

Thankfully, some of those concerns have now abated. Even better, crude oil now seems reasonably priced after Brent hit $85 at one time, sovereign yields have significantly softened following the IL&FS debacle, and the INR is relatively stable following the steep depreciation against the USD from 65 to 74 levels.

More importantly, the broader market fall has cleaned up frothy valuations from the secondary market. I sense a lot of stocks are in a bottoming-out phase.

Anticipating a sustained recovery in earnings of domestic-linked sectors (sans the public sector) and given the boost in the attractiveness of Nifty yield vis-à-vis fixed income yield, I find the current juncture to be a great time for loading up on stocks.

Q) What is your call on small & midcaps for 2019? How one should choose the right kind of stock for investment?

A) As the Nifty inches upwards in 2019, we could see a strong bounce back in many midcaps and small caps. However, this revival would still be part of a major bottoming-out process for this space.

This is an excellent time to accumulate interesting midcap and small cap stories, not exactly from a 2019 perspective but for a horizon of three years or more.

One should start identifying companies with credible management, those having sustained financial performance even during turbulent times.

Q) Given that Brent is trading around $55 to a barrel, what is your call on OMCs and aviation stocks?

A) We had a Sell call on OMCs last year, which was contra to the market which had placed them on the top picks list. Following the massive underperformance in last one year and with crude prices now having come off, it may appear that times could be ripe for OMCs again.

However, I view them as market performers at best. Given the hanging sword of elections, the sentiment is not great for PSU stocks. Refining margins have weakened in the recent past.

Large capex plans along with sustained dividend payouts will impact both cash flows and balance sheet strength. Restoring confidence levels would take significant time.

The aviation sector is a complete avoid given its fundamental woes. Average passenger air traffic has been soaring in high double digits for several years now, yet the airline industry is yet to register profits. Steer clear of this space.

Q) Any top five stocks or sectors which you are recommending to clients for a period of more than 1 year?

A) Some of our top picks for more than one-year horizon include Reliance Industries, KNR Construction, Axis Bank, Asian Paints, and Aarti Industries. We also believe the Capital Goods space will return to favour after a long lull.

Q) It looks like most of the worries are global in nature. Are we heading for growth slowdown in the US in 2019 or a possible recession?

A) A US growth slowdown does seem possible. Following the concerns over a slowing global macro backdrop, gloomy trade scenario and fragile financial markets, the US Fed itself has projected a lower growth of 2.5 percent and roughly 2 percent in 2019 and 2020 respectively.

This can be manifested by an inverting yield curve between 2-year and 1-year sovereign bonds and 5-year and 2-year as well. The longer end of the curve does not proportionally reflect the prospects of a persistent rise in interest rates, given 10-year yields retreating from 3.2 percent.

Q) If the globe is slowing down, do you think India will be able to pull it off with ease amid the possibility of a political drama which could unfold in the first half of 2019?

A) Unless we head towards a global recession, a deceleration in global GDP growth would not necessarily cause a reversal in a market direction at home.

On the contrary, India’s growth rate at 7%+ would look even more attractive to investors, when compared to a slowing globe. Any slowdown in the US economy could compel the Fed to pause or probably reverse the monetary tightening process.

Lower growth and soft sovereign yields in the US would facilitate the flow of capital to high-yielding emerging markets.

It's pertinent to note that election mandates do not have a lasting impact on equities, unless a third-front government assumes power at the center. We have seen bull and bear market cycles pervading across the UPA and NDA tenures.

Q) Retail investors have remained loyal to investing in equities via SIP route despite wild gyrations in 2018. Do you think the number could fall if the volatility increase?

A) Retail flows have been resilient in recent years, which truly speaks volumes of our domestic strength. These inflows have credibly helped fight volatility at times when FIIs were on a selling spree.

Technology has also played a vital role as many SIPs are on the auto debit mode from bank accounts. My sense is that retail flows will continue to flow into equities in a disciplined manner.

It would take over 10 percent downside from current market levels followed by a lackluster market for a prolonged period for the auto debit SIPs to be turned off. That seems highly unlikely.

Q) Enormous wealth has already been created in the history. The Sensex has grown like 100x in 32 years, at 15 percent CAGR. Do you think, 2019 will also give us a similar opportunity to enter and remain invested for a long time to create wealth?

A) I am very bullish on the market cycle for the next four to five years. For one, corporate earnings have remained largely subdued for a decade now.

A big take-off in earnings on this low base, when demand lifts industry utilization levels to 82 percent and above, will dramatically bring down market multiples. Secondly, India’s economy will more than double to $5 trillion in five years and I do not see any reason why the market indices would not follow suit.

Thirdly, a strong foundation of GST, Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar enrollments, Direct Benefit Transfer would progressively enable financial inclusion, arrest subsidy leakages and bring more enterprises in the formal economy.

The intent on infrastructure development is easily discernible. All these measures will help boost rural consumption, which is a prominent driver of our economy.

Q) What are your views on public sector banks after the recent RBI report suggested that the headwinds in terms of NPA mess could be abating?

A) Structurally speaking, I am negative on PSU banks. A work culture deprived of professionalism and fool-proof systems & processes, capital dependency on government and sub-optimal operating profitability are issues that would continue to haunt them for long.

Most PSU Banks would have to endure an arduous transformation journey before being worthy of attracting sustainable valuation multiples.

Having said that, there are times in any market cycle, when PSU Banks become tactical 'buy' ideas for a couple of years. FY20 onwards, their burden of delinquencies and provisioning stress should definitely recede.

In the wake of moderating asset quality pressure and a substantially improved treasury performance, their time may come anytime between now and next 15 months.

Nifty ended the past week on a positive note despite volatility. The index touched an intraday low of 10,628 on January 4 and a high of 10,870 on January 9.

Nifty50 tried to make multiple attempts to break out of the range but the follow up buying which was needed was clearly missing. It consolidated in a slender range of merely 140 points, which is way below its average weekly range.

For the index to move higher, Nifty50 has to climb above 10,870-10,950, while on the downside, a break below 10,733 could result in further profit booking.

“Market participants were keenly awaiting a decisive breakout from this range; but every attempt (on both sides) eventually turned unsuccessful. Technically speaking, prices have been vacillating within the boundaries of a ‘Triangle’ as well as the ‘Diamond’ pattern and we are very close to the apex point,” Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical & Derivatives, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Considering the overall development in the broader market as well as the heavyweight banking basket, our inclination is more on the positive side. A move beyond the higher end of 10870 would unfold the next leg of the rally towards 10970 – 11150 levels. However, in case of a breach below 10733, this would certainly not bode well for the bulls,” he said.

In such scenarios, Chavan advises investors that one should wait for a confirmation to place aggressive bets. Until then a prudent strategy would be to focus on individual stocks by following a proper exit strategy.

Here is a list of top 10 short term trading ideas by experts which could give 4-13% return in the next one month:

Analyst: Rajesh Palviya, Head – Technical & Derivatives Analyst, Axis Securities.

Divi's Laboratories: Buy| LTP: 1504| Target: Rs 1540-1570| Stop Loss: Rs 1467| Return 4%

On the daily chart, the stock price has decisively broken out its “Downsloping Trendline” at 1485 levels on a closing basis and sustaining above the same. This breakout is accompanied by an increase in volumes which supports bullish sentiments ahead.

The weekly, as well as daily strength indicator RSI and the momentum indicator Stochastic both, have turned positive which supports upside momentum to continue in the near-term.

The stock price has given positive crossover from its 20 and 50 day SMA which indicates positive bias.

ICICI Prudential Life Insurance: Buy| LTP: Rs 355| Target: Rs 368-375| Stop Loss: Rs 340| Return 5.6%

Manav Chopra, Head Research- Equity, Indiabulls Ventures Ltd

ITC: Buy| LTP: Rs 295| Target: Rs 320-335| Stop Loss: Rs 272| Return 13%

The recent decline tested the rising trend line drawn from the March’18 lows and the prices formed a Bullish hammer candlestick which further validates the bullish structure.

The RSI has confirmed a breakout and positive reversal which indicates a new high in making and likely stock to exceed its July’18 peak.

Amara Raja Batteries: Buy| LTP: Rs 756| Target: Rs 850-875 Stop Loss: Rs 700| Return 15%

The counter has formed a bullish candlestick pattern at the support zone and the prices has now exceeded its previous week’s high which indicates that a short-term trend reversal is on the cards.

The prices have been oscillating in the range of Rs 700-880 and are likely to see a bounce from the current levels.

Muthoot Finance: Buy| LTP: Rs 536| Target: Rs 570-590| Stop Loss: Rs 510| Return 10%

The prices recently observed a higher high formation which confirms the continuation of the uptrend. The RSI is in a bullish momentum which indicates more upside.

Analyst: Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical Analyst at HDFC Securities Ltd

Axis Bank: Buy| CMP: 666| Target: Rs 704| Stop Loss: Rs 638| Return 5%

The stock witnessed a Symmetrical Triangle breakout on the daily charts. It formed higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily and weekly charts. The stock price has been trading above its 20, 50, 100 and 200-DMA.

Considering the technical evidence discussed above, we recommend buying the stock at CMP target of 704 and keeping a stop loss at 638 on a closing basis.

Titan Company: Buy| CMP: 959.50| Target: Rs 1020| Stop Loss: Rs 925| Return 6%

The stock price has given a breakout from the bullish inverse head and shoulder pattern on the weekly charts. The stock price is placed above all important moving average parameters.

Considering the technical evidence discussed above, we recommend buying the stock at CMP target of 1020, keeping a stop loss at 925 on a closing basis.

Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy| LTP: Rs 728| Target: Rs 790| Stop Loss: Rs 710| Return 8.5%

This counter appears to be in a multi-week consolidation mode and moving in a large range of 800 – 700 levels. Interestingly, after a recent cut from the highs of 810, this counter appears to be moving in a narrow range of 712 – 730 for last six sessions hinting at a possible short term bottom.

In that case, if it starts rallying, ultimately it should test the upper end of the larger trading range placed around 800.

As the risk-reward ratios will be favourable, positional traders are advised to buy into this counter for a target of 790 and a stop below 710 on a closing basis.

Bosch: Buy| LTP: Rs 19514| Target: Rs 20500| Stop Loss: Rs 19,150| Return 5%

After the recent upmove from the lows of 18300 – 20,000, this counter appears to be moving in an 800-point range between 20,000-19,200 range for almost last 17 sessions.

Hence, one can buy into this counter in anticipation of a breakout above 20,000. In that scenario, the initial target can be placed at 20500 levels. A stop suggested for the trade is a close below 19150.

Welspun Corp: Buy| LTP: Rs 137| Target: Rs 154| Stop Loss: Rs 129| Return 12%

This counter appears to have posted a short-term bottom around Rs 130 levels as it is moving in a narrow range for the last 6 sessions after retracing 62% of its rally from the lows of 116 – 164.

Hence, on resuming the upmove from the said base it can eventually test its interim top of 160 levels. Hence, positional trades should buy into this counter for a target of 154 with a stop below 129 on a closing basis.

For Q3, private banks are expected to report marginal profit growth of 3 percent YoY and PSU banks may return to profit, global investment firm CLSA said.

The research house believes slippage should be manageable with the gross non-performing loans (NPL) ratio moderating to 9 percent of loans and healthy NII growth of 14 percent YoY.

It feels most of the slippage should arise from non-NPL stressed loans and few may see a reduced exposure to IL&FS in Q3, although most may see this slip in Q4.

Banks are also expecting their asset quality review reports over Q3-Q4FY19.

According to CLSA, provisioning during Q3 could make earnings volatile as select banks are looking to either improve provision coverage for NPLs towards 65-70 percent or may build provisions towards exposure to IL&FS (like IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank).

The research house said banks will benefit from write-back of MTM losses on G-sec books as yields corrected by 60bps during Q3 to near-March 2018 levels. ""PSU banks will be the biggest beneficiaries (as G-sec books are more leveraged) and some banks may utilise this to build provisions based on management discretion.""

The global investment firm believes corporate lenders like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and SBI should deliver better quality results in terms of slippage and core operating performance.

Earnings for smaller private banks like IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank may be impacted by provisioning for stressed loans and slower growth in corporate banking fees, according to the brokerage.

On the NBFC segment front, CLSA said earnings may also be volatile as increased levels of securitisation can lead to upfront profit recognition (this may not repeat).

It believes HDFC should see steady growth in core profit, but its net profit is down as its base includes profit from the sale of its stake in HDFC Life Insurance. ""Its YoY numbers will also be restated for the transition to IndAS.""

Among NLFs, revenue traction for companies operating in capital market businesses (insurance, mutual funds and brokerage) will show moderation, it said, adding ICICI Lombard should outperform peers. It remains its top-pick across NLFs.

Dharmesh Shah

As 2018 draws to an end, the big question on the investor’s mind is, how to navigate election year volatility?

The recent strategy report, titled 'Technical Strategy 2019' is, therefore, centred around complementing empirical inference with a bottom-up model to arrive at the prognosis for CY19. The message is amply clear: Shrug off the nervousness and embrace the equities.

Empirical evidence suggests in each of the past three election years, Nifty50 (large-caps) and Nifty500 (broad-based) have generated returns in excess of 11 percent and 18 percent, respectively.

History suggests the second half of election years has always witnessed a broad-based rally led by cyclical (double-digit returns). Our bottom-up method of prognosis for the Nifty projects an upside towards 12,200-12,500 in CY19, further validated by conventional chart work.

The key inference from the past three election cycles (covering two decades) is that cyclical have generated above-average returns for investors in an election year, which is concurrent with our bottom-up work.

The top two baskets of Nifty constituents a) turnaround stocks and b) outperformer stocks are led by cyclical and are likely to generate average returns of 26 percent and 24 percent, respectively.

Between two of them, they carry 62 percent weight of Nifty, thus corroborating our bullish stance, derived from empirical studies.

Anxiety around key events (domestic or international) has always triggered volatility in the past. However, markets always steer clear of them once anxiety settles down, irrespective of the outcome.

In two out of three occasions, the markets behaved indecisively five months prior to elections. In contrast, throughout the past three elections, both Nifty and Nifty500 exhibited a robust performance seven months post the election phase with average returns of 27 percent and 33 percent, respectively.

Stock selection: Deciphering the bottom-up way

Over the past few years, our emphasis on building a statistical model for stock selection, based on our in-house technical screeners, has provided rich dividends.

Year on year, we have strengthened our parameters to adapt to changing market dynamics. The virtues of such a statistical approach are:

(a) Removing individual biases in stock picking

(b) Efficient screening of market internals, which helps to build a holistic bottom-up approach

(c) Achieving more objectivity in market analysis to arrive at high probability investment ideas

Our in-house statistical model includes technical screeners to identify bargain buying, structural turnarounds, and outperformers. This bottom-up approach has provided valuable insights into sectoral internals, as compared to conventional ways.

Here is a list of our top 7 stocks which are a must buy for the year 2019:

Axis Bank Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 625| Target: Rs 755| Stop loss: Rs 569| Upside: 20 percent

We witnessed a breakout above the four-year-long ‘Symmetrical Triangle’ pattern that suggests a structural change is in the offing which could provide fresh entry opportunity.

A major support base is placed at Rs 580. Last two month’s consolidation base and 12 months exponential moving average (EMA) is also placed around Rs 583.

We expect the stock to head towards Rs 770 in the coming year as it is the 123.6 percent extension of the previous up move from Rs 481 to Rs 678 as projected from the recent trough of Rs 535.

Britannia Industries Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 3,098| Target: Rs 3,790| Stop loss: Rs 2,740| Upside: 22 percent

The share price of Britannia Industries has been trading in a secular bull trend and has undergone periodic corrective phases that have offered prices to cool off from the overbought situation.

Hence, time and again, they provided a fresh entry opportunity for traders. In the current scenario, prices have been inching northward after forming a higher base around Rs 2,650 as buying demand emerged from 61.8 percent retracement of last major up move (seen during February–August from Rs 2,200 to Rs 3,467) placed at Rs 2,684 coinciding with 12 months EMA placed around Rs 2,770.

We expect the share price to head towards Rs 3,800 in the coming year as it is the 138.2 percent external retracement of the previous decline (Rs 3,467 to Rs 2,628) placed around Rs 3,790.

Abbott India Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 7,462| Target: Rs 9,368| Stop loss: Rs 6,380| Upside: 25 percent

The stock is in a secular uptrend as it registered a breakout above multi-year highs around Rs 6,170 during the middle of the previous year and is seen maintaining a higher peak and higher trough on the long-term chart.

The last two year’s up move is well-channelled signalling sustained buying demand at elevated levels. The stock after the last three month’s corrective decline is currently seen rebounding from the lower band of the channel.

We expect the stock to resume its fresh up move and test Rs 9,370 in the coming year as it is the 123.6 percent external retracement of the previous decline (Rs 8,820-Rs 6,900) at Rs 9,370.

Voltas Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 551| Target: Rs 688| Stop loss: Rs 497| Return: 24 percent

The primary uptrend in Voltas remains intact as the stock is seen consolidating above the multiyear trendline breakout joining the high of CY10 (Rs 262) and CY16 (Rs 402) signaling a change of polarity as the previous resistance has reversed its role and acting as support.

A slower retracement of the previous up move signals corrective nature of current decline and positive price structure.

We expect the stock to head towards Rs 695 in the medium-term as it is the 138.2 percent external retracement of the previous major decline (Rs 637-Rs 472).

TVS Motor Company Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 564| Target: Rs 720| Stop loss: Rs 495| Return: 27 percent

The share price of TVS Motors has registered a breakout above the 12 months downward sloping channel signaling a reversal of the corrective trend and offers a fresh entry opportunity to ride the next up move in the stock.

The stock is seen rebounding in the last two months from the major support area of Rs 500-Rs 520 as it is a confluence of lower band of the last five months consolidation and 61.8 percent retracement of previous up move (Rs 355-Rs 794).

We expect the recent corrective decline to have approached maturity. The stock is likely to resolve higher from here on and head towards Rs 730 in the medium-term as it is the 80 percent retracement of the previous major decline (Rs 794-Rs 507).

JSW Energy Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 69| Target: Rs 96| Stop loss: Rs 56| Return: 39 percent

The stock has formed potential double bottom near the 80 percent retracement of the August 2013 to February 2015 up move (Rs 34 to Rs 125) signalling a reversal of the corrective trend and offering a fresh entry opportunity.

The up move during CY17 was on the back of the strong volume of almost double of 12-month average volume of 11 crore per months whereas the correction during CY18 was accompanied by very thin volume suggesting larger participation in the direction of the trend.

We expect the stock to maintain its positive bias and head towards Rs 97 as it is the 61.8 percent retracement of previous decline (Rs 126 to Rs 53) and high of January 2018 at Rs 97.

Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 204| Target: Rs 263| Stop loss: Rs 163| Return: 29 percent

The stock registered a breakout above the 30-month consolidation range of Rs 123–Rs 188, signalling a resumption of the primary uptrend.

The breakout was supported by the strong volume of more than four times the 12-month average volume of 1.8 crore share per month signalling larger participation in the direction of the trend.

We expect the share price to head towards Rs 263 in the coming year as it is the 123.6 percent extension of the previous up move (Rs 132 to Rs 215) as projected from the recent trough of Rs 160 signalling upside towards Rs 263.

This is the verbatim transcript of Axis Bank management call with analysts.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.

On behalf of Axis Bank, I once again welcome all the participants to the Axis Bank Conference Call. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Jairam Sridharan to brief all the guests on the Q2 FY 2019 Results. Thank you and over to you, Sir.

Jairam Sridharan: Thank you, Karuna. Ladies and Gentlemen, Good Evening. I welcome you to our conference call for the presentation of the bank’s performance for the Second Quarter of the Financial Year 2019.

On this call with me are my colleagues, Mr. V. Srinivasan -- Deputy Managing Director; and Mr. Rajiv Anand -- Executive Director (Retail Banking).

During this call, we do expect to refer to some slides in our Investor Presentation, so you might want to keep them handy.

I would like to start our conversation today with a discussion on asset quality. Please refer to slide #48 through slide #55 in the Earnings Presentation.

NPA ratios for the Bank improved sequentially with GNPA and net NPA reducing by 56 basis points and 55 basis points respectively. Slippages continue to remain at moderate levels after the highs seen in the fourth quarter of the financial year 2018.

Gross slippages in the quarter were Rs. 2,777 crores compared to Rs. 4,337 crores in the first quarter and Rs. 8,936 crores in the second quarter of last year. Slippages from the corporate segment were Rs. 1,089 crores.

Net slippages for the quarter were Rs. 591 crores compared to Rs. 1,420 crores in the first quarter and Rs. 7,888 crores in the second quarter of last year.

Corporate Slippages did come predominantly from our previously disclosed stress book. Of all corporate slippages in the quarter, 88% came from the BB and Below book.

During this quarter, we saw a net reduction of Rs. 1,536 crores in the standard BB and Below book. This information is on Slide #52, where you see the trajectory that the BB and Below book has taken over the last 2.5 years. You can see here that the BB and Below book today stands at Rs. 8,860 crores or 1.7% of gross customer assets. This level is less than one-fourth of the 7.3% peak it reached two years ago.

The various rating movements we saw during the course of quarter have strengthened our belief that the elevated rating downgrade cycle is now substantively completed.

Our provision coverage on NPAs has increased further this quarter to 73%. Our steady state target for PCR continues to be in the 60% to 65% range.

I would request you now to refer to Slide #54 that highlights the Bank’s long-term credit costs over the last 16 years. If you have followed the Bank’s Presentation over the last few quarters, you will notice a few differences here. You will notice that we have now disclosed two credit

cost trajectories: the normal credit cost that we have talked about in prior quarters and, an additional one that is adjusted for recoveries from a write-off, what we have called net credit cost.

I would like to take a moment to explain this chart to you. Over the long-term, annualized credit cost for the Bank has averaged 110 basis points, as you can see in the burgundy line here. The Bank consistently writes off accounts into a prudential write off the pool, after making 100% provisions. And any future recoveries that happen on the prudential write off a pool of accounts are reflected in the miscellaneous income line under the broader non-interest income category, and not as a release of prior period provisions.

If we notionally net these recoveries from the credit cost line, the resultant “Net Credit Costs"" that we have shown here in the grey line averages 97 basis points over the long-term. You will also notice that the gap between the two credit cost metrics tends to widen in the years immediately after credit cycle peaks. For example in the financial year 2005 to 2007 and financial year 2011 to 2014. Right now as we come off from the peak of last year, you might expect something similar going forward as well. We have seen some version of that in the first half of this financial year. The Bank presently has an accumulated prudential write-off portfolio (APWO) of Rs. 16,502 crores of which 81% has been written off in the last 6 quarters.

During the quarter, liquidity concerns faced by the non-bank financial sector got accentuated with one of the infrastructure conglomerates defaulting on some of its payment obligations. If you refer to Slide #46, we have made a disclosure regarding our outstanding to an overall financial sector that consists of Banks, NBFCs, Housing Finance Companies, Microfinance Institutions, and other intermediaries. Out of total combined fund based outstanding of Rs. 19,971 crores to NBFCs and HFCs, 99.6% is rated A or better.

Before we close our discussion on asset quality, I would like to mention the Bank’s outstanding to an infrastructure conglomerate that has been in the news recently. As of 30th September, we had an outstanding of Rs. 825 crores to this group, of which Rs. 238 crores is fund based including investments and Rs. 587 crores is non-fund based.

During the quarter, we have made a provision of 20% on the funded outstanding. Rs. 539 crores of the total outstanding to the group is currently rated BB & Below.

With that, let us move to the Bank’s Earnings Profile. I request you to refer to Slide #11 through Slide #18 of the Earnings Presentation.

Net profit for the quarter grew 83% Y-o-Y to Rs. 790 crores. Net Interest Income for the quarter grew by 15% Y-o-Y. If you refer to Slide #15, you can see that the Net Interest Margin for the quarter stood at 3.36%, with Domestic Net Interest Margin at 3.59%. This compares with a 3.29% global NIM in the first quarter, adjusted for the one-off recovery on an IBC 1 client last quarter which we have disclosed.

If you look at the next slide, you see that the yield side of the equation is showing strong signs of improvement. The Bank’s MCLR has increased by 50 basis points in the last three quarters and 54% of the advances are now MCLR linked. As you can see in the pie chart on MCLR duration, you can infer that over the next few months, existing MCLR accounts will continue to be reset at higher levels of new MCLR. This dynamic, along with lower slippages and interest reversals, give us confidence that margins are likely to see good support through rest of this year. As we mentioned at the beginning of the year, we expect NIMs in FY 2019 to be broadly in line

with full-year margins last year.

Non-interest income excluding trading income for the second quarter grew 15% Y-o-Y. Of this retail fee income grew a healthy 24% and now constitutes 62% of the total fee income of the Bank.

If you flip to Slide #17, you can see that the composition of our fee income line has fundamentally altered in recent times, with the contribution of corporate credit driven fees reducing significantly. Corporate credit, which used to contribute 24% of our fees at the end of first quarter financial year 2017, now constitutes 12%. This contribution has been picked up by our cards business, and other retail businesses. With such a significant shift, we believe the transition in our business model on the fee front is nearing completion. In line with this business model shift, corporate credit fees de-grew by 36% Y-o-Y in this quarter. Overall Fee income grew by 9% Y-o-Y. Trading Income contribution was much lower for the second quarter at Rs.

136 crores from Rs. 377 crores in the same quarter last year. This quarter also saw a sharp rise in yields across the G-Sec yield curve. Consequently, the Bank registered MTM provisions on investments of Rs. 136 crores during the quarter.

Operating expenses growth for the quarter stood at 14% Y-o-Y and that for H1 stood at 13%. The annualized operating expenses to average assets ratio stood at 2.15%, continuing the moderating trajectory of recent quarters. We remain on track for our goal of cost to assets under 2% in 3 years. Core operating profit rose 16% Y-o-Y.

Provisions and contingencies for the quarter decreased by 7% and by 12% Q-o-Q to Rs. 2,927 crores. For detailed break-up of provisions, you could refer to Slide #55.

Miscellaneous income during the quarter was Rs. 166 crores compared to Rs. 38 crores in the second quarter last year. This income includes Rs. 153 crores of recoveries from written off accounts.

Over the last four quarters, the Bank has recovered a total of Rs. 809 crores from written-off accounts. This corresponds to an annualized recovery rate of 11% on four quarter lagged writeoff. As you can see on Slide #55, the size of our prudentially written-off pool at the end of the second quarter stands at Rs. 16,502 crores.

Let me move now to a discussion on our Retail Franchise. The Retail franchise of the Bank continues to deliver. Overall deposit growth for the Bank during the second quarter stood at 15% Y-o-Y.

I request you to refer to Slide #07 in the Presentation on a new disclosure we have started this quarter on average balances. As you can see, in this chart on a quarterly average basis, CASA deposits for the Bank have growth at an average of 17% in recent years. The growth in this period has been quite steady with the demonetization related disruption creating some elevated quarters and subsequently some base effect for a few quarters thereafter.

In the second quarter, quarterly average CASA grew 13% Y-o-Y and comprised 45% of total deposits. Savings Account and Current Account balances grew by 17% Y-o-Y and 4% Y-o-Y, respectively on a quarterly average basis. You will also notice on the slide that growth in Retail Term Deposits has been gaining a lot of strength in the recent quarters. In the second quarter Retail Term Deposit grew by 21% Y-o-Y. CASA and Retail Term Deposits continue to form a strong, stable base of funding for the Bank and stood at 82% of total deposits. Retail fees have increasingly become more granular and annuity based. Cards fee grew strongly by 26% Y-o-Y and constituted 39% of overall Retail fees in the second quarter.

The Bank’s strategy on retail assets continues to be centered around existing customers of the Bank. 82% of retail assets originations in the second quarter was from existing customers. 97% of the Bank’s credit card and 90% of personal loan originations in the quarter were from existing

customers of the Bank. 49% of the overall sourcing happened through our branches. Given our internal sourcing strategy, we believe that branches remain essential for new customer acquisition and hence continue to make investments in developing an extensive branch network.

We opened 103 branches during the quarter taking our total network to 3,882 branches. However, the newer branches continue to get smaller in size.

On Slide #24 we have highlighted the strong growth of our wealth management business called ‘Burgundy’. Based on 2017 Asian Private Banker India rankings, we manage one of the largest wealth management businesses in India with assets under management of Rs. 127,425 crores as

of the end of September 2018.

Let us move now to Digital, where our strengths and leadership position continues. If you refer to Slide #29, you will notice that the Bank has a strong market share across most digital and tech payment product categories. Slide #33 talks about our leadership in the mobile banking space.

Mobile banking spends in the Q2 reported a growth of 106% on a Y-o-Y basis.

If you refer to Slide #31 our Credit Cards business has grown strongly with our market share growing 2x in the last 5 years. The Bank now has 5 million credit cards in force at the end of the quarter, making us the 4th largest credit card issuer in the country, with a market share of 12%.

On the next slide, you can see that Credit Cards spends in the second quarter increased by 44% Y-o-Y to Rs. 14,311 crores and Debit Cards grew by 39% Y-o-Y to Rs. 10,516 crores.

On Slide #35, we have showcased the significant increase in contribution from digital channels towards business growth. 63% of all Savings Accounts opened are sourced through Tab banking compared to 42% a year ago. In addition, 45% of all personals loan disbursements in the second quarter originated through digital channels as supposed to 17% a year ago.

The next slide, Slide #36 highlights our capabilities and our strong positioning in the UPI space. During this quarter, we saw 122 million UPI transactions, with a total transaction value growing over 22x Y-o-Y to Rs. 13,320 crores. We currently have a registered customer base of over 26

million and a market share of 8%.

Let me now discuss loan growth and the trends we are seeing across our business segments. The Bank’s domestic loan growth for the quarter stood at 15% Y-o-Y. The international loan book de-grew by 12% Y-o-Y. Our Loan to Deposit ratio at the end of the quarter moderated to 95%. The Retail loan book continued to grow strongly at 20% with continued diversification and portfolio mix towards products offering higher risk-adjusted returns.

If you refer to Slide #23, the growth in Retail Loans in Q2 was led by Personal Loans, Credit Cards and Auto Loans that grew by 39% - 33% and 27%, respectively. Our previously disclosed new engines of growth like Personal Loans, Small Business lending, and Education loans continue to see strong momentum. The momentum in the SME segment continued during the quarter with 14% Y-o-Y loan growth. Term loans and working capital loans grew by 7% and 17%, respectively. The share of working capital to overall SME loan book currently stands at 79%. Our focus here remains on building a high rated SME book. And presently, 89% of non-

NPA outstanding exposure is to clients rated SME 3 or better.

On the corporate loan book. Domestic corporate loan growth stood at 9% and the international book de-grew 23% Y-o-Y. With a focus on risk management in the corporate segment, we continue to drive our strategy along four dimensions - reduce concentration risk; build a higher rated lending book; increase the share of working capital loans and transaction banking revenues, and prepare for a move towards deeper bond markets through our DCM franchise. In line with these focus areas, you will notice a few factoids on Slide #41 through Slide #47:

79% of non-NPA outstanding exposure in corporate lending is to companies rated A or better, compared this compare to 70% a year back. New client acquisition continues to be focused on highly-rated customers, with 95% of new sanctions in the first half of this fiscal going to clients

rated A or better.

On Slide #44 – you can see that concentration risk in the book continues to reduce. Our exposure to top 20 borrowers, which was close to 300% of Tier-I capital some years ago, has consistently reduced and now stands at 120%.

On business mix, our business mix in Corporate lending continues to move towards Working Capital loans. Working Capital loans grew strongly by 21% Y-o-Y this quarter, and as you can see on Slide #42, they now form 31% of total corporate loans.

The impact of these moves on the risk management front in corporate credit can be seen most clearly on two metrics – On the Fees side, as we discussed before, this shows up as much more modest fee generation from the lending side of our corporate business. And on the RWA front or Risk Weighted Assets front, this shift in strategy shows up as noticeable lowering of our RWA to Assets ratio in Corporate.

Which gets us to a discussion on the Bank’s capital position. The RWA to assets ratio of the bank improved to 72% at the end of the second quarter. Driven by this improvement in RWA intensity over the last few quarters, the Bank’s capital consumption during the year continues to be modest. In the first-half of this year, the Bank has accreted 3 basis points of capital to CET1

after incorporating profits in the first-half. The Bank’s CET 1 ratio at the end of the second quarter was 11.71%, with a Tier 1 Capital Adequacy ratio of 13.04%, after incorporating profits in the half-year. Our capital position continues to be strong and is sufficiently robust for us to pursue growth opportunities over the next two years.

Finally, let us move to the performance of our key subsidiaries: The Bank’s subsidiaries have started to scale to a level where they are now able complements to the Bank’s overall strategy.

I would like to start with Freecharge – I would request you to refer to the Slide #65 in the Presentation. Freecharge remains an important component of the Bank’s strategy in the Fintech and payment innovation space. It is now exactly one year since the Bank acquired Freecharge, and we have made sound progress in this period.

As we had expected, the client base of Freecharge is fundamentally different from the core base of Axis Bank, and hence has augmented our reach. User base, activity levels, transaction volume, have all increased materially during this one year. We have also constantly expanded the products and services we are offering to our customers.

During the quarter, we started offering lending products on this

platform by offering Instant paperless loans and EMI on Debit Cards. We believe we have been able to derive synergies that what we had envisioned from this acquisition and the beginning of a journey that can bring together the best of both worlds. The agility of a Fintech company, backed by the strength of a Bank. In a relatively short span of time, Freecharge is progressing well in its journey from a payments platform to a complete digital financial services platform. We will continue to make significant investments making it a powerful financial platform over the coming years.

Axis Finance, our NBFC saw a loan book growth of 38% Y-o-Y to Rs. 7,329 crores as of the end of September 2018. Our important strategic thrust here is to grow the share of retail loans in the overall book. This share stood at 20% at the end of this quarter. our NBFC business continues to deliver good returns with an annualized return on equity of 17.42%, Net Interest Margin at 4.14% in first-half and has no NPAs so far. The NBFC continues to enjoy highest ratings of AAA by Crisil and A1+ for India Ratings, and maintains a comfortable liquidity position.

Axis Capital - The Institutional Equities and Investment Banking franchise of the Bank has been the leader in Equity and Equity-linked deals over the last decade. Overall capital market activity in first-half has been muted driven in part by increased volatility. Axis Capital executed 15 transactions during first-half including one QIP, 2 IPOs, 3 OFS deals, and 4 Advisory deals.

Axis Securities is one of the fastest growing stock brokerage firms in India. It currently ranks number #3 among brokerages in India in terms of the total client base. It also has one of the highest mobile adoption rates in the industry with over 39% volumes coming from Mobile. The cumulative client base rose 23% Y-o-Y during first-half to 1.96 million.

Axis AMC, our Mutual Fund business continues to perform well. The AMC reported 27% Y-o-Y growth in average AUM for the second quarter led by a 38% Y-o-Y rise in a number of client folios. Axis AMC now has an asset under management of Rs. 87,631 crores.

Invoicemart, the Bank’s digital invoice discounting platform has done exceptionally well in the first few quarters of its existence and continues to enjoy a market share of about 41% among all TReDS platforms. We currently have more than 890 participants on the platform and have clocked more than Rs. 1,163 crores in financed throughput by e-discounting over 73,400 invoices.

After the discussion of subsidiaries, I would like to close my comments but before that let me re-summarize some key themes of the quarter:

The slowing of new NPA formation and the reduction in NPA ratios increases our confidence in the belief that this NPA recognition cycle is nearing its end. Having increased provision coverage significantly, we continue to believe that we should see credit cost normalization trends in the second-half of this year. Core profitability metrics are gaining strength. Improvement in RWA ratios have strengthened our capital position and we do not expect to need any infusion of capital for the next two years. We continue to see strong growth opportunities, on both retail and corporate segments and will pursue them vigorously, within the construct of our risk and portfolio thresholds.

With that, I come to the end of my comments. We would be glad to take your questions at this moment.

Moderator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and Gentlemen, we will now begin the Question-and-Answer Session. The first question is from the line of Mahrukh Adajania from IDFC Securities. Please go ahead.

Mahrukh Adajania: Congratulations on a very good set of numbers. My first question was on the stress loan. So, we know the movement of the double BB pools and I have a question on that later. But the restructuring portfolio has remained stable across 2 quarters at Rs 28 billion, the restructured

loans have remained stable over the last 3 quarters at around 10 billion and then S4A at Rs 17 billion. So, is there any stress in these two portfolios because they have remained stable for the last 2 quarters? How will this portfolio behave in the next 6 months to 9 months?

Jairam Sridharan: Yes. So, Mahrukh, it is almost definitional that these things are not moving. These accounts have been restructured in a way that there are 2 pools here. There is the old CDR restructuring, which is about Rs. 1,100 crores. There is the rest of the restructuring dispensation, which is another Rs. 1,600 crores or thereabouts creating a total different kind of restructuring dispensations. The pool of about Rs. 2,700 crores this has not moved very much in the last couple of quarters mostly because of the restructuring dispensations are in play. So, if it is a 5:25 that is in play or any of the other dispensations that are in play, there is not much sort of principal paydown that is expected right now. So, we will continue to look at it. We will continue to make disclosures on it. As of now, there is no emerging concern and as you can see the size itself is relatively small

and as long as we are sure that this is not growing and is not causing any specific repayment issue, I think we are fine.

Mahrukh Adajania: Okay, so it is unlikely to slip this year? Or I mean, how do you look at it?

Jairam Sridharan: Well yes, I think I would say that it is unlikely to slip in the next few quarters, yes. The restructurings have been done somewhat recently in the last couple of years. The clients have been in line so far. I do not think there is much room here. And given the February 8 circular, any miss on any of the parameters of the restructuring dispensation will anyway quickly deem the accounts as NPA. There is not much room here. I think the accounts will be fine in the shortterm. We will keep making the disclosure about these to you all.

Mahrukh Adajania: Sure. And in terms of the non-fund based exposure of 28 billion, is that all likely to slip? Or is that a fair assumption?

Jairam Sridharan: Not really, Mahrukh. Actually, before I go there, let me make one other statement, I said that if you put all sorts of restructuring dispensation together, that is about Rs. 2,700 crores. Of that, I want to reiterate, about Rs. 700 crores is already in the BB book. The rest of it is not rated BB at this moment. So, clearly those are the stronger accounts. Now coming to your point on the devolvement of non-fund based facilities, you will see that even in the NPA book, we have had non-fund based facilities which have been open for fairly extended periods of time without devolving and so that tells me that devolvement is not a certainty in this case. By the way, on that note, let me also say that on NPA pool, we have about Rs. 2,800 crores. Just coincidentally the same number Rs. 2,800 crores of non-fund based facilities which have not devolved. So, no, I do not think it is 100% devolvement. But if I were in your place, I would start with some sort of a baseline assumption let us say 50% or 60% devolvement rate and do some sensitivity analysis around that.

Mahrukh Adajania: Okay, very helpful. Just in terms of addition to BB portfolio, was there any in the second quarter?

Jairam Sridharan: There was some addition but it was a 3-digit number, Mahrukh. So, we had a few hundred crores of addition. We had a few hundred crores of slippages and we had a couple of significant upgrades from BB out into BBB, mostly in the steel sector.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Manish Karwa from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Manish Karwa: So, first question is on your provisioning coverage. How are you thinking about it? Because you still are fairly comfortable close to 60% to 65%. You are already at 73%, would you still want to take it up? Or you think credit costs have to fall sharply going ahead, starting 3Q?

Jairam Sridharan: So, let us take it as it comes, Manish. I think, we are not trying to be too prescriptive about provision coverage ratio. We do believe that based on all our understanding of the LGD (Loss Given Default) of assets in the past, we do think 60% to 65% is the appropriate LGD expectation to have which means over the long run, you want to have provision coverage around 60% to 65% as well. As it happens, right now we are in the part of the cycle where provision coverage is on the way up. We aren’t going to necessarily try and engineer it to go up too much. We are not also going to try and engineer it on the way down. But all we are saying is yes, we have made appropriately conservative provisions right now. That is resulting in a provision coverage of 74% - 73% but LGD is continuing to point towards 60% to 65%. So, if we have sort of flexibility on the margin, you might see something happen in that direction but it is not going to be something that we are going to necessarily engineer.

Manish Karwa: Okay, and just a question on your subsidiaries. While even the top line has been good across all the subsidiaries but if we just look at the bottom-line, all subsidiaries have seen a reasonable decline, especially the smaller subsidiaries. But even Axis Capital has seen a decline. Why is

that? Is that some provisioning that you have taken? Or margins have come off?

Jairam Sridharan: No. That is a fair comment Manish, actually, each subsidiary has a separate story on what is going on. Axis Capital you mentioned, I mean clearly the deal volumes in the first-half have been much lower compared to the same period last year. That has caused some moderation in what has happened there. Axis Finance is broadly stable on IndAS terms, Axis Finance has a little bit of growth but really in Indian GAAP terms, it has been more or less constant in terms of what is happening. Some of the smaller ones have got idiosyncratic issues in each of them. AMC, you know what is happening in AMC right now in terms of the profitability dynamics. So, we are seeing some of that play out. So, yes I mean, I think you are going to see, as we expand some of these businesses and we try to scale them up, you will see a period in which we are significantly pressing the accelerator in terms of growth and try to get them to scale. And our operating expenses are not yet paying off in the revenue line. But this is because as we have been talking about for the last few quarters, we have made a conscious choice internally that we would like to scale our subsidiaries to the next level. And if that requires making some investments at this point of time rather than optimizing for profits, that is something that we are quite ready to do.

Manish Karwa: Okay. And last time you had given out the SMA-2 number. Do you mind sharing that for at the end of this quarter?

Jairam Sridharan: Our SMA-2 is under 40 basis points of loans. It is a very small number right now, Manish.

Manish Karwa: Okay. No, that is good. Thank you so much.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Adarsh P. from Nomura. Please go ahead.

Adarsh P.: I had a question on margins and you can to be descriptive about this. I just wanted to understand, one is the MCLR repricing and other is overall spread improvement that you would see because of the pricing environment. So, I just wanted to understand in each segment, maybe well-rated corporates, AAA, AA and the other segments, how is that panning out? And should one be hopeful of a decent margin improvement because of that?

Jairam Sridharan: So, thanks for your question, Adarsh. So, large corporates is the space in which the dynamic is most obvious or most clear. Clearly, almost the entire pool is MCLR linked. So, the MCLR dynamic plays out favorably in the entire large corporate outstanding book. Also, what we are seeing is a little bit of a return of pricing power in the corporate segment. Particularly with some of the bond market liquidity issues, etc., you are seeing a return of pricing power there. So, both the dynamics work favorably. There is a third dynamic as well in the corporate book, which is

around the reduction in the slippages and interest reversals, etc. So, all 3 dynamics are in favor in the corporate book. So, the corporate book is the one that we will see the most margin expansion. The retail book, ex-mortgages, you are seeing a reasonable amount of pricing power and essentially a somewhat steady sort of core margin trajectory. But in home loans, we are not yet seeing much in the form of margin expansion or pricing power increase. While some of the troubles of the HFC sector in recent weeks will probably translate to increased pricing power in the coming months, we have not seen evidence of that just yet. So, we will need to wait and watch. So, in the retail segment, the primary driver of margin expansion will be MCLR reset and not necessarily pricing power resumption.

Adarsh P.: So, is it. What I wanted to understand more is next year getting into FY 2020 this full impact of all of these pricing power, MCLR then lower NPLs all play out. So, any quantitative assessment on the kind of expansion that one could see? Or what will be the offset, if any, you can think of?

Jairam Sridharan: Yes, so as you know that we have not offered any sort of commentary or guidance on FY 2020. So, I will not get into that trajectory here but qualitatively speaking I agree with the thesis that you are putting forward, which is that the key effects in the market on the margin side right now are all tailwinds. So, right now, looking at all the different variables that are out there, it does look like margins should continue on an expansion trajectory. But let us wait and watch and let us not get sort of carried away too much by events that have happened in the last few months or quarters. We do not want to get kind of too overly optimistic on this front just yet. Let us wait and see but current momentum does seem to suggest that.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Krishnan Asv from SBICAP Securities. Please go ahead.

Krishnan Asv: Yes, I just wanted to check about the non-corporate slippages. Is that run rate a bit surprising in this quarter? Is there any one-off in that? Because your corporate slippages have dropped quite materially and that is very welcome to see. But your non-corporate slippages are close to about Rs 17 billion in this quarter. So, is that run rate something that you could see?

Jairam Sridharan: No, I do not think there is anything surprising there. You must have seen that the last few quarters have been very similar to this and if you look at on a net basis what the slippages are on a net basis, the total slippages Rs. 600 odd crores outside of corporate which is very much stable I do not think I am at all surprised by that. So, in the recognition regime that we are in which I have been talking about for the last couple of quarters where you make or you identify NPA on a daily basis and mark accounts as NPA on the 91st day that is going to result in an environment where gross slippage numbers look a little bit higher than what one might have been used to. But upgrades and recoveries also look a little bit higher compared to what one is used to. But the net numbers look roughly the same which is what you are seeing about Rs. 600 crores of net slippages I think are fairly benign for the non-corporate book which is about Rs. 250,000 crores

or thereabouts.

Krishnan Asv: Right, fair enough. The next question was pertaining to just your branch expansion. You mentioned roughly about 400 branches that we were likely to open during the current financial year. Just wanted to understand what your narrative in terms of your digital initiatives, is there any rethink around branch expansion strategy at this point of time?

Rajiv Anand: Hi, this is Rajiv. I think we have been guiding that we would open about 400 branches a year, and we did that last year. First-half of the year, it was about very close to that number. Our own expectation is that we will continue to open branches till we get to about somewhere in the vicinity of about 4,500 branches. We are about 3,900 currently and we will look to reevaluate that as we go forward. I do not think it is an either or scenario, I think if you look at it in the context of India yes, we are seeing very-very strong digital penetration across most parts of the country. But I think as you go deeper into the country, the physical presence is a very important

component particularly in the context of trust. And we are also seeing an increased number of assisted digital transactions going through the branches, particularly in semi-urban and rural areas as well and remember that while we are present in about 2,000 towns and cities across the country, a little over 80% of those we have a single branch. And as the catchment areas continue to grow in these areas as there is more affluence in these areas it becomes imperative for us to open one more branch. So, therefore, are we opening branches in the middle of Bombay or Delhi? The answer is no. But as these cities are expanding as the affluent areas are growing wider and wider, the need for our physical presence still continues. So, it is not an either or case that either we open branches or we do digital. We continue to see great progress on our digital initiatives and great progress in terms of the amount of transactions that are going through

digitally. We are seeing more transactions, more sales going to go in through digitally as well. And I think that imperative will continue.

Krishnan Asv: Great. Just one last thing, could you just help with the stock number for GNPAs in retail and SME?

Jairam Sridharan: We do not disclose our NPA by segment, Krishnan. We have said that the overall NPA is roughly Rs. 31,000 crores, GNPA book. We do not, at this point offer GNPAs at segment level.

Krishnan Asv: Okay, because I was under the impression in the June quarter you did, so okay. That is all. Thanks.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nilanjan Karfa from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Nilanjan Karfa: On the real estate sector right, are you witnessing any pain or stress? Because I recall in our earlier discussions, that sector is obviously seeing some kind of a pain already, right? And we do have about 3.5% of standard exposure out there.

Jairam Sridharan: Yes. So, our overall exposure in real estate is roughly around Rs. 15,000 crores or thereabouts. And give or take 60% of that is LRD (Land and Building Developers) exposure and we feel fairly comfortable with where that is. We also see that in terms of ratings, about 48% is A or better. Another about 44% or so is BBB+ or BBB. And 8% is BB or BB or below. Overall, just looking at the product construct I can see from our rating mix the way our internal ratings work, the ratings capture the fact the real estate is in general, fundamentally a slightly riskier business.

So, ratings tend to be subdued for all real estate developers in general and that is reflected in the rating mix. Overall, portfolio composition why we feel very comfortable with our exposure in either commercial property or land and developer segment, as we said 50-plus percent or 50% to 70% depending on how you count is pure LRD exposure, we feel pretty good about that. Srini, do you want to add anything in that?

V. Srinivasan: I think it is perfectly fine. I think the bulk of our real estate primarily is in LRD and even in the other exposures, we will primarily focus on the commercial real estate.

Nilanjan Karfa: Right, so the residential part is relatively low, is it?

V. Srinivasan: Relatively. Yes, quite low.

Jairam Sridharan: Relatively, the residential part is less than Rs. 1,000 crores.

Nilanjan Karfa: Right, that is good. Second is on just IBC. I mean, would you want to share some data in terms of what is the total exposure? I mean, just not talking about the list 1 or list 2 but overall IBC. What is the kind of claims that we have claims and on books?

Jairam Sridharan: Sure. So, Nilanjan first, let me talk about list 1, list 2 and then I will come to the overall as well. In list 1 and list 2, we have about Rs. 4,600 crores or something in terms of exposure and we have about Rs. 4,200 crores of provisioning against it. So, we are provided at about 90%. If you look at the overall accounts that are in IBC or going through different phases of NCLT, our total exposure is about Rs. 11,000 crores and we have a provision of about Rs. 9,500 crores. So, we are upwards of 80% or roughly 81% provision coverage on all accounts that are in any part of NCLT, whether they are list 1, list 2 or anything else.

Nilanjan Karfa: Right. And my final third question, I think to an earlier question, it looks like next year should be reasonably a lot - a lot better. The question is where are we ploughing back some of this money into the business? Which business will need the most amount of money? I mean, beyond talking about branch expansion, if you can just share us some of those strategies?

Jairam Sridharan: Sure. I am sure I will be able to tell you a little bit more once a certain gentleman joins on November 19th. But in the meanwhile, I will say that we have talked for the last few quarters about being a RAROC driven in terms of allocation of capital and having our internal model RAROC guide us on which are areas we should be making more investments and which are areas where we would be making less. Clearly, there are some things which are pretty straightforward. We do want to grow our corporate book a little bit faster than what we have been growing right now. We will be making more investments in our subsidiaries and clearly, in the transaction banking space, etc. you would see us make a lot more investments. As far as retail is concerned, we have been fairly consistent in the kinds of businesses that we want to grow. Clearly, unsecured is that we are very interested in. Small business financing of various kinds, we have said we are very interested in and education loans, we said we are interested in. Those are spaces that will continue to grow disproportionately fast compared to what you have seen in the past.

Nilanjan Karfa: Right. Any exit ROEs for this year and let say in the final quarter? Should we be in double digits?

Jairam Sridharan: No, Nilanjan, let me not get into that. Let us see how the year goes along. We have not given any guidance on this so far. I do not want to start.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Parag Jariwala from White Oak Capital. Please go ahead.

Parag Jariwala: Yes, I have 2 questions. One, is there any departure in the senior management team apart from what you disclosed in the Press Release? Anyone who is president and above post the announcement of the new MD?

Jairam Sridharan: We will see over the next few days and weeks if there is anything. If there is anything for us to disclose, we would be making the appropriate disclosures. As of now, I have nothing to report. Parag Jariwala: Okay. And secondly, you have highlighted about the NIM trajectory etc. But I mean, one, is the margins we have lost because of the interest reversal and all those sorts of things? And secondly, in terms of changing of the business mix and etc? So, on a sustainable basis, can you give some numbers where do you see this your margins to settle?

Jairam Sridharan: Sure. So, if you tracked us for a while, you might recall that for a long time, we have been talking about 350 to 375 basis points as the sustainable range of margins for the Bank. I do think that, 3.5% to 3.75% continues to be the right range for us to think about in terms of sustainable NIM for the Bank in the medium-term to long-term. It might take us a little while to get there. But that is something in terms of global NIM that we want to get to. And naturally, the India NIM would be meaningfully higher than that.

Parag Jariwala: Okay. And lastly, you know in terms of this NBFC liquidity and all those sorts of things, how we are approaching this situation in terms of LAP and home loan? Are we in a position to buy more from against securitization as well as direct transfer from the customers?

Jairam Sridharan: So, on NBFC liquidity situation, I do think we are monitoring the situation closely and we are looking for opportunities that might arrive. But we have look at it on a case-to-case basis to see whether it is profitable, whether the underlying transaction is going to be executed operationally in an efficient manner, etc. I do not think we are going to go out there necessarily to try and ‘solve’ our liquidity issue. We might go out there if there is a particular interesting opportunity for growth that is available, and we will see on the deal-to-deal basis. Srini, anything else to add on?

V. Srinivasan: I think I agree with Jairam. I think we will look at what opportunities emerge and if portfolio buy out makes sense, we will look at it.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rakesh Kumar from Elara Capital. Please go ahead.

Rakesh Kumar: Just one question regarding the MCLR based loan pricing mechanism. My question is that could we increase the average maturity of loans for the loans under the MCLR in a declining interest rate scenario. Right now, we are in a rising interest rate scenario but suppose one year down the line or even 2 years down the line when there is a declining interest rate scenario, could we change the average maturity of loans under the MCLR? Like you know on the liability side if you see our average maturity of a deposit has been close to around 3 years with around 45% to

46% of deposit falling into 1 year category and this interest rate is declining, can we change that? Or what would be our strategy in that time? Thank you.

Jairam Sridharan: So, in general, our approach over the last couple of years, you have heard us talk a lot about product mix shift. And one of the product mix shift you heard us talk about is in the corporate side, in particular, moving away from term loans towards working capital, etc. This mix shifts

in my mind are a much simpler way to achieve the maturity profile matching that you are talking about rather than looking at individual account level or client level changes in maturity. I do think the bank or all banks need to have an appropriate matching of asset and liability maturities. And having a right business mix will get you there. And we have been making, in our opinion, all the right moves in getting to that destination.

Rakesh Kumar: Just one more question if I could ask. On the credit card side like on the volume side, the market share gain in value terms in the last 5 years is not comparable. Why so?

Jairam Sridharan: Yes, that is true. Our spent market share gain and the number of cards market share gain is not exactly the same. You know spends take a little bit of time to catch up. The way cards businesses work is you originate an account and particularly for franchises like Axis, where our core franchise is essentially a type of customer who does not have multiple credit cards in the past. In fact, our core franchise is a group of customers for whom we are the first credit card. So, for these customers, just getting them acclimatized and used to the idea of using cards takes a little bit of time and spend slowly builds up. And as we have seen, spends have been building up and they would lag your number of cards by a year or so. But you will see that catch-up. There are not that many businesses in which you are going to see us have a double-digit market share. This is one of them. So, this is actually a business that we are enormously proud of in terms of the

way it is built out. And both in number and value terms, we are very happy with the progress it is making and hopefully, that trajectory will continue.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mahesh M.B. from Kotak Securities. Please go ahead.

Mahesh MB: To Mr. Jairam sir, I am just kind of laying down the questions to you guys, sir, you can just take up whichever way you want it. So, Mr. Jairam, what is the outstanding security receipts that we have at the end of this quarter? To Mr. Srinivasan, just wanted to understand what is the status on the power sector? We saw some fair amount of resolutions in terms of interest, at least coming forward a couple of months back. Just wanted to understand any read-through on why it has fallen? And also how should we read into these upgrades and recovery which we are doing today, which is approximately Rs. 2,000 crores a quarter. How much of it is essentially cash sales to ARCs, how the distressed market evolving? Or these are a one-off settlement that you are able to negotiate with your defaulters? Also on the APWO portfolio of Rs. 16,000 crores is it predominantly corporate? And if the recoveries are coming at around Rs. 800 crores, where is it coming from? To Mr. Rajiv, just one question. Is there further scope for ROA improvement? Thanks.

Jairam Sridharan: All right. Let me take a few of the ones. Outstanding SR portfolio is about Rs. 3,000 crores, nothing much has changed there. The APWO pool of Rs. 16,000 crores, how much of it is corporate? Almost all of it. There is a small amount which is retail, etc. but really almost all of it is corporate. Where are the recoveries coming from? From the corporate side of that book as well.

Rajiv Anand: Yes, this is Rajiv. I will take the easy one first before the difficult one for Srini. Is there improvement in ROA? Absolutely, I think across various sides of business, there is certainly more pricing power. So, I think that should certainly add to ROA. There are also initiatives to ensure that we are increasing our end-to-end digital sales on our retail lending side such that acquisition cost is managed And I think that should add to ROA as well as we go forward.

V. Srinivasan: So, in the power sector, nothing has changed. So, currently status quo court order is there. So, we have to wait for the court to tell us whether all the power projects going into NCLT or there is room for us to go to out and do this outside NCLT. So, we will have to wait for the court order, the status quo to be removed.

Mahesh MB: Okay, and how should we read into these Rs. 2,000 crores a quarter of recoveries and upgrades that you are doing? How much would be sales to cash sales to ARCs? And how has the distressed market evolved according to you, guys?

Jairam Sridharan: Yes, there is no sales to ARC in this number for this quarter. If there are ARC sales, etc., we tend to disclose it specifically. This quarter, there is none. All of it is just organic recoveries from the client themselves. And you might recall that third quarter last year and from there on, we have moved to the regime of daily recognition of NPA, where NPA tagging happens on the first day. And that results in an outcome where both gross and recovery upgrade numbers look a little bit higher than one might be used to in the past, though the net numbers do not necessarily change a whole lot. So, that is also behind some of the optical dynamics that you are seeing.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Abhijit S. from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Abhijit S.: The first question is on the LAP book. When we look at the quarter-on-quarter movement, there appears to be a 16% - 17% growth. Anything specific to read into it?

Jairam Sridharan: In the LAP book?

Abhijit S.: Yes.

Jairam Sridharan: LAP growth is 25% year-on-year. It is on Slide #23.

Abhijit S.: So, it has moved from 8% of retail to 9% this quarter.

Jairam Sridharan: No, there might be some be some rounding off thing because the data we are showing is 9 but really not much I mean, yes.

Abhijit S.: And the second one is on Axis Finance. So, since 80% of it is corporate. What is the mix of loans? What is granularity like on this book?

Jairam Sridharan: Yes. So, there is some promoter funding-type stock, there is real estate-type lending, there is some structured finance stock, and there is some retail that is broadly what is there in the Axis Finance book. As I mentioned, so far there are no NPAs in this portfolio. And we continue to see fairly pristine credit quality. We continue to watch it, though. I mean, if the NBFC plays in a particular space the bank does not play in. So, one has got to continue to watch it and be careful on the credit risk side. We are continuing to look at it but credit risk is not an area that is giving us sleepless nights on the NBFC, to be honest. We are watching also some other market developments in that space.

Abhijit S.: And finally, the Agri book has been behaving well over the last 3 months to 6 months?

Jairam Sridharan: Yes. Look, from a credit perspective, it is been behaving okay. I mean, we had a big event of course, in the first quarter of last financial year. Since then, things have been relatively benign. The thing about the Agri book is growth is actually turning out to be a little bit of a challenge. So, with the elections coming up in the coming year, one’s also being a little bit careful about what kind of lending and which geographies does one want to get into. So, we are waiting and watching that space a little bit. So, growth is actually a bigger challenge right now in Agri than risk. The risk seems fairly benign and under control.

Abhijit S.: And the last one is a share of mutual fund fees in the overall retail fees.

Jairam Sridharan: Yes. It is about 8%,

Abhijit S.: Retail fees was close to Rs. 1,500 crores this quarter?

Jairam Sridharan: Around Rs. 110 crores, so yes, less than 10%. So, it is 7-8% the mutual fund fees.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nakul Gupta from CLSA. Please go ahead.

Prakhar: Hi, Good Evening. This is Prakhar. Two sets of questions, one on the retail side, the other on asset quality. On the retail side just 3 subsequent questions. One, why is CASA growth continuing to be slower despite you adding branches? Second, home loan growth is very slow at 11%. And the small business banking loan is very high at 76%. What is the comfort you have there? That is the retail part.

Jairam Sridharan: First of all, small business, we are very happy with the growth rates there. We have been talking about this a long time. We want this to be one of the drivers of the retail book going forward. It is an important untapped opportunity in the marketplace. And starting from a small base, you are obviously going to see very high percentage changes. It is not something that particularly bothers us. We have a 5-year plan in place in terms of what we want to do with this business and we are on track in trajectory to get there on small business lending. We are watching the risk

very-very closely. We recognize that this is almost definitionally a higher risk segment. Of course, we are getting paid for it more than adequately. But it is a place where we need to continue to watch the risk and we are, and we feel good about how that is headed. And as far as CASA is concerned we have shown, you might see this time a fairly long-term trajectory in terms of average balances of CASA and how they have changed and how they are growing quarter-on-quarter. If you look at Slide number #7, and you go back all the way to 2014 and you look at the Y-o-Y growth rates on an average book basis, you see that it is been very stable.

There is not much that has changed there at all. It is a very narrow range between 13% and 17% quarter-on-quarter. Just steadily, we have been delivering and we have been growing. You cannot engineer a book sort of more closely than that. As we have spoken about in the past, there

is a lot of sort of let us call it “quarter end management” that sometimes happens with respect to CASA numbers. We have not been in that game and that is why we are actually specifically sharing this new disclosure this time on how our quarterly average balances are doing. And if you see that chart, you can clearly see how we have been in a very narrow 13% to 17% range quarter-on-quarter consistently over the last multiple years, except for the 4 quarters when demon pushed us up and then the 4 quarters thereafter when base effect pushes you down a tad. But really overall, it has been very-very consistent in terms of what CASA growth has been. So, we continue to feel fairly satisfied with how CASA is doing.

Prakhar: Home loans, yes.

Rajiv Anand: If I can add to the deposit piece as well. I think one of the big drivers this year, this quarter and in fact, this year has also been the renewed thrust on retail term deposits. And I think you have seen very good traction there and we do expect that to continue as we go forward. And as you think about the total deposit book in the context of some of the loan growth that Jairam has been talking about, that CASA plus TDs then becomes a critical, TD and its growth then becomes a critical component. I think the point that you made on home loan versus our small business banking remember that home loan business is a little over 1 lakh crores. The SBB business is about Rs. 5,000 crores. So, in that sense, the bases are quite different. So, even at 11%, the growth in absolute terms is quite high. I think, it was always our stated philosophy to grow slightly slower than the market within this space in the context of the pricing pressure that we have seen so far in the home loan space, and to be able to compensate for both the growth as well as the yield with higher rates of growth, particularly on the unsecured side. Let us see how things pan out post the tightening of liquidity, and as NBFCs begin to slow their growth and as we get out pricing power back, we could potentially see this growth number going up a bit.

Prakhar: Sure, thank you. Just on the asset quality, just quick things. One, could you just reconfirm the non-fund exposures to NPL? I wanted if you could confirm.

Jairam Sridharan: It was Rs. 2,800 crores, Prakhar.

Prakhar: Rs. 2,800 crores, okay. Last quarter, you had given a nice slide on power sector exposure. I did not see this one but should I regard it as it is more or less the same?

Jairam Sridharan: Yes, nothing much has materially changed. We thought you might be more interested in NBFC this time. So, we put an NBFC slide instead of power sector details.

Prakhar: It is very useful. Just wanted to confirm more or less it is unchanged.

Jairam Sridharan: Yes, more or less the same.

Prakhar: And just lastly, any further color on the IL&FS exposure. Do you think it is something you have to watch out for in your portfolio perspective?

Jairam Sridharan: Not really Prakhar like we have given a lot so if you see Slide #46, we have given a whole lot of the disclosure there on what is going on there, and we made available the provision on all the funded stuff, we have made 20% provision. There is not much, we will just wait and watch what the resolution process is. It is going to be the same for the entire industry. We will do what it takes. The loan part of or the funded part of our IL&FS exposure is like 0.5% of our total loan book. And our market share in IL&FS is 0.9%. So, it is really like it is a really small exposure for us. So, we will do whatever is required as and when it sort of pans out. As of now, we made a 20% provision.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jai Mundhra from B&K Securities. Please go ahead.

Jai Mundhra: Sir, firstly on this corporate growth. So, now we have been doing a bit of portfolio rebalancing in favour of working capital loan let us say and reducing term loan. So, on a net-net basis, how should we see this portfolio balancing panning out? I mean, in terms of net growth, so far it is

flattish Y-o-Y.

Jairam Sridharan: Yes, there is a lot of opportunities there in the corporate segment. There are 2 different things going on here. One is sort of the growth that you want to pursue. The second is the business mix that you want to pursue. Clearly, we have said that from a business mix perspective, we would like to have a little bit more working capital than we had historically. We have been overweight term loans and underweight working capital in this space in the past. We want to get equal weight on them and that is why you will see a little bit of product shift. As far as an opportunity in the corporate segment for growth is concerned, Srini, you have any thoughts?

V. Srinivasan: No, I think as Jairam was saying there is nothing like we would not do term loans. Clearly, I think opportunities exist and you will see and even if you look at over this quarter, I think the offshore book has come off and the domestic book has shown some growth and you will see that

accentuate as we go forward.

Jai Mundhra: But this sort of rebalancing should continue till we achieve sort of.

V. Srinivasan: On an incremental basis, you should see more working capital. But you will see term loan also coming well.

Jai Mundhra: Sure. sir. And secondly, in IL&FS exposure so we have Rs. 825 crores exposure, but we only put Rs 500 crore something in that BB and below. So, what about the rest? If you can clarify or that has already been NPA?

Jairam Sridharan: Yes, there are a couple of operating companies in the group which are in the technology and technology enablement kind of spaces which we have not put in the BB pool. The rest of the accounts we have put BB and below the pool.

Jai Mundhra: Okay, and the provision where we have made this is still the standard assets, right?

Jairam Sridharan: Yes, yes. Everything is standard now. So, we have made provision in the other provision column.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amey Sathe from Tata Mutual Fund. Please go ahead.

Amey Sathe: Hi. Just 2 questions. One is on the what is your domestic CD ratio?

Jairam Sridharan: Domestic CD ratio is about 85%.

Amey Sathe: Okay. And if you look at our ROE, so in terms of capital consumption, so how do you see the Tier-I say, probably end of the next year or do we need to raise capital by end of fourth quarter

FY 2020?

Jairam Sridharan: As I said, we have a common equity Tier-I of 11.71% at the end of this quarter. In a typical year over the last 11 years if you see the average, we have consumed about 55 basis points of capital, which means for 1.5 years you are talking about what 80 basis points - 90 basis points. We would be fairly comfortable at that level. Remember also that there are some warrants which some investors have subscribed to, which will fall due in June of next year or which will expire in June of next year. So, if those warrants get exercised that will give us an additional 40 basis points of CET1. So, put it all together and until the end of FY 2020, the math does not seem to suggest that you would need to get to the market. You should still be fine. There might be an intermittent quarter or 2 where you might flirt with the 11% line on CET1 but then with the expected exercise of the warrants, you will come right back up and we should be fine.

Moderator: Thank you. Ladies and Gentlemen, this was the last question for today. With this, I now hand the conference over to Mr. Jairam Sridharan for his closing comments. Over to you, sir.

Jairam Sridharan: Thank you very much. Ladies and Gentlemen, thanks for attending the call. Wish you all a very happy, prosperous and safe Diwali. And I am happy to have been able to spend this evening with you and hope you all have a relaxing weekend.

Moderator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and Gentlemen, on behalf of Axis Bank, that concludes this conference call. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.",11104,0.6743716991716816

Edited excerpt:

Do you see RBI reducing rates in 2019 or a change in its stance?

The reduction in inflation forecast to 2.7-3.2% from 3.9-4.5% should have ideally lead to lesser hawkish monetary policy. As the shift in policy stance was done in the last meeting, it was difficult for RBI to reverse the same.

If one sees continued benign data on the inflation front, one can hope for increased liquidity from RBI, going forward, to support credit growth.

We believe even if the RBI does not act, bond yield will come down if the inflation is benign as aggregate demand and supply are more relevant than RBI rate. As we have seen earlier as well that despite RBI reducing rates in 2015-17, the transmission of rates did not happen.

Do you think the pain in the mid and smallcaps is here to stay in 2019 as well?

Since small and midcaps are down 35 percent (Nifty Smallcap 50) and 13 percent (Nifty Midcap 50), respectively, so far in 2018, there could arise an opportunity where you find good quality stocks at attractive valuations in these segments but avoid averaging stocks whose fundamentals have deteriorated significantly.

We are focused on stories, which are benefiting from crude price fall. Also, we are seeing some improvement in liquidity for NBFCs which will help in a rebound in credit growth helping these companies grow.

After a muted 2018, what are your predictions for 2019?

The market has more or less disappointed investors in 2018. The Nifty50 has merely given 4 percent YTD return till date. The rising crude oil prices, depreciating rupee and international trade tensions were some factors that affected the market in 2018.

However, in 2019, because of lower crude prices many macro challenges like currency depreciation, increasing CAD and inflation are getting resolved.

2019 strategy: Top five fundamental safe stocks which are good buys at current levels for a holding period of 1 year?

We expect the following stocks to perform well in the coming year (2019):

Indian Energy Exchange (IEX): To benefit from growing volumes in the short-term electricity market.

L&T Infotech (LTI): Strong client mining and deal win momentum would lead to the sustenance of top-tier revenue and earnings growth.

Axis Bank: To benefit from robust NII growth and a decline in loan loss provisioning.

Larsen & Toubro (L&T): Improving the capex cycle and government thrust on infrastructure spending will be the key triggers.

Bajaj Finserv: To benefit from a higher share under the motor segment (general insurance), focus on customer retention, and increasing the absolute value of new business (life insurance).

Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in the coming year?

We are positive on capital goods and IT sectors. While capital goods stocks have not participated much in the recent rally, growth momentum is likely to be decent going forward considering the impact of the upcoming elections and on the assumption that private capex will make a return.

In the IT space, improving demand in America led by a pick-up in retail and the stability in the BFSI segment will support growth. The strong demand for digital solutions is also positive for the IT sector.

Do you think rupee will continue to appreciate in the near term?

We have already seen some recovery in the rupee over the past one month, primarily on account of the decline in crude oil prices. It will depend on the future direction of crude oil prices and the trend of foreign flows.

Also, the headwinds with regard to Brexit deal and trade wars will ensure that the volatility may rise, going forward.

Any sector(s) which you think could turn out to be dark horse in 2019?

The capital goods sector could be a dark horse in 2019 due to the possible easing of pricing pressure due to the return of private capex and pick up in order execution.

What should be the ideal strategy for investors for the next one year?

At any given time, one should invest based on their risk profile. There is no hard and fast rule; an aggressive person can invest 70% in equities, 20% debt, and 10% in gold, whereas a person with a moderate risk appetite can invest 50% in equities, 35% in debt, and 15% in gold.

A conservative investor should invest 50% in debt, 20% gold, and the rest in equities. However, from a tactical allocation perspective, one can increase weight in equities with a bias toward smaller & mid-cap companies.

The rise in the Nifty50 which we witnessed in the month of November was nothing but a short-term pullback. It retraced nearly 50 percent of the September-October fall and thereon the index seems to have started the next leg down.

The short-term momentum indicator that has been showing negative divergence has triggered bearish crossover. Thus, a top seems to be in place at the recent high of 10,941 and the index looks poised for a fall towards 10,000.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 12-15% return in the next 1 month:

Dabur: LTP: Rs 411| Stop Loss: Rs 395| Target: Rs 463| Return 12%

Dabur formed an Impulse on the upside from the level of Rs 362 till Rs 426 and has retraced the same till 38.2% retracement mark which is also a key Fibonacci level, the stock has started rallying again. In the last session, the stock has crossed a falling trendline on the hourly chart.

Axis Bank: Sell| LTP: Rs 603| Stop Loss: Rs 630| Target: Rs 535| Return 11%

Axis Bank has broken down from an Ending Diagonal pattern recently. The pattern marks the end of a short-term pullback and the stock has started a fresh move down. The daily momentum indicator has been showing negative divergence whereas the weekly momentum indicator has given a fresh sell signal

Ujjivan: Sell| LTP: Rs 215.85| Stop Loss: Rs 227| Target: Rs 182| Return 15%

After a short-term pullback, the stock has formed a distribution near the junction of 40 daily exponential moving average & the daily upper Bollinger Band.

The two in combination act as key hurdle zone. From there the stock seems to have resumed the medium-term downtrend.

What a comeback from the bulls. D-Street snapped the 3-day losing streak on Friday; however, it closed lower for the week.

Let’s look at the data. For today, Sensex ended 361 points up at 35,673. However, for the week, the index closed 1.4 percent lower.

The coming week will be guided by macro data as well as state election results. Apart from that movement of crude oil price, rupee FIIs flows as well as trade talks will be guiding factors.

Foreign investors have pulled put close to Rs 400 crore from the Indian stock market in the last five trading sessions amid weakness in global equities due to the arrest of a high-profile Chinese executive. This comes following a net inflow of over Rs 10,000 crore in November.

Big News:

Markets will react to exit polls. Traders are advised to go long on a fresh breakout above 10950 levels on closing basis. Majority of market participants want a stable ruling government rather than one having a fractured mandate.

Most of the exit polls suggest that Congress is likely to make a comeback or at least give a tough fight to the ruling BJP in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan as well as Madhya Pradesh. From a market point of view, the other two states like Mizoram and Telangana are not material to the markets.

Four out of five exit polls have shown Congress leading in Madhya Pradesh. India Today–Axis poll has given between 102-120 seats to the BJP, and between 104-122 seats to the Congress. Times Now – CNX has given 111 seats to the BJP and 109 seats to the Congress, NewsX-Neta survey has given 106 to the BJP and 112 to the Congress.

(Image: PTI)

Axis Bank on December 8 inducted Amitabh Chaudhry as additional director on its board, three weeks ahead of his taking over as the new managing director and CEO of the private sector lender. He will replace incumbent Shikha Sharma whose fourth term has been curtailed by the RBI by nearly two-and-half years.

In a board meeting held on December 8, Axis Bank approved the appointment of Chaudhry as additional director. The board also gave its nod for the reappointment of Samir Barua, Som Mittal and Rohit Bhagat as independent directors.

""The Board ...has appointed Amitabh Chaudhry as an Additional Director of the Bank and to hold office as such till the conclusion of the ensuing Annual General Meeting...,"" Axis Bank said in a regulatory filing.

The appointment is subject to approval of the shareholders, it added.

Chaudhry, the former MD and CEO of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company, was in September named the MD and CEO of Axis Bank for a period of three years, with effect from January 1, 2019.

Chaudhry, 54 years, will take over from Shikha Sharma after she demits office on December 31, 2018.

He started his career in corporate banking with the Bank of America in 1987, where he worked in diverse roles.

In July 2017, the board of Axis Bank had approved the reappointment of Sharma, who was to start her fourth term as MD and CEO from June 2018.

However, in April this year, Sharma wanted her new term to be reduced to seven months from a three-year tenure without citing reasons, which was accepted by the board.

It was learnt that the RBI had asked Axis Bank's board to reconsider the decision to reappoint Sharma amid concerns over rising bad loans on the bank's books. She had completed her third term as the bank's head on May 31.",349,

Equity markets across the world rallied on trade truce between the US and China. The domestic markets also opened in positive but failed to sustain above 10,900 as GDP and fiscal deficit numbers weighed on the market.

The Nifty finally settled at 10,884 on December 3, marginally higher by 0.06 percent for the day. Market breadth on NSE was slightly in favour of advances.

Broader market indices BSE Midcap and Smallcap were up 0.5 percent each for the day. The index filled falling gap area (10,755-10,847) and retraced 50 percent of the entire fall (11,760-10,005). But after six consecutive sessions of gains, the last couple of candlesticks on daily chart suggests momentum is waning and market could pause the rally.

Thus, if the index starts to trade below 10,835 then expect a test of the 200-day moving average which comes around 10,745. Below this, the next support is seen at 10,650.

On the upside, if it sustains above 10,940, expect a rally towards 11,090 which is 61.8 percent retracement of the current fall.

In Nifty options, maximum open interest for Puts is seen at strike price 10,000 followed by 10,500; for Calls it is seen at strike price 11,000 followed by 11,500. Put writing was seen in 10,500 and 11,000; while Call writing was witnessed in 11,100 and 11,500.

The earnings seasons ended on a positive note with more companies reporting in-line or better than expected earnings. For Nifty 50 companies, 30 companies reported in-line or better than expected results while the other 20 companies missed the estimates.

Due to this, the earnings estimates for the Nifty50 index was cut by 5 percent and 2 percent for FY19 and FY20, respectively. IT and Capital Goods sectors have seen earnings upgrade by the consensus, while other sectors have seen earnings downgrades.

Even though other sectors have seen earnings downgrades but except for automobiles, telecom and pharmaceuticals downgrades have not been significant.

While the financial performance can be considered in-line with expectations, but the operating performance was ahead of expectations. Margin pressure was seen in certain sectors but with crude prices cooling off from the recent highs, the challenges of margin pressure are slowly abating.

Post earnings, the broad picture for the market appears to be constructive. While the earnings picture is constructive, the political environment is getting charged.

The market volatility will continue to remain at elevated levels ahead of the state election. Volatility manifests into higher equity risk premium which in turn mean that valuation multiples across sectors are likely to be capped.

This scenario often augurs well for value investing. Moreover, the banking sector is slowly coming out of woods with two important banks ICICI Bank and Axis bank showing improving operating and financial metrics.

Thus, investors should focus on valuation metrics. Companies with reasonable price to book value backed by improving operating metrics are likely to outperform.

Banking sector stands out, and private banks, both large and mid-sized banks are likely to gain market share over the medium-term are likely to perform well. ICICI, Axis, Federal, and DCB are likely to outperform over the medium term.

Apart from the banking sector, telecom sector gained a lot of attention in the recent past based on market sentiments of an impending price hike by Reliance Jio.

While Reliance Jio has categorically not indicated anything but considering the stress in the sector a spate of price hikes cannot be ruled out. Bharti has managed to hold its course during this turmoil in the sector in terms of revenue and subscriber market share.

Valuations on P/B for Bharti are reasonable, and it is more likely to gain more from price hikes (if happens) as Vodafone-Idea is still chalking out its strategy.

Cement and Infrastructure plays are the other areas where there could be investable stories. The cement price hike is likely in this quarter and players like Ambuja could be the gainers.

Infrastructure stocks are also cheap and have healthy order books. This could be another area to focus. Overall, the market seems optimistic with range bound valuations but options galore with the right value investing strategy.

The debate is on and there is no easy answer to the questions – ‘where should you place your bets?' Should one invest in large, mid or smallcaps?

Going by the statistical data for 2018, S&P BSE Sensex outperformed the broader market. The S&P BSE Sensex rose 3 percent compared to 25 percent fall in the S&P BSE Small-cap index, and 16 percent downward move in the S&P BSE Mid-cap index. S&P BSE Largecap index also recorded flat-to-negative returns in 2018, so far.

Investment in any asset class should be determined by your risk profile. Data suggests that largecaps have been more stable, while volatility has been seen in the mid- and small-cap indices.

The broader market has been weighed down by a host of issues starting with SEBI reclassification of MF schemes, governance issues, fall in crude oil, mixed results from India Inc., and high valuations. But, is it the right time to buy into small or midcaps?

However, some stocks, especially from the small-cap space, outperformed and more than doubled investor wealth this year. The list includes Excel Industries, DIL, Responsive Industries, Merck, Generic Engineering & Construction and National Peroxide.

Many experts feel that large-cap stocks will offer a better value, and that is what has happened in 2018 also. However, some experts say that there is value in the broader market but the key is stock selection.

“We continue to like broader market over the largecaps. We also note that the market is witnessing a strong divide in valuations across quality and ordinary businesses notwithstanding market capitalisation which warrants that investors should be stock-specific now,” Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICIdirect.com told Moneycontrol.

“Emphasis should always be on buying a business which are run"" in a capital efficient way and possess sustainable growth prospects,” he said.

Shibani Kurian, Sr. Vice President and Head of Equity Research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company is of the view that large caps will still offer stability in a portfolio.

“However, after the sharp correction in midcaps, their valuations are now converging towards large caps and many of the excesses of the past have been erased. In this environment, with a 3-5 year view, certain midcaps, which have a strong growth outlook, sound management, strong capital allocation policies and have superior return ratios do provide an investment opportunity,” she said.

In the S&P BSE largecap index, as many as 21 stocks rose 10-20 percent in 2018, including Axis Bank, Marico, Infosys, Dabur India, Nestle India, Bajaj Finance, TCS and Tech Mahindra.

In the S&P BSE Mid-cap space, as many as 12 stocks rose 10-40 percent, including Havells India, JSW Steel, Berger Paints, Mphasis and Divi’s Laboratories.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services is of the view that largecaps provide a better chance of investment in the long term given a healthier risk-reward ratio. Whereas, mid and small caps have a higher risk of a downgrade in earnings and valuation in the future.

“The short term is looking positive whereas, in the medium term, the intrinsic value of equity as an investment asset is under evolution. In the very near term, this rally can get volatile but can get positive in the long term as downtrend in crude prices is maintained. India earnings downgrade is over and valuation has become bit more rationale,” he said.",563,0.7406072244048119

The market witnessed a gap-up opening following positive global cues but drifted into negative in the first half to rally strongly in the latter half. The Nifty closed on November 26 with 0.97 percent gains at 10,628.

The market breadth was disappointing on NSE with seven stock advancing for 10 declines. Lack of broader market participation is a concern as BSE Midcap and Smallcap remained flat for the day.

After touching high of 10,775 last November 19, the index had been declining and touched a low of 10,490 on November 26 where it found support at its 20-day moving average.

Now, the index has an immediate resistance at 10,650-10,660 which needs to be crossed for the rally to continue towards 10745-10845 levels, where 200-day moving average and falling gap area resistances are seen.

On the downside, immediate support is seen at 10,490-10,450. Breaking below this level, the index can decline towards 10,300.

Here is a list of top three stock which could give 11-15 percent return in next one month:

Larsen & Toubro Limited: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,422| Stop loss: Rs 1,360| Target: Rs 1,600| Return: 12 percent

The stock touched a high of Rs 1470 in February this year and had been in sideways to negative correction mode between Rs 1,470 and Rs 1,182 for the last nine months.

Now, the stock crossed its falling resistance trend line which connected highs of Rs 1,470, Rs 1,425 and Rs 1,390 on the weekly chart and continues to trend higher. Thus, signaling the end of correction with a sharp rally from lower levels.

MACD line has given positive crossover with its average and moved above equilibrium level of zero on the weekly chart. Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips towards Rs 1,395 with a stop loss below Rs 1360 and a target of Rs 1,600.

PVR Limited: Buy| LTP: Rs 1,437| Stop loss: Rs 1,380| Target: Rs 1,600| Return: 11 percent

After hitting a high of Rs 1,655 in May last year, the stock has been in a correction mode. In the last four months, the stock has formed a double bottom on the weekly chart.

The lows of the bottom were formed at 200-day weekly moving average and it is now trading above the average on the daily chart. Currently, the stock is trading at a breakout level and is consolidating in a narrow range which is generally expected to give breakout in direction of previous of the previous trend i.e. uptrend.

The Relative strength index (RSI) and Stochastic have given positive crossover with their respective averages on the daily chart. Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips towards Rs 1,415 with a stop loss below Rs 1,380 and a target of Rs 1,600.

Axis Bank Limited: Buy| LTP: Rs 631| Stop loss: Rs 600| Target: Rs 730| Return: 15 percent

The stock has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern on the weekly chart and is trading in a range of Rs 650 and Rs 350 for more than three and half years.

On the daily chart, the stock has seen a sharp bounce back from 200-day moving average and price has been consolidating in narrow between Rs 635-600 for the last three week.

Thus, it has formed bullish pole and flag pattern on the daily chart that is expected to give a breakout on the upside.

ADX line indicator of trend strength is steadily moving higher above neutral level of 20 indicating strength in up move. Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips towards Rs 620 with a stop loss below Rs 600 and a target of Rs 730.

Tata Elxsi Limited: Buy| LTP: Rs 994| Stop loss: Rs 950| Target: Rs 1,100-1,135| Return: 14 percent

The stock again tested 200-day moving average twice and then bounced back. Relative strength index has turned up from its average and moved above 50.

Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips towards Rs 1,435 with a stop loss below Rs 1,385 and a target of Rs 1,600-1,650.

Given the background of low inflation and slower growth, the Reserve Bank of India is unlikely to hike rates in the near term, said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services in an interview to Moneycontrol's Sunil Shankar Matkar.

Q. Do you think the market can hit new highs or is there a chance for double-digit returns in the next one year?

A. While the market has remained rangebound, what remains elusive is the broad market earnings recovery. Against this backdrop, it is challenging for market valuations to re-rate further, in our view.

In fact, the downside risks to earnings estimates have increased over the past few months, given the liquidity concerns, the rising cost of funds and input cost inflation. We still remain in an earnings downgrade cycle. Therefore, our portfolio strategy remains premised on earnings visibility and valuation comfort.

While our preference still remains with largecaps (given the sharp moderation in valuation premium for midcaps over the past nine months), we believe that interesting bottoms-up opportunities have started emerging.

Amid an environment of uncertain and volatile macros and a forthcoming busy political calendar, we place disproportionate emphasis on earnings visibility.

Q. What has been your reading of September quarter earnings? What is your expectations for next quarter/half year of FY19?

A. The September corporate earnings report season was broadly in line with our expectations as far as the Nifty earnings are concerned. However, MOSL Universe numbers missed our expectations, entirely attributed to disappointments from PSU banks and telecom sectors.

One of the key positives from this earnings season was the improving revenue growth trajectory. For the MOSL Universe, aggregate sales grew 25 percent YoY (a 26-quarter high).

Capital goods, metals and healthcare posted profits ahead of our expectations, while PSU banks, oil and gas, telecom and utilities missed our expectations. For the quarter, Nifty sales/PAT grew 26 percent/10 percent, in line with our estimates.

We expect Nifty EPS to grow 13 percent in FY19. For H1FY19 the earnings have grown at around 11 percent and hence our expectation for H2FY19 is a growth of around 14-15 percent.

Domestic cyclicals are expected to post double-digit growth in Q3FY19 and Q4FY19. This will be led by private banks, which are expected to post double-digit growth in Q3FY19 (first time since Q4FY17). PSU banks, too, will benefit from a low base. NBFC universe's performance is expected to moderate significantly, but it will still maintain the double-digit growth trajectory.

Q. Crude has corrected sharply over the last couple of weeks. Can we expect it to stay in the $60-70/barrel range over the next one year?

A. Crude oil prices have been supported by a record production by Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US. Along with these increases, downward revisions to demand growth forecasts and US President's decision to grant sanctions waivers to buyers of Iranian oil, have reversed market sentiment from fears of a supply shortage to concerns about a glut in the space of three months.

While it is difficult to predict the oil price movement, especially as they have been driven by geopolitical factors lately and have witnessed a sharp increase in volatility. Nonetheless one can assume the Brent crude price to be in the range of $60-70/barrel as this is beneficial for both the oil producing as well as consuming countries.

Q. Do you expect rate hike from RBI as well as FOMC in the December policy meeting?

A. India's headline retail inflation was lower-than-expected for the fifth consecutive month at a 13-month low of 3.3 percent in October 2018. This was primarily due to a fall of 0.1 percent in food prices.

Retail inflation is expected to remain at around 3 percent in Nov-Dec'18, on the back of softer crude oil price and low food inflation. Further, Real GDP growth is also expected to weaken from 8.2 percent in Q1 to 7-7.2 percent in Q2, and further to 6.5 percent in the second half of FY19.

Given this background of low inflation and slower growth, we don't expect RBI to hike rates in the near term.

Q: What are your top five bets for next one year?

ICICI Bank | Target Price: Rs 400 | Return: 12 percent

ICICI Bank reported a strong second quarter under new management, as fresh slippages were in control and gross stressed assets/watch-list declined sharply. Net earnings improved sharply, led by better margins and steady loan growth.

The provisioning coverage ratio increased sharply by 330bp QoQ to 59.5 percent. ICICI is in the midst of an improvement in the operating environment and is showing healthy signs of earnings normalisation.

With challenges related to management transition getting addressed, the bank is now focusing on growing its core operating profits.

Axis Bank | Target: Rs 750 | Return: 19 percent

Axis Bank's Q2 net earnings came in better-than-expected, led by steady revenue growth and controlled operating expenses. NIM expanded 7bp QoQ to 3.4 percent, and management guided for an improvement in the NIM as MCLR re-pricing happens.

Asset quality improved as fresh slippages subsided. Loan growth stood at 11.2 percent YoY, led by 20 percent YoY retail loan growth and 14 percent YoY SME loan growth. With an improving outlook on fresh slippages/credit cost and clarity at top management, we expect earnings to start normalising second half of FY19 onward.

We expect balance sheet cleanup to get over and earnings to return to normalcy during the second half of FY19, and warrant conversion should provide additional capital to support growth thereafter

Maruti Suzuki | Target: Rs 8,484 | Return: 13 percent

Maruti Suzuki Q2 revenues grew 2 percent YoY to Rs 22,230 crore, EBITDA margin shrank 240bp YoY to 14.5 percent, adjusted PAT declined around 15 percent YoY to Rs 2,100 crore.

Despite the cyclical headwinds, we consider Maruti’s long-term narrative as attractive – it is a market leader in the under-penetrated aspirational category, with solid and deep moats around its business.

We remain positive on Maruti, given its (a) multi-year favourable product lifecycle, (b) better product mix (higher share of premium products), aiding realisations/margins, (c) reducing JPY exposure, (d) lower capex intensity, (e) better FCF conversion and (f) sharp improvement in RoIC. We believe Maruti would gain further market share, driven by 10 percent volume CAGR over FY18-21.

Titan Company | Target: Rs 1,045 | Return: 14 percent

Despite the challenging base, Titan continued reporting strong topline growth in jewelry (segmental sales up 29 percent, aided by strong 32 percent SSSG, 24 percent volume growth). Management commentary indicated that the outlook for Jewelry remains buoyant.

Recovery in watches revenues and margins continued at a healthy pace. We believe that premium valuations are fully deserved for a business that has perhaps the best revenue growth potential in the retail space (20 percent CAGR growth in jewelry – its largest segment – in the next five years). The healthy outlook on margins led by operating leverage also provides visibility of strong earnings growth.

Exide Industries | Target: Rs 304 | Return: 20 percent

Exide’s Q2 revenue grew by 15 percent YoY at Rs 2,720 crore driven by growth in automotive, inverter and industrial batteries. Further cumulative price increase of around 3-3.5 percent in the automotive segment has also aided revenues.

EBITDA grew 12.4 percent to Rs 330 crore. Adjusted PAT grew 17 percent to Rs 190 crore. We expect Exide to improve its market share as economic recovery-led demand is expected to come in from AUTO OEM and Industrial segment.

Exide has taken several initiatives at the market and product quality level, which is being reflected in market share recovery, product quality improvement and recovery in margins. We believe Exide is on track to reduce the performance gap vis-à-vis its peers like Amara Raja.

Axis Bank shares gained 2 percent on Monday after global investment firm HSBC upgraded the stock to buy from hold and also raised target price by 24 percent.

The research house increased its target price for country's third largest private sector lender to Rs 730 from Rs 590 earlier, implying 19 percent potential upside.

""Axis Bank's ahead-of-the curve branch expansion will help its net interest margin as growth picks up,"" HSBC reasoned.

The gap in return on equity/growth outlook drove its relative preference for Axis Bank over ICICI Bank.

The research house has downgraded ICICI Bank to hold from buy after the recent rally, but raised price target to Rs 390 from Rs 345, implying 11 percent potential upside.

In case of HDFC Bank, HSBC has maintained its buy call but slashed price target to Rs 2,350 from Rs 2,398 due to underperformance.

At 14:34 hours IST, the stock price of Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 626.50, up Rs 12.20, or 1.99 percent. ICICI Bank was up 1.39 percent at Rs 356.85 and HDFC Bank up 2.05 percent at Rs 2,046.50 on the BSE.

Centrum's research report on Axis Bank

We retain HOLD on Axis Bank with TP revised upwards to Rs560 (valued at 2x FY20E ABV) . Q2’19 results were in-line with our estimates on revenue / operating front. Slippages came in lower (2.4% of loans); provision coverage therein has improved further. The share of vulnerable pool is now at a meagre 1.7% of customer assets and provides greater comfort. Capital position remains strong and will cushion asset growth in the credit up-cycle. While we see levers in place, we would await for better clarity on long-term growth strategy for the bank under the leadership of the new management (change of guard will be effective from Q1CY19). Valuation at 2.2xFY20E ABV appear reasonable. Prefer ICICI Bank in the private banking space.

Outlook

Retain HOLD with TP at Rs560 (valued at 2x FY20E ABV). Key risks: Lower than expected margin improvement or higher than expected slippages and thus credit cost thereon.

Volatile movements based on current political scenario involving elections, along with any downside on GDP growth are big headwinds for the market, Naveen Kulkarni, Head of Research at Reliance Securities told Moneycontrol’s Uttaresh Venkateshwaran. But that could be seen as an opportunity.

“Investors should be buying on dips stocks, which are backed by quality and earnings growth. This is a good time to build portfolio as higher volatility will mean lots of opportunities to accumulate quality stocks at discounted prices,” he told the portal. Edited excerpts:

What has your assessment of the current earnings season been? What are the big hits and misses?

The earnings season was by-and-large in line with the consensus expectation. Outlook on margins ahead is a little bleak. While there have been some cuts to the earnings estimates, it isn’t very significant. Nifty companies’ earnings for FY19 have been cut by 5% and for FY20 by 2% which isn’t very significant.

Some of the big hits in terms of outlook and quality of earnings have been for ICICI Bank and Axis Bank. Misses have been for Bharti Airtel, Asian Paints and Ultratech.

How should an investor approach the market from a one-year view?

One-year view of an investor should be to focus on value, backed by quality and earnings growth companies. The next six months will be volatile because the political temperature will climb.

State elections followed by general elections will keep the markets guessing. Thus, earnings visibility and valuations become very critical factors.

Investors should be buying on dips stocks which are backed by quality and earnings growth. This is a good time to build portfolio as higher volatility will mean lots of opportunities to accumulate quality stocks at discounted prices.

What are the key headwinds and tailwinds to watch out for?

Political scenario continues to evolve and next one month will set the tone for the general elections. So, market volatility is a key headwind and if GDP growth rate were to slow down then that will present as key challenge for growth.

However, the current macro situation is improving. The banking system has also passed the peak of challenges of stressed asset cycle. Overall the macro situation seems more encouraging and constructive now.

Given the backdrop of NBFC situation, how should one look at such stocks? Any bets in the financials space?

The near-term challenges of liquidity in NBFC sector are slowly receding but there are structural challenges of the cost of funds having risen for NBFC sector.

However, the companies with niche positioning and solid track record are likely to gain market share over the medium term.

We like Shriram Transport, Bajaj Finance and Mahindra and Mahindra Financial services in the space. We also like the gold financiers Muthoot and Manappuram as they have lesser challenges of asset liability mismatches and can deliver credible RoEs.

What is your outlook on some of the infrastructure or capital goods segment, given how Larsen & Toubro’s performance during Q2 has been?

Larsen & Toubro (L&T) reported strong numbers. Overall the capex cycle seems to be picking up albeit slower and later than expected. There could be some short-term challenges as government capex closer to elections is likely to dwindle, but from a medium-term perspective the sector is likely to do well as valuations are reasonable and order books are pretty strong.

What are your top 5 stock picks? Could you share the price targets and a rationale as well?

Infosys | Target: Rs 795

It is gaining ground and inching closer to the market leader in terms of deal wins but has a significant valuation gap. Offers decent upside from current levels and it is unaffected by the domestic challenges. Hence, a solid portfolio stock.

ICICI Bank | Target: Rs 390

It is a fast-improving lending book with a major cleanup. It has a solid retail franchise and well-placed to gain market share.

Sonata Software | Target: Rs 420

This high quality mid-cap IT company is available at discounted valuations of 12x FY20E earnings.

Engineers India | Target: Rs 169

All time high order book provides revenue visibility. The valuations are cheap at 13x FY20E earnings.

DCB Bank | Target: Rs 207

It is a fast-growing bank in the midcap space with solid exposure to MSME space. It is likely to gain market share from NBFCs.

Axis Bank’s incoming chief Amitabh Chaudhry will join in an executive position (CEO elect) starting November 19 to help smooth top order transition in the bank as Shikha Sharma will step down as CEO and Managing Director on December 31.

“This will facilitate a smooth transition and help familiarise him with the business before he assumes charge as MD & CEO starting January 1, 2019,” the bank said.

According to Sharma, “There is a leadership transition happening in the bank and I think from a succession point of view, we should have an orderly transition as Amitabh hopefully will join November 19. There will be some handover time before I step down on December 31. I think we have made good progress on that front as well.”

In addition, the private bank’s Deputy MD V Srinivasan will not seek an extension after his three-year term ends in December, Sharma confirmed in the post-financial results press conference.

Srinivasan led the markets and corporate banking at Axis Bank.

Srinivasan has not revealed the reasons for not extending his contract and also where he is headed. The second in command to Sharma for the last three years, he joined Axis Bank in 2009 after Sharma became the CEO succeeding PJ Nayak.

Sharma said, “There is a leadership transition happening in the bank and I think from a succession point of view, we should have an orderly transition as Amitabh hopefully will join Nov 19. There will be some handover time before I step down on December 31. I think we have made good progress on that front as well.

On the leadership and growth trajectory, she said the bank has built an enormous amount of capability across different parts of business over the years.

“Yes, we have had hiccups on corporate credit side just as any other lender who has participated in that. I would argue that even within that segment, our credit experience has been better than that of average corporate credit bank. But nevertheless, we have learnt our lessons from that, we have tightened our risk infrastructure,” Sharma said.

All of that capability resides in the organisation both in terms of people and processes and systems, Sharma added.

""Srini and I are both responsible leaders who want to make sure that that capability becomes an organisational capability and that will very much remain part of the Axis franchise. People come and go, but I think institutions last much longer if they are built right,"" she concluded.",468,0.9645845890045166

Axis Bank, India's third-biggest private sector lender by assets, on November 2 posted a better-than-expected 82.6 percent jump in second-quarter profit, boosted by higher interest income, lower provisions and improvement in asset quality.

Axis Bank, the country's third largest private sector lender, is expected to report double-digit growth in earnings for the quarter ended September 2018. Low base due to higher provisions in Q2FY18 and fall in provisions may support strong profit growth.

The stock was one of the outperformers as it rallied 20 percent during September quarter and 7 percent year-to-date due to early recovery bad loans.

Brokerage houses expect profit growth for the quarter in the range of 40-90 percent compared to year-ago.

Prabhudas Lilladher expects the maximum growth of 91 percent YoY. Emkay Research and Nomura expect 80 percent each, Kotak 43 percent, and Motilal Oswal 56 percent.

Provisions for bad loans are likely to decline in the quarter ended September 2018 as not only Axis Bank but also other banks made maximum provisions till Q1FY19.

""Provisions should come off from previous levels, the bank will also take some PCR improvement,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher which expects provisions falling 10 percent YoY and 15 percent QoQ.

Kotak expects 18 percent YoY and 10 percent QoQ fall in provisions while Nomura sees 11 percent YoY and 16.4 percent QoQ decline.

Net interest income is also expected to grow in double-digits on stable loan growth and margin.

""NII growth should hold as margins stabilise (removing the benefit of IT refund in Q1FY19), and expect a slight improvement in loan growth,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher which expects NII growth at 14 percent YoY.

Motilal Oswal expects Axis Bank to report around 12 percent loan growth, driven by continued strong growth in the retail and SME segments. ""Deposit growth is likely to be around 11 percent, resulting in an elevated CD ratio of around 99 percent.""

Emkay Research, which sees 20 percent NII growth, said business momentum should continue to stay robust, with retail loans continuing to lead growth. ""We expect margin trajectory to improve in Q2FY19.""

Asset quality is likely to be stable, but slippages might remain elevated in the quarter ended September 2018.

Prabhudas Lilladher expects gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances to decline by 21bps sequentially while Emkay Research expects Axis Bank to continue moving toward normalisation in slippages and credit costs. ""We expect the bank's sub-investment grade pool to generate slippages.""

Kotak, which expects slippages of Rs 3,500 crore, said benefit from NCLT cases would be lower in Q2FY19.

Net stressed loans for the bank has declined to 6.7 percent, while the bank has already improved its coverage ratio to 69 percent.

""Though there are some signs of recovery in NPL cycle, we still expect slippages to remain at elevated levels (around 4.5 percent annualised slippage ratio), as the bank proceeds to clean up its balance sheet (this should lead to high credit costs, which is expected to start normalising from second half of FY19),"" Motilal Oswal said.

With just around Rs 10,000 crore of stress book left to be recognised, Nomura expects slippages to normalise with some normalisation in retail/agri slippages.

Key issues to watch out for

> Quantum of corporate slippages from BB and below list and any revision in the size of the stressed assets

> Bank's strategy on retail and unsecured loans

> Liquidity situation and the commentary on the margin/growth outlook

While investors have been worried about returns amid steep market fall, some promoters have used the opportunity to increase stake in their companies during the September quarter.

Promoters of as many as 74 companies in the S&P BSE 500 index raised their stake in the second quarter. These stocks have fallen up to 80 percent in 2018 and on quarter-to-date basis, data from AceEquity showed.

Companies in which promoters raised their stake include Manpasand Beverages, Infibeam Avenues, HCC, Indiabulls Real Estate, Tata Motors, DB Corp, The India Cements, Dish TV, BPCL, Bharat Electronics, IDFC Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Ashok Buildcon, CEAT, and Punjab National Bank .

Most of the stocks which fell in double digits are small & midcaps. The fact that promoters are betting on their firm is a sign of confidence and after a double-digit fall, the valuations have also come down.

But, does that make them an attractive buy? Maybe not. Investors should do their own research before putting money in stocks which saw a rise in promoter holdings.

“Generally, it is a positive development for an investor but it should be followed by self-research to take an investment call. It usually happens when promoter foresees potential value or future growth in business which is expected to realise in future,” said Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“However, investors shouldn’t fall prey to false information related to value or growth in business, and they must do a diligent study to justify the stance of promoter raising the stake,” he said.

We have a list of 30 stocks out of 74 in which promoters increased their stake in the September quarter:

On the flip side, promoters decreased their holding in 87 companies in the S&P BSE 500 index including 8K Miles, Ajanta Pharma, Axis Bank, Avanti Feeds, Cipla, Cyient, DLF, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Eicher Motors, Kotak Mahindra Bank, JustDial, M&M, MindTree, MOSL, NATCO Pharma, NIIT Tech, Yes Bank, and Wockhardt.

Equity markets around the globe have been under pressure on account of trade war fears, interest rate hike and valuation concerns.

The domestic equity market also declined more than 10 percent from August peak while stocks also eroded a substantial wealth. Investors lost more than 6 lakh crore in terms of market capitalisation on the BSE in October alone.

On BSE, as many as 383 stocks saw a rise in promoter holding for the quarter ended September 2018 including Omkar Speciality (down 86% in 2018), Sintex Plastics (down 68%), and Mcnally Bharat (down 77%).

After hitting record highs in August 2018, benchmark indices have now corrected more than 14 percent triggered by a weak rupee, rising crude oil prices, trade war concerns, FII outflows and high valuations.

“Post this steep price correction in the broader markets, there is certainly value emerging in some the stocks as indicated by their promoters’ activity in the open market,” Soumen Chatterjee, Director- Research, Guiness Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Promoters have raised stake in many beaten-down names signaling that the promoters believe that their stock is trading below its intrinsic value,” he said.

Why do promoters raise stake?

Promoters could raise their stake in the company due to a variety of reasons, but usually, it is done when they find value or the market price is below the intrinsic value, suggest experts.

Analysts advise investors to examine the fundamental health of underlying company in terms of sustainability, earnings growth, exposure towards debt, and consistency of return on equity before putting money in stocks which saw a hike in promoter holding.

“The reason for raising stake by promoter may differ at times but the primary reason is when they find value in business or possibility of a positive turnaround in a future course. Promoters may also carry out this activity to prevent from possible hostile acquisition by other business,” said Rohira of 5nance.com.",650,-0.5629044704967074

The Reserve Bank of India is expected to keep key policy rates unchanged in the remaining 2018-19 fiscal, said Saugata Bhattacharya, Senior Vice President, Business and Economic Research, Axis Bank.

""My guess is at least is this year we won't see a further rate hike,"" he said.

He also said that major components of growth may moderate going forward cyclical component has shown upward movement from 2016-17, current investment cycle is driven by government spending and inflation trajectory seen down for the next 2-3 months.

He further said that US Federal Reserve has been signaling rate hike but RBI will not hike rates to match the Fed move. ""No clear correlation between Fed money policy and RBI money policy,"" he added.

Subdued prices of vegetables and fruits in summer, when prices normally tend to escalate, gave comfort to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Urjit Patel to hold on to rates, but the higher oil prices forced him to change the stance from neutral to calibrated tightening.

RBI governor stated that the change in the central bank’s stance is due to the rising international oil prices that pose a challenge to inflation. He said in the current rate cycle ""rate cuts are off the table"". RBI had maintained a status quo in its October policy after two consecutive rounds of rate hikes of 0.25 percent each.

Bhattacharya said the RBI policy of focusing on inflation and letting the currency do the heavy lifting was a hugely mature step.

Liquidity is likely to tighten further in H2 FY19, requiring significant infusion to prevent the cost of funds spiking up.

""The problem with liquidity management is its fungibility. Infusion of funds at longer maturities will flow back into short-maturity instruments, increasing the potential of forex market volatility.""

""If volatility continues, RBI will have to squeeze near-term cost of funds, while more durable liquidity infusion attempts to flatten the yield curve, which has steepened excessively over the past year,"" he added.

He also said that portfolio flows to India will slow down as liquidity may tighten in the months ahead

Talking about rupee depreciation, Bhattacharya said that the rupee has probably passed the worst unless the surprise elephants like election do any damage.

He said non-banking finance companies must be prepared and maintain adequate liquidity cushion to offset the potential risk in CPs, which emanates from high dependence on rollovers and refinancing on maturity.

Bhattacharya said around Rs 40,000 crore NBFC funds are about to mature in 2-3 months.",426,-0.7185571193695068

The Nifty breached its 10-SMA and formed a small green candlestick as BankNifty led the overall bullish sentiment on D-Street on Tuesday.

Buying was seen in broader indices as the NiftyBank was leading the sentiment with gains in bluechip banks such as ICICI Bank, SBI and Axis Bank. Reliance Industries and HDFC added further strength to Nifty and helped the index to close above 10,550.

The momentum was strong in indices but the range was much smaller as compared to previous trading sessions. The small green candlestick with a gap-up does indicate strength but also marks a note of cautiousness as a follow up is needed.

The upside remains open towards 10,650 – 10,700 but it will be too soon to take bullish call given the indicators are showing a weaker trend strength.

We remain cautious and suggest to have a short-term scalping play rather than a directional play. Bears may get active at higher levels of 10,700 – 10,650.

Here is a list of top three intraday trading ideas for Wednesday:

Torrent Power: Buy| LTP: Rs 245.10|Target: Rs 250| Stop Loss: Rs 240| Return 2%

The stock outperformed benchmark indices with good volumes and closed near its intraday high on Tuesday. The momentum oscillator CCI has also given a closing above 100 on the daily chart and it also gave closing above the 200 EMA on the daily chart.

We recommend buying the stock at the current level for an initial target of Rs 250 with the stop loss placed below Rs 240.

Tata Elxsi: LTP: Rs 1039| Target: Rs 1060| Stop Loss: Rs 1035| Return 2%

The stock outperformed well with average volumes and closed near its intraday high. The RSI has also shown the reversal from the oversold zone on the daily chart. We recommend buying from the current level for the target of Rs 1060 and a stop loss below Rs 1035.

Equitas Holdings: Buy| LTP: Rs 131.40| Target: Rs 138| Stop Loss: Rs 128| Return 5%

The stock opened gap-up on Tuesday and maintained its momentum throughout the day. The stock is trading well above its 200-EMA on the hourly chart and closed above it. We recommend buying at the current level for an initial target of 138 and a stop loss below Rs 128.

As per momentum oscillators, the market has entered deeply oversold levels, at these levels fresh shorts are not suggested as the risk-reward would not be favourable right now.

The levels of 10,150-10,200 might act as a cushion on further declines. If the market faces any support at these levels we may witness a relief rally up to 10,500-10,600 levels.

The same is expected in BankNifty, instead of taking a fresh short position one should try to exit from shorts if BankNifty stabilizes 23,900-24,000 might act as a cushion for further decline.

On weekly charts, RSI is nearing long-term bullish support levels of 40. Historically, these levels have been good support in the bull market and even in the bear market these level generally leads to mean reversion rally.

We expect Nifty to mean revert towards critical moving averages which are placed around 10,700-10,800 levels (200-DEMA placed around 10,779).

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 14-17% return in the next 1-2 months:

Axis Bank: LTP: Rs 568| Target: Rs 650| Stop Loss: Rs 530| Return 14%

The recently Axis Bank has broken out of the long-term triangle on the weekly charts, which is now retesting its earlier resistance levels.

These levels are now likely to act as strong support. One can buy Axis Bank from these levels as the structure is bullish and the risk reward is favourable. Investors can initiate buy with a target at Rs 650 while a stop loss can be placed at Rs 530.

UPL: Buy| LTP: Rs 598.20| Target: Rs 700| Stop Loss: Rs 560| Return 17%

UPL has recently formed a Morning Star candlestick pattern on the weekly charts, which is now nearing its monthly support levels. Supports are placed around Rs 550 - 565 levels.

One can take a long position in UPL while keeping a stop loss below Rs 560 levels, and a short-term target can be maintained at Rs 700 levels

Cipla: LTP: Rs 634.55| Target: Rs 730| Stop Loss: Rs 610| Return 15%

Cipla is currently holding its monthly breakout levels and the momentum oscillators are showing bullish signs. In this volatile market, one should focus on pharma stocks.

The recent dip should be taken as buying opportunity in Cipla, for the short-term target can be maintained at Rs 730 levels while placing a stop loss below Rs.610.

The year has been quite tough for the private sector banking industry which is seeing exit of three high-profile bankers, Chanda Kochhar, Shikha Sharma and Rana Kapoor, before the end of their scheduled term.

While Kochhar Thursday resigned from the post of MD and CEO of ICICI Bank with immediate effect, Sharma is leaving Axis Bank in December.

Another high profile banker and founding CEO of Yes Bank Rana Kapoor has been asked by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to quit the post by January 2019.

Kochhar, who is facing allegations of nepotism and conflict of interest, quit the bank six months before her current tenure was to end.

She also resigned from all subsidiaries of the bank including ICICI Securities where she had sought reappointment as the chairperson.

There are allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon group on a quid pro quo basis.

Another ICICI Bank prodigy, Shikha Sharma had decided to quit the bank by the end of this year. Although she got the approval of the board for a three-year term with effect from June 1, 2018, the proposal did not find favour with the RBI. Her stint was mired in divergence of bad loans.

The private sector lender's NPAs jumped by over five-fold in recent financial years. The gross NPAs worth Rs 4,110 crore at the end of March 2015 surged to Rs 21,280 crore at the end of March 2017. During the same period, the lender's net profit halved from Rs 7,357.8 crore to Rs 3,679.2 crore.

The RBI also cut short the tenure of Kapoor and asked the private sector lender to look for his replacement by January 2019.

Kapoor, who has been managing director and CEO since the bank's inception in 2004, had sought a three-year extension till August 31, 2021. However, the sector regulator did not agree to the request and permitted him to continue only till January 2019.

The banking sector has seen increased regulatory scrutiny over the last two years as the RBI has tried to push for appropriate recognition of bad loans.

The asset quality review initiated in December 2015 has led to banks recognising an additional Rs 6 lakh crore as bad loans.

Banks were asked to disclose 'divergences' in bad loan reporting. As a result, the RBI judged gross NPAs at Rs 8,373.8 crore for Yes Bank for 2016-17 against the declared gross NPAs at Rs 2,018 crore. Thus, there was a divergence of Rs 6,355 crore or three times the reported amount.",436,-0.5303856253623962

Nifty fell nearly 2 percent, or over 200 points, for the week ended September 28. The index witnessed its fifth consecutive weekly fall.

The index breached its crucial support placed at 11,000 on the weekly basis for the first time since July. The price action on the charts suggest that market is in a downtrend but after falling consecutively for the last 4-5 weeks, a pullback rally could be on the cards.

Bulls should only be able to regain control if the index reclaims 11,170 levels comfortably else we may consolidate around current levels. A close below 10,800 could further extend the selling pressure and take the index towards 10,700-10,600 levels, suggest experts.

""At this juncture after taking a hit of around 8 percent from the highs of 11,760 with 4-weeks of continuous fall, we should expect some pullback rather than looking to go short at current levels,"" Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.

""Bulls should be able to regain control if Nifty50 manages to close above 11,170 levels. If the index closes above 11,17o, the next resistance level stands at 11,350 levels. On signs of weakness around these levels, one can initiate fresh shorts with a target placed between 10,700 and 10,600 kind of levels,"" he said.

Here is a list of top 10 money making ideas by experts which could give 5-16% return in the next 1 month:

Analyst: Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking

Lupin: Buy| LTP: Rs 900.9| Initiation range: 890-900| Target: Rs 980| Stop loss: 860| Return: 9%

Lupin witnessed a decent profit taking and found support around the multiple moving averages (200/100/50-EMA) on the daily chart. It is rebounding from thereon and is likely to maintain this bias ahead as well. Traders should use this dip to initiate fresh longs through Call option as per the mentioned levels.

Canara Bank: Sell Futures| Last Close: Rs 221.2| Initiation range: Rs 225-230| Target: Rs 200| Stop Loss: Rs 240| Return: 9.5%

After it failed to cross its resistance hurdle of multiple moving averages around Rs 294, Canara Bank has witnessed a steep fall of late and is likely to maintain this bias ahead too.

Further, we have similar indications from majority PSU banking counters. We advise using any uptick to create fresh shorts within the given range.

Titan Company: Sell Futures| Last Close: Rs 806.8| Initiation range: Rs 815-825| Target: Rs 760| Stop Loss: Rs 840| Return 5%

Titan Company has been consolidating for the past ten months now and has formed a distribution pattern “Head and Shoulder” on the weekly chart. It is trading on the verge of a breakdown from the same and is likely to witness a sharp fall.

The positioning of confirmation indicators is also in sync. Traders should use any bounce to go short in the mentioned zone.

Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,294 | Target: Rs 1,370 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,267 | Return 6%

Last three weeks of price action is looking quite interesting with long lower shadows on the weekly charts which suggest that dips are getting bought into this counter.

Even in the last two sessions, the bulls of this counter remained indifferent to the wild swings witnessed in the broader markets.

Hence, on a sustainable pullback rally, this counter should trade somewhere around Rs 1,377 levels. The near-term strength will get cemented on a close above Rs 1,336 levels. Positional traders should buy into this with a stop of Rs 1,267 for a target of Rs 1,370.

Axis Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 612 | Target: Rs 649 | Stop Loss: Rs 587 | Return 6%

The price behaviour of the last four sessions in this counter is looking quite interesting as it appears to be building a decent base between Rs 620 – 590 levels from the cushion of which it can rally.

In such a scenario a decent upmove towards Rs 655 can’t be ruled out. Hence, traders are advised to buy into this counter for a target of Rs 649 with a stop of Rs 587.

L&T Finance Holdings: Buy| LTP: Rs 129 | Target: Rs 147 | Stop Loss: Rs 117| Return 14%

This counter appears to have hit a short-term bottom after retracing around 50 percent of its entire up move from the lows of Rs 48 – 213 levels as it is consolidating in a narrow zone of Rs 120 – 135 levels.

On sustaining above Rs 120 levels, it can easily pullback to test its 21st September high of Rs 151 levels. Hence, positional traders can make use of this opportunity to go long for a target of Rs 147 levels with a stop of Rs 117.

Brokerage Firm: Narnolia Financial Advisors Ltd

ITC: Buy| Buy Range: Rs 287-290|Target: Rs 335 | Stop Loss: Rs 267 | Return 16%

Selling in ITC seems to be absorbed by buyers after witnessing almost 50 percent correction from the peak of Rs 323 marks. The stock seems to be bottomed out near 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire upward swing from Rs 259 to Rs 323 levels which is supportive for the Bulls.

The emergences of Morning Star pattern near the same suggest reversal in the coming sessions. Currently, it is retesting its previous neckline of the Cup and Handle pattern on the weekly chart which is around Rs 288 levels.

Strong support is seen near Rs 280-285 zones where 61.8% Fibonacci retracement is located of the same upward swing. Traders can buy around Rsc290 with a stop loss below Rs 267 and a target of Rs 335.

NTPC: Buy| Buy Range: Rs 160-162|Target: Rs 186| Stop Loss: Rs 149| Return 15%

The stock seems to have bottomed out at the levels Rs 149 mark and from that level, it has given a breakout and surged higher. Currently, inverse Head & Shoulder is emerging on the daily chart in which the right shoulder is still pending.

But, from current levels, the risk-to-reward ratio is looking favorable. Indicators and oscillator are also conducive for the price action. One can take a long position around Rs 162-160 with a stop loss of Rs 149 and a target of Rs 186.

ICICI Bank: Buy| Buy Range: Rs 305| Target: Rs 345| Stop Loss: Rs 285| Return 13%

After the recent fall, the scrip seems to have bottomed out near its channel support line. It found a base near 50% Fibonacci retracement of the upside move from Rs 266 to Rs 346.80 which is giving hope to bulls for making long position in the scrip.

The 200-DMA is seen around Rs 305 levels which is key support. The weekly chart is showing parity with its historical levels. Oversold stochastic is also lending support to its price action. Traders can go long in the stock around Rs 305 levels with a stop loss of Rs 285 and a target of Rs 345 marks.

Mahanagar Gas: Buy| Buy around: Rs 800 |Target: Rs 900| Stop Loss: Rs 755| Return 12.5%

The scrip has given a sharp fall after hitting a peak of Rs 986.80 and it seems to be halting its downswing as it has found a strong base near the levels of Rs 790-800 levels where congestion zone is seen.

Positive divergence is seen in RSI and occurrence of double bottom price pattern indicates upside move. We saw a positive crossover in MACD & the declining histogram imply positive move on the northward side. Traders can buy around Rs 800 with a stop loss of Rs 755 and a target of Rs 900 levels.

The Nifty50 continued its losing streak for the fifth day in the row where it fell sharply by 175 points on Monday as brokers square off positions or sell collaterals to account for mark-to-market losses.

A weak rupee and higher crude prices also hurt the sentiment. During the last five trading sessions, the Nifty has already corrected 550 odd points. Technical evidence points towards a short-term bottom.

On September 21, 2018, the Nifty fell more than 3.3 percent in intraday and recovered 75 percent of the loss at closing. Normally, this kind of a bounce-back is seen as a short-term turning point.

We studied data all the way back to August 2002, whether this hypothesis holds true. We looked for 3 percent fall and minimum recovery of 60 percent from low of the same day. We have found 4 such instances, and in all the four instances, it turned out to be a bottom.

Moreover, last week’s intraday low of 10,866 is the 50% retracement of the entire upswing seen from 9,952 to 11,760. Nifty’s 200-day simple moving average is also placed around 10,750 levels.

So with historical evidence on our side, we can say that we are near the bottom and we may see a pullback rally from here on.

Considering the technical evidence discussed above, we believe that, short-term pullback rally is on the cards and bottom of 10,750 levels should not be violated soon. On the higher side Nifty is likely to find resistance around 11200 level where Calls have been written

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 8-10% return:

Axis Bank: LTP: Rs 597| Buy| Target: Rs. 645 | Stop-Loss Rs 570 | Return 8%

After making an all-time high during the month of August, the Stock price has nearly corrected 8% during this month. However, the primary trend of the stock is positive where the stock is trading above its 200-day Simple moving average.

Axis Bank is also outperforming other private sector banks. The stock price has reached near to a strong support of Rs 585 levels.

We believe that recent correction in the stock price is a running correction in the overall uptrend. Therefore, we recommend accumulating Axis Bank in the range of Rs 585-597 for the upside target of Rs 640, keeping a stop loss below at Rs 570.

Deepak Nitrite: Buy| LTP: Rs 270| Target: Rs. 295 | Stop-Loss Rs 255 | Return 9%

During the last week, Deepak Nitrite has broken out on the daily chart by closing above the crucial resistance level of Rs 284 levels. Primary trend of the stock is positive where it is trading near its all-time high level.

The stock price is also trading above its 20 and 200-day simple moving averages indicating a bullish trend for the medium to long-term trend.

The stock price has been making higher top higher bottom formation on the daily chart. We believe that recent correction in the stock price is a running correction in the overall uptrend.

Therefore, we recommend accumulating Deepak Nitrite in the range of Rs 260-270 for the upside target of 295, keeping a stop loss below Rs 255.

Karnataka Bank: Sell| LTP: Rs 101| Target: Rs. 90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 106 | Return 10%

Karnataka Bank has broken down on the weekly chart by closing below Rs 104 levels. The stock price has also closed at a two-year low with volumes rising during the last couple of days.

The stock price is trading below its 5, 20 and 200-day SMA indicating a bearish trend for the short to medium term. Therefore, we recommend selling Karnataka Bank for the downside target of 90, keeping a stop loss above Rs 106.

The correction in stocks that started with rising oil prices and a falling rupee was accelerated by rising bond yield and now credit default issue is creating selling climax in the market.

India VIX is trading at the highest level of the week around 15.36 and gained almost 10 percent on September 21, which along with fall of prices, implies higher volatility in the market with a bearish bias. Although Nifty bounced back to its 5-DMA (11,309) on the day, it closed below it, around 11,143 marks, which suggests weakness in the benchmark index in the short term.

Strong indicator 100 DMA is around 11,025 mark, decisive closing below it will take the index towards 200-DMA, which is trading around 10,740 levels. However, a fall should halt around the 10,700 levels, where the previous swing high/low and the strong support trend lines confluence zone exists.

Looking at the Open Interest (OI) front, the highest in Put is seen around 11,000 strikes, followed by 11,100 strikes whereas maximum OI in Call is around 11,500 levels, followed by 11,400. Moreover, options data indicates an immediate trading range between 11,000 and 11,400 marks.

For Nifty, we expect strong support to emerge from 100 DMA at 11,025 and 200 DMA at 10,740. Although, the current panic may continue for few more days due to margin calls triggered post heavy sell-off on September 21. On the other side, a lower time frame downward sloping trend line breakout will be above 11,320 levels, which indicates the Nifty’s close above 11,320 levels will lead the rally towards 11,550/11,600.

Tata Global | Buy above Rs 240 | Target: Rs 275 | Stop Loss: Rs 220 | Upside 15%

Private sector lender Axis Bank and Raipur Smart City Thursday launched a payment platform, targeting to have 10,000 people by March-end pay digitally for low-ticket transactions in the capital of Chhattisgarh.

The platform entails having a smart card, a mobile app and a web portal, which can be used for payments and is primarily targeted at the overall seven lakh users of the civic body bus transport.

Using a single card or the app, citizens will be able to pay for their bus travel, shopping at merchants, property bills and also e-commerce.

""We will be concentrating on putting up point of sale terminals across the 20,000 merchant establishments in the city and are targeting to have 10,000 users by end of March,"" Raipur Municipal Corporation commissioner Rajat Bansal said.

He said the Raipur Smart City has been able to save Rs 13 crore budgeted for launch of the platform through the tie-up with Axis Bank.

The lender has done all the necessary capital expenditure upfront including developing the system, the app and web portal, and also installing acceptance infrastructure in lieu of getting the civic body's accounts, he said.

The bank's executive vice-president for transaction banking, Debarchan Mishra, declined to comment on the investments done by the bank in the five-year project.

Mishra said Raipur has a population of nearly 17 lakh and the bank has tied up with various merchants to offer discounts, in order to incentivise usage by the citizens.

While bulls were in full control until last month, September is turning out to be a lackluster month. The Nifty50, which touched a record high last month, saw sharp selling pressure in this month taking the index below 11,300.

Escalating trade war fears, sharp drop in the Indian rupee, growing concerns of rising current account deficit due to jump in crude oil prices, selling by foreign institutional investors and risk of rate hike by central bankers are some of the factors that weighed on Indian markets.

Global investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have come out with their reports on Indian market, suggest that premium valuation could be a concern and the upside from current levels remains fairly limited.

Global investment firm Morgan Stanley has raised its 30-share BSE Sensex target to 42,000 for September 2019 implying a potential upside of 11 percent, on the other hand, Goldman Sachs maintains a target of 12,000 on Nifty which translates into an upside of little over 5 percent.

Goldman Sachs, which was strategically overweight on India since March 2014, has turned slightly cautious towards Indian market in 2018 and lowered its investment view to marketweight from overweight earlier.

Sectorally, the global investment bank has upgraded defensive stocks and exporters. It is overweight on banks, tech and metals. The key downside risks remain a less stable government.

Morgan Stanley, on the other hand, said Indian equities continued to be in an uptrend and investors should bet on favourite underperformers.

""Investors should choose price underperformers with improving earnings outlook and finally broaden their portfolios by adding small and midcaps,"" it said.

On its Focus List, Morgan Stanley added SBI, Prestige Estates and Apollo Hospitals, and removed Infosys, Havells India and Zee Entertainment, given the recent downgrades.

We have collated a list of top 10 fundamentally strong stocks from various experts which investors can look at buying with a minimum holding period of 1-2 years:

Analyst: DK Aggarwal, Chairman and MD, SMC Investments and Advisors Ltd

Dr Reddy’s Laboratories:

The company has reported robust first quarter FY19 results, aided by the launch of gSuboxone. According to the management of the company, it has focus on operational efficiencies which helped in significantly improving its margin profile.

In FY19, its priorities are driving productivity improvement, focusing on core therapeutic areas and big brands, and scaling up New Chemical Entity (NCE) launches done through the Amgen deal.

In the medium to long term, management of the company wants to focus on ramping up biosimilars through internal and partnered assets and building differentiated products in relevant therapies accompanied by further ramping up of the base business.

The management expects 15-20 launches in FY19 and also expects emerging markets to grow 16% YoY led by a robust spurt in Russia and ROW.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises:

The company has led the industry in its evolution and transformation. Along the way, it has entered newer geographies, both domestically and globally, launched multiple channels, strengthened distribution, expanded the genres and widened its audience profile.

Moreover, management focus towards expansion and market share would give strong growth to the company in coming years. During the quarter, its consolidated advertising revenue grew by 18.6% to Rs 1,146 crore.

Domestic advertising revenue growth at 22.3% continued to be strong driven by demand across categories and partly aided by lower growth in the base quarter.

Bajaj Auto:

The company has a diversified business model and has a strong focus on the profitable growth, widening reach in export markets and strategic alliances with global majors.

The domestic 2-wheeler market would start growing from the festive season & would continue to grow for next couple of years. The management has assured that the company would see a very healthy top line growth and a very healthy EBITDA increase in coming quarters.

FY18-19 capex plan stands around Rs 250-300 crore. It would look to expand and strengthen the 150cc Pulsar segment in addition to pursuing new three-wheeler markets within India.

Its total current capacity is approximately about 6.6 million. 3-wheelers will be approximately about 7.2 lakh. The company expects 1.9 million export numbers for FY 19.

UPL:

The company has strong fundamentals and a robust outlook. Its strong focus on brand building and customer reach is helping the company in increasing its market share in major addressable markets.

Moreover, with the acquisition with Arysta LifeScience, the company will be one of the world's largest global crop protection companies, with an innovative and differentiated product portfolio.

The management has been focussing on technological enhancement and new product developments which would aid the further financial growth of the company. Moreover, the company believes new launches would bear fruit in the coming term.

Indian Hotels Company:

The Company plans to continue to grow through a judicious mixture of owned and leased hotels, a de-risked model along with its ability to attract management contracts.

Its command and long & successful track record in operating hotels for third party owners would facilitate growth for the future.

Moreover, it has the ability to deliver improved returns on capital would be driven through product renovation, rigorous asset management, revenue maximization, cost control and reduced leverage and exit from non-core underperforming assets.

It has assigned a capex of Rs 3,000 crore for the next five years and hotel industry occupancy levels and average room rate (ARR) are showing upward trends due to a demand-supply gap.

Analyst: Deepak Jasani, Head – Retail Research at HDFC Securities

Mahanagar Gas:

Monopolistic nature of the business and ramp-up/expansion in new geographies would drive volume growth in the coming years. Better economics of CNG/PNG versus liquid fuels in an era of a buoyant crude price regime and maintained spreads are tailwinds for the company.

Axis Bank:

Axis Bank has made significant investments to ride the next growth cycle (post-near-term asset quality challenges), with strong capitalisation and an expanding liability franchise.

The worst seems to have been priced in, and the bank is available at attractive valuations as compared to other similarly-placed peers. The new CEO could bring in a fresh perspective to the bank’s growth plans.

Rico Auto:

Post its split with FCC in 2015 Rico Auto has changed its strategy and now caters to PV and CV markets in addition to 2W. Strong order book of Rs 4800cr, capacity expansion and increasing volumes in alloy wheels, changing product mix are expected to improve the OPM.

Rico is in the process of launching 3 more products and improving profitability may help it get re-rated to a PE comparable with other auto-ancillary companies.

Engineers India:

EIL is likely to benefit from the expected capex in the hydrocarbon and petrochemicals industry as it is a market leader for consultancy. It’s a debt-free company with an order backlog of Rs 7229cr (~3.5x book-to-bill). With a healthy cash balance of Rs 2500cr, it may reward shareholders through another buyback or special dividend.

Sun Pharma:

Sun Pharma is amongst the few companies in India to have made large upfront investments in US specialty. OPM are expected to improve on the back of key drugs launch and moderating price erosion in the US.

The company has 422 approved products in USA and 139 pending for approval. Ramp up of generics and specialty business driven by increased investments augurs well for the company as it improves the launch visibility.

The apex consumer forum has asked Axis Bank, one of the largest private sector banks in the country, to pay over Rs 50 lakh to a customer for failing to return certain documents submitted by him while availing a loan, even after he repaid the amount.

The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) asked a branch of Axis Bank Ltd to pay an amount of Rs 50 lakh for financial damages, Rs 50,000 for causing mental agony and harassment, and Rs 15,000 towards litigation expenses to Rajesh Gupta.

""The facts of the case clearly establish that the Opposite Party (Axis Bank Ltd) has failed to discharge their obligation towards their customer and have failed to return all the documents, which were entrusted,"" presiding member Justice Deepa Sharma said.

The Commission also asked the bank to issue Indemnity Bond (undertaking given by a party entering into a contract promising to bear the losses in case of breach of contract) in favour of Gupta regarding all these documents.

It further said the amount shall be paid within four weeks, failing which the amount shall carry an interest rate of 12 per cent per annum.

Gupta had taken a loan of over Rs 67 lakh from the Faridabad branch of Axis Bank in 2012. He had cleared the loan amount in 2013 and closed his loan account.

However, the bank failed to return the documents Builder Buyer's Agreement, full and final payment receipt by the seller, and the original allotment letter of his property to him.

The bank contented that some of the documents available with them had been returned and the rest of the ""documents had lost"" and that they were unable to return those papers.

It also claimed that the documents, which they failed to return, were only receipts and had no importance.

The Commission ruled that ""there is deficiency in service"" as in the absence of the documents, it would certainly ""not be easy for the complainant (Gupta)"" to put his property in market in case he wanted to sell it.

""The Opposite Party cannot at this stage take the plea that the documents which they had failed to return were of no value.

""Had that been so, meaning thereby that if those documents which they have lost were of no consequence and value, there was no occasion for the Opposite Party to ask the complainant to deposit these documents for sanction of the loan and for its continuance,"" the Commission added.",422,-0.9956453045209249

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Axis Bank

RBI approves appointment of Mr. Amitabh Chaudh ry as MD & CEO of Axis Bank for a perio d of 3 years with effect from 1 -Jan -19 up to 31- Dec -21. Mr. Chaudh ry’s term will thus begin after Ms. Shikha Sharma, the current CEO demits office on 31 -Dec -18. It’s going to be a second consecutive time that Axis Bank’s MD & CEO will come from a life insurance company.

Outlook

AXSB’s stock has delivered 23% return in past two months in anticipation of this management change and also aided by the early signs of recovery in NPL cycle. With management overhang done away with and improving outlook on fresh slippages/credit cost, we expect earnings to start normalizing 2HFY19 onward. AXSB has already increased the PCR to 69% (NCLT-1 provisions of 83%), which will further curb incremental provisioning requirement. We revise our PT to INR750 (SOTP basis) as we roll forward our valuations even as we keep our target multiple unchanged at 2.5x Sep-20E ABV for standalone bank. Maintain Buy.

Investors have welcomed Amitabh Chaudhry's appointment as Axis Bank's next Chief Executive by pushing the lender's stock up by 5 percent on Monday morning.

On Saturday evening, Axis Bank said the Reserve Bank of India has approved Chaudhry's appointment as new CEO and Managing Director for three years from January 1 next year.​

While the welcome will please Chaudhry, who is the current CEO and Managing Director of HDFC Life, he would know that the same investors could turn against him unless he restores their confidence in the bank, especially with respect to its corporate portfolio.

Since MD and CEO Shikha Sharma's exit was first announced on April 9, Axis Bank's stock has moved up 25 percent on hope of a change in the bank under a new chief. Sharma will step down by December-end.

First taskAnalysts said the first task on hand for Chaudhry is to change systems and processes while working with existing senior executives.

The lender will see a small rejig in its top brass with the recent exit of its corporate banking head Siddharth Rath and the term of Deputy Managing Director V Srinivasan set to end later this year.

""To address the critical issues of mismanagement at Axis Bank, it was critical that the new CEO have two attributes. One was to be an outsider, as the senior executive management under Shikha Sharma had lost credibility,"" said a note by independent analyst Hemindra Hazari.

""The second was that the new CEO should be a seasoned commercial banker with considerable exposure to manage corporate and retail credit risk and operational risk management,"" it said.

An Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad alumnus, Chaudhry's profile constitutes very little corporate banking experience. He had a brief stint with corporate and wholesale banking at the start of his career with Bank of America in 1987, where he eventually moved to investment banking. Later, he worked with Calyon Bank (formerly Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia or CLSA) heading the investment banking and technology divisions for southeast Asia.

""Chaudhry also has a vast experience on the technology front which will come in handy as bank further builds upon its digital capabilities and thus boost growth/productivity levels,"" said Motilal Oswal in a research note.

Axis Bank so far

Axis Bank has been under the scanner of the regulator and investors for over a year now.

Earlier this year, the central bank pulled up the board for proposing another three-year term as CEO for Sharma, whose tenure was then cut short to seven months.

The bank's shares fell almost 8.3 percent from January till April 9, when Sharma was asked to step down and her tenure was cut short to seven months.

Last year, the bank came under the banking regulator's radar for reporting divergences for two consecutive years. In FY16, RBI assessed classification of bad loans to be Rs 9,480 crore higher than what the bank reported and the same in FY17 stood at Rs 5,633 crore.

In June, global agency Fitch Ratings revised the outlook on Axis Bank to negative from stable.

Axis Bank’s capital buffers are less comfortable for its current rating despite raising fresh capital, it said. However, Fitch does not expect the bank's earnings and non-performing asset (NPA) ratio to markedly deteriorate from current levels.

Bad loan trouble

Axis Bank’s asset quality has deteriorated substantially in the past three years with its non-performing assets (NPAs) surging over 300 percent.

The situation worsened especially after RBI asset quality review (AQR) in late 2015 which led to a rise in bad loans for most lenders. Axis Bank was among the worst hit given the heavy project financing in its corporate book.

In the April-June quarter, Axis Bank reported a 46 percent decline in net profit to Rs 701 crore after incurring its first quarterly loss (Rs 2,189 crore) in the January-March quarter.

Axis Bank under Shikha Sharma

Coming from ICICI Bank, Sharma took over Axis Bank in June 2009.

Gross NPA ratio as a percentage of total loans, which was 0.94-1.68 percent between June 2009 and March 2016, breached 2 percent for the first time since Sharma took over. It rose further to touch 6.77 percent by March-end.

However, it improved marginally to 6.52 percent in June. In absolute terms, gross bad loans ballooned from Rs 915 crore to Rs 32,662 crore in June after peaking to almost Rs 34,250 crore in March.

Course correction

For now, the bank has made corrections and improved its risks and growth strategies.

Its retail advances are going strong, making up 48 percent of the bank’s total advances.

Its exposure to the top 20 borrowers as a percentage of Tier I capital has come down to 118 percent at present compared to 287 percent in March 2011.

Moreover, 94 percent of the bank’s incremental sanctions are now going to corporates rated ‘A’ or above compared to 68 percent in FY12.

As an outsider, challenge for Chaudhry remains to settle in a new space, clean up the corporate stains and get the bank's growth back on track.",851,-0.2130977749824524

The stock-broking arm of India's Axis Bank on Monday began offering commodity derivatives trading on the Multi Commodity Exchange platform, making it the first subsidiary of a bank to offer the service.

The Reserve Bank of India had allowed bank subsidiaries to provide commodity broking services in September last year, as the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the capital market regulator, tries to deepen the market.

Existing Axis Securities clients can now trade commodity futures and options after filing a declaration, Axis Securities managing director Arun Thukral told a news conference.

The broking firm will also allow its members to trade on the National Commodity Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) platform by end-September, Thukral said.

MCX is the dominant bourse for metals and energy products, while NCDEX corners the bulk of the volume in agriculture commodity derivatives.

Trading volumes in commodity derivatives could rise by 20 percent in the next three years as many bank subsidiaries line up to offer trading in commodity derivatives, said Mrugank Paranjape, chief executive officer of MCX.

Axis Bank is likely to add between 350 to 400 branches to its network this year from the current about 3,800 branches, a top bank official said today.

""National, totally we have about 3,800 branches currently. Last year, we added about 400 branches. Our anticipation is that we will add between 350 to 400 branches this year as well (FY19). We added 76 branches in the first quarter,"" Rajiv Anand, Executive Director- Retail Banking, Axis Bank, told reporters here.

In Telangana, the country's third largest private sector bank, currently has 123 branches and 731 ATMs.

While digitisation has taken off in metro and urban areas, it is ""by definition"" slower in the semi-urban and rural areas, requiring Axis Bank to have branches in those areas, he said.

He was asked whether number of ATMs and bank branches would come down with the ongoing digital drive.

Even as the bank has shown robust growth across business levers, its mobile banking segment has shown particularly impressive numbers, a release by Axis Bank said.

""Overall mobile banking spends at the bank touched Rs 71,444 crore in Q1FY19 increasing 90 percent YoY (Year on Year),"" it said.

In its commitment to the 'Digital India' agenda, it said more than 70 percent of all transactions in the first quarter of this financial year were made through digital mode, it said.

The bank continues to focus significantly on cards, both credit and debit, which remain an important business function. Axis Bank is a market leader in installing 'card-acceptance terminals', it said.

""Axis Bank has driven forward the government's digital initiative by focusing on and strengthening our mobile banking and internet banking services,"" Rajiv Anand said.

Non-interest income excl. trading income has seen healthy growth of 28% yoy/10% qoq at INR 28.2 bn. PPOP at INR 43.7 bn is up 2% yoy/19% qoq. Provisions, though lower than last quarter, were elevated at INR 33.4 bn, +42.5% yoy/-53.5% qoq translating into credit cost (calc.) of 2.2%, +46 bps yoy/-260 bps qoq. The provisions were high on account of shoring up of PCR ratio (incl. technical write-offs) from 65% in Q4FY18 to 69% in Q1FY19 and recognition of entire MTM losses in the quarter. GNPAs at 6.52% reduced by 25 bps / NNPA at 3.09% are down 31 bps. Gross slippages in the quarter were lower than last quarter at INR 43.37 bn, but still at an elevated level. The bank expects elevated slippages for another quarter post which they are expect to subside. The bank is of the view that downgrades to BB and below should normalize henceforth.

Outlook

The bank reported PAT of INR 2.8 bn for FY18. For FY19/20, we estimate PAT of INR 43.2 bn/102.7 bn respectively. Even though slippages are expected to start trending downwards from H2FY19 onwards, we are of the view that there are better options to play the corporate recovery. We value the stock at INR 562 based on 2.5x FY20E ABV (last 5 years’ mean). Recommend HOLD.

Although big fat payouts are missing from the industry, CEOs at India's top three private banks had their pockets full, while err... running the banks.

The three CEOs received a total bonus of Rs 1.57 crore, as part of their deferred bonuses for previous years.

In the fiscal ended March 2018, HDFC Bank’s chief Aditya Puri received Rs 92.31 lakh as deferred bonus tranches for earlier financial years, as per the annual report. Likewise, Axis Bank's Shikha Sharma got Rs 44.10 lakh, and ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar was richer by Rs 20.69 lakh.

The three haven't yet received full bonuses for 2016-17, pending clearance from Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

“At present, the bonus pertaining to the year 2016-17 proposed to be paid out in FY 2017-18 is pending RBI approval. Therefore, after RBI approval is obtained, the approved amounts, if any, will be paid and disclosed in the Corporate Governance Report for the next financial year,” HDFC Bank said in its annual report.

Sharma was to receive Rs 1.35 crore, as per Axis Bank’s annual report for 2017.

“The bonus amounts are the deferred portion of bonus approved in earlier years that was paid during fiscal 2018 and the comparable amounts for fiscal 2017 were Rs 4.5 million (Rs 45 lakh) for Chanda Kochhar,” ICICI Bank said in its report for FY18.

Interestingly, ICICI Bank’s annual report said, “The deferred portion of variable pay is subject to malus, under which the Bank would prevent vesting of all or part of the variable pay in the event of an enquiry determining gross negligence, breach of integrity or in the event of a reasonable evidence of deterioration in financial performance.

“In such cases, variable pay already paid out may also be subjected to clawback arrangements, as applicable.”

On similar lines, Axis Bank’s report said, “As a prudent measure, a portion of variable pay if it exceeds a certain threshold is deferred and is paid proportionately over a period of 3 years. The deferred variable pay amount of reference year would be held back in case of any misrepresentation or gross inaccuracy resulting in a wrong risk assessment.”

Emails sent to the respective banks and RBI remained unanswered.

Regulator's approval

At present, the bonus or variable pay given to the senior management of private banks proposed by their boards need to be approved by the banking regulator.

The missing bonuses come at a time when two of the above banks – ICICI and Axis – are battling allegations of governance and performance issues.

ICICI Bank and Axis Bank were penalized by the regulator for non-disclosures of non-performing assets (NPAs) which were listed as divergences from RBI’s assessment.

For FY16, ICICI Bank’s divergence in NPAs stood at Rs 5,105 crore and Axis Bank’s was at Rs 9,478 crore.

In FY17, Axis Bank’s divergence was worth Rs 5,633 crore, while ICICI Bank did not require any disclosure. The much immune HDFC Bank also reported a divergence of Rs 2,051 crore for FY17.

At present, Kochhar is on leave pending an enquiry on allegations of ""conflict of interest"" against her, while Sharma's term is set to end in December 2018 after she was forced to step down in April.

Moreover, both ICICI Bank and Axis Bank reported a decline in profit for FY18. ICICI Bank posted a 44 percent drop in net profit to Rs 6,777 crore while, Axis Bank’s net profit nosedived 93 percent to Rs 276 crore.

For the fourth quarter from January to March, ICICI Bank’s net profit halved to Rs 1,020 crore while Axis Bank suffered a loss of Rs 2,189 crore (dropping 278 percent).

Year's remuneration

For FY18, the total remuneration of all three banking honchos stood at Rs 21.66 crore.

The highest being that of HDFC Bank's Puri who received a total of Rs 9.65 crore. This was followed by Kochhar who received Rs 6.58 crore while Axis Bank's head was paid Rs 5.43 crore.

The remuneration for all three includes basic salary, compensation towards gratuity, provident fund and superannuation (except Kochhar) and other allowances and perquisites. However, it excludes employee stock options.

In terms of basic salary, Puri and Kochhar got a 15 percent hike while Sharma received a 7.6 percent raise.

For ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, the trouble is far from over.

In Q1 of FY19, Axis Bank’s net profit fell 46 percent to 701 crore, while ICICI bank reported its first quarterly loss ever at Rs 120 crore.

JM Financial's research report on AXIS Bank

AXSB reported 23% YoY growth in core operating profits as NPA recoveries aided margins (NII +12% YoY) and core fee income (+30% YoY). Bank continued on stress recognition path with gross slippages of 4.3% (annualised) and 88% of corporate slippages coming from the erstwhile identified ‘BB & Below’ pool. PCR recovered to ~54.4% (+282bps QoQ) and including written off accounts, it now stands at 69% (+400bps QoQ). On operating front, while faster growth in term deposits (+19% YoY) impacted the funding costs, the asset repricing will follow in coming quarters as c.72% of MCLR linked book is <6month tenor. We expect AXSB to improve operating performance and build 20% loan CAGR over FY17- 20E with NIMs (calculated) recovering to 3.4% by FY20E. With lower slippages and improving CI ratio, we expect the bank to clock RoA of 1.3% and RoE of 15% by FY20E.

Outlook

However, we believe there are other large corporate banks which offer cheaper alternatives to play the corporate recovery theme. Maintain HOLD rating with unchanged TP of INR 590/sh.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB reported PAT of INR7.01b (est. of INR7.92b), led by steady revenue growth and controlled opex (+12% YoY). Asset quality improved as fresh slippages subsided; however, rating downgrades resulted in an increase in the vulnerable asset pool to INR122.4b. NII grew 12%/9% YoY/QoQ to INR51.7b; in line if adjusted for a recovery on NCLT account. NIM expanded 13bp QoQ to 3.46% (again aided by NCLT recovery), and management guided for stable trends over FY19. Core fee growth stood at modest 5% YoY, affected by a muted trend in corporate fee (-24% YoY), while retail fee growth stood healthy at 18% YoY. AXSB absorbed the entire MTM losses of INR1.35b during the quarter.

Outlook

We revise our earnings marginally, and value AXSB at INR670 per share (2.5x FY20E ABV for standalone bank). Maintain Buy.

Centrum Research's research report on Axis Bank

We retain HOLD on Axis Bank with TP revised upwards to Rs540 (vs. Rs520 earlier). Q1’19 results were ahead of our estimates on revenue front; however with weak core operating profit growth and higher provisions, earnings declined 46% YoY. The trend in new NPA addition is stabilizing; accelerated pace of recovery will see overall NPAs reduce. Share of vulnerable pool has reduced to 2.5% of customer assets (vs 4.9% YoY). Growth has gathered pace; and is backed with strong capital position. Valuation at 2.1x FY20E ABV for an exit RoE of 14% offers limited near term upside. Prefer ICICI Bank in the private banking space.

Outlook

We have left our earnings FY19E/FY20E estimates unchanged. GNPA / NNPA estimates have been revised lower given improving trend on the recovery / up-gradation front. Retain HOLD with TP at Rs540 (valued at 2x FY20E ABV).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Axis Bank

Axis bank's earnings of Rs7.0bn (PLe: Rs9.9bn) was lower than expectations mainly on higher provisions which improved the PCR. NII growth of 12% YoY looked better as bank had positive bearing of interest recognition on large recovery (11bps positive impact), but adjusting to same operational performance remained largely in-line. Bank reported lower slippages of Rs43.4bn (PLe: Rs44.6bn) compared to last few quarters mainly from corporate and stressed pool.

Outlook

Which remains a concern in near term, although holds a good PCR of 70% (55% without technical write off) which compels us to downgrade to Accumulate post the recent run-up and valuations richer than corporate peers at 2.2x Mar-20. We revise our TP to Rs624 at 2.4X FY20P/ABV (up from Rs585).

Edelweiss' research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank’s (Axis) Q1FY19 earnings came broadly in line with stable asset quality. Slippages were restricted to INR43.4bn (3.9% versus past six quarters’ >6.0% run rate) with >45% from BB and below rated corporate. However, vulnerable pool rose to 2.8% (2.1% in FY18) given higher downgrades to BB and below, a trend that management highlighted will normalise going forward. Revenue momentum was supported by one-off rise in NIMs (17bps QoQ), excluding which it was in line with estimate. Stress crystalisation seems to be stablising, but we believe recovery will take a while. We expect returns profile to be modest as: a) 2.8% of book is in still unrecognised stress; b) slower resolutions; and c) lower core NIMs. Maintain ‘HOLD’. Change in top management is a key monitorable.

Outlook

We expect valuations to be capped at 2x FY20E P/BV for RoE of sub-15% (post capital). At CMP, the stock trades at 2.1x FY20E P/ABV. We maintain ‘HOLD/SU’ with TP of INR543.

On the equity volume front, 9.43 lakh shares of the company were traded on BSE and over 2 crore shares changed hands at NSE during the day.

Axis bank yesterday reported 46 per cent fall in net profit to Rs 701.09 crore for June quarter due to increase in provisioning for bad loans.

The bank had registered a net profit of Rs 1,306 crore in the June quarter of 2017-18.

The lender's asset quality worsened as gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose to 6.52 per cent as on June 30 of this year, from 5.03 per cent on June 30, 2017.

Likewise, net NPAs or bad loans increased to 3.09 percent of advances furnished by June-end from 2.30 per cent a year ago.

Axis Bank reported a 46 percent year-on-year (YoY) drop in net profit at Rs 701 crore for the first quarter ending June 2018.

The third largest private lender in India had posted 16 percent YoY fall in net profit at Rs 1,305.60 crore in the same quarter last year. It had posted a loss of Rs 2,188.7 crore in the March quarter.

In the post-results conference call, Jairam Sridharan, chief financial officer at Axis Bank, said, ""This is the quarter of turning around with PAT (profit after tax) coming back in black...""

During the quarter, provisions towards bad loans rose 42.5 percent to Rs 3,337.7 crore as against Rs 2,342 crore in June end 2017. Sequentially, it declined by 53.5 percent from Rs 7,179.5 crore.

A Reuters’ poll had projected a profit dip by 57 percent at Rs 558.5 crore, while a Motilal Oswal report had estimated decline by 40 percent to Rs 790 crore.

“Despite a build-up in global uncertainty, growth momentum seems to be picking up in India…While large corporates are in the process of finalizing capex plans, we are optimistic of a continuing 12-13 percent loan growth, primarily driven by retail and services... Our experiences in this quarter increase our conviction that the asset quality cycle has turned,” said Shikha Sharma, Axis Bank’s CEO and Managing Director, after the results announcement.

NPAs

Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of total loans reduced more than expected to 6.52 percent in Q1FY19 from 6.77 percent in Q4FY18 but increased from 5.03 percent in Q1FY18.

Net NPAs also decreased to 3.09 percent from 3.40 percent in the fourth quarter but worsened on a year-on-year basis from 2.30 percent in the first quarter of last year.

Gross and net NPAs were projected to deteriorate to 7.6 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively, by the Motilal Oswal report.

Fresh additions to NPAs declined by 74 percent to Rs 4,337 crore.

Sridharan said, ""The pool from which slippages are coming, particularly in corporate credit of BB and below rated ones, has continued to shrink over the last nine quarters. It has reduced from a peak of 7.5 percent or so to now two percent.""

""When the Gangotri reduces in size, Ganga is going to thin out. So, the slippages are reduced because the origin point is just much smaller now,"" he added.

As on June 30, 2018, Axis Bank’s gross NPAs in absolute terms stood at Rs 32,662 crore and net NPAs stood at Rs 14,902 crore.

Recoveries and upgrades during the quarter were at Rs 2,917 crore while write-offs during the quarter stood ar Rs 3,007 crore.

On the NPA outlook, Sridharan said, ""We continue to think, we are in the last phases of asset quality recognition cycle in corporate, so you'd probably see one more quarter of slightly elevated level and then going back to normalised level.""

Interest income

Net interest income (NII) - the difference between interest earned on loans and paid on deposits – beat estimates to grow by 12 percent to Rs 5,167 crore as compared to Rs 4,616 crore in the year-ago period.

The projected growth was 7.2 percent at Rs 4,947 crore.

Non-interest income or other income fell marginally by 2.5 percent to Rs 2,925 crore from Rs 3,000 crore last year. It was estimated to drop by 11.5 percent to Rs 2,655 crore.

Trading profits as part of other income plunged to Rs 103 crore as compared to Rs 824 crore in Q1FY18.

Loan growth and Margin

Loan growth during the quarter stood at 14 percent over a year ago at Rs 6.53 lakh crore driven by retail (21 percent) and SME or small and medium sector enterprises (19 percent) segments. Retail and SME loans constituted 61 percent of total loans.

Corporate loan growth was at six percent.

Net interest margin for Q1FY19 stood at 3.46 percent down from 3.63 per cent in Q1FY18.

""The two-year NIM compression cycle is over and this quarter's dip is because of a large steel loan recovery from the insolvency process. A range of 3.40 percent, similar to last year, is the overall guidance for the full year...Overall trajectory is upwards,"" Sridharan said.

The results were announced post market hours on Monday.

Anticipating better results, Axis Bank shares ended at Rs 568.45 per share, higher by 2.67 percent as compared to 0.42 percent rise of trade in BSE Sensex.",740,-0.22349284754859078

Axis Bank, country's third largest private lender, is likely to post a 57 percent drop in net profit at Rs 558.5 crore for the April to June quarter in FY19, as per a Reuters' poll estimate.

Increased provisions towards bad loans or non-performing assets (NPAs) are expected to drag the profits.

The results, which will be announced post market hours on Monday, will be keenly followed as the street will be looking for further direction in what is the Bank's final fiscal under CEO and Managing Director Shikha Sharma.

Sharma's term gets over in December 2018.

A Motilal Oswal report has projected the net profit to decline by 40 percent to Rs 790 crore.

The bank had posted 16 percent fall in net profit at Rs 1305.60 crore for the June quarter in the financial year 2017-18.

During the quarter, provisions are projected to rise by 26 percent to Rs 2,952 crore as against Rs 2,342 crore in June end 2017, the Reuters’ poll estimated.

Asset quality

Gross NPAs as a percentage of total loans are projected to deteriorate to 7.6 percent in Q1FY19 from 6.8 percent in Q4FY18 and 5.0 percent in Q1FY18, as per Motilal Oswal’s report.

Net NPAs are also expected to increase to 3.9 percent from 3.4 percent and 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter and first quarter of last year, respectively.

“We expect slippages to remain at elevated levels (about 3.5 percent) annualized slippage ratio), as the bank proceeds to clean up its balance sheet, leading to high credit costs,” the report highlighted.

However, it expects Axis Bank to report 17 percent loan growth, driven by continued strong growth in the retail and small and medium enterprise (SME) segments.

Interest income and Loan growth

Net interest income (NII) - the difference between interest earned on loans and paid on deposits - is projected to grow by a meagre 7.2 percent at Rs 4,947 crore as compared to Rs 4,616 crore in the year-ago period.

However, non-interest income or the other income is estimated to drop by 11.5 percent to Rs 2,655 crore likely due to treasury losses in the first quarter ending June 2018.

In the June quarter last year, the other income stood at Rs 3,000 crore.

Axis Bank is set to announce its new leader next month. The third largest private bank in India is in search of its new chief executive officer and managing director (CEO and MD) to succeed incumbent chief Shikha Sharma.

Sharma’s term is set to end in December 2018. On Tuesday, without giving names, Axis Bank said it has shortlisted three candidates to take over the baton from Sharma.

The names doing the rounds are V. Srinivasan, Deputy Managing Director at Axis Bank, PS Jayakumar, CEO and MD of government-owned Bank of Baroda and Pramit Jhaveri, CEO at Citi India.

Bank of Baroda and Jayakumar have denied the reports saying they are “merely speculative and there is no merit in these news reports”. Citi spokesperson also strongly rubbished the reports as speculations.

Axis Bank’s board of directors met on July 9 to deliberate on the succession planning process. A sub-committee headed by director Prasad Menon and aided by global executive search Egon Zehnder considered more names including Shirish Apte, former CEO and Chairman (Asia Pacific), Citigroup and B Sriram, the former SBI MD who recently took charge at IDBI Bank for three months.

The new CEO and MD of Axis is likely to be announced next month after the approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

But the larger question is whether the bank needs an insider or an outsider to lead it in the present circumstances?

Outsider or Insider?

“An internal candidate is unlikely. Axis bank has also been under the scanner of investors and an insider may not help soothe them. At present, it needs a strong-willed person who can change the systems and processes. Someone who can take head-on, along with existing senior executives…Jayakumar is a good candidate, while Jhaveri may be too expensive for Axis Bank,” according to a source.

Sharma's gross salary for FY17-18 stood at Rs 4.88 crore, while Jhaveri's current salary is not in public domain, it is likely to be substantially higher than Sharma's.

The source added, Jayakumar has also worked in a multinational bank (Citibank) and is doing well with Bank of Baroda at present. “Historically, he also has been in the professional mould and also managed well in the limitations of a public sector undertaking and managed the people challenge.”

But there will be difficulties. “Challenges for a person coming from outside would be the ability to settle in such an environment and getting Axis bank on the growth path. Its retail book is on track but the resolution in the corporate book will be key…Yes, there may be a process change required. But I would assume an insider may also be looked at…I wouldn’t speculate (on the names),” Abizer Diwanji, Partner, and National Leader - Financial Services, EY India.

Diwanji believes Axis Bank has a corporate banking problem similar to many other banks, yet is much better than the likes of IDBI Bank and few other public sector banks.

The NPA burden

Axis Bank’s asset quality has deteriorated substantially in the past three years with its non-performing assets (NPAs) surging over 300 percent.

The situation worsened especially after RBI asset quality review (AQR) in late 2015 which led to a rise in bad loans for most lenders. Axis Bank was among the worst hit given the heavy project financing in its corporate book.

During Sharma’s tenure, Gross NPAs to total loans ratio, which was 0.94 - 1.68 percent between June 2009 and March 2016, breached 2 percent for the first time since Sharma took over. It rose further to reach 6.77 percent by March end 2018.

Since she took charge of the bank in 2009, Axis Bank’s gross bad loans ballooned from Rs 915 crore to Rs 34,248.64 crore at the end of March 2018, while on a net basis, the bad loans stood at Rs 16,591.71 crore, largely from the corporate portfolio.

To add to the trouble, in the quarter ending March 2018, from January to March, Axis Bank reported its first-ever quarterly loss (Rs 2,188. 74 crore) since it listed over two decades ago. The bank also, for the first time in 10 years, skipped declaring a dividend.

Axis after Sharma

In April, after RBI’s nudge and pressure from investors and shareholders, Sharma’s term was reduced to seven months from three years at her request. Sharma has been at the bank's helm since June 2009.

In its annual report released in May and the last quarter financial results for FY17-18 announced in April, outgoing Sharma attempted to clear her image as well as of the bank that took a beating with negative headlines for over 18 months.

A senior analyst says, Axis Bank can be a good growth story from here on, so the new leader can benefit if he/she can manage a turnaround.

“For Axis Bank, the next challenge is to sail through management transition in addition to dealing with some of the remaining stress assets,” said Udit Kariwala, Associate Director at India Ratings & Research of the Fitch Group.

Diwanji says the private lender has a strong and growing retail book, which is not a concern. “Axis has limited problems given the size of its balance sheet and market capitalisation. Except for fully assessing the NPAs and providing for it, Axis Bank is otherwise quite stable.”

That said, the bank’s problems are still at historical highs and may need more than just a clean-up.

Its credit costs are at 2.82 percent, the most in at least 14 years. Its price-to-book ratio is 2.3 times, as compared to its smaller peer Kotak Mahindra Bank’s about 4.0 times, as per Bloomberg.

However, with a strong retail franchise, as Diwanji puts across, and capital infusion worth Rs 11,625.8 crore from the likes of Bain Capital and other investors, the bank may be well-positioned to turnaround.

At a time when the banking industry is fixing its bad loan problems, no bank including Axis Bank would remain immune to it. But for Axis, it is important the new leader does not kill the goose that is probably poised to lay the golden egg.",1039,-0.33025712172190347

The share price of Axis Bank gained 1.6 percent intraday on Thursday, taking total gains of five consecutive sessions to 6 percent after global brokerage house Macquarie expects it to rally further 15 percent.

The research house has a Buy call on the stock with a target price at Rs 615 per share as it feels an external candidate would be more suitable for the CEO post of the private sector lender.

Macquarie said external candidates for CEO post are PS Jayakumar, Pramit Jhaveri and Shirish Apte while internal candidates include current DMD V Srinivasan and ED Rajiv Anand.

The board of Axis Bank recommended names of three candidates for the position of MD & CEO, the bank had said in a release to the exchanges on July 10.

The names have been recommended in order of preference for approval by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the release added.

The candidate, as approved by the RBI, will succeed Shikha Sharma, whose term as the MD & CEO is due to expire on December 31, 2018.

In April, the bank had trimmed the balance term of Shikha Sharma to seven months from three years at her request. Sharma has been at the bank's helm since June 2009.

At 14:22 hours IST, the stock price Axis Bank was quoting at Rs 540.35, up Rs 3.75, or 0.70 percent.",237,0.9999971985816956

Bulls capitulated against bears as the Nifty continued to tumble below its 50-day daily moving average on expiry day (Thursday). However, it bounced back in Friday's session. Selling was seen across all sectors last week, while the carnage in the mid and smallcap space continued.

In the medium term, the Nifty is likely to trade rangebound as long as it trade above 10,550 levels. Its relative strength index (RSI) near the 50 mark suggests sideways movement in coming sessions.

Confluences of Fibonacci retracement and 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) around 10,570 levels implies robust support. The Nifty will remain strong till it holds above this level.

Nifty VIX continues to trade in the range of 13.94 and 12.02, suggesting that market participants are not seeing a major rise in volatility at least for the Nifty.

The downward sloping trend line connecting the two major tops of 11,121 and 10,929 suggests resistance at 10,850 levels. The regression line is flat around 10,750 levels.

We expect the Nifty to trend sideways for the next few trading session. On the flip side, the index has to close below 10,550 to change this sideways movement thesis.

Bank Nifty too is expected to remain rangebound between 26,800 and 26,200 levels. It would start trending only if it decisively closes below its 50-day moving average currently placed at 26,130 levels.

Here is a list of 5 stocks that could return 10-21 percent in the short-term:

Petronet LNG: Buy | Range: Rs 212-215 | Target - Rs 260 | Stoploss - Rs 199 | Return - 21%

Petronet stock price has formed double bottom around Rs 202 which is price reversal pattern in nature. The double bottom formation is also near the consolidation made in July-August 2017 from where last rally has emerged taking stock price to the high of Rs 275.

During making of this double bottom RSI has spurted in the middle to high of 84.7 suggesting possibility of strong follow through post making of the double bottom.

Moreover, emergence of Morning stars on daily chart is indicating up move in coming sessions. Sustainability of RSI above 50 also provides strength.

Buying acceleration will increase above Rs 230 mark after that it should give spurt towards Rs 260 mark. View remains intact as long as it sustains above Rs 199 mark.

Jindal Steel & Power: Buy | Range - Rs 216-219 | Target - Rs 250 | Stoploss - Rs 204 | Return - 15%

Jindal Steel & Power is in a correction mode since early 2018. A bullish Sea-pony harmonic pattern visible on the chart of Jindal Steel is a bullish reversal pattern based on various Fibonacci ratios and one which marks the end of a price decline.

Low of Rs 208 made by Jindal Steel on 28th June is the inflection point D of this harmonic pattern that started getting built when Jindal Steel had hit of yearly high of Rs 294 in January 18.

Price is expected to find a bottom here and potentially reverses to the upside. Formation of Morning star on daily chart is likely to set stage of bottoming out around Rs 215-220 zone.

Price can be expected to head higher in the days ahead, potentially towards Rs 235 and Rs 250 marks. View will invalidated if it closes below Rs 205 mark.

Axis Bank: Buy | Range - Rs 505-510 | Target - Rs 565 | Stoploss - Rs 480 | Return - 11%

A bullish Gartley harmonic pattern is a bullish reversal pattern that is based on various Fibonacci ratios and one which marks the end of a price decline.

By definition, point D is the inflection point as it is around this point, prices is expected to find a bottom and potentially reverses to the upside.

Formation of Bullish long legged doji on daily chart is likely to set stage of bottoming out around this support zone.

Hidden negative divergence is seen in RSI as it is forming lower lows and prices are forming higher lows. Price can be expected to head higher in the days ahead, potentially towards Rs 550 and Rs 570 marks. View will invalidated if it will get close below Rs 480 mark.

Larsen & Toubro: Buy | Range - Rs 1,260-1,270 | Target - Rs 1,400 | Stoploss - Rs 1,205 | Return - 11%

L&T after making recent low of Rs 1,206 on June 28, 2018 gave a good pullback rally in last couple of trading days. The stock has made a ‘Hanging man’ pattern on daily candlestick chart.

The ADX line is tilting downward from 40 levels. A positive divergence also formed on stochastic. All these technical parameters are suggesting some fresh up move from the current level.

Wipro: Buy | Range - Rs 260-261 | Target - Rs 287 | Stoploss - Rs 253 | Return - 10%

While many IT stocks are hitting 52-week high, Wipro continues to trade lower. Recently it has made double bottom near Rs 253 and thereafter have given a good pullback.

RSI and Stochastic after reaching over sold zone has shown higher lows formation. Positive crossover in MACD is showing positive sign.

Therefore some strong pullback rally is expected from the current level.

As majority of the banking system players, including its private sector peers fight the scourge of bad loans and frauds, HDFC Bank said it is looking at expanding its market share.

""Of course, we will get some benefit if the rest are focused on other issues other than growth. We do expect to grow well,"" managing director and chief executive Aditya Puri told reporters here.

The veteran banker further said typically, his bank's growth plans are not dependent on competition.

Puri termed the ongoing troubles in the system as a period of transition, and that there is nothing to worry at the systemic level as most of the lenders are either well- capitalised or have the assurance of government support.

It can be noted that the high quantum of NPAs have led 11 of the 21 state-run banks into tighter regulatory controls. There are also fears of more banks coming under the prompt corrective action framework of the Reserve Bank, leading to worries about the system's ability to support credit demand.

The bank's closest rivals ICICI Bank is fighting allegations of conflict of interest and lack of disclosure against its head Chanda Kochhar, while Axis Bank board cut short its chief Shikha Sharma after reports of regulatory concerns on her ability to reign in high NPAs.

HDFC Bank, which is by far the best-managed large lender when it comes to NPAs, has only five accounts of over Rs 100 crore which are classified as dud loans, he told shareholders at the annual general meeting, adding the aggregate exposure to these accounts is only Rs 827 crore.

Dampening the power sector players, who have been calling for a special dispensation in NPA recognition, Puri termed it as a bad idea that defies logic.

""NPA is an NPA. What is the regulator's role? The role is to define the NPAs in the system. You cannot say one sector's NPA is not NPA in the other sector. I don't think that makes any logic,"" he told reporters.

He also supported the changes in the NPA asset recognition norms, saying it coupled with the bankruptcy laws, has changed the way borrowers think.

Puri said the bank will be starting a Rs 24,000 crore capital raising process ""very soon"" and exuded confidence of it sailing through on its key strengths--good capital buffers, and one of the best earnings ratios in the world.

""Why should I have a problem in a country that is growing well and demand exceeds supply for financial services?"" Puri quipped when asked for his views on credit demand outlook.

Earlier, he said a growth rate of over 7.3 percent is good for any economy and said as capacity utilisation levels increase, private sector investments will also pick up.

To a question whether the fresh capital raised will be deployed only for loan growth --as talks of privatising state-run lenders are on--Puri said the funds will be used for ""growth prospects"" without qualifying what that means.

Informing the shareholders that the bank typically plans its capital needs three years in advance, he asked them not get ""despondent"" about domestic growth prospects as the economy has a lot good things having come out of the impacts of the demonetisation and GST.

But he was quick to add that HDFC Bank did not get impacted by the twin measures by government in quick succession that had impacted economic growth.

Even though the migration to the newer Ind-AS system has been postponed, he said the bank will not be impacted by the new accounting norms when implemented.

He also said the bank is not looking at expanding its overseas presence, even though all its foreign branches are profitable now.

Puri reiterated that the farm loan waivers by various states have impacted recoveries on farm loans.",640,-0.1908612310886383

Axis Bank has put up for sale Lanco Kondapalli Power, which owns and operates 1476 MW gas based power plants as the power producer failed to pay dues. Without mentioning the name of the company Axis Bank called Expression of Interest (EoI) for the sale of three gas-based power projects with a combined capacity of 1476 MW.

Sources close to the development said the power projects are of Lanco Kondapalli, which was once a subsidiary of beleaguered Lanco Infratech Limited. They said the lenders have to find a suitable resolution for their debts before September 16, lest the creditors approach the National Company Law Board for a resolution.

""If the lenders cannot find a solution before the deadline set by the Supreme Court (September 16 2018), then the matter has to be referred to NCLT for a resolution.

The NCLT in turn may appoint a Resolution Professional and give time for a resolution plan,"" the sources told PTI. Lanco Kondapalli a 368 MW gas-based plant is operational since October 2000. Phase-II 366 MW is operational since December 2009 and Phase-III 742 mw is operational sinceJanuary 2016.

While Phase-I is operating with limited gas supplies, Phase II and III are not producing any power due to lack of gas supplies. Lanco officials were not available for comment.

Axis Bank sought in case of strategic investors, sought bids from parties who have net worth of Rs 300 crore as on March 2017 or later. It wanted the financial investors with Rs 1000 crore worth of Assets Under Management or Rs 500 crore committed funds available for investment in future on the plants.

Lanco Kondapalli Power Limited was earlier a subsidiary of Lanco Infratech Limited, which is currently under insolvency proceedings. Lenders of Lanco Kondapalli acquired 51 per cent stake in the company in April 2017 through Strategic Debt Restructuring (SDR). The company has a debt of over Rs 3,000 crore.",328,

Leading exchange BSE today began a mock trading session for further funds offer of the Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF). The mock session would be conducted tomorrow as well.

In November last year, the government had launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC, Axis Bank and L&T. Now, it has launched the follow-on offer through which it is expected to raise up to Rs 8,400 crore.

In a notice, the BSE said the mock session is being conducted to familiarise the participants with the new segment on its web based platform -- iBBS (internet based-book building software) -- for subscription and bidding of further funds offer of the Bharat 22 ETF on BiMF module.

""The BiMF (BSE iBBS platform for mutual fund) module on iBBS platform can be accessed through internet and leased line,"" the exchange said, adding that no separate registration is required to access it.

The exchange has also requested all the trading members to give their feedback of the mock session.

In a separate notice, BSE also said that the subscription for further funds offer (FFO) of the Bharat 22 ETF will commence from June 20 and remain open till June 22 on BiMF module on iBBS platform.

The issue would open for the anchor investors tomorrow and would be available for other institutional and retail investors from Wednesday.

The investors would get a 2.5 per cent discount over the issue price.

A finance ministry official had said last week that the government is aiming at mopping up Rs 6,000 crore, with a green-shoe option to retain another Rs 2,400 crore from the Bharat-22 ETF follow on offer to be launched on June 19.

This offer would also help the government in meeting the minimum public holding norm in PSUs like Coal India.

The state-owned companies or PSUs that are part of the new Bharat ETF-22 include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

Based on the reconstitution of Sensex from June 18, 2018, the earnings per share (EPS) of Sensex is set to get an upgrade of 1.7/1.8 percent, Motilal Oswal has said in a report. The brokerage house has attributed this to the increase in free flat PAT (+2.3 percent/2.4 percent for FY19/FY20) than in free float market cap (0.5 percent).

Going forward, it expects the Sensex EPS to be Rs 1,870 for FY19 and Rs 2,241 for FY20, an increase of 36 and 20 percent, respectively. “Excluding corporate banks such as SBI, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, the profits of Sensex are expected to be posted around 24 percent for FY19,” the report added.

Speaking on the rejig, the brokerage observed that weight of metals is set to increase by 130 basis points to 2.6 percent, while healthcare counterpart is set to hit an eight-year low.

“Vedanta will be included in the benchmark, with weight of 1.3 percent, taking Metals’ weight to 2.6 percent (+130bp). With this inclusion, the metals sector will have two stocks in the benchmark (Tata Steel having 1.3 percent weight),” analysts at the firm wrote in the report.

Meanwhile, with the exit of Dr Reddy’s Labs (weight: 0.8 percent), healthcare stands to lose the most in terms of weight (-70bp to 1.7 percent). Earlier, in December 2017, Cipla and Lupin were excluded from the benchmark, Motilal Oswal further observed.

“Healthcare’s weight will now be at an eight-year low, with the exclusion and also due to the significant underperformance of the sector over the last two years. Sun Pharma (weight: 1.7 percent) will be the only healthcare stock in the benchmark index.”

Having said that, the least impacted sectors would be oil & gas, NBFCs, capital goods, utilities, PSU banks, telecom and infrastructure. Of the top-10 stocks to be most impacted, four are from financials.

Stocks to be hit

According to the report, the top 10 stocks to be impacted the most by the reshuffle are HDFC Bank (-6bp), Reliance Inds (-5bp), HDFC (-5bp), Infosys (-4bp), ITC (-4bp), ICICI Bank (-3bp), TCS (-3bp), L&T (-3bp), Kotak Bank (-2bp), and Maruti (-2bp).

Global ratings agency Fitch today said ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have ""gaps"" in their risk control mechanisms and has revised down its outlook on the latter to negative on sour assets worries.

""Both the banks exhibit gaps in risk controls. An ongoing investigation at ICICI Bank on extending a loan with a potential conflict of interest has also focused authorities' attention on the bank's governance,"" it said in a note.

The report also warns that adverse findings may create a ""reputational risk"", especially if they point at broader weaknesses in management.

The agency cut its outlook on Axis Bank's issuer default rating to negative from stable, pointing out to the high proportion of NPAs and the limited capital buffers available, despite a recent infusion.

It can be noted that a spike in NPAs and provisioning for the same have led the bank, which is searching for a new head after the board agreed to cut short Shikha Sharma's tenure, to report its first ever quarterly loss in Q4 of FY18.

Commenting on ICICI Bank, the report said, ""capital buffers are better even though it has experienced similar financial deterioration like Axis Bank in the previous few financial years.""

The agency also downgraded ICICI Bank's 'support rating' to '3', from '2', apart from revising down its support rating floor to 'BB+', from 'BBB-'.

But the agnecy has affirmed the issuer default ratings and viability ratings of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at 'BBB-' and 'bbb-', respectively.

It can be noted that both the private sector lenders have had a tumultuous time in the past few months. While ICICI Bank managing director and chief executive Chanda Kochhar is facing allegations of conflict of interest and lack of disclosures, it has been NPAs and the ensuing management change that is dogging Axis Bank.

Media reports initially said the RBI was unhappy to extend Sharma's tenure by three years, after which she requested to cut the tenure, which was accepted by the board.

Fitch, which has a negative outlook on domestic banks, said the new regulatory NPAs that has accelerated bad-loan recognition will help improve the health of the banking sector over the long-term.

The report has further said the present NPA ratios make it believe that there has been a full recognition of the legacy problems and the ongoing bankruptcy resolutions can also help positively.

""We expect the internal capital generation for the sector, including the two private sector banks, to stay weak in FY19,"" it added.

The larger private sector lenders have robust deposit franchises but enjoy less depositor confidence than state- owned banks due to the latter's government ownership, but this could lead to greater changes in funding costs and liquidity in ""an extreme scenario"", the report warns.",505,-0.33482617139816284

Fitch Ratings affirmed the long-term issuer default ratings (IDRs) and viability ratings of ICICI Bank and Axis Bank at 'BBB-' and 'bbb-', respectively.

IDRs refers to the relative vulnerability of a company to default on its financial obligations.

The global ratings agency also revised the outlook on Axis Bank to negative from stable but maintained ICICI Bank’s outlook as stable for now.

Axis Bank’s capital buffers are less comfortable for its current rating despite raising fresh capital but does not expect the bank's earnings and non-performing asset (NPA) ratio to markedly deteriorate from current levels, Fitch said in a note released on Friday.

On the other hand, ICICI Bank's capital buffers are expected to be better ""even though it has experienced similar financial deterioration in the previous few years"".

However, Fitch has downgraded ICICI's Support Rating to '3', from '2', and revised downwards its Support Rating Floor to 'BB+', from 'BBB-'.

The revision takes into account the sovereign's constrained finances and our belief that a large number of weak majority government-owned banks, the note said.

The banks' Support Rating Floors and Support Ratings reflect Fitch's expectation of a moderate probability of extraordinary state support, if required, due to their private ownership and lower systemic importance relative to larger banks.

“The Negative Outlook on Axis's IDR reflects rising pressure on its standalone profile relative to banks with a viability rating of 'bbb-', stemming from heightened asset-quality stress and weak earnings,” Fitch said.

Fitch points out that both the private banks exhibit gaps in risk controls.

For ICICI, the ongoing investigation relating to the loan given to Videocon Group raises a potential conflict of interest bringing its corporate governance to the focus of various authorities.

“Adverse findings could create reputational risk, particularly if they point at broader weaknesses in management,” Fitch said adding that its intrinsic creditworthiness may come under further pressure depending on the outcome of the investigation.

Although it believes that ICICI could see improvement in earnings and its NPA ratio with more resolutions.

Fitch already has a negative sector outlook on Indian banks. The new regulatory NPA framework announced on February 12, has accelerated bad-loan recognition given the clean-up mission. It should improve banking-sector health over the long term, it said.

Most (19 of 21) state-owned banks reported losses in the financial year ending March 2018 (FY18) and earnings at large private banks also came under significant pressure, with Axis reporting its first-ever quarterly loss.

“We expect internal capital generation for the sector, including the two private-sector banks, to stay weak in FY19,” the note said adding there is a chance of improvement if some of the 40 large NPA accounts facing insolvency proceedings are resolved in FY19, although there is a risk of legal delays.

Global ratings agency Moody's Investors Service today gave counterparty risk ratings (CRR) to 15 lenders in the country, including fraud-hit Punjab National Bank and country's largest lender SBI.

Others who got the ratings include ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda and HDFC Bank, among others.

It said the CRR are opinions of the ability of entities to honour the uncollateralised portion of non-debt counterparty financial liabilities (CRR liabilities) and also reflect the expected financial losses in the event that such liabilities are not honoured.

The agency also upgraded the counterparty risk assessments of four banks, including PNB, ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda and Axis Bank.

""The counterparty risk (CR) assessment of Punjab National Bank was upgraded to Baa3(cr)/P-3(cr) from Ba1(cr)/NP(cr),"" a statement from the agency said.

Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda and ICICI Bank had their CR assessments upgraded to Baa2(cr)/P-2(cr) from Baa3(cr)/P-3(cr).

PNB in a statement today said, ""Following the bank's strong recovery and the Government of India's continued support, Punjab National Bank (PNB) has been assigned counterparty risk rating (CRR) from Moody's Investors Service.""",243,0.9999983310699463

Edelweiss' research report on Axis Bank

Analysis of Axis Bank’s FY18 annual report provides incremental insights into sector-wise stress accretion (power sector GNPL stood at 4.3% and iron & steel at >60%). Dismal asset quality (multi-fold rise in slippages due to stress up-fronting while maintaining provision coverage) and lower treasury profits took the sheen off FY18 earnings momentum. Even retail earnings were subdued (PBT fell 44% YoY) on soft NII (impact of transfer pricing) and higher provisions. Subsidiaries however gained momentum with revenue/earnings up 31%/5%. Going ahead, returns profile is expected to be modest as: a) >2% of book in still unrecognised stress; b) resolutions are slower; and c) NIMs are at lower levels (settling at 3.4%). Maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

Even as retail continues to strengthen, earnings visibility remains weak. FY18 performance has rattled investors’ confidence. This, along with uncertainty at top management level, will cap valuation in near to medium term. We expect valuations to be capped at 2x FY20E P/BV for RoE of sub-15% (post capital) levels. Maintain ‘HOLD/SU’.For all recommendations report, click here

Mark participants are eyeing the outcome of the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The Street has more or less discounted a rate hike of 25 bps and a change in stance by the central bank.

This is the first time the committee is meeting for three days instead of the regular two days. Some experts expect the MPC to revise the benchmark repo rate upwards from current 6 percent.

Repo rate is the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from the RBI.

Observers feel that the MPC may shift its stance on liquidity to hawkish from being neutral earlier. This could be in preparation for a hike in August if rates are not hiked in the June meeting.

A rate hike is something which might not be taken positively by many sectors. Stocks in sectors like consumption, consumer durables, banking and real estate will be impacted the most, along with rupee and bond market.

""The impact of rate hike by the RBI (if not in June then in the August meeting) will just hit the sentiment of the inventors. As said earlier, if RBI becomes more hawkish, there will be an impact on all the sectors; however, the intensity of the impact will be different. Sectors such as Banks, FMCG infrastructure, real sector and automobile, to name a few, are expected to see some impact,"" DK Aggarwal, Chairman and MD, SMC Investments and Advisors told Moneycontrol.

“A rate hike in coming months, if not in June, seems inevitable as global central banks, be it the US or other emerging markets are on interest rate hiking trajectory. Obviously, hike in interest rate by RBI would impact banks’ lending, capex, rupee and bond markets,” he said.

Aggarwal further added that a rate hike is unlikely to immensely affect lending rates, because banks such as SBI, HDFC, and Axis Bank have raised borrowing costs even before any central bank action.

Rupee, which has been witnessing downside trend, may get a relief from the rate hike. Off late, Indian bond markets have witnessed its worst selloff where FIIs were smart enough to pull out money and place it in other Asian economies like Indonesia and Philippines, suggest experts.

“In my view, a 25 basis points rate hike in August is more or less discounted in the bond market hence, only a higher than 25 basis points (bps) hike will trigger fall in bond market considering this an unusual and aggressive stance by the Reserve Bank of India,” Ashok Mittal, Founder & CEO, Prest Loans told Moneycontrol.

“Rupee has been moving largely due to demand-supply factors, it has a good integration and correlation with the bond market. The fall in rupee is more related to crude and gold prices than rate hike by RBI at this moment,” he said.

Commenting on sectors in specific Mittal said, a rate hike would hit demand for two-wheelers, credit demand for the banking system and realty will become unattractive due to rise in lending rates.

We have collated a list of ten stocks from different experts which are likely to get impacted the most by a rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI):

Analyst: Ritesh Ashar, Chief Strategy Officer at KIFS Trade Capital

DLF & Indiabulls Real Estate:

As real estate stocks are directly impacted by a rate hike and are considered as most sensitive ones to the changes in key rates stocks like DLF and Indiabulls Real Estate will be impacted in a negative way slowing down the growth rate.

The cash flow of DLF remained weak and there was also a major change in the profit of March’18 which came at Rs.37.7 crore as compared to Rs.4110.2 crore in December 2017.

Axis Bank:

The results of Axis bank were not impressive as the Gross NPA rose to 6.77 percent of the total loans at the end of the March quarter, from 5.28 percent in December.

The net NPA ratio worsened to 3.4 percent from 2.5 percent sequentially. And, now the rates are expected to increase it would be very tough for the stock to sustain at the current market rate.

State Bank of India:

SBI also gave negative results for the quarter ended March. The asset quality worsened because of fresh slippages which shot up to approximately 7.2 percent. The country’s largest bank reported a second consecutive net loss of Rs 7,718 crore for the March quarter, primarily due to a surge in provisions and bad loans.

IndusInd Bank:

The gross non-performing assets rose 14 percent sequentially in absolute terms to Rs 1,705 crore. Provisions for bad loans also increased to Rs 335 crore in March quarter, compared to Rs 236.2 crore in the previous quarter.

Analyst: Atish Matlawala, Sr Analyst, SSJ Finance & Securities

Hero MotoCorp & TVS Motor:

Both the two-wheeler names depend on finance to boost sales. Most of the two-wheelers are bought on finance and hence any increase in interest rate will certainly lead to lower sales.

Indiabulls Housing Finance & DHFL:

Housing EMIs forms a large portion of household spend and thus new consumers will certainly defer their decision of buying a home in case of a rate hike.

Indiabulls Housing & DHFL has grown at a very fast pace in recent years and rate hike will certainly put brakes on advances growth for the company.

L&T:

The company is the largest EPC player in the Indian infrastructure space. If RBI hikes interest rates than we may see a slowdown in the infrastructure sector and will result in drying up the new order wins for L&T.

Sebi will soon take action against some market operators and senior staff members of about a dozen listed blue-chip firms for their alleged involvement in leak of price-sensitive information through WhatsApp.

The companies may also face censure action by the market watchdog for alleged lapses in safeguard mechanism to check leak of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI), including financial results before they were made public for all investors, regulatory sources said.

The regulator is close to completing its probe into the matter, including for suspected unlawful gains through insider trading on the basis of leaked information, and is collating the details it had sought from all concerned companies, the officials said.

Almost all the companies have replied to Sebi's queries in this regard.

According to top officials, the regulator is taking a tough stand on the companies that fail to fix individual responsibility for any leak of price-sensitive information. Besides, the market operators, including staff members of some brokerage firms, are also under the scanner for colluding with the company executives in the case, which came to light late last year.

Among various companies from which Sebi had sought details through its interim orders, HDFC Bank last week disclosed in a regulatory filing that it has submitted the requisite information to the regulator.

Referring to Sebi's February 23 directions, HDFC Bank said, ""In this regard, and keeping with its commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance and the integrity of its systems, controls and processes, the Bank has submitted the requisite information and reports to Sebi in compliance with the Sebi directions and within the timelines prescribed therein.""

Sebi had asked the bank to conduct internal investigations to identify those guilty of the leak and take steps to check any recurrence, and also provide necessary information to the regulator within three months.

Apart from HDFC Bank, the regulator has already passed initial orders against Tata Motors, Axis Bank and Bata India in this high-profile case, wherein they were asked to conduct internal probes and report back to the regulator. The probe concerns about a dozen listed firms.

The preliminary probe by Sebi found that the firms' quarterly financial results were matching with the figures that were in circulation on WhatsApp groups prior to the official announcement.

Sebi began a probe in November after a media report surfaced with respect to circulation of unpublished price sensitive information in various private WhatsApp groups about certain companies before their official announcements.

The regulator had also conducted search and seizure operations in this regard at various places, including on the premises of various market entities.

Those being probed by Sebi include auditors, brokers, analysts and investment advisors, besides the company executives, with whom the financial information was shared before being made public through regulatory disclosure on stock exchanges.",475,-0.4586026221513748

JM Financial's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank accelerated the recognition of stressed assets in 4QFY18 driven by RBI’s revised stressed asset guidelines. Consequently, slippages jumped to ~Rs163bn (slippage ratio of 4.2%, NOT annualized). Net Non-NPL stress pool of the bank thus reduced sharply to 2.7% of loans, as against 4.5% in 3QFY18. We see this as a positive move despite the near-term negative impact on P&L (loss of INR 21.9bn in 4QFY18).

Outlook

Axis Bank has the right capital adequacy to still pursue growth opportunities while provisioning rate persists at high levels near-term. Our target price of INR 590 on the stock values the bank at 2.1x FY20E full adjusted book value. Maintain HOLD.For all recommendations report, click here

Motilal Oswal's research report on Axis Bank

AXSB reported a loss of INR21.9b, led by elevated provisions, as the bank accelerated recognition of stressed assets, leading to slippages of INR165.4b (15.4% annualized). NII stood at INR47.3b (flat QoQ/YoY; 2% miss). NIM contracted 50bp YoY, negating 18% YoY advances growth. Other income declined 7.5% YoY to INR27.9b due to weak treasury income against a high base. This, coupled with 10%/14% QoQ/YoY rise in opex, led to a 16% YoY decline in PPoP. Loan growth stood healthy at 18% YoY (+23% YoY in retail; +20% YoY in SME). Deposit base grew much faster off a sequentially low base at 11% QoQ. Reported CASA mix, thus, increased 500bp QoQ to 54% (46% on average basis, flat QoQ). Fresh slippages spiked sharply to INR165.36b (INR44.28b in 3QFY18), while upgrade/recoveries of INR34.0b and write-offs of INR38.9b led to a 37% QoQ increase in GNPA. Elevated provisions helped maintain PCR at 65% (66% in 3Q), leading to 41% QoQ growth in NNPA. 90% of corporate slippages came from the BB and below pool, the size of which stood at INR89.94b. Power/Metals/Infra sectors accounted for ~59% of total slippages. The bank indicated that BB and below book will continue witnessing additions resulting from downgrades over the next two quarters. However, incremental stress addition has peaked out and is expected to decline from hereon.

Outlook

AXSB has reported a weak quarter on the asset quality front and the management has indicated for normalization in credit cost from 2HFY19E only as asset quality pressures continue over the near term. However the stronger PCR (65% including technical write-off), potential improvement in Tier-1 as we build in the warrant conversion and steady trends in core business will help expand RoA to 1.1% by FY20E. We cut our earnings on sharp deterioration in asset quality and higher opex, thus driving 9% decline in our FY20E ABV. We value AXSB at INR600 per share (2.1x FY20E ABV for standalone bank) and value AXSB’s subsidiaries at INR35per share (post 20% holding company discount) in our SOTP valuation. Maintain BUY.

ICICI Direct's research report on Axis Bank

Axis Bank’s asset quality parameters deeply worsened in Q4FY18. Slippages increased by 3.7x QoQ to Rs 16536 crore. Around 84% came from the corporate book. Most corporate slippages (~90%) in Q4 came from the BB & below book, particularly the power sector Consequently, the absolute GNPA increased from Rs 25000 crore in Q3FY18 to Rs 34249 crore in Q4FY18. The GNPA ratio was at 6.77% New guidelines for resolution of stressed assets drove recognition in the restructured book. Bulk of stress has now been recognised Credit growth was healthy at 18% YoY to Rs 439650 crore. Retail & SME loan book grew 23% YoY & 19% YoY, respectively, while corporate loans increased 12% YoY. Deposits increased 9% YoY to Rs 453623 crore. CASA ratio was at ~54% The bank reported losses of Rs 2189 crore due to operating earnings declining 16% YoY to Rs 3672 crore and ~2.6x rise in provisions. The losses occurred despite tax write-back of Rs 1319 crore Full year FY18 PAT was at Rs 276 crore vs. Rs 3679 crore in FY17.

Outlook

Dismal asset quality in the past has been a show spoiler for the bank. However, with bulk of the pain now recognised and adequately provided, the outlook on asset quality is expected to improve ahead. Retail has put up a good show. Now, the corporate segment is expected to witness healthy traction & quality ahead. We remain watchful about management changes over next two quarters & asset quality. Thus, we revise our target price lower to Rs 600 (earlier Rs 690) valuing the stock at 2.6x FY20E ABV. PAT trajectory in FY18-20E would be higher on improving operating earnings & lower base in FY18E. We retain our BUY rating on the stock.

Centrum's research report on Axis Bank

We retain Hold on Axis Bank with TP revised lower to Rs520. The quarter saw bank upfront a substantial part of its watchlist exposure into NPA (slippages came in at Rs165.4bn or 15% of loans annualised). Resultant, Q4’18 results were lower to our / street estimates on both profitabiity and asset quality front. With large part of stressed assets recognised, focus now shifts towards growth. Loan loss provisions is expected to remain elevated (especially in H1FY19), however with healthy core-operating profit we expect RoE to scale towards 14-15% levels by end-FY20e. Valuations at 1.9x FY20E ABV appear reasonable.

Outlook

We have revised our FY19-20E estimates on the slippages and credit cost front. The bank is starting on a clean slate as a major part of stressed assets (one of the overhang on the stock) is behind. We expect RoE to inch towards 14-15% levels by end-FY20E. Valuations at 1.9x FY20E ABV appear reasonable. Retain HOLD with TP at Rs520 (valued at 2x FY20E ABV).

This will, however, produce benefits over the longer term.

""Increased provisioning will hurt the banks' profitability, and weaker public sector banks (PSBs) in particular will continue to report losses in the next fiscal year (FY19), adding pressure on their capital ratios,"" said Alka Anbarasu, Vice President and Senior Analyst with Moody's.

The observations were made in its report, ""Banks -- India: A final push for NPL recognition will hurt profitability in coming quarters"".

Already, 11 public sector banks are under PCA or prompt corrective action framework by the RBI because of their weak capital ratios and high non-performing assets or loans (NPAs or NPLs).

""Nevertheless, the near-term impact of this profitability deterioration on their credit profiles will be largely offset by planned capital infusions from the government,"" she added.

In October 2017, the government announced infusion of an unprecedented Rs 2.11 lakh crore capital over two years in PSBs that are reeling under high NPAs. Of these, Rs 80,000 crore has already been sanctioned in the last fiscal year ending March 2018.

Banks have been struggling to resolve NPAs worth over Rs 8.5 lakh crore.

Moreover, Moody's said that the central bank's new NPA resolution rules are positive from the point of view of healthy quality of the balance sheet because they provide a clearer, time-bound process for resolving stressed assets and will prevent a future buildup of problem loans in the system.

Under the new rules for bad debt resolution that the RBI released on February 12, banks can no longer resort to various loan restructuring schemes to delay the recognition of NPAs.

Anbarasu says ""Also, we have already been taking into account the system's restructured assets, not just NPAs, when assessing the banks' credit profiles, so shifts in the composition of the broader asset pool will not have much bearing on our assessment of the banks' asset quality.""

Although banks have recognized many loans as NPAs following an extensive inspection of loan books by the RBI in 2015, they still hold large volumes of restructured loans, a large share of which will become NPAs in the coming quarters. As banks reclassify these assets, NPA ratios will gradually rise, but once this process is complete, they will stabilize and eventually decline substantially, the Moody's report said.

""Among the rated private sector banks, ICICI Bank Limited (Baa3 stable, ba1) and AXIS Bank Limited (Baa3 stable, ba1) have the highest ratio of stressed assets but are better equipped to face higher credit costs because their profitability is superior -- and so is their capitalization as a result,"" the report adds.

Most of the existing restructured assets are legacy loans originated in 2009-12, largely to infrastructure-related sectors, such as construction and power, and Moody's expects growth in new stressed assets to be limited.

The power sector accounts for more than half of stressed assets, as it continues to struggle with a low capacity utilization rate, with state-owned power distribution companies remaining under stress and holding off on entering into long-term purchasing agreements with electricity generators.",531,-0.4630024234453837

Axis Bank's slippages for the quarter nearly quadrupled year-on-year to Rs 16,536 crore, with nearly Rs 13,900 crore of new slippages coming from the corporate sector. So more than 80 percent of the slippages were from companies rated 'BB' and below.

Analysts polled by Reuters had estimated a decline of 56 percent in net profit to Rs 534 crore, and 4 percent rise in net interest income to Rs 4,909 crore.

Interestingly, this was not the first or the biggest loss that has been posted by a bank in India.

Edelweiss' research report on Axis Bank

Dismal asset quality (multi-fold rise in slippages) took the sheen off of an otherwise operationally steady Q4FY18 (~18% loan growth and sustained momentum in retail franchise), thereby resulting in a loss. Critically, slippages were due to up-fronting of stress from the watch-list and BB & below rated exposures as per the RBI’s recent recognition norms. The bank maintained provisioning coverage leading to significantly higher credit cost. Major part of stress recognition seems to be over, but recovery is expected to take a while. Returns profile will be modest as: a) >2% of book in still unrecognised stress (watch-list + RBI’s restructuring dispensation + below-investment grade corporate rating); b) slower resolutions; and c) NIMs settling lower at 3.4% levels. Maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

Even though retail continues to strengthen, earnings visibility remains weak. FY18 performance has rattled investors’ confidence. This, along with uncertainty at top management level will cap valuations in near to medium term. We expect valuations to be capped at 2x FY20E P/BV for RoE of sub-15% (post capital). At CMP, the stock trades at 1.8x FY20E P/ABV. We maintain ‘HOLD/SU’ with revised TP of INR535.

Sharma, who is serving her fourth term, has decided to shorten her tenure by more than two years. Sharma’s decision came after the country’s apex bank the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) questioned the bank’s performance and its deteriorating asset quality. Under Sharma’s tenure, Axis Bank – the country’s third largest private lender – reported its gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rising from 0.96 per cent in March 2009 to 5.28 per cent in December 2017. Axis Bank has also been pulled up twice by the central bank for under-reporting bad loans for financial years 2016 and 2017.

Axis Bank CEO and MD Shikha Sharma showed no signs of inner turmoil as she took the stage to field queries from the press on the company’s quarterly performance, on Thursday.

Axis Bank’s books were awash in red after massive losses in the March quarter — the first ever quarterly loss in the private sector lender’s history.

The conference was delayed due to the extended board meeting, and Sharma started by apologising. Sharma has not chaired earnings press conferences in a while now. She is rarely present for earnings calls, and the queries from industry watchers would be mostly handled by her deputy and the chief financial officer.

For the past 18 months now, Sharma and Axis Bank have been making headlines regularly, but for all the wrong reasons. It began with demonetisation when some branch officials were found colluding with cash hoarders to help them legitimise their money. Then followed persistent rumours that she was on her way out, and that Axis Bank was being taken over by Kotak Mahindra Bank. The divergence in the quality of assets as pointed out by the RBI also drew bad press.

Moreover, with the new financial year starting April 1, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) dropped Axis Bank from a list of banks it has cleared to import gold and silver.

Sharma's leadership also has been under a cloud after Reserve Bank of India questioned her reappointment as the bank chief for three years given the company's deteriorating financials.

Subsequently, the Axis Bank Board shortened her tenure to December 2018 on her request. For someone who had played a key role in transforming the bank since taking charge in 2009, the swansong is not what she would like it to be.

Of losses and slippages

Axis Bank posted a Rs 2,189-crore net loss in the fourth quarter, after being hit by a 37 percent rise in non-performing assets and slippages into bad loans at Rs 16,536 crore.

The loss would have been much higher at Rs 3,507 crore if not for the tax write-back of Rs 1,319 crore it received.

And for the first time in 10 years, Axis Bank skipped declaring a dividend.

In the pink of health?

But at the conference, held at the bank's headquarters in Worli's Bombay Dyeing compound, Sharma came across as confident and at times, even defiant. She answered some of the questions with a smile, with her colleagues, including Deputy MD Srinivasan and Executive Director Rajiv Anand, sitting next to her.

Wearing a pink saree — much in contrast to the health of Axis Bank — Sharma started off by highlighting the bank's achievements in the last nine years under her charge.

She underlined how Axis Bank has become one of the top deposit franchises in the country with market share growing from 2.9 percent in FY09 to 3.7 percent as on December 2017.

To her credit, Axis Bank did grow its lending book by 21 percent over nine years, shifting focus on retail, and growing to be among the top three banks in the country by volume and value.

She also acknowledged the failures. For instance, her disappointment with the bank's performance on credit risk. ""We made some significant bets on the infrastructure sector, which have turned out poorly in this credit cycle. Consequently, our NPA ratios have risen materially over the past two years,"" Sharma said adding that the course correction began in 2013 to reorient its corporate lending and strengthen risk framework

The NPA epidemic

Still, the cracks had begun to set in. Over last two years, Axis Bank has joined the league of many other public sector banks, which have made losses after being hit by the NPA epidemic plaguing the sector.

Industry watchers were surprised by the further deterioration when the bank announced the fourth quarter results on Thursday. Its gross NPAs ballooned to Rs 34,250 crore as on March end, a jump of 37 percent from the previous quarter.

Thus, the share of gross NPAs to total loans rose to 6.77 percent from 5.28 percent in the December quarter.

But Sharma put on a brave face.

""We believe the NPA recognition phase of this credit cycle is now nearly complete and the focus shifts on resolution,"" she told the media.

During this quarter, the bank took a conservative view of the recent regulatory changes and have executed all the necessary NPA recognitions. This comes, especially, given the divergence worth Rs 9,478 crore for FY16 and Rs 5,632 crore for FY17, in NPA classification as compared with RBI's assessment.

Axis Bank spiked up its provisions (capital towards bad loans) by three times to Rs 7,180 crore in the fourth quarter.

""We believe that new NPA formation in this financial year will be significantly lower,"" Sharma said adding that the bank didn't want to get bogged down with short term challenges, but instead was working towards the future.

Future tense

Sharma now has just a few months to undo much of the damage of the last few years.

And she sounded confident about being able to get the bank back on track. At the conference, she laid down four pillars of delivery for Axis Bank — normalising credit risk, delivering profitable growth, enhancing capabilities and investing in the future.

The jargons though sounded familiar.

Sharma said the bank was aiming to grow the loan book from high teens to low 20 percent in the next two years without raising more equity capital.

Sharma later took questions from journalists, and even when tricky ones came her way, the smile didn't leave her face.

Responding to a question on the recent controversies, she reminded a journalist that Axis Bank was a great institution that had delivered over the last nine years, and had a bright future ahead.

As Sharma exited the conference, with a smile on her face, one couldn't help but wonder if she could do anything to change the way history will judge her innings at Axis Bank.

The answer will be clearer three quarters later.",1123,-0.20039812723795572

We are very disappointed with Axis Bank's Q4FY18 results. Although it looks cheap on the valuation front as compared to other private sector peers but we would certainly avoid this counter.

We believe this result will not go well with street participants. The recent newsflow regarding surge in bad loans in CEO Shikha Sharma's tenure has already raised eyebrows. It all depends as to how the prospective new chief tackles the NPA problem and his strategy going forward to bring back o its past glory which seems difficult at the moment.

The Bank reported first ever quarterly loss since listing during the March quarter of the last fiscal on the back of three-fold increase in provisions. The third largest private sector lender posted a net loss at Rs 2,188.74 crore in the Q4FY18, as opposed to a net profit of Rs 1,225.10 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Net profit for the financial year 2017-18 shrunk 93 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to end at Rs 276 crore.

The bank saw its provisions and contingencies increase to Rs 7,179.53 crore from Rs 2,581.25 crore seen during the quarter that ended on March 31, 2017, according to a regulatory filing by Axis Bank. The bank's Net Interest Income in the March quarter stood flat on YoY basis at Rs 4,730 crore, the statement added.

Axis Bank also skipped on distributing dividend due to the surprise loss in the March quarter. ""After making mandatory appropriations to Statutory Reserve, Investment Reserve and Capital Reserve, no profits are available for distribution as dividend for the year ended March 31, 2018. Accordingly, no dividend has been recommended by the Board of Directors for the year ended March 31, 2018.

The asset quality of Axis Bank also worsened as its gross non-performing assets (NPAs) reached 6.77 percent during the fourth quarter of FY18. The same was at 5.28 percent in the December quarter last fiscal, and 5.04 percent in the corresponding period last year.

The private lender saw its net NPAs rise to 3.40 percent from 2.56 percent in the previous quarter and 2.11 percent in the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Axis Bank's gross NPAs stood at Rs 34,249 crore and its net NPAs at Rs 16,592 crore. Slippages for the quarter under review stood at Rs 16,536 crore, amounting to a four-time jump on YoY basis from Rs 4,811 crore during Q4FY17. More than Rs 13,900 core in new slippages came from corporate sector.

Slippages for the quarter nearly quadrupled year-on-year, with nearly Rs 13,900 crore of new slippages coming from the corporate sector with more than 80 percent of the slippages were from companies rated 'BB' and below.

The Nifty50 which reclaimed its crucial psychological resistance level of 10,600 made a bullish candle on the daily charts on Thursday. The index took support at its 5-days exponential moving average (DEMA) for the third day in a row.

However, Nifty witnessed selling pressure around its crucial resistance level of 10630-10640. Hence, for bulls to regain control of D-Street, a close above 10640 is required which would open fresh target towards 10900 in May series, suggest experts.

Option data suggests an immediate trading range in between 10500 to 10700 and traders are advised to remain on the long side. Level of 10500 will act as crucial support for the index. Investors should keep a trailing stop loss below 10,530 for long positions.

On the option front, for the May series option data scattered at various strike prices since it’s the beginning of new series. Maximum Put OI is at 10500 followed by 10400 strikes while maximum Call OI is at 11000 followed by 10800 strikes.

Fresh Put writing was seen at 10500 and 10600 strikes while significant Call writing was seen at 11000 and 10700 strikes.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,575.54, followed by 10,533. If the index starts moving upward, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,644 and 10,670.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 25,010, up 196 points. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 24,821, followed by 24,632. On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 25,132, followed by 25,252.

Axis Bank, country's third largest private sector lender, reported loss of Rs 2,188. 74 crore for the fourth quarter of FY18. The bank had posted profit of Rs 1,225 crore in the same quarter last year.

This is the first ever quarterly loss posted by Axis Bank since it listed over two decades ago.

Slippages for the quarter nearly quadrupled YoY to Rs 16,536 crore with nearly Rs 13,900 crore of new slippages coming from the corporate sector. So, more than 80 percent of slippages were from BB and below rated companies.

The bank said loans to the power sector amounted to Rs 9,000 crore and 40 percent of these loans were NPAs.

Net interest income (NII) – difference between interest earned and expended – was flat at Rs 4,730 crore in Q4FY18. In Q4FY17 NII was at Rs 4,728.60 crore.

A Reuters analyst poll had estimated a decline of 56 percent in profit to Rs 534 crore. The poll estimated NII to rise a marginal four percent to Rs 4,909 crore.

Bad loans and provisions

Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) during the quarter deteriorated to Rs 34,248. 64 crore, at 6.77 percent of total loans.

Gross bad loans had increased in Q3 ending December 2017 at 5.28 percent, and at 5.04 percent as on March end last year.

Net NPAs jumped 41 percent QoQ to Rs 16,591.71 crore, at 3.4 percent of total loans.

Net NPA was at 2.56 percent in December 2017. In the year ago period, net NPAs were at 2.11 percent as on March end 2017.

Provisions were at Rs 7.179. 53 crore from Rs 2,581.25 crore in March quarter last year.

Management commentary

""Recent regulatory guidelines forced us to recognise other accounts as bad loans,"" said MD and CEO Shikha Sharma in a results conference.

""Credit risks have been a disappointment for the bank and our focus now is normalisation of these risks,"" she said, adding, ""It was important to complete the NPA recognition process. Now we can say this is the end of the recognition process.""

The private lender has been grabbing news headlines for the wrong reasons in the past few months given its deteriorating financial performance under the leadership of Shikha Sharma.

Earlier this month, Sharma's tenure was shortened by the bank's Board on Sharma's request from three years to seven months ending December 2018.

Reports suggest that the Reserve Bank of India had intervened in the Board's decision that cleared Sharma's reappointment for the fourth term for another three years in July last year.

Sharma said she is confident the Board will find the right person to take the leadership of the bank. ""I will cooperate in the transition. I am sure, it is an exciting time for anyone to take over the job (on new CEO). We should not get bogged down with short term challenges and work toward the future,"" she said.

Jairam Sridharan, CFO of Axis Bank said, NPA recognition cycle is nearly through with this quarter. ""Our watchlist is closed with the end of this quarter and will no longer exist,""he said.

We believe the new NPA formation in this financial year will be significantly lower. We continue to expect loan growth in the high teens (over 15 percent), Sridharan said.

He said the bank will look at stable to upward projection in net interest margins (NIMs).

The bank is confident about its capital requirement for the next two years. “At least two years of growth can be funded by our current capital,” he said.

For FY19, the bank has charted a four-step plan comprising normalisation of credit risk, delivering profitable growth, enhancing capabilities and investing in the future, Sharma said.

On resolution under insolvency Sharma said, ""I wouldn't worry about the couple of months delay in the resolution, the law is remarkable and eventually will see resolution. About 60-65 percent hair cut can be expected overall.""

Sridharan said the impact of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), write backs from the resolution, change in credit culture due to the February 12 RBI circular, among other initiatives will help improve the credit costs going forward.",697,0.05181327263514201

ICICI Direct has come out with its fourth quarter (Jan-March’ 18) earnings estimates for the Banking & Financial Services sector. The brokerage house expects Axis Bank to report net profit at Rs. 947.5 crore down 22.7% year-on-year (up 30.4% quarter-on-quarter).

Net Interest Income is expected to increase by 5.6 percent Y-o-Y (up 5.5 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs. 4,992.4 crore, according to ICICI Direct.

ICICI Direct’s earnings estimates for Axis Bank

Axis Bank's previous quarter was a healthy overall with slippages and GNPA witnessing a decline. However, in Q4FY18, owing to lack of resolutions in the large NCLT cases (exposure of Rs. 7,000 crore), RBI's new NPA framework and a large telecom account turning technically NPA, we expect bank's slippages and GNPA to be relatively higher QoQ. Business growth is expected to be decent with loan traction of 18% YoY to Rs. 440,222 crore and deposit growth of 9% YoY to Rs. 451,782 crore. With margins estimated steady QoQ at 3.4%, NII growth may stay in single digit at 5.6% YoY to Rs. 4,992 crore. PAT is seen at Rs. 947 crore.

Advances growth expected at 18%, though continued high slippages on account of new RBI NPA classification guidelines are likely to dent NIMs, resulting in flat NII growth. High credit costs will impact PAT, which is expected to de-grow sharply. Asset quality is expected to deteriorate.

Private sector lender Axis Bank today said it has started the process to select a new Managing Director & CEO as the incumbent Shikha Sharma is scheduled to demit office in December.

Earlier this month, Sharma had requested the Board that she may be relived in December. The bank had earlier given her a new three-term beginning June 1.

""This is to inform you that the Board of Directors of the Bank has commenced the succession process to appoint a new Managing Director & CEO of the Bank,"" Axis Bank said in a regulatory filing.

The Board has appointed Egon Zehnder, a global leadership advisory firm, to conduct the succession process and evaluate candidates for the said post.

The bank further said the Board will ensure that the process will be completed before the end of Sharma's tenure and ""thus facilitate smooth transition of leadership responsibilities at the bank"".

In December last year, the bank had said the Board had decided to reappoint Sharma as the Managing Director and CEO, for a period of three years with effect from June 1, 2018, subject to receipt of requisite approvals.

The Board had accepted request of Sharma to curtail her tenure amidst RBI raising questions over her re-appointment for the fourth term as MD and CEO of the third largest private sector lender in the wake of mounting non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans.",242,-0.9994946718215942

The Nifty snapped its 9-day winning streak on Wednesday, but managed to close above its crucial support level of 10500 for the third consecutive day in a row.

The index formed a bearish candle on the daily candlestick charts after a Hanging Man pattern recorded in the previous trading session which suggests that the momentum seems to be fading.

However, the Nifty closed above its crucial 5-days exponential moving average (DEMA) which offers some hope to the bulls. However, if the index breaches 10495 in Thursday’s trading session, chances are that the trend could tilt in favour of bears.

The Nifty which opened at 10578 rose to an intraday high of 10,594 before bears walked in. The index slipped to an intraday low of 10509 before closing 22 points lower at 10,526.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,492.53, followed by 10,458.87. If the index starts moving upwards, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,577.03 and 10,627.87.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 25,102.3. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 24,965.14, followed by 24,827.97.

On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 25,333.14, followed by 25,563.97.

The Finance Ministry may come out with a Rs 10,000-crore follow-on fund offer of the Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF) as it looks to dilute stake in Coal India to meet the minimum public holding norm.

Besides, the ministry is keen to take the ETF route to sell off government shares held through SUUTI in private companies -- ITC, Axis Bank and L&T, an official told PTI.

The government had in November last year launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC, Axis Bank and L&T.

The fund had garnered bids to the tune of Rs 32,000 crore, although the government retained only Rs 14,500 crore.

An official said the ETF route is a safer mode of disinvestment as it shields investors against stock market volatility.

""Based on the current composition of the Bharat-22 ETF, the leg room for a follow-on fund offer would be around Rs 10,000 crore,"" the official added.

The state-owned companies or PSUs that are part of the new Bharat ETF-22 include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

The other central public sector enterprises on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

The official said by using the ETF route, the government may dilute about 3.55 per cent stake held in Coal India to comply with the minimum 25 per cent public float requirement as mandated by market regulator Sebi.

The government plans to raise Rs 80,000 crore in the current fiscal from disinvestment, lower than over Rs 1 lakh crore raised last year.

Prior to the launch of Bharat-22 ETF which has a diversified portfolio, the government had floated the CPSE ETF comprising stocks of 10 bluechip PSUs -- ONGC, Coal India, IOC, GAIL (India), Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, Engineers India and Container Corporation of India.

Through the CPSE ETF, the government had raised Rs 11,500 crore in three tranches, with Rs 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014, Rs 6,000 crore from the second tranche in January 2017 and Rs 2,500 crore from the third tranche in March 2017.",388,0.21034422516822815

Three months ago, a diversified financial services player was in talks with a public sector general insurance company to insure its directors.

Though the deal did not materialise at that time due to high premium, the company has now come back asking the insurer for a Directors & Officers (D&O) liability, and as well as Errors and Omissions (E&O) coverage. It is now even ready to pay a higher premium.

The Directors and Officers (D&O) Liability Policy covers the liability incurred by acts of omission and commission by top management of companies. However, while the policy provides for coverage even in cases like sexual harassment, there are specific exclusions which companies make. E&O, on the other hand, covers any wrongful acts of any employee of a company for which they could be held liable as an institution.

The turn of events in the financial sector - from the PNB scam to the ICICI Bank imbroglio - has led to companies scurrying for cover in anticipation of any legal or financial liability from stakeholders due to any any errors by the staff.

""We had seen that E&O was usually taken by a certain set of firms including law firms, attorneys or organisations working in the medical field. Now even banks and broking houses are asking for these covers apart from D&O, even though past claims have led to an increase in premiums by at least 20-30 percent,"" said the underwriting head of a mid-size private general insurance company.

""Any individual's lack of foresight or financial decisions as a member of a particular team could be liable for legal implications on their employer, client if any wrongful acts are detected. So, BFSI clients want to err on the side of caution, even though intentional frauds are an exclusion,"" said the chief general manager of a state-owned general insurer.

Here, the premium is based on the size of the company and the number of members that they intend to cover under the policy. However, any criminal, dishonest, fraudulent, willful, intentional or malicious act is not covered.

In the banking sector in particular, the Bankers Indemnity Policy has become a must-have for all the institutions, even though public sector banks are yet to warm up to the idea.

Moneycontrol had reported earlier that bankers are leaving no stone unturned to ensure that liabilities arising out of their employees' misdeeds are covered by insurance. There is an increase in the demand for higher limits and specialised covers from insurers.

Last week, Axis Bank said that its MD & CEO Shikha Sharma's term has been reduced to seven months from three years at her request. The decision to reduce the term came days after reports suggested the Reserve Bank of India had asked Axis' Board to reconsider Sharma's reappointment at the helm for the fourth term on the grounds of the bank's dwindling financial performance.



Similarly, private sector bank ICICI Bank continued to face the heat as global rating agency Fitch said allegations over a loan to Videocon raise questions of corporate governance and pose reputational risks for the bank.

On the public sector bank front, Punjab National Bank had a billion-dollar scam that involved diamond merchant Nirav Modi colluding with some employees to get loans without collateral. The size of the scam is currently believed to be around Rs 12,700 crore.





Under D&O and E&O, if an executive of a company is charged for any civil or criminal proceedings, this cover will pay for the legal costs incurred.



For instance, in an earlier case involving a law-suit of a sexual harassment case involving Infosys staff, including its former employee Reka Maximovitch and Phaneesh Murthy, the case was settled for $3 million. Here, the insurer for the company paid half the amount, while Infosys paid the other half.





D&O and E&O come under the miscellaneous category of insurance. While this constitutes less than 10 percent of the overall portfolio of general insurers, sources said that this segment has seen the highest growth in corporate clients at about 40 per cent year-on-year and also sees the highest ticket sizes.",692,-0.518458342552185

The last couple of weeks have been tough for ICICI Bank’s Chanda Kochhar, who is one of India’s top bankers, as she fights losing confidence from investors, media and experts in the banking sector.

Speculations and suggestions of her stepping down as the CEO and Managing Director of ICICI Bank, which is country’s largest private sector bank, have been rife as the nepotism links widen amid various investigations and reports.

“A couple of Board members do have reservations on her continuing as the CEO but they are still evaluating the process. Also, given the asset quality troubles, weak investor response to the IPO of ICICI Securities and the losing investor confidence, it may be a matter of time that she may have to step down till the investigations give her a clean chit,” said a person aware of the developments.

At present, the 12-member ICICI Bank board has six executive directors or bank employees, and six non-executive directors. The latter six include bank Chairman MK Sharma, LIC chairman VK Sharma, Finance Ministry Joint Secretary Lok Ranjan (replaced Amit Agarwal on April 5) and three other independent experts (Dileep Choksi, Neelam Dhawan and Tushaar Shah).

On March 29, a news report of the allegations made by a whistleblower in October 2016 through a blog resurfaced in the media, raising questions over ICICI Bank sanctioning loans to the Videocon Group in 2012, allegedly because its chairman Venugopal Dhoot had business dealings with NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar.

Questions were also raised on her presence in the credit committee that decided on loans and if any disclosures of the links between Dhoot and her ‘relative’ were made to the Board.

Although the board of ICICI Bank has backed its chief, ruling out any conflict of interest or quid pro quo after a review done on March 28 by all members, ICICI Bank’s stock has plunged as much as 14 percent during the last one month.

Various commentators have also raised concerns of the growing discomfort and waning faith in corporate governance in private sector firms’ boards. This also comes after Axis Bank’s board, within four months, reversed its decision on the reappointment of its CEO and MD Shikha Sharma, who will step down in December this year, reducing her fourth term from three years to seven months.

While Axis Bank has buckled under pressure from Reserve Bank of India, which had asked the bank’s board to reconsider Sharma’s 3-year term reappointment, reports suggest RBI had intervened in ICICI Bank-Videocon controversy in 2016 and is doing so again to decide the next step for ICICI Bank’s board. On the other hand, Finance Ministry is only taking updates but will let RBI decide the action plan.

Global credit rating agency Fitch Ratings issued a note last week stating the potential conflict of interest and raising questions over ICICI Bank’s governance and reputational risks. It has slammed what it calls to ICICI’s “reluctance to support an independent probe” into the matter.

Over the past two weeks, the Income Tax Department has sent a notice to Deepak Kochhar, and issued lookout notices for him at airports. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has questioned his brother Rajiv Kochhar, in relation to his firm Avista Advisory playing a role in restructuring of loans to Videocon Group, directors of NuPower and Mahesh Chandra Punglia, a longtime consultant of the Videocon Group and confidante of Dhoot.

Even as nothing has been proven so far, developments and new public records unearthed by various media reports since the allegations came to light have not captured the bank in a good light.

Further, complete silence from Chanda Kochhar since then and Chairman MK Sharma’s refusal to take any questions after a media briefing where he came out in support of her, has added fuel to the fire.

With much at stake for ICICI Group as an institution, the board may have to make more amends to restore faith of investors and depositors in the bank and towards its CEO.

Till then, the uncertainty continues to loom on her term, which if we were to go by the current scenario, could end before its expiry in March 2019.

In the week gone by, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank remained the buzz word with the controversies surrounding the leaders of these banks.

Moneycontrol spoke to the fund managers to know how are they placing these stocks in their portfolio.

Most fund managers on conditions of anonymity said there was no cause for panic at the moment. They, however, would wait for clarity before investing further in both stocks.

The CEO said the ICICI Bank board’s initial decision to give a clean chit to Chanda Kochhar in the controversy surrounding the loan to the Videocon group, may have been a bit hasty. Media reports over the last couple of days suggest the board is divided in its support for Kochhar.

On April 9, global ratings agency Fitch expressed doubts about the corporate governance standards at ICICI Bank, amid allegations of impropriety against Chanda Kochhar.

Over the past two weeks, top ICICI Bank board members have responded to queries and held conference calls with several investors, assuring them that the bank adheres to corporate governance standards and that internal investigations are being carried out.

Some management officials have reportedly been participating in the reassuring investors - excluding CEO Chanda Kochhar, who has chosen to maintain complete silence on the matter.

In the case of Axis Bank, MD & CEO Shikha Sharma stepped down after the RBI questioned the bank’s board's decision to extend her term by another three years starting June this year. Sharma will be staying in her role till December to ensure an orderly transition. So far, it is not clear who will be replacing Sharma.

Over the last many months, there had been persistent speculation about Sharma quitting Axis Bank. So much that Axis Bank had to issue a statement denying the rumours.

Last month, there were reports in a section of the media that Deputy Managing Director V Srinivasan had resigned from his position some weeks back. Axis Bank has termed the reports ‘speculative’.

The next trigger for both banks from a stock market perspective, will be the fourth quarter earnings. Market expectations from both banks are muted, given the bad loan problem in the sector appears to be far from over.

For Axis Bank, FY17 was a difficult year because of mounting pressure on asset quality culminating in asset quality divergence highlighted by RBI, rumours of being acquired by a rival and, finally, the early exit of high-profile CEO Shikha Sharma.

In FY17, NPAs rise from 1.67 percent to 5.04 percent with a gross slippage of

Rs 21,781 crore. The moderation of slippage in the first quarter of FY18 was followed by gross slippage climbing in the second quarter thanks to the asset quality divergence pointed out by Reserve Bank of

India (RBI).

While gross and net NPA stood at 5.28 percent and 2.56 percent, respectively, at the end of December 2018, we feel the pain is not yet over especially after the February 12 RBI circular that closed the door on all existing categorisation of standard stressed assets.

For large accounts with aggregate exposure of over Rs 2,000 crore, the failure to resolve within 180 days from March 1 would warrant taking the cases to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) as well.

Dont panic, just wait and watch. We expect short term target of around Rs 590.

We believe the current cheap valuations of Axis Bank in the private banking space are owing to rise of NPAs in a gradual manner over the last few years. The board of directors of the bank have written to the Reserve Bank of India saying that its Chief has requested them to reduce her fourth term to December 2018, instead of May 2021, triggering a hunt for her successor.

“Shikha Sharma, Managing Director & CEO of the Bank has requested the Board to reconsider the period of her re-appointment as the Managing Director & CEO of the Bank be revised from June 1, 2018 up to December 31, 2018,” the bank said in a stock exchange filing.

We believe it would be a tough ask from the new chief who takes over to clear all the past mistakes. Recovery would take time and there might be possibility of further write offs and slippages. In terms of valuation it is attractively priced at its 2.5x of its Book Value. Any improvement on the asset quality front would be cheered by the street which can lead to likely rerating.

Axis Bank enjoys a strong CASA deposit which implies strong retail reach. The bank continues to focus on retail/SME/working capital and better rated corporate exposures which can improve its overall asset quality. We remain hopeful and optimistic.

The recent developments at Axis Bank and ICICI Bank have once again renewed the debate on corporate governance standards and the independence of boards.

Till about a year back, the widely held view was that private sector banks were doing a much better job of maintaining asset quality. That halo faded after the Reserve Bank of India started pointing out discrepancies in the quantum of bad loans as disclosed by the banks and RBI’s assessment of the situation.

Banking experts point out that the boards of these banks continued to reward the top bosses with handsome bonuses and increments despite mediocre financial performance and the under reporting of bad loans.

Earlier this week, Axis Bank MD & CEO Shikha Sharma stepped down after the RBI questioned the board’s decision to extend Sharma’s term for another three years, beginning June this year. Sharma will remain in her role till December to ensure a smooth transition.

At ICICI Bank, the board gave a clean chit to MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar who is battling allegations of nepotism on the loan to the Videogroup group. Subsequent media reports suggest the board is divided on the matter.

Banking sector experts say that both the private banks have seen a deterioration in their asset quality while the boards have continued to reward their respective chiefs with heavy increments, bonuses and incentives. Hence, it shows that even when both the banks were penalized by the Reserve Bank of India for under reporting of bad loans, their boards did not punish them for under par performance.

“It is strange that you renew a CEO’s tenure despite a sharp deterioration in asset quality, poor operational risks management, two consecutive years of misreporting of accounts and collapse in performance,” Hemindra Hazari, an independent banking analyst told Moneycontrol.

“And to top it, the increments, stock options and bonuses approved by the board keeps going up each year. If a Board is incapable of such a basic function of performance appraisal of a bank and its CEO, the Board itself becomes dysfunctional,” Hazari says, adding that most independent directors are independent only in name.

Both Kochhar and Sharma are serving their third term and have been rewarded consistently by their banks with bonuses in most years. According to media reports, RBI has not yet approved the payout of bonuses for private sector bank bosses for FY18.

For FY17, ICICI’s board had approved a bonus of Rs 2.2 crore (NIL for FY16) for CEO Chanda Kochhar with total remuneration of Rs 5.64 crore, up from Rs 4.79 crore in FY16, while Axis Bank’s Shikha Sharma received total pay of Rs 5.7 crore (up from 5.4 crore) with a bonus of Rs 1.35 crore (up from Rs 1.13 crore).

Previously, the role of boards of IT companies such as Satyam and Infosys have also come under shareholder and regulatory fire. Among other things, the Satyam scam highlighted the failure of independent directors.

The Infosys Board also defended its former CEO Vishal Sikka when allegations of severance pay to its former key executives and irregularities in the Panaya acquisition were raised by Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy.

Says J.N. Gupta, MD at Stakeholders Empowerment Services, “It exposes the entire evaluation process in our corporate sector. If the Axis Bank Board had found her capable for heading the bank for next four years, there was no reason for them to succumb to the RBI pressure in three months...So either the Board was wrong in its initial decision or it is wrong now.”

Echoing somewhat similar views, M Damodaran, ex-SEBI chairman says when RBI asked the Axis Bank board to reconsider Sharma’s appointment, the board should have had a strong argument as to why it thought that Sharma should continue.

On the ICICI Bank issue, Damodaran said the lender’s board should have sought independent opinion.

“The board should have appointed an independent inquiry authority, not do its own inquiry, because there are stakeholders, there is reputation management,” he said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

""This can be done only by conducting an impartial inquiry, and that is what everyone does whether in India or outside,” he said.",809,-0.24695660173892975

Fund managers at domestic mutual funds are closely watching the developments at ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, as the two major private sector lenders grapple with leadership issues.

As on December 31, 2017, domestic mutual funds owned 22.62 percent in ICICI Bank and 9.5 percent in Axis Bank.

Fund managers who spoke to Moneycontrol on conditions of anonymity said there was no cause for panic at the moment. They, however, would wait for clarity before investing further in both stocks.

ICICI Bank shares have fallen around 7 percent over the last month, compared to a 2 percent rise in the Bank Nifty. Axis Bank shares have risen too over the last month.

""We are little skeptical on the way things are turning out in these banks,” said the chief executive officer of a fund house.

Aside from being among the most powerful Women or in deed leaders in the world of Indian business they are also counted as among the most powerful in the world. The latest piece of news occupying the business world today involves Axis Bank’s MD and CEO Shikha Sharma’s premature exit planned for the end of December 2018. All you need to know about the wise and hows of this development, what was the reason behind it? Why did the Reserve Bank of India ask the board of Axis Bank to reconsider its decision for a full-term renewal of Shikha Sharma? What are Axis Bank’s current problems? How did Axis Bank evolve under Shikha Sharma and what legacy she leaves behind? All of that and more on this story of the day podcast right here on Moneycontrol with me Rakesh.

Even as news trickles in today that some members in the ICICI bank board may not favour the continuation of MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar of ICICI Bank, we hear this latest development in Axis bank and one time colleague of Chanda Kochhar ICICI, Mz Shikha Sharma. On December 8th 2017 the board of India's third largest private lender that is Axis Bank had informed with decision tore-appoint Shikha Sharma as the MD and CEO for a period of 3 years with effect from June 1st 2018 subject to requisite approvals. But there were also reports soon after that the Reserve Bank of India had asked axis’s board to reconsider Sharma’s re-appointment at the helm for the 4th term on the grounds of the bank’s dwindling financial performance. And that story has seen resolution with MS Sharma herself requesting the board to reconsider the period of her re-appointment. “Kindly note that MZ Shikha Sharma, Managing Director and CEO of the bank is request the board to reconsider the period of a re-appointment as the MD and CEO of the bank be revised from the 1st of June 2018 up to the 31st of December 2018”, said Axis Bank in a filing to the stock exchanges. So what may be the reasons behind all of this? Let's take a look at some of the problems plaguing Axis Bank right now.

In an interview to Bloomberg in December 2017, Shikha Sharma said and I quote, “we have burnt our fingers, we have learnt lessons from concentration risk, structure of the project and risk parcelling and leverage structures. I think we will keep all that in mind in the next cycle”. Well unfortunately for Mz Sharma, that cycle ends in December this year. In her nine years at the bank, Mz Sharma has pushed for growth degrowth unfortunately has also come with the cost of deteriorating asset quality which in the end may well be the cause of her exit.

Reason 1 - Bad Loans. Axis Bank in recent times has posted a sharp rise in bad loans. Analysts they're going to say that Axis Bank’s asset quality review that is AQR in late 2015 led to a rise in bad loans for most lenders including Axis Bank. In many ways, troubles began in late 2015. In quarters that followed, Axis turned out to be among the banks worst hit by the Asset quality review. When Mz Sharma took over as the MD and CEO of Axis Bank back in 2009, Axis was well behind MS Sharma's previous employer ICICI bank. As of March 2009, the bank had advances of 81557 crore rupees. About half of this was loans to corporates and around this time the bank had managed to escape the worst in retail bad loans in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008 and then had a bad loan ratio of just about under 1% and then began the days of great corporate lending and miss Shikha Sharma took a leadership role in this corporate lending. Speculations at that time were rife that this was in a move to close the gap with HDFC bank and ICICI Bank especially ICICI bank because observers within the corporate circles obviously saw this is a competition between her and her erstwhile colleague Mz Chanda Kochhar who pipped Mz Shikha Sharma to become the head of ICICI bank as Mz Shikha Sharma was also in contention for that post. That slightly sexiest speculation aside, the result was a more than two fold increase in the bank’s loan book to 3.73 lakh crore Rupees as of March 2017. Corporate lending initially worked, the share retail loans in Axis Bank total rose to 46% by the end of December 2017 from 21% in June 2009 which was when Sharma took over. Profits also rose steadily during this period on the corporate side infrastructural ending also continued given the opportunites is provided for most banks including Axis Bank. But even during this time when Axis’s quality was considered healthy with gross bad loan ratio well below 2%, net NPA well below 1%, they were concerns because it, peers like HDFC and ICICI with similar infrastructure focus were reporting higher loan ratios and Axis’s numbers were divergent on the sectoral trend that we were seeing otherwise. Which would be our number 2 point but let’s concentrate on the bad loans aspect right now. Like I said earlier, things were fine until 2015 which was when RBI announced an asset quality review. Gross NPA ratio which was. 0.94 to 1.6% between June 2009 and March 2016 jumped to over 2% for the first time since Shikha Sharma took over. In the quarters that followed it grew to be even worse. It rose to high of 5.28% by the end of 2017. During Mz Shikha Sharma’s Tenure gross bad loans of Axis Bank grew from 915 cross back in 2009 to 25000 crore Rupees by the end of 2017.

Number 2 - Divergence. The Bank’s image was also probably hurt due to the divergence in the quantum of bad loans reported by it and what the regulator that is RBI judged bad loans to be. At the end of the fiscal year of 2017 the bank classified loans worth 21280 Rupees as bad loans. The RBI on the other hand pegged that number to be 26913. The difference, that is the divergence, was 5633 crore. For financial year 2016 the bank reported an even higher divergence of 9480 crores which was 156% more than the reported amount. So, within the past year and a half alone, the bank has been penalised by the RBI for underreporting of bad loans. In addition to all of these troubles there was WhatsApp. Where doesn't WhatsApp popup these days? UTI face the wrath of SEBI which ordered Axis Bank to strengthen it systems and conduct an internal probe to fix responsibility as the initial investigation showed the leakage of price sensitive financial information was due to inadequacy of processes at the bank in a WhatsApp leak case relating to its quarterly results of April to June 2017. So on top of bad loans and the underreporting of bad loans that was the WhatsApp leak in 2017.

Number 3 - The bottom line. In addition to the gross NPA ratio rising to as high as 5.28% compared to 0.96% in March 2009 when Sharma to charge the pressure of bad loans has also dented its net profit. At the end of December last year it was it 726 crore rupees against 562 crore rupees when she became the MD of the bank back in 2009. The profit growth has reduced from 69.5% in F5 2009 to negative 55.2% in 2017. Worse, its shareholder returns of 252% is less than the bankex index at 270%. The stock price has remained dormant over the past year and in March alone it stumbled by over 3%.

Meanwhile number 4 - The RBI had also dropped Axis Bank from a list of banks it has cleared to import bullion that is gold and silver in the current financial year that began April the 1st. It was unclear back then why Axis, one of India's leading importers of bullion did not feature in the list, but now may answer some questions.

And number 5 - People who have been observing Axis Bank knew something was afoot because Axis Bank had appointed Egon Zehnder which is a consultancy firm to identify the next CEO which conducted preliminary search before the board decided on Sharma's reappointment. But of course the announcement of the reappointment was not without speculations which had been rife that it was time that Axis Bank chose a new successor. Being as MZ Sharma was a lateral mover in that she was hired from ICICI Bank speculation is rife that the next successive would be someone from within. But of course, casting a wide net to choose an external candidate has also not been ruled out as an option. A senior management level rejig is likely in the aftermath of Sharma’s exit an appointment of a new chief. Some of the names doing the rounds as Mz Sharma’s successors include Deputy MD V Srinivasan and Executive Director Rajiv Anand.

Number 6 - The problems that Axis Bank currently faces are not merely restricted to poor management of credit risks, there been other incidents as well. In 2013 Axis Bank along with ICICI bank and HDFC bank had been penalised for ‘Know Your Customer’ norm violations after the website Cobra post.com caught bank employees advising clients on how to legitimize unaccounted money that is black money and more recently 2 bank managers from Axis were arrested during demonetisation on allegations of money laundering via accounts of Bullion traders. That incidence could well have contributed to why Axis Bank did not receive the RBI licence to import bullion for this financial year. So all these slings and arrows and frankly cannonballs, have led to the departure of Mz Shikha Sharma almost as if the 1812 Overture was playing in the background, Cannonball Run all. The next challenge is of course with the board and the bank to find a new successor. Having listed all of these troubles, the bank under Mz Sharma has for the last 2 years been trying to correct some of the mistakes. It has reduced loans given to specific groups in industries, it has focused on loans given to higher rated companies in order to cut down the bad loan ratio, the bank is going to provide data that its exposure to the top 20 borrowers as a percentage of Tier 1 capital has come down to 118% compared to 287% in March 2011 and banker has also provide the data that 85% of the bank’s incremental sanctions are now going to corporate rated A or above compared to 68% back and financial year 2012. But perhaps it was a case of ‘too little too late’. For now though, it continues to be the bronze medal holder while below HDFC and ICICI and investors continue to value it well below its peers including smaller ones like Kotak Mahindra Bank which by the way was also rumoured to be eying a merger with Axis bank as recently as last year.

But the final note on all of this is of course the fact that we will now be seeing the exit of Mz Shikha Sharma, one of the highest ranked bankers and certainly one of the top women bankers the country has ever seen. We will of course be remised if we did not end this podcast without also acknowledging the successes and achievements of Mz Shikha Sharma.

Sharing her birthday, that is November 19th with no less than Indira Gandhi, Shikha Sharma has gone to be one of the biggest names in corporate India. With a career of more than 38 years in banking, she joined ICICI in 1980 ahere she went on to lay the foundations of ICICI Bank’s personal financial services. In December 2000 she went on to head the insurance business of ICICI and took charge of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and repeated her success with retail banking. Investment on to be extremely successful crossing the 200,000 policies landmark within 2 years of its start with the premium income of 280 crore rupees. Because of all her successes within ICICI she became a contender for the top post at ICICI bank which eventually went to Mz Chanda Kochhar and Shikha Sharma left to become the head of Axis bank. But her entry into Axis Bank was just as stormy as her impending exit. She was the successor to PJ Nayak who had headed the erstwhile UTI bank which later became renamed as Axis bank and Naik was keen on promoting an insider to take over from him as CEO. The board of course had other plans and approached Shikha Sharma. Business journalists from that time and people who follow the news back then remember what are widely reported conflict that was and eventually the board won and Shikha Sharma was appointed to head the bank. She took over like I said earlier in 2009 June. Her entry into Axis was far from easy, it witnessed a flurry of senior management exists upon the appointment to whom they so as an outsider as the bank’s CEO. Sharma almost completely changed the old guard and picked her own deputies. Under Shikha Sharma Axis became a truly universal bank with an enviable investment banking team. Axis still regularly features in the top three of every League table in debt and equity fund raising. One of her first moves upon moving to Axis was to acquire Enam securities with that specific aim in mind. But of course, this deal valuation also came under criticism back then in April 2012, the deal size was cut by almost a 3rd to 1396 crore rupees from 2070 crore rupees. Eventually the deal did pay off as Axis Capital which was carved out of Enam business grew to feature in League Tables are like I said just earlier. Getting more retail business also became a Priority even as the bank continued to focus on corporate lending which may well have been the beginning of the end as well and some ways and focusing on retail business as per share of retail loans in Axis banks total book rose to 46% at the end of December 2017 from 21% in June 2009 when Sharma took over. On the liability side also Axis Bank grew on to have a name under Shikha Sharma because it's now recognised as a lender with a strong franchise of low cost current and savings account deposits. Profits grew steadily during those periods from 2009 onwards until of course 2015.

Under Shikha Sharma's leadership Axis Bank also saw a different way of thinking. Under her predecessor P J Naik decision making was largely top down at the bank had been growing in a different environment and then took on a new corporate identity. But Sharma who was more used to participative processes realized that as the organisation scaled up and became more and more complex and markets grew larger, it would need more layers of decision making which was where her personal leadership style of delegation paid off and it was during this time that she planned her first major strategic planning exercise for Axis calling it Vision 2015 with the entire top team participating and not merely her dictating her vision. The first task was to sort out the retail business. When Axis identified retail lending as one of its main focus areas in the vision 2015 plan analytics was an area the bank knew it would have to concentrate on. NPAs in the personal loans business for unacceptably high and the problem could be addressed only through analytics and retail behaviour. It was also important to identify the right customers for the bank and that was when Mz Sharma decided to hire Jairam Sridharan whom she had worked with at ICICI Bank from Capital One in the US to head the bank’s retail business. The bank then put in place a detailed risk management system and overtime they saw a reduction in retail NPAs and that was showing on the balance sheet. So slowly her Vision 2015 was gaining momentum and Sharma kept benchmarking herself against her own targets, making sure that she was neither to quick nor to slow in implementing the changes. In some ways a very sure footed leadership. Well where they were highs there were lows as well. For such a flying achiever, Sharma has been consistently described by many people who have met and interacted with her as disarmingly modest. All too willing discuss her own failures and drawbacks. A the start of her career as she went on to say at an interview was not particularly propitious during the placement period the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmadabad or IMA where she is a graduate and where she also met her husband to be she was unable to land a job until day 8 or day 9. She went on to say that foreign banks had rejected her and that she was losing confidence in herself but was able to take it in his stride. And it was then that ICICI gave her the break that defined her career path which would eventually lead her to Fortune’s most powerful women in business list as recently as 2017. In interview with Forbes India in 2014 she was asked the question - What Legacy would she want to leave behind at Axis bank? She said, “I'll say what I told investors in 2009. I took over a good business, I want to leave behind a great institution”. As the dust settles how Shikha Sharma as contributions will be evaluated, only time will tell, but it is a matter of absolutely no doubt that Mz Shikha Sharma through her storied career has influenced and inspired countless women and men alike in the becoming one of the most successful bankers the country has ever seen.

This has been everything you wanted to know about Shikha Sharma and her impending exit from Axis Bank. Until the next time I see you, this is me Rakesh saying thank you for joining us and stay with us on Moneycontrol.",3075,0.0

Beena Parmar & M Saraswathy

Axis Bank MD & CEO Shikha Sharma’s decision to step down is seen adding to the pressure on the ICICI Bank board to re-examine the tenure of its MD and CEO, Chanda Kochhar.

Sharma’s exit follows the Reserve Bank of India’s directive to the Axis Bank board that Sharma’s tenure to be extended for only a year, and not three years, as was decided in July last year.

At ICICI Bank, Kochhar is battling allegations of nepotism over loans given to Videocon Group whose promoter Venugopal Dhoot had business dealings with her husband Deepak Kochhar's firm. When reports about the Dhoot-Kochhar link first surfaced last month, the ICICI Bank hastily issued a statement backing Chanda Kochhar. But media reports over the last few days hint that the board members are divided on the issue.

The Finance Ministry is understood to be keeping close tabs on the developments at ICICI Bank, although there is no official word from the government yet.

“Investigative agencies are already probing the allegations. The government is getting updates on the matter on a daily basis,” said a banking source, who didn't want to be named.

The executive added that the government will let the Reserve Bank of India take a call on the matter and if required, will intervene directly.

The issue of Chanda Kochhar leadership is likely to be discussed at the next board meet of ICICI Bank to be held shortly.

According to JN Gupta, MD at Stakeholders Empowerment Services, ""It is for the independent directors to safeguard their reputation and come out with a call...Here, RBI should do its duty given that they know the best facts.""

On calls for an external, independent probe, Gupta said this would question the independence of ICICI Bank's independent directors.

Government on ICICI Board

The government nominee on the board of ICICI Bank is Lok Ranjan, Joint Secretary in the Department of Financial Services. LIC Chairman VK Sharma is also on the board. Agrawal was replaced by Lok Ranjan on April 5.

It has come to light that both, the previous government representative Amit Agarwal and Sharma, were missing from the March 28 board meeting held by ICICI Bank. At the meeting, the Board gave a clean chit to Chanda Kochhar, ruling out any wrongdoing in the Rs 3,250-crore loans given by the bank to Videocon Group.

LIC representative was away in the US due to his prior commitments.

A senior LIC official said, ""They (Bank) are aggressively trying to sort out the issue and that space needs to be given to them.""

Sources said that LIC has reposed its faith in the bank and the functioning of the organisation.

Contrary to reports, the country's largest insurer has denied seeking any meeting with the bank board. But it is keeping a close watch on this matter, being a large shareholder.

A Business Standard report said, the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which holds about a 9.4 percent stake in ICICI Bank, and the government’s new nominee on the private lender’s board have called a meeting of the bank’s top management this week.

""There is no such official meeting being sought by us,"" said a LIC official close to the development.

Institutional investors are understood to be raising concerns over the alleged irregularities and conflict of interest in the bank’s Rs 3,250-crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012. Dhoot set up NuPower Renewables, along with Chanda Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar.

On Monday, the private sector lender continued to face the heat as global rating agency Fitch said allegations over the loan to Videocon raise questions of corporate governance and pose reputational risks for the bank.

“Fitch will closely monitor developments, and would take appropriate rating action if risks to the bank’s reputation and financial profile were to rise considerably,” it said in a statement.

“That said, the bank’s rating is underpinned by relatively strong capitalisation and profitability,” it added.

This comes against the backdrop of declining investor confidence and concerns over losses incurred due to the decline in the bank’s stock price.

ICICI Bank has lost over 8 percent of its value since reports about the alleged conflict of interest against Chanda Kochhar came to light last month.

On Monday, the ICICI Bank stock closed at Rs 280 per share on BSE.

Meanwhile, the CBI questioned Kochhar’s brother-in-law Rajiv Kochhar for the fifth straight day. He is likely to be questioned on Tuesday as well.

The CBI is expected to widen its investigation and question more officials from NuPower Renewables, which was founded by Deepak Kochhar, husband of the ICICI Bank chief and Rajiv Kochhar's brother.

Since last week, Rajiv Kochhar, Videocon’s consultant, Mahesh Chandra Pungalia, have been quizzed by the CBI as part of the investigations.",806,-0.6815897226333618

Sharma, who is serving her fourth term, has decided to shorten her tenure by more than two years. Sharma’s decision came after the country’s apex bank the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) questioned the bank’s performance and its deteriorating asset quality. Under Sharma’s tenure, Axis Bank – the country’s third largest private lender – reported its gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rising from 0.96 per cent in March 2009 to 5.28 per cent in December 2017. Axis Bank has also been pulled up twice by the central bank for under-reporting bad loans for financial years 2016 and 2017.

Axis Bank chief Shikha Sharma’s term has been reduced to seven months from three years at her request. Sharma has been at the bank's helm since June 2009.

Sharma’s re-appointment as the Managing Director & CEO of the Bank was revised from June 1, 2018 up to December 31, 2018.

“Kindly note that Smt. Shikha Sharma, Managing Director & CEO of the Bank has requested the Board to reconsider the period of her re-appointment as the Managing Director & CEO of the Bank be revised from 1st June 2018 up to 31st December 2018,” Axis Bank said in a filing to the stock exchanges.

In July 2017, the board of the third largest private lender had informed of its decision to re-appoint Sharma as the MD & CEO, for a period of 3 years with effect from June 1, 2018, subject to requisite approvals.

The decision to reduce the term comes days after reports suggested the Reserve Bank of India had asked Axis' Board to reconsider Sharma's reappointment at the helm for the fourth term on the grounds of the bank's dwindling financial performance.

Background of Shikha Sharma’s term

Since over a year, Axis Bank has been under the investors, shareholders and regulatory ire over its dwindling financial performance and recent concerns over governance issues.

Last month, it was the Reserve Bank’s turn when it reportedly asked Axis Bank's Board to reconsider her fourth-term reappointment as the bank's CEO and Managing Director.

“The bank Board is likely to discuss this issue with the RBI and hope to meet an acceptable solution,” sources had told Moneycontrol.

Over three weeks back, Axis bank was reported to have seen two high-profile exits including Sidharth Rath, head of corporate and transaction banking, and V Srinivasan, deputy Managing Director.

In fact, there was also talk that billionaire banker Uday Kotak wanted to merge Axis Bank with Kotak Bank given its likely low valuations post rise in bad loans

RBI and Sebi stick

In the past year and a half, the bank has been penalised by RBI for under-reporting of bad loans where the banking regulator found divergences in classification of bad loans worth Rs 9,480 crore in FY16 and Rs 5,633 crore in FY17.

Starting April 1, RBI also dropped Axis Bank from bullion importers' list that can import gold and silver.

The lender also faced wrath of markets regulator Sebi which ordered Axis Bank to strengthen its systems and conduct an internal probe to fix responsibility as the initial investigation showed the leakage of price sensitive financial information was due to ""inadequacy"" of processes at the bank in a WhatsApp leak case relating to its quarterly results of April-June 2017.

Last year, Axis Bank had appointed Egon Zehnder as consultant to identify the next CEO, which conducted a preliminary search before the board decided on Sharma’s reappointment.

Speculations have been rife on Axis Bank’s Board was seeking a successor to Sharma but an early re-appointment announcement by the bank last year dashed the rumours of a leadership change in the bank.

In December last year, while Axis bank’s Board cleared Sharma’s fourth term in the bank for the next years, the reappointment was yet to be cleared by the Reserve Bank of India.

In a statement issued to stock exchanges, the bank said that the board forwards its recommendations to the regulator as required and added that the “process is currently in progress.”

Axis Bank under Shikha Sharma

Shikha Sharma took over as the chief of Axis Bank in June 2009 from banking veteran P.J. Nayak, despite some reservations from the outgoing chief who preferred that an internal candidate as his successor.

Sharma entered at a time when the world was reeling from the Lehman crisis and inherited a bank with heavy corporate book with a semi government institution.

Over the course of her nearly 9-year tenure, the bank has seen advances rise from Rs 81,557 crore at the end of the March 2009 quarter to Rs 4.20 lakh crore as of December 2017.

Even as her corporate book continued to be troublesome, Sharma’s strategy to expand the bank’s retail base worked very well. Her decision to acquire Enam’s investment banking business for Rs 2,067 crore paid got her accolades, despite some apprehensions on the valuations being too high.

Corporate NPAs and Shareholder returns

The bank is the seventh largest bank with a balance sheet size of Rs 6 lakh crore plus.

Its corporate loans, especially to the infrastructure sector players continued to impact the bank’s balance sheets and under her watch, its non-performing assets (NPA) ratio has swelled to over 300 percent to over Rs 25,000 crore as on December 2017.

The lender has seen its gross bad loans ratio rise to 5.28 percent as of December 2017 compared to 0.96 percent in March 2009, when Sharma took charge.

The pressure of bad loans has also dented its net profit at the end of December last year was at Rs 726 crore, against Rs 562 crore when she became the MD of the bank. The profit growth has reduced from 69.5 percent in FY 2009 to a negative (55.2) percent in 2017.

Worse, its shareholder returns of 252 percent is less than the Bankex index at 270 percent. The stock price has remained dormant over the past one year and in March alone, it tumbled by over 3 percent.",1013,-0.7826516736637462
